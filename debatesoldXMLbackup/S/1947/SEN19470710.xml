      <P>I have received notice from Senator Baxter that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House to-night, he proposes to ask the Minister for Justice if he is prepared to make a statement with regard to the policy of the Government on the question of the admission of aliens, members of the Polish forces in Britain or from amongst the displaced persons in camps in Europe who have a skill and technical training of a type badly required in this country and not possessed by our own nationals.  I am accepting that notice.  The matter will be taken at 9.30 p.m. or earlier if the proceedings on the Courts of Justice Bill be concluded before that hour.</P>

      <P>I feel that I would be wanting in my duty if I did not protest against this Bill.  In my opinion this Bill is absolutely indefensible and should not be hastily considered.  I know of no Bill which has been introduced over the past number of years which has received such universal condemnation from the community.  The general consensus of opinion from every Party and from every individual is that it is indefensible.  It was perfectly obvious last night that every Senator here&mdash;even those on the other side&mdash; was ill at ease.  I am satisfied that <Col N="298" /> arguments in favour of the Dáil members can scarcely be defended.  However, whatever can be said in favour of this Bill with regard to members of the Dáil, no argument can conceivably be adduced in favour of giving increases to members of this House.  I think it is generally admitted that the members of this House are treated not only decently but, I might say, generously in regard to the allowances which they get.  Has any member of this House or has the House in a collective manner ever made an approach to the Government or to the Minister with regard to unfair treatment in this connection?  Can we honestly say that the allowances that are given to us are totally inadequate for the demands that are being made on our time and our services here?  Anybody looking at the other side of this House last night could see that the members or those who may be described as Government supporters were very ill at ease during the whole of the discussion on this subject.  Would it not be an awful thing if in this democracy of ours those members are called upon to do violence to their consciences in order to serve the ends of political expediency?  It was quite clear to everybody last night that their feelings on this subject were exactly similar to those felt by us on this side of the House, namely, that the Bill is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of some remarks which I made here yesterday I tried to point out that this spiral of ever-increasing taxation is becoming too great for the general community to bear.  I ask the Minister and the Government when or where it is going to end.  Rates have gone up out of all proportion, from about £2,500,000 a few years ago to nearly £5,000,000.  The Government promised that if it was returned to power it would reduce taxation, and it was returned to power because of definite and specific promises made by them which were accepted in good faith by the people.  The Government, when making these specific promises, pointed to the colossal incubus of £23,000,000 and said that if they were returned it would be reduced to £19,000,000.  Instead of that, what do we find?  We find a huge incubus of <Col N="299" /> nearly £65,000,000 which has been imposed by continued legislation over the last 15 years instead of the £19,000,000 or the £20,000,000 which the Government promised.  The Minister and the Government will argue that because of the occurrence of a world war the whole economic barometer was thrown out of balance.  However, the point is that the taxpayers have to find £65,000,000.  Recently some one of our statisticians said that this sum represents about £21 or £23 per head of the population in this State.  I want to know when this state of affairs will end.  Can it go on indefinitely?  Here is a Bill to increase Deputies' and Senators' salaries.  No approach was made by Senators, either collectively or individually, to secure that; yet I have been nearly attacked in my own business house, since this Bill was introduced, by people who tried to point out that I must have been a party to an appeal to increase our emoluments.</P>
    <P>No measure ever received such unanimous condemnation by the whole community as this one.  I appeal to the Government, whatever they may do about the Dáil, to delete the provisions regarding the Seanad, out of consideration for the Seanad.  There is no justification in morals or in equity for the increase and no one can say we are not sufficiently remunerated for the work and the time we give and that is expected of us here.  Halt must be cried to this monumental compilation of taxation that is crushing out the whole community.  The agricultural community are suffering through the adverse weather and the disappearing dairying industry.  Is this the time to increase the emoluments of Senators?  It is not.  Instead of that, we should devote our efforts to putting agriculture on an economic basis.  I appeal to the House to delete that portion of the Bill which refers to Senators.  I would be blind and callous to the unceasing and desperate struggle of the community, if I did not make that appeal.  Every day it is a struggle for the farmers to make ends meet.  Recognising that agriculture is the basis of our whole <Col N="300" /> economy and is unquestionably the substratum of the whole prosperity of this state, we should recognise that this is neither the time nor the place to put that increasing burden on them.  We should endeavour to make life a little more compensating and more easy for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that, owing to my health, I have to leave to-morrow for a few weeks, and have been forbidden to attend meetings.  The whole of this Bill is repugnant to me. Personally, I am sorry there are any allowances for members of this House. It is a great pity that the idea of voluntary community service tends to disappear from our public life.  For a long period of years, men have been content to give their time ungrudgingly in county councils and corporations, without any suggestion of emoluments, and I would value my membership here far more if no allowances were paid. However, it has been decided that there are to be allowances and if that principle is accepted it is time some little effort were made to counteract the propaganda directed against this particular Bill.  We live in an age of democracy and the argument for allowances is that they make it possible for any individual to aspire to membership. At the same time, I feel that every interest represented here could and would be adquately represented if there were no allowances&mdash;and, perhaps, we might even have a better Seanad then, though that might sound heretical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are to be allowances, let us be honest and say straight out that, even on the new scale, they are not extravagant.  I would have more regard for the criticism levelled against this Bill if members of organised Parties, particularly in the other House, had said they were so hostile that, even if the Bill were passed, they would not accept the increased allowances, as an organised Party.  I cannot understand the attitude of any body of men who criticise individually and yet tacitly accept the implications of the Bill they feel is going to be passed.  I am jealous of the reputation of this House and do not think we help ourselves if we aid <Col N="301" /> in the propaganda so noisily bruited about that this Bill is inimical to the the general welfare of the community. So long as allowances are conceded, let us be honest and cease apologising for the fact that they are on this or that scale.  They can be thoroughly justified on the revised scale and they cannot be called salaries or represented as adequate compensation for the time the members of this House have to give.  If there were a motion to abolish them altogether, I would be in favour of it, but since they are there we must recognise the Government's wish to compensate for the depreciating value of money by bringing these allowances into line with present conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I belong to a Party that had the payment of members in its programme for many years.  I expect they took that point out of their six points in 1911, when it became an accomplished fact.  Therefore, it is not now a question of principle, but a matter of degree.  I contend that, in introducing this Bill the Government is not putting first things first.  It does lay us all open to the criticism that we are not attending to the more important things that need reform.  Many things have been mentioned in the other House.  I do not intend to follow that line but I do want to say that, as a member of the Labour Party who always advocated payment of members, I do not see anything wrong with the payment of members for service to the community but I do say that in introducing this measure and discussing it here, we are not attending to the important things that need reform even more than the allowances of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I want to complain of the method that has been adopted by the Government in this matter.  If a committee representative of all sections of the Oireachtas had met and presented a report to the executive council for Government action it would have been the proper method to have adopted.  It would have obviated much talk of a very undesirable kind and the introduction of false analogies.  I, for one, do not intend to follow the example set by speakers a few years ago who said that such-and-such a figure was enough for any man in the service of the community.  I can quite understand <Col N="302" /> Senator Summerfield's attitude. That has been the attitude of the Tory Party for generations.  They did not want payment because they wished to keep to themselves the representation of the people in Parliament and to see that ordinary people would not have an opportunity of going to Parliament to serve the community.  Of course, Senator Summerfield like many others in the past, will just follow the example of the rest of us in this matter but I do not like the attitude that he adopts in this regard.  I do not want to introduce matters which I consider irrelevant and therefore I refrain from saying more than that Senator Summerfield's attitude to-day is the attitude that was adopted many years ago&mdash;and subsequently departed from&mdash;by the well-off people of the country who thought they had the right to govern us in the way that they thought fit.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that seems to me abundantly clear and that is the need for checks and balances in representative Government.  That is clearly evidenced by this discussion here and more than clearly evidenced by the discussion in another place.  I understand that when Civil Service pay is being decided, the Civil Service Commissioners, after consultation and consideration, report to the executive council who in turn lay the report for adoption and recommendation before the Oireachtas.  The Government recommends and Parliament decides. That is what is happening to some extent to-day in this matter and, if I might be pardoned for quoting what a friend of mine said when this matter was being discussed in another place, it was, &ldquo;You chaps in Parliament do not need to pray the Scotsman's prayer, &lsquo;God gi'e us a guid conceit o' oursel's&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We seem to be in a somewhat invidious position with regard to this whole matter.  In one respect we seem to be guilty of the breach of good manners involved in looking a gift horse in the mouth.  We certainly have no direct power in the matter of this proposed increase of our allowance. That is coming to us, as it were, from an external source.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the whole matter might be discussed in terms of some general philosophy of life and philosophy of politics.  The question has been asked, should Senators be paid or not?  Senator Summerfield thinks the ideal situation would be one in which everyone gave his services to the country, free, gratis and for nothing in the Seanad, but I think that most people will agree that in a democratic country the case for payment of Senators and Deputies is absolutely unanswerable.  Otherwise you make it impossible for the genuine representatives of a large mass of the people to play a part in the Oireachtas, and representation in the Oireachtas would be confined to the Parties who represent privilege.  There was a long time in the history of the British Parliament when payment of members did not exist, and that time coincided with a time in which, on the whole, privilege was over-represented, and the masses of the people were under-represented or not represented at all.  To this day, the House of Lords serves without payment, but I do not think anyone seriously suggests that we should model ourselves on that particular method of choosing a Second House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question might be asked: by whom should Senators be paid? The House is supposed to be built on the basis of representing as far as possible organised vocational interests and, therefore, it might be argued that, if they must be paid, representatives should be paid by the particular vocation that they are here to represent. I think that would be a thoroughly objectionable principle, because it would obscure the primary obligation of all Senators, which is, that they are here to render service to the nation as a whole and only indirectly and incidentally to set forth the point of view and forward the interest of the particular vocational interest which they happen to represent.  I dare say I and my colleagues might be regarded as being here to represent a certain minority interest, but we have been treated in so friendly and sympathetic <Col N="304" /> a manner by both the present Government and its predecessor that we are in the happy position of being able to forget for the most part that we have a minority interest to represent and to remember only that we have a contribution to make to the common service of the nation.  Consequently, if Senators are to be paid at all, obviously their paymaster must be the State as a whole and it would be thoroughly objectionable for them to be paid by any particular private interest.</P>
    <P>That leads us then to the further question: on what principle should the remuneration of Senators be determined? It has been seriously suggested by Senator Duffy that in determining that remuneration account should be taken of the hours of attendance, especially in the House, but I would ask whether the Senator would also include attendance in the Lobby of the House, where frequently valuable services are rendered merely in the process of discussing things with one another in a friendly atmosphere at a turf fire, or whether attendance in the restaurant should be accounted as part of our service to the nation and even attendance in another institution not far removed from the restaurant.  I am quite prepared to argue quite seriously that a Senator is rendering valuable services to the country in his activities, not only in the House but in the precincts of the House, including that other institution.  Tensions and acrimonies generated in the House are relaxed in the more favourable atmosphere of that other institution and under the influence of the spirit which prevails there.  So that you cannot get anywhere along the lines of this suggestion that Senators should punch a clock when they come in to do their work and punch it when they leave, and be paid so much an hour for every hour they spend in the House or in the precincts of the House.  Should they be paid for talking or should they be paid for listening?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to argue that a Senator is rendering valuable service not only when he speaks, which, perhaps, is not always <Col N="305" /> the case, but even when he keeps silent, and still more when he listens attentively to what other people have to say, for, undoubtedly, it would be a physical impossibility for every Senator to master all the documents which we get daily in the post.  Our only hope, therefore, of having an intelligent opinion about the various questions that are put before us is if each person will do his best to master that particular part of the public business in which he is most skilled and will give the rest of us the benefit of his views in audible voice, and in such a way that those of us who can hear can understand. In that connection, I would like to suggest that the acoustics of this House are not as good as they might be, and, possibly, also the enunciation of certain Senators is not as clear as it might be.  I am quite well aware that I myself have been regarded as being by no means perfect in that respect.  I would seriously suggest, in order to increase the efficiency of Senators in their listening capacity, that something ought to be done in the way of introducing some of the modern gadgets that are now available to improve the acoustics of a Chamber like this&mdash;amplifiers and loud speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>And what happened last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go further and say that a Senator is rendering service to the nation not only when he is in the House or in the precincts of the House, but also when he is, perhaps, serving the State on commissions of various kinds in respect of which he receives no emoluments whatever, and even by the general public activities which he exercises both in a private capacity and in his capacity as a Senator.  For example, soon after I became a member of this House in 1938 an opportunity was presented to me of going to Montreal to attend a conference of agricultural economists.  My attendance there cost <Col N="306" /> me, personally, about £20 or £30.  I accepted the invitation because I felt it to be part of my public duty to do so.  I probably would not have got the invitation and would not have gone there if I had not been a member of this House.  I consider that the work I did by going to Montreal to attend that conference was a genuine part of my work, and of my obligations, as a Senator.  You cannot draw the line anywhere and say that the service of a Senator begins and ends at a certain point&mdash;that he should be paid so much for that and nothing for anything else.</P>
      <P>Another question then arises, and that is should Senators be paid in proportion to the financial value of the contributions which they make to the service of the State?  It might be argued by certain Senators that the ideas which they recommend and the policies which they advocate are so terrifically important not only to the Government but to the nation that if adopted they would result in adding millions of pounds to the total national income.  In such an event Senators might be able to build up a case on some sort of marginal productivity theory that they ought to get a substantial rake-off from the added national wealth which resulted from their wit and wisdom.  I mention that, not by way of a serious contribution to the debate, but merely to indicate how difficult and impossible it would be to calculate the rates of payment for Senators on these lines.  After all, how would you estimate the additional contribution to the nation's wealth resulting from the wisdom of any particular Senator?  Would any tribunal be regarded as sufficiently competent and impartial to arrive at a fair determination of that important matter; I think it is true to say you would get nowhere by adopting that particular method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, I think the remuneration of Senators must be regarded in some sense as payment for the expert services which they render to the nation in their public capacity, and must be justified, if at all, only on the grounds that unless that payment is forthcoming the services in question would not be available at all, or at any rate would not be available to an adequate extent. <Col N="307" /> Payment then is a condition, a <i>sine qua non</i>, of rendering certain services which are regarded as valuable and important to the nation, but is it possible, by any objective method, to say what the financial value of these services is?</P>
    <P>Then, of course, not all members of the House are in the full vigour of life. Some of us may have rendered valuable services to the nation in the past, but may not now any longer be able to render such services, so that in their case payment must be regarded as an honourable tribute paid by the nation in recognition of past services and quite regardless of any services which they are capable of rendering at the present moment.  I think that is a principle of payment which is honourable alike to the donors and to the recipients and ought to be so regarded. In most cases, the payment is a necessary condition to make possible the rendering of certain types of services to the nation.  It must be regarded as compensation for the individuals rendering those services and for the incidental sacrifice of leisure and of other possible sources of income which they incur, as well as to enable them to keep up a certain position of dignity. It is right that they should be put in a position to maintain that position of dignity, because they are in a true sense the representatives of the nation.  No doubt, the principal representative of the nation is the President, but every member of the Oireachtas is, in some sense also, a representative of the nation, differing from the position of the President only in degree and not in kind. Therefore, the same argument that justifies a liberal payment to the President of the nation justifies some payment to members of the Oireachtas to enable them to behave worthily as public representatives of the national life.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, payment should be regarded as equally honourable to those who give and to those who receive, and should not be a matter for spiteful criticism.  That brings us to the real difficulty&mdash;how great should be the remuneration of <Col N="308" /> Senators?  Here we must face the fact that, whatever level of payment is fixed, it must be the same for all Senators.  You cannot pay one man £500 a year, another man £300 and yet another £100.  Yet that same principle of equality of monetary remuneration under the present system certainly involves serious inequality of real reward, for the circumstances of Senators differ considerably with regard to their various other sources of income.  What might be a matter of comparative indifference to one Senator, already a well-to-do person, might be the sole means of living of another Senator who happens to be less well-to-do, so that the same monetary payment is not consistent with the same reality of real reward.</P>
    <P>If you fix the rate of remuneration of Senators on too low a level, then you rule out from the possibility of serving in this House all that element in the population who are unable, owing to private circumstances, to play a part in the life of the House because the rate of remuneration would in that case be too little for them&mdash;they would sacrifice too much and simply could not afford it&mdash;and you will rule out many persons who might be able to render valuable service in the Seanad and might be truly representative of important vocational interests.  On the other hand, if you fix the rate of payment on too high a level, you run the risk of encouraging a mercenary spirit on the part of would-be candidates for membership of this House, and, perhaps, attracting people to seek membership of this House whose real object is not public service but the acquisition of money by what looks like being an easy job.</P>
    <P>That risk is one, I think, which we run in any event even on the present rate of payment and the true remedy for it is not in the hands of the Government, but in the hands of the electorate.  It is the duty of the electorate to estimate as closely as they can the private motives and personal character of the various people who seek their suffrages, and if they think candidate A is primarily &ldquo;on the make&rdquo; and not out to render disinterested public service, then it is <Col N="309" /> their duty to refuse to vote for him and to vote for some other more worthy candidate.  That, I think, is the only remedy for that particular problem.</P>
    <P>It has been said that by fixing too high a rate of remuneration we run the risk of professionalising the business of politics both in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  I would hate to do anything which would bring that honourable word &ldquo;professional&rdquo; into disrepute, and I think it would be a fine thing for politics if it could be professionalised in the best sense of the term.  After all, there is nothing disreputable about the profession of law or medicine, and why should not the profession of politics be equally honourable and equally honoured?  Would it not be a grand thing if it could be looked upon as an honourable profession, and if its standards could be admitted to be as high in the public estimation as the other professions which are proudly called professions?</P>
    <P>Under normal conditions&mdash;and we have been emerging from a period of serious impoverishment&mdash;I would be inclined to take the risk of fixing the remuneration of Senators too high rather than too low.  But, in present circumstances, I am not unaware of the fact that it would be undesirable to give the impression outside that we are in politics for what we can get out of it; while, at the same time, I think we should try and do away with that whole point of view and not give in too much to that tendency on the part of our fellow-countrymen to develop an attitude of envy, malice and uncharitableness to us who should be regarded as their servants and as people whose well-being is also their well-being. However, I admit the weaknesses of human nature and the fact that our position is one which gives rise to a great deal of unfair and malicious criticism.  So that, while in general the argument for fixing a liberal remuneration for Senators is pretty strong, in particular I must say that the Government were rather courageous to introduce this Bill at this particular time and raise the allowances of members of the Oireachtas, as is proposed to be done.</P>
    <P>I think it is very difficult for a <Col N="310" /> Senator to say what is an adequate remuneration for any other Senator. Everyone knows his own personal circumstances, but it would be presumptuous to say what is enough for the other 59 Senators.  All I can say is that I find the present rate of remuneration quite adequate for me, personally.  I am quite willing to believe that many other Senators find the present rate of remuneration quite inadequate to them in their own personal circumstances. Therefore, I would hate to lay down the law for other Senators in that particular matter.</P>
    <P>I come back now to the point I originally made, and that is, that while we must have equality of monetary remuneration all round, it is very undesirable that the equality of remuneration should be synonymous with real inequality of reward on account of the variation in the circumstances of individual Senators.  The only remedy I see for that inequality underlying nominal equality of monetary reward is if the mechanism of the income-tax machine is applied to the remuneration of Senators.  I think there are no arguments in logic or reason against regarding payments received by members of the Oireachtas as salaries rather than as allowances and that as such they should be subject to income-tax, just like any other payments for professional service.  By that method the Revenue Commissioners could make the real difference between the circumstances of different Senators which the present system does not make.  For example, if our allowances were salaries and were subject to income-tax it is quite likely that certain Senators would lose a substantial proportion of their Senatorial payment in the form of income-tax, and, quite possibly, certain other Senators, who are not so well off from other sources of income, would be able to keep practically the whole of their allowances or salaries as Senators.  In that way the Revenue Commissioners could lessen the real inequality of real reward, which, I think, is the principal criticism of the present system.</P>
    <P>But, if that were so, and if Senatorial remuneration was subject to income-tax, <Col N="311" /> it would be necessary to redraft the income-tax law and to have a very liberal interpretation of that particular part of the income-tax law which allows exemption from income-tax for all those expenses which are wholly, exclusively and necessarily incurred in securing a certain income.  For example, the £20 or £30 that I spent in going to Montreal in 1938 would certainly not be regarded under the existing income-tax law as a legitimate expense to be excluded from income-tax. Under the law as it should be in reference to this matter, I think that kind of expense should be treated as an expense in reference to which no income-tax should be paid.</P>
    <P>There is a further and very good reason why the remuneration of both Senators and Deputies should be recalculated on a new basis and made subject to income-tax, especially from the point of view of members of the Dáil, and that is because they have a lot to do with imposing income-tax on their fellow citizens.  It is a real grievance that, when they do that, they themselves are not always as income-tax conscious as they would be if they had to pay income-tax themselves in respect of their own salaries.  It is most desirable that members of the Dáil especially should be aware of what exactly happens when income-tax is raised by 1/- in the £ or lowered by 1/- in the £ and have it brought home to themselves in their own personal experience.</P>
    <P>If this proposed payment of £468 per year to members of the Seanad were made subject to income-tax, it would probably mean a real gain to certain Senators whose income from other sources is not very great, and it would certainly mean that certain other Senators would gain little or nothing, in fact, even might lose as compared with the present situation under which we get £360 a year free of tax.  The result of it all would be that, with the same nominal payment all round, there would be less inequality of reward for the service rendered in this House.</P>

      <P>Senator Johnston, in an interesting speech, dealt with the philosophy behind the payment of <Col N="312" /> members of the Oireachtas, and seemed, at the end, to satisfy himself that the right thing to do was to make the allowances of Senators and Deputies subject to income-tax. Senator Hayes accused me of a lazy approach in fixing a percentage increase in the allowances of Deputies and Senators.  Other Senators suggested that, before any percentage increase was suggested, the question should have been examined by some outside body.  I want to recall to Senators, however, that in 1938 there was a certain level of allowance fixed for members of the Dáil and a certain level of allowance fixed for Senators. That allowance was proposed by the Government, and Senator Douglas, speaking here, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am of the opinion that the amount which should be paid to Deputies or Senators, subject, of course, to criticism and advice in the House, must be the responsibility of the Executive of the day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government in 1938 took full responsibility for the allowances proposed, and the Seanad, with one dissentient, approved the 1938 level of allowances.  In the general elections held since we must assume that the people approved of the level of allowances given to members of the Dáil and Seanad in relation to 1938 conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question for us to debate is whether the 1938 conditions have altered in any way, and whether, if it was fair and equitable to give an allowance of £360 a year to a Senator in 1938, it is fair and equitable to continue the payment of £360 in present circumstances. The only reason that I know for which Senators or Deputies are paid an allowance is to enable the average man, who can convince the people that he should be elected to represent them, to fulfil his functions as a Deputy or Senator.  If I were to suggest that the value of money had not dropped since 1938 by 30 per cent., there is not a Senator here who would not disagree with me.  Is there any Senator&mdash;I put it to the House and I am prepared to listen to a reply&mdash;who will say that the Senatorial allowance of £360 is worth as much in this year, <Col N="313" /> 1947, as it was worth in 1938?  Is there any Senator who will say it has not decreased by at least 30 per cent.? There is not.</P>
    <P>There are some Senators here who on other occasions in relation to other Bills would claim that the 1947 £ was worth £2 in 1938.  If that is their calculation, then the proposed increase of £30 per £100 of allowance does not represent an increase in terms of 1938, but an actual reduction&mdash;a reduction to £65 in 1938 values.  Senator Concannon wants Senators to make a sacrifice.  If any Senator holds that the present £ is worth only 10/- in terms of 1938 values, Senator Concannon's allowance under this Bill has been cut to £65.  If the calculation is that the value of money has been decreased by 50 per cent., then Senators will get by this Bill £85, in terms of 1938 values, instead of £100.</P>
    <P>The Government, for the past nine or ten months, have often been occupied with this question of the value of money, the trend of prices and what was best to do to meet present difficulties without doing anything which might render more difficult the future economy of the country.  Senator Concannon yesterday said that one thing she did not like about this increase, as she called it&mdash; it is not an increase, as I have shown &mdash;was that it looked as if the Government were in despair about a future fall in prices.  Up to last year, the Standstill Order was in operation and the Government did their utmost to keep wages from rising, in order to prevent a spiral of increasing prices, increasing wages, followed again by increasing prices.  Last year, the Government abolished the Standstill Order, with the result that there was a movement upward in wages, particularly in those industries and pursuits in which wages had been frozen up to the date of the abolition of the Standstill Order.</P>
    <P>Since last September there have been fair increases, not only in wages and salaries outside Government circles, but within the State service. The Government granted increases which represent a big percentage over 1939 wages and salaries.  In the case <Col N="314" /> of lower civil servants those increases in some instances represent more than 50 per cent. The minimum increase granted to any civil servant over his 1939 salary, no matter how much he was then drawing, was 25 per cent.  I pointed out, in my opening statement here, that if a civil servant&mdash;I will make all the qualifications afterwards, about income-tax and so on&mdash;in 1939 was receiving in salary £360 a year, which would correspond to the allowance of a Senator, he would have got, with the increases that were given during the war, at least 41 per cent. over his salary in 1938.  I gave that so that Senators would have a standard to go by and would have some indication of what happened in relation to wages and salary levels.</P>
    <P>I do not propose 41 per cent., and the Government do not propose 41 per cent of an increase in Senators' allowances; we proposed 30 per cent. Some people would claim, in other debates, that if we wanted fully to compensate Senators for the increase in prices since 1939 the percentage increase should not be 30 per cent., but 100 per cent.  Others would say that it should be at least 50 per cent.  In order not to disturb the general settlement that has been made in wages and salaries throughout the country, the Government propose that Senators should be content with 30 per cent. over the 1939 level.  In doing that, I believe the Government are asking Senators and members of the Dáil who thought the 1938 allowance was fair to make a contribution so that it could not be said that the Dáil and Seanad were fixing a higher percentage increase for their allowances than was granted to people with corresponding sums outside.</P>
    <P>We know that throughout the country people on the very lowest income levels have got much more than 50 per cent.; some have 60 and others have 70 per cent.  I think the people will understand that the Government, in carrying out its functions and making suggestions as to what level of allowances should be made to Senators and Deputies, are acting in a fair and <Col N="315" /> reasonable manner and that this additional 30 per cent. should be given.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon spoke about this addition being rather an indication of despair on the part of the Government of prices falling.  I do not know whether it is despair or optimism.  It seems to me to be merely facing the facts in the present situation.  Prices have risen.  Some people say that prices will fall and others suggest that they will rise still higher.  Wholesale prices have risen in Ireland from 104 points in 1939 to 207.  If we were the only country in the world in which prices had risen, we might hope by our own efforts to reduce those prices. But, what is the situation generally? Our wholesale price level depends, not alone upon the action of this Government, but upon the action of the multiplicity of Governments governing the many countries from which we draw raw materials or finished goods.</P>
    <P>Let us have a look at how prices have risen since 1939 in a few of the countries from which we draw goods, and let us see whether it is an action of despair on the part of the Government or merely facing the facts to grant some compensation generally throughout the country for the decrease in the value of money, rather than force people to wait still longer for an automatic fall in prices to 1939 levels in other countries.  In the United States, since 1939, the wholesale price index rose from 101 to 196, almost as high as in this country.  Indeed, since 1945 the biggest increase took place.  It rose from 138 points in 1945 to 196 in March of this year.  In Great Britain the wholesale price index rose from 106 in 1939 to 189 in March of this year.  In France it rose from 101 in 1939 to 821 in March of this year.  In the Netherlands it rose from 105 in 1939 to 269 in January, 1947.  In Sweden it rose from 105 to 178 in February, 1947&mdash;that is one of the lowest increases of the lot.  In Switzerland it rose from 105 to 207 in February of this year.  In Denmark it rose from 107 in 1939 to 205 in February of this year.  In Spain it rose from 104 in 1939 to 216 in 1945, the latest date for which I have a <Col N="316" /> figure.  In Portugal it rose from 103 in 1939 to 255 in February, 1947.  In Argentina it rose from 105 to 235 in January of this year, and then, in our own country, it rose from 104 to 207. Looking through all the years at how the price index has risen fairly steadily, no one could say with any conviction that prices are likely to drop suddenly to the 1938 or 1939 levels.  If the Dáil and the Seanad thought the allowances fixed in 1939 were reasonable, if the people at the various elections since thought they were reasonable and if they want the work for which these allowances were granted to continue, then I think it must be admitted that some addition to the 1938 level of allowances should now be granted.</P>
    <P>Two suggestions were made as to how Senators should be paid.  One by Senator Hayes and by Senator Duffy was that they should be paid on results.  Senator Hayes said that a Senator who does no work for the Seanad should get no pay from the State.  Senator Duffy spoke in much the same strain and he said that somebody should have the right to tell the person who does not attend that we shall not pay him an allowance.  If there was something in this Bill which proposed that some authority should be nominated to vet the value of a Senator's work for the State and pay him according to that value, there are no two people who would make the welkin ring more loudly than Senator Duffy and Senator Hayes.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy and Senator Hayes said in effect that they should be paid on results&mdash;&ldquo;no work, no allowances&rdquo;.  I am not saying that there is anything very wrong in making that suggestion.  I am only saying that if anybody else suggested it these very Senators would make the welkin ring in protest.  Supposing the Seanad put in an amendment to this Bill that in future no allowance should be granted to Senators unless they attended and signed a book, some authority would have to be assigned to ascertain whether they did so.  Usually the person who watches the public purse is the Minister for Finance.  I then would have to appoint somebody to attend at the door here and as each Senator came in make him sign a book. Again, as he went out he would sign the book.  Or is he just to come in, sign the book, go out, go off home and be paid for the day?  If the system were adopted that he would have to stay here all day, would he have to put up his hand and ask the Clerk of the Seanad to get leave to go out, even for a cup of tea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another variation of it&mdash; Senator Johnston's variation of payment by results, because an allowance for expenses really comes to the same thing.  Senator Johnston did not suggest by inference that the Minister for Finance should put a man on the door to keep an eye on Senators but he suggested that the Revenue Commissioners, by way of an income-tax allowance, should decide what a Senator should draw.  I think that if Senator Johnston thought that out, he would object very strenuously to the Revenue Commissioners being set up as the authority to see what portion of a Senator's allowance was wholly, necessarily and inevitably spent, in his work as Senator.  Many other suggestions could be put forward as to how there might be payment on results of Senatorial work but meantime we have to do the work.  I do not believe that any ideal system could be evolved at any <Col N="318" /> time.  We have to take the rough with the smooth.  Over a number of years, it has been found in a number of democratic countries like our own, that if a Lower House and a Second Chamber are wanted to keep an eye on the Government, to criticise legislation, to criticise the inaction or actions of the Government because of their effects on the country, Deputies and Senators have to receive an allowance which will enable the average man in the country to be elected either to the First or Second House, to carry out his functions as a member of one or other of these Houses.</P>
    <P>We might argue until Tibbs' Eve-about some ideal system but the only system I see for fixing allowances is to fix a sum which has general approval and to trust to the people to elect men to represent them who will carry out their duties faithfully as representatives of the people.  We all have the feeling that we wish human nature were otherwise, and that we could rely upon the people electing their representatives and helping to support them in a voluntary fashion, without any direct payment by the State.  It has been pointed out here that, in the period 1919-21, individuals went forward and were elected as representatives of the people and received no allowances or payment of any kind.  That is true but these were certainly not normal times. They were very abnormal times and in abnormal times even the normal person will be moved by a spirit of patriotism to do things which he would not dream of doing in the ordinary way.  In normal times it is only the exceptional person upon whom the people can rely to come forward and fulfil a public duty at very great expense to himself.  We are legislating now, or we did legislate in 1938, for the normal person and normal times, not for the exceptional person living in exceptional times.  There has been over a number of years general approval for the level of allowances fixed in 1938 and what we are proposing here to-day is to decrease the actual income value of the 1938 figure, not to increase it.</P>
    <P>A number of minor points have been raised but I do not propose to go into them.  I think I have said enough to <Col N="319" /> convince Senators that, at least in making the proposals contained in this Bill, the Government was not unduly liberal, that it set no bad headline for people of the country to look for any further increase in wages or profits at this particular time because the level proposed, in actual terms of cash, represents a bigger decrease in income for Senators than for any other section of the community whom I know.  I believe with Senator Douglas, who referred to the matter in 1938, that the job of making proposals for allowances for Senators and Deputies is a job for the Government.  We did not consult either the Dáil or the Seanad on this matter.  Having, over a number of months, fixed the level of allowances for civil servants, judges and all sorts of public officials, we came to the conclusion that we should be neglecting our duty if we did not make the proposals contained in this measure.  I know that those proposals are open to criticism but the Government has to face criticism in connection with every action it takes, or refuses to take, and we are fairly well hardened to criticism by now.  I believe that the ordinary person in the country will understand the reason for what we are doing.  I believe that he will understand that, if he wants to get his work done and if he wants to hold his representatives accountable to him for the doing of it, he will be in a better position to do that if they are getting an allowance which will enable them to carry out their functions in an efficient manner. That is all this Bill proposes to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The present salaries of members of the Government, Parliamentary Secretaries, the Attorney-General and the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Houses of the Oireachtas are fixed by the Ministerial and Parliamentary <Col N="320" /> Offices Act, 1938, Part II.  The allowances for expenses paid to the Leaders of the second Party and the third Party in Dáil Eireann are fixed under Part III of the same Act.  The Government, having considered the amounts so fixed in the light of change in the value of money since 1938 and and of the additions granted, or proposed to be granted, to all classes of public servants, came to the conclusion that they were no longer adequate. Accordingly, it has been decided to submit the present Bill, containing proposals for increases as follows&mdash;the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General have, under the 1938 Act, £2,500.  That is to be increased by 20 per cent. to £3,000 per annum.  Members of the Government and the Ceann Comhairle have £1,700.  It is proposed to increase that amount by 25 per cent. to £2,125. Parliamentary Secretaries and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad have £1,200.  That is to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,560.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has a salary of £1,000, which is to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,300.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad has £750, which is to be increased by 30 per cent. to £975.  The Leader of the second Party in the Dáil has an allowance of £800, which is to be increased by 30 per cent. to £1,040. The Leader of the third Party in the Dáil has an allowance of £500, which it is proposed to increase by 30 per cent. to £650.  The annual cost of these increases will be £8,030 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the increases provided in respect of judges and justices under the Courts of Justice Bill, 1947, which is now in their hands.  The Chief Justice has, at present a salary of £4,000, which it is proposed to increase by 15 per cent. to £4,600.  The President of the High Court and the judges of the Supreme Court have a salary of £3,000, which is to be increased by 15 per cent. to £3,450.  Ordinary judges of the High Court have a salary of £2,500, which is to be increased by 20 per cent. to £3,000.  Circuit Court judges have a salary of £1,700.  It is proposed to increase that by 25 per cent, to £2,125, same as the salary of Ministers.  The salaries of District Justices range from <Col N="321" /> £1,000 to £1,200.  These salaries are to be increased, under the terms of the Courts of Justice Bill, by 30 per cent., and will range from £1,300 to £1,560. There is now a Bill in circulation which gives an indication of how the increases are running.  Under the new Comptroller and Auditor-General Bill, which I hope we will come to later on, it is proposed to increase that officer's salary by 25 per cent.&mdash;from £1,500 to £1,875 per year.  As I said in relation to the other Bills, I think that the increases proposed for these various officers are fair and reasonable having regard to the changing value of money since the salaries were fixed in 1938.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very easy for anybody standing up in this House to-day who had attained the use of reason and who listened to speeches in the years from 1927 to 1932 to take the line that was followed by the Minister and his colleagues in their campaigns throughout the country in those years.  We can all, from time to time, make allowances and excuses for certain extravagant and reckless statements that may be made on platforms and in speeches on the grounds that, perhaps, they are caused by the somewhat heady wine of eloquence and mob hysteria.  No such excuse can be made, however, for the deliberate poster campaign sent out by the Minister and his colleagues from the national headquarters in Dublin throughout the whole country so that there were on every hoarding, in every city, in every town, in every market place, at every fair and at every crossroads, posters which compared in a false and in a most distorted way the salaries of the Ministers of that day, of the civil servants of that day, and certain other wages paid to other members of the community.  The only way to describe that campaign is to say that it was despicable, dishonest, disgraceful and, perhaps, better forgotten. Certainly, so far as I am concerned, I am not going to follow on those lines now in this House.  I have far too much respect for the dignity of this House.  I have far too much respect for the people.  I realise the damage that could be done to public <Col N="322" /> life&mdash;damage such as was done at that time and which had such an effect that it will take many, many years before the people realise how public life should be run.  If I were to approach this Bill on the grounds of what I think individual Ministers are worth, quite obviously my estimate would be somewhat small.  I do not propose to approach the matter, however in any personal way like that.  I propose to approach it from the point of view of consideration of the offices that are incorporated therein and the offices that are referred to and to accept it as dealing with those offices rather than with individual Ministers of any particular Government of the day, no matter what Party or colour such Government may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all of us agree that it is right and proper that there should be accorded to the Ministers of the State a sufficient salary&mdash;and here, as I shall deal with later, it is entirely a salary &mdash;to ensure that those Ministers are completely free from financial worry, that they are completely free from financial temptation and that they are able to accord to their positions the dignity and the duties that should be accorded to them.  That is essential and I think we are all agreed about it.  I think it is also absolutely essential that the public should know, understand, realise and appreciate exactly what the members of the Government are being paid out of the public purse.  I am afraid I consider that dealing with the references as they are dealt with in this Bill as being the sole salaries, the sole emoluments of Ministers is as dishonest as was the poster campaign prior to 1932. That is not a fact.  It is a fact that certain regulations were laid down in 1937, and in the Act in 1938 following the committee of 1937, and that the Minister is dealing with a portion of those.  I am not at all impressed by the argument the Minister made on an earlier Bill, that because something was done in 1938 by a Dáil and a Seanad of that day it is sacrosanct and it cannot possibly be changed and it should not and ought not be changed. If we take that view then we would certainly have very little work to do as <Col N="323" /> legislators because no law would ever be amended.  When we get a Bill before us we must consider not merely what is in the Bill, as such, but what was done in previous times, in the whole ambit of that Bill and consider whether the Bill should be treated from the point of view of the things that are in it and from the point of view of the things that are not in it. So far as this Bill is concerned, I take the view, very strongly, that there is no justification whatever for paying any Minister any part of his salary free of income-tax.  There is an argument one way or the other&mdash;I am not going to repeat what we have had on the previous Bill&mdash;in respect of Deputies and Senators.  Let us consider what exactly is at issue in respect of a Minister.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the ordinary Minister is going to be paid £2,125.  Of that £2,125, £1,501 is going to be paid as salary and £624 is going to be treated as an allowance.  The reason for treating that £624 which a Deputy gets as an allowance is because a Deputy has certain very definite expenditure which he must meet and which the allowance is supposed to cover.  It is necessary for a Deputy to deal in some manner with certain clerical expenses.  That is one of the items the allowance is supposed to cover.  Of course that does not operate at all so far as a Minister is concerned. A Minister is provided by the State with a Private Secretary and the clerical assistance necessary for that Private Secretary is provided by the State.  Of course, it is obvious that the Private Secretary must and does deal not merely with State matters, but with what may broadly be termed political matters as well.  A Minister, therefore, is not under that expense. A Minister is not under the same expense as a Deputy in regard to telephones. Very frequently a Deputy will have to telephone to his constituents from Leinster House, or to telephone to Dublin from his constituency. Again, of course, the State does and must pay for the telephone expenses of a Minister.  A Deputy has to engage, particularly under the <Col N="324" /> system which we may be discussing further next week, under which he becomes more an administrator than a legislator, in very considerable correspondence. The postage is very often a considerable item.  A Minister, on the other hand, has no such expenses whatever, because, of course, all the political letters that are written by the Minister go out from his Private Secretary's office and go out, therefore, franked and free from postage in the ordinary way.  A Deputy has, during the sittings of the House, to come to Dublin and to stay in a hotel&mdash;that is, if he is from the country.  Obviously a Minister must live where his job is and he has not therefore that incidental expense. That is something we must all admit in regard to all our lives&mdash;that we have got to live somewhere which is convenient and handy to our work.  A Minister has to do the same and, therefore, he is saved that incidental expense. A Minister is not like a Deputy, either, in that a Deputy leaves his own job for certain days of the week, and, perhaps, has to get someone else to do something for him while he is away.  The Minister is at his job wholetime.  Finally, a Minister is in a very different position in regard to transport which I shall deal with at some length in a moment.  These are all the expenses that a Deputy is asked to bear and that a Deputy's allowance is expected to cover.  They are not expenses which a Minister has and, therefore, there is no case whatever for saying that any portion of a Minister's salary should be free of income-tax or surtax.  I am not arguing on a question of amount, but on a question of principle.  Since the Government has to take the primary responsibility for taxation, they should be liable on principle to the same taxation as everyone else.  Regardless of whether it is desirable for Deputies and Senators, it is essential, in my view, that the members of the Government should be liable to every tax to which the ordinary individual man or woman in the State is liable in the same circumstances.</P>
    <P>The salary of a Minister is going to be £1,501, with an allowance of £624. <Col N="325" /> The fact of that allowance being tax free makes it equivalent to £947 on top of the £1,501.  On a salary of £947 plus £1,501, the income-tax would be £308 and the surtax about £32.  The Shanley Committee, which sat in 1937, strongly recommended&mdash;it is the only part of their recommendations that was underlined in the report&mdash;that no part whatsoever of a Minister's salary should be free of income-tax, that the allowance he gets as a Deputy should be deducted and his salary adjusted accordingly.</P>
    <P>Apart from the tax-free salary, there is the question of transport.  That was considered at some length in the 1937 report, but the position appears to have varied considerably since then.  As far as I can ascertain, there were 19 motor cars available then for Ministers and, presumably, Parliamentary Secretaries. The latest authentic information available to me is given in reply to a question in the Dáil on the 12th December, 1945, reported in the Official Debates, Volume 98, column 1683.  According to that answer, the number of cars available in 1945 for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries had jumped from 19 to 38, the average annual mileage per car run over the four years was about 10,000 and the average quantity of petrol used was about 670 gallons, while the average cost of servicing was about £113.  The price of the cars in use must have varied considerably.  We know that new cars have been bought&mdash;and very properly bought.  I have tried to make a calculation on the last official information available to me as to the value of this perquisite of free transport.  I appreciate that part of the transport is a necessary protection, but I am afraid that what has happened since 1937, and which is quite clear from the figures in the Shanley Report and in 1945, is that the purpose has been extended from one of free transport for a Minister, as part of a necessary protection and as part of his duties, to transport for the wives and families of Ministers and for other persons they may designate.  As a matter of principle, that is undesirable and it should not be dealt with in that way.  We should ensure that Ministers <Col N="326" /> are paid adequate salaries, taxed in the same way as those of any other citizen, sufficient to enable them to pay out of their own pockets for such transport as they may deem desirable and necessary for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>So far as I can find out, on the last figures available, it would probably be a fair guess to say that the car depreciation cost for a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary who has the use of those cars is about £500 a year.  One of the most extraordinary things is that it is quite clear from the figures that the amount the Taoiseach gets out of transport is very much less than the amount his Ministers get.  The Taoiseach is provided with an allowance of £350 to cover his cost of transport plus his drivers and I understand he has to pay for his petrol, oil and servicing, and buy his new cars, and so forth.  There were 38 cars and the number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries was 15, excluding the Taoiseach.  Probably £500 a year is a fair depreciation cost.  There are two drivers appointed for each Minister and as they are Guards, with a plainclothes allowance and other allowances for this form of work, it would work out that their salaries at present are about £6 a week, which gives a figure of £600.  We must remember that petrol rationing was much more stringent in 1945 than it is now and it is to be hoped that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries at that time were exercising considerable restraint in the use of their cars and petrol&mdash;though it is common knowledge that one who is no longer in that position was most flaithúlach in the way he used his car on all possible occasions.  On the 1945 figures, it would seem that about £250 a year is spent per Minister on petrol and oil.  The cost of servicing, as set out, gives us an average of £113 for each of the 38 cars, which would work out at about £250 for each person entitled to use a car.  The cost of workshop staff was about £20 a week, according to the answer, and that seems to work out at about £100 per person entitled to use a car.  The whole of that makes a total of £1,700.</P>
    <P>I admit at once for the Minister that <Col N="327" /> there is a large part of that proper protection cost.  I shall not be so foolish, so childish or so mean as to suggest that that is not included but, over and above that protection cost, there is a very fair proportion of that sum that can quite fairly be described as a perquisite, particularly when it is a question of using the official car for persons other than the Minister himself and the Minister alone.  I think that that, as a matter of fact, is undesirable and is a bad practice.  It is a practice that apparently was not adverted to in the Shanley Report nor, so far as I can find from a member of the commission, was it known to the commission at that time.  It is a practice that must have crept in since that date.</P>
    <P>Supposing one takes, say, about half the cost of transport involved as being protection cost and about half the cost as being perquisites, that would mean a figure of approximately £800.  In the case of the ordinary citizen, he would have to pay that £800 out of his own pocket after his pocket had suffered from the Revenue Commissioners having a little dig at it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and then, coming along and having a second dig at it, with surtax.  It works out, therefore, that taking, of course, the salary of £1,501, Deputy's allowance charged as a salary, as it should be charged in the case of a Minister, and the first £300 of transport allowance that is paid&mdash; which is equivalent at the proper income and surtax rates to a payment of £550&mdash;it works out that, if we are only suggesting that £300 of a Minister's perquisites for transport is a personal perquisite, he would have a salary of £3,000 a year.  If, on the other hand, we decide, as I suggested a moment ago, that half the transport cost was perquisite and the other half was proper protection cost, it would work out that it would be equivalent to charging at a salary of £4,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to suggest whether salary A, B, C or D is excessive.  I am stating very strongly that it would be far better for the public morale that <Col N="328" /> the salary would be fixed and would be fixed in such a way and at such a figure. It would be much better for the State if it were fixed, say, at £3,000 and made an honest £3,000 salary rather than that it should be done in this particular way, which means that there is make-believe and sham arising out of the whole figure.</P>
    <P>One of the unfortunate things that is abroad at present is a sort of taint in the minds of the people on public life. It is an unfortunate taint that started, in my belief, from the campaign to which I referred earlier.  But, it is more than ever essential, when that exists, that the public would feel, understand and know that whatever was being paid to their servants was being paid in a clear way that was easily estimated, easily ascertainable and easily known.  In fixing that figure, I want to see a figure fixed that gives the people who are in charge of our country freedom from financial worry, freedom from financial temptation, ability to carry on the job in a proper way, to carry it on with proper dignity, but I want it done overboard and not in the way of sham and make-belief in which I think it is done in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting that the Senator said what he has just said. On the question of transport, this report, which was not a secret&mdash;the report of the majority of the Shanley Committee of 1937&mdash;in paragraph 58, after referring to the transport that had been available to Ministers from 1924 to 1927, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At a later date the arrangements now in force&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is in 1937&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;were introduced, viz., the provision of motor cars for the use of Ministers and others together with escort cars in some instances.  A Minister may use the official car for any purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A Minister may use the official car for any purpose&rdquo;&mdash;Is that what Senator Sweetman said?  He said that a Minister could only use a car for official purposes, but the Shanley Committee, which had gone into the matter, pointed out that from 1927 onwards the situation was that a Minister could use an official car for any purpose.  The committee examined and gave consideration as to whether the system of providing official cars with official armed drivers for Ministers, and in some cases escort cars with armed escorts, should be changed and whether a Minister should be given an allowance to buy his own car, service it and do all that for himself.  After full consideration, the Shanley Committee came down on the side of continuing <Col N="331" /> the system that was in operation under the Fine Gael Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What was in operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Shanley Committee said, that a Minister may use his car for any purpose and that what was in operation from 1927 onwards should continue: that Ministers should be provided with official cars and with official drivers supplied out of the official pool.  Now, as far as Ministers personally are concerned, I think that the vast majority of them, including myself, would prefer to get an allowance of a few hundred pounds per year as is done in the case of the Taoiseach. They would prefer to provide their own cars, their own petrol and to have nothing to do with official drivers, escorts or anything like that.  As far as I am concerned, they are a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister should add that they are a courteous nuisance.  They are a nuisance in one sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They are a nuisance.  I have a good driver&mdash;but we will not go into details.  I would much prefer &mdash;it is a purely personal point of view &mdash;to have my own car to go anywhere I liked myself and to leave everybody else behind me.  But that is not the situation.  At times not only had we drivers always with us, but we had a troop of armed escort behind us that one could not leave any time, any hour of the day or night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Sweetman thinks that is a perquisite which we envy and want to keep on, well he is welcome to his ideas of it.  There is undoubtedly convenience from the point of view of the State.  If a Minister, or any other person, has to look after his own car it may at times prove troublesome.  It will take his mind off any other work that he may be doing.  He has to think of when tyres are wanted, when petrol is wanted and when repairs of various kinds have to be done.  A Minister has not that responsibility and has not that worry when he has an official car. The car is at his service simply by making a telephone call.  From the point of view of doing the business of <Col N="332" /> the State, I must admit that the people can get more out of the Minister by supplying him with an official car than they could get otherwise.  The Minister can give to State affairs the time that he would have to spend worrying about a car if it were his own, as to what should be done or should not be done to it.  From that point of view, even though it is a much more costly type of transport, I think that the present system is in the long run best for the community.  As I say, I would have no personal objection to an allowance to provide my own car.</P>
    <P>With regard to these salary increases, I started out by making recommendations to the Government.  We took the 1939 salaries and allowances of various kinds as having a reasonable relation as between person and person and officer and officer.  We said that we would give additions and keep, fairly strictly at any rate, to the percentage increases granted in relation to different classes of salaries and allowances. We did not go quite as far in regard to Senators and Deputies as we did in the case of corresponding Civil Service salaries.  Anyway, they are strictly comparable.  What we took in regard to Ministers was this: we took the salaries and allowances and the perquisites that went with Ministerial office in 1938, and in the case of Ministers we gave an increase of 25 per cent.  In the case of the Taoiseach 20 per cent., and in the case of certain other officers on lower salaries 30 per cent.  I think that was a reasonable method of approach.</P>
    <P>In 1938 the Seanad unanimously approved of the 1938 level of salaries for themselves and various officials.  In view of that, I believe that the Seanad can make no reasonable objection at this stage to the granting of increases so as to compensate in some measure for the decrease in the value of money since then.  The Second Stage of the 1938 Bill was passed in the Seanad without a division.  On the Committee Stage a proposal was moved by Opposition Senators to increase the Taoiseach's salary, but was defeated, yet the Committee Stage was passed. Finally, the motion that the Bill be passed and returned to the Dáil was agreed to without a division.  I maintain <Col N="333" /> that if the Seanad and the Dáil thought that the Ministerial salaries and all Parliamentary officers' salaries in 1938 were fair and reasonable, and if at the various elections held since the people thought they were reasonable, Senators must admit now that in giving a 20 per cent. increase to the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General, 25 per cent. to Ministers, 30 per cent. to Parliamentary Secretaries and some other officers the Government and the Dáil and the Seanad are not being over-generous and that they are trying to hold the balance equally as between these officers of State and other officers of State who have been granted increases in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 29th January, 1947, the Government imposed an Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Order, No. 227, placing a customs duty of 37½ per cent., or 25 per cent. preferential, <i>ad valorem,</i> on combs suitable for personal use or adornment.  An industry was established here during the war.  Previous to the war, combs were not being made in this country, but when imports were curtailed during the emergency a number of firms, particularly the button manufacturers, began to make combs from home-produced casein.  This was an out-of-date process, and later the manufacturers began to produce combs from plastic powders by an injection moulding process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the year 1946 there was a considerable increase in the importation of combs.  In that year the value of the imports of combs was some £64,000, as compared with an estimated import value of £10,000 or £12,000 pre-war.  It was represented that the home manufacturers were unable to secure orders and had to lay off a number of employees.  It was alleged that seconds, or slightly defective products, which, apparently, are the result of defects in the moulding process, were being imported here in very large quantities and that this was the reason the imports had increased so considerably in 1946; that, if these imports were to be permitted to continue, the industry, which had been established during the war and which seemed to be developing so satisfactorily, would be in <Col N="335" /> serious danger.  Therefore, the Government decided to impose the tariff to which I have referred&mdash;37½ per cent. full, and 25 per cent. preferential, rate. An undertaking was obtained from the home manufacturers that prices for home-produced combs would not be increased except in the event of a rise in the cost of raw materials or labour.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is the reason for the laughter on the part of some Senators, but I presume, at any rate, if one has to regard the laughter as a form of interrogation that the reply to it would be that, if an undertaking is given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that certain standards will have to be achieved by the manufacturers of combs or any other product which is protected in this fashion, it will be the duty of the Minister to see that the undertaking is loyally observed. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that the raw materials for this industry are readily procurable.  Stocks of combs have, in fact, been built up by the manufacturers here, and he is quite satisfied that the manufacturing capacity will be sufficient not alone to meet the requirements of the home market, but also to establish an export trade. In fact, efforts have been made to establish such a trade, but there has been difficulty in securing import licences from other countries.  Were it not for these difficulties, the Minister is satisfied than an export trade could be begun.  The combs to be produced here will not exceed in prices the prices of comparative articles which are being sold in Great Britain and the manufacturers will be required to maintain equal standards of efficiency.  I do not know that there is any other point, but if any Senator wishes to ask any question regarding the matter I will be glad to answer if I have the information available.</P>

As I have said, a second firm has started in Nenagh, County Tipperary, but I do not know whether they have succeeded in getting into full production.  They have only recently gone into the business.

      <P>I agree, but I am hoping that we will be able to get to closer quarters with this whole problem. The Minister says that there is some assurance that prices will not be <Col N="337" /> higher than the corresponding&mdash;I think he said &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo;, whatever that may mean&mdash;prices in Great Britain.  We had that assurance from the manufacturers in the case of wireless sets.  The ink on it is hardly dry and prices have gone higher than they are in Great Britain.  I do not place any value whatever on these assurances. I repeat that, in principle, legislation of this kind should be viewed with the deepest suspicion and the public should have some safeguards in the form of an examination by some inquiry, tariff commission or some body of that kind, before these duties are put on, which we know from experience operated against the public interest.</P>

    <Title>Great Southern Railways Company (Superannuation Scheme) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="340" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable a superannuation scheme to be set up in this country for certain employees of the former Great Southern Railways Company who up to the present have been covered by a British scheme entitled the Railway Clearing System Superannuation Fund.  This scheme was set up by statute in 1873 and most of the railway companies in these islands were members of it.  The affairs of the corporation were reorganised in 1914 and again in 1941. The reorganisation involved substantially increased contributions and guarantees of solvency by the railway companies concerned.  Most of the Irish railway companies refused to assent to these provisions at first, but all these companies eventually agreed except the Great Southern Railways Company. That company decided it would be preferable to set up their own scheme. When the fund was reorganised in 1941 the Great Southern Railways members were placed in special sections&mdash;named &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;D&rdquo;&mdash;of the fund.  The benefits provided for members of sections C and D were less than those applicable to other members, but the Great Southern Railways Company made good the loss to their employees by granting <i>ex gratia</i> supplementary benefits.</P>
      <P>There are about 1,300 former employees of the Great Southern Railways Company in the scheme at present.  The assets appropriate to sections C and D of the fund total approximately £1,000,000.  The corporation have now agreed with Córas Iompair Eireann to transfer the assets, members and liabilities to trustees in this country so that a new superannuation scheme may be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new scheme will apply to all salaried officers and clerks of the former Great Southern Railways Company who are members, active or superannuated, of the corporation scheme.  It will also apply to any former employee of the Great Southern Railways Company who is subsequently transferred from a wages grade to a salaried grade, if such a person would have been entitled to become a member of the corporation scheme if the <Col N="341" /> Great Southern Railways Company had not been dissolved.</P>
    <P>The corporation have been advised that legislation in both countries is required to effect the transfer of the assets so that the new scheme may be established, and to indemnify the fund corporation against any claims from the former members of the fund.  The corporation have agreed to sponsor in the British Parliament a complementary Bill to which the scheme in the Irish Bill will be scheduled.  The Irish Act will not come into effective operation until three months after the passage of the British Act.  This will allow ample time for the formalities necessary for the transfer of the assets and members to the new fund.  The British Bill should be introduced by November next, and certain formalities &mdash;meetings of members of the scheme and so forth&mdash;will be necessary between the passing of this Bill and the introduction of the British legislation. This measure is, therefore, urgent, and I propose to ask the House to take several stages together.</P>
    <P>As members will recollect, the Minister for Industry and Commerce gave an undertaking during the debate in the Dáil on the Transport Act, 1944, that arrangements would be made to secure for the clerical staff of the Great Southern Railways Company benefits at least as good as those to which they would have been entitled if the company had assented to the 1941 reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The scheme in this Bill fulfils that condition.  It further provides that certain members can exercise the option of obtaining either the benefits provided in the scheme or, alternatively, the benefits to which they are entitled under existing practice; that is to say, benefits made available to members of non-assenting railway companies, plus the supplementary benefits provided <i>ex gratia</i> by Córas Iompair Eireann.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the negotiations a booklet containing the proposed superannuation scheme was circulated to all the former Great Southern Railways members of the scheme and was approved by an overwhelming majority. At a later stage it became necessary to <Col N="342" /> make certain drafting and other minor amendments, but the scheme as now scheduled to the Bill is unaltered as regards contributions, options and benefits.  I am assured that the fund corporation, the clerical workers concerned and the management of Córas Iompair Eireann are satisfied with the terms of the scheme as now settled and that all interests concerned are anxious that the Bill should be enacted as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill reminds me of an interview I once had during a dinner with an American professor of law.  It was as far back as 1925 in New York.  He asked me to tell him something about the Irish Medical Register which was then being set up.  As a representative of the National University, I happened to know something about it.  I said to him that the British Attorney-General had some difficulties in connection with it.  He said: &ldquo;The British Attorney-General?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, the British Attorney-General,&rdquo; I replied.  &ldquo;Do you talk to the British Attorney-General,&rdquo; he asked, and I said &ldquo;I think they do.&rdquo; I explained to him that the Treaty had laid down certain general principles and that it would take possibly more than a generation to disentangle various things which had been for so long interlocked.</P>
      <P>This is an example, I think, of where various parties have to be consulted. We have to pass a Bill and the British Parliament will, it is presumed, also pass a Bill in order to disentangle certain things which arise from the close political, financial and other connections between Great Britain and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Bill is one with which, in fact, the Oireachtas can do nothing.  In the first place, the schedule depends on an agreement made by certain parties here, an agreement with which certain people may be dissatisfied, but, even if they are, we have no remedy.  As I say, the schedule depends on an agreement between certain parties, and it also depends on an agreement in Great Britain and on the passage of a Bill through the British Parliament. <Col N="343" /> Therefore, I think the Bill, which is one with a scheduled agreement, is one to which we might assent, and all stages of which we might pass.</P>
    <P>Question agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the easiest ways to avoid answering an awkward question is to put up another ninepin and knock it down.  There is a case, and the case was made before in this House, in respect of the difficulty associated with work in the Metropolitan District Court.  By virtue of the pressure of business in these courts, there is the case that the district <Col N="344" /> justices should not be asked to sit on as many days as justices in the country but I do not agree, as I said on the last stage, with the provisions of the Bill, even though the provisions are taken to some extent from the Principal Act.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's arguments on the last day was that the Principal Act provided a difference between the salary of a district justice in the metropolitan district and the salary of a district justice in the country.  Before the Minister arrived this evening we had a discussion on the question of precedents.  As I pointed out then, if we were to take the view that every Act previously passed was the last word in legislation, we should never have the Minister here.  We should be very sorry for that.  There would be no necessity to amend the law if we took that view.  Apart from that, I think I am right in saying that the difference in connection with the original Act is smaller than the difference which there will be under this measure.  There is a very distinct view that district justices in the country have to keep up a style which does not operate in the city.  In the city nobody knows exactly what the manner of living of a particular district justice is.  He is swallowed up in the large urban population.  In the country the district justice of the area is a person who must be looked up to. That is essential if he is to carry in his court a proper dignity.  He is a person who must be asked&mdash;and very properly &mdash;to various functions in his area.  The Minister knows as well as I do that, even though one may get an invitation to a certain function, as matters work out, the cost is often greater than if he had not got an invitation.  It does seem ludicrous that, if I knock down a man because he annoys me, the district justice who will try the case, if the offence occurs in the country, will be paid at a different rate from the district justice who would try the same offence if it were committed in the city.  I do not think that that is right. As I am not allowed to move an amendment on the matter, I press the Minister to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage covering these points.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this proposal. There is every justification for the Minister doing what Senator Sweetman urges.  Neither the Minister nor anybody else will challenge the truth of the statement that the competence of the district justice in the country must be, at least, up to the level of that of the district justice who operates in the city.  As the national schools are the poor man's main source of education in the country, so the District Courts in the country are the poor man's courts.  Many interesting and important questions of law are decided in those courts.  The justice who adjudicates on these questions must understand country life and must know his law. What is sought will not involve any considerable expenditure and it is a desirable step to take.</P>
      <P>If additional justices or temporary justices have to be appointed in the city, I presume that these young men coming into the service will be paid a salary equivalent to what the permanently appointed justice receives. That salary will be higher than the salary received by old and experienced men in the country.  That is an invidious position in which to place the senior justices in the country.  Nobody seeks to belittle the responsibilities with which city justices are faced every day of the week.  On the other hand, nobody who knows the type of problems which have to be determined by district justices in the country and who realises how important it is that their judgment should stand out as competent and impartial will deny that these justices should be as well paid as justices operating in the city.</P>

      <P>I should like to join my voice with the voices of those Senators who have spoken in support of this proposal.  I should like to see justices in the country paid the same salary as justices in the city are paid. Apart from their work, with which many Senators are more familiar than I am, these men have a position to <Col N="346" /> keep up.  It is extremely difficult for them to do so, particularly if they have young families.  I ask the Minister to consider the proposal which has been made.  On Report Stage, perhaps he would see his way to meet the wishes which have been expressed by so many Senators to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this proposal on general principles.  I think that it would be better if, instead of this peculiar scheme of differentiation, district justices were paid a uniform salary.  I do not want to repeat what I said on the Second Stage, but civil servants in the administrative grade have a much higher salary than these country district justices.  Under the consolidation scheme, and a man who had £900 a year, now receives £1,300 a year, and he has prospects of promotion.  When a person becomes a district justice, he abandons any prospects of promotion. The District Courts have worked well, and there is no basis at all for this distinction between ordinary Dublin justices and justices in the country districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I frankly think that it is very desirable that the district justice should be enabled to cut some kind of figure in the country.  One of the things we have come to realise since our extreme youth, when we were in favour of the levelling of everything, is the lack here of a certain kind of society.  The district justice, who represents the State, and the administration of Irish justice, and who has been selected for his character, is a desirable kind of person to be able to cut a figure such as I have mentioned. From the social point of view and even from what we might call the Irish-Ireland point of view, it is desirable that he should have a reasonable income. The difference made between a district justice in the country and a district justice in Dublin has no real basis.  The Department of Finance is, of course, always looking for bases to make differentiations of this kind.  The man who gets appointed to Dublin may become a principal district justice and may, in a short time, have a much higher salary than men in the country who were appointed 20 or 25 years ago. <Col N="347" /> That is very undesirable.  The amount of money involved is very small.  The unfortunate position is that the district justices win the golden opinions of all classes, including politicians and lawyers, but they do not get any money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard for me to resist all these appeals, but I have got to do so.  Whether the Seanad agrees with it or not, what is being done in this Bill is consistent with what has happened throughout the Government service.  In this Bill a percentage increase is provided, which is not as great as would compensate for the increased cost of living.  That has not been done in the case of those higher positions at all.  The increases are on a graduated scale.  Whatever case may be made for an increased salary for district justices, the Minister for Finance would never consent to such an increase in connection with the figures set out in this Bill.  He does not want to destroy the basis on which he started out.  If that were done in this case, he would be told that he gave 50 per cent. to these people and only 30 per cent. to others.  I am not promising that such increases will be made at a future date.  I put this matter up to the Government.  There was some pressure about it before now. I myself should have liked to see a larger salary provided for district justices. Whatever hope there may be of having that done in the future if the question of the difference in the purchasing power of money leads to an increase in the jurisdiction of the courts, it will not be done in connection with this Bill.  We have had other Bills here to-day. There is a percentage increase in them. In the case of civil servants it could be done without legislation.  Statutory salaries require legislation to give effect to the Government policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry I have to resist the appeal that has been made from all sides of the House.  I have, however, no option in the matter.  I will say that if I were the Minister and if there was a Bill for increasing jurisdiction of that kind I would make a fight for it.  At present <Col N="348" /> I see no case without opening the door for practically every class of public servant which has got an increase. Some Senator said that we are taking an unscientific line in the matter.  I do not agree.  I consider that it was a very safe course to adopt.  People on the lower scales got a much higher percentage increase because undoubtedly a greater proportion of their salary went to the increased cost of living.  I suppose that as one's salary goes up the scale it is less&mdash;maybe it is not, some say it is not but I think it is&mdash;because my belief is that a higher salary does not require as big a percentage increase.  The Government thinks so too and have been consistent in the matter.  I have no option but to turn down the appeals which have been made from all sides of this House, and also in the Dáil, and even before that from all over the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was discussed at some length on the Second Stage.  Its purpose is to ensure that, though the President of the Circuit Court will have all and every proper power in relation to the Circuit Court, he will not be an <i>ex officio</i> judge of the High Court.  I do not like the provision by virtue of which the President of the Circuit Court can be&mdash;and I use the words &ldquo;can be&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;utilised as a judge of appeal over another Circuit Court judge.  The Minister said on a previous stage&mdash;I am not quite clear whether he said it here or in the Dáil, but I read it in the report of either House&mdash;that the President of the Circuit Court would not be used for that purpose.  With all due respect to the Minister, I say that he cannot give any such undertaking.  The provision is in this Bill that the President of the Circuit Court can be so used.  I do not admit the Minister's case in this respect but, whatever case there is for the President of the Circuit Court to, so to speak, stand in and do High Court work, if High Court judges become ill, I suggest there is no case at all for sending out the President of the Circuit Court as a journeyman High Court judge on circuit to hear appeals coming from <Col N="350" /> other judges of the Circuit Court. There is provision in this Bill by virtue of which that can happen.  The Minister, I think, very nearly went as far as saying that he did not agree that it would be satisfactory for the President of the Circuit Court to have to hear appeals from other Circuit Court judges.  I think it was in the other House that the Minister stated that.  If that be so&mdash;I say very strongly that it is so&mdash;and if the Minister agrees with me would it not be far better to insert an amendment in this Bill by virtue of which the President of the Circuit Court can stand in to do ordinary High Court work if there is illness but under no circumstances can he be asked to hear appeals from his other Circuit Court brethren?</P>
    <P>I think quite candidly that for the President of the Circuit Court to hear appeals from the other Circuit Court judges whom he is directing in the courts could only lead to friction.  There is no use in trying to evade the fact that if a judge is overruled by another judge there is bound to be a certain amount of ill-feeling, and perhaps friction, in certain cases.  It is very undesirable that the man who is directing the work of the Circuit Court, as the President of the Circuit Court, should be asked as in this case, or should be put in the position of being asked&mdash;even going as far as that&mdash;to sit in appeal over another Circuit Court colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment as it stands.  I gave my reasons on the last occasion for that. In short, they are that it is a very good thing, if there is a shortage of High Court judges, that the President of the Circuit Court would be available to do the work.  There is something in what Senator Sweetman has said but it is not in his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that this provision should be inserted in the Bill.  This Bill has been drawn up without reference to or consultation with the members of the legal profession. Members of the profession are practically unanimous in opposing this provision, namely that the President of the Circuit Court should <i>ex officio</i> be an additional judge of the High Court.  I do not know why the Government ever decided to adopt this provision. It may be that the Department of Finance had some qualms of conscience about consenting to Section 6 (1), which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President of the Circuit Court shall receive the same annual salary as an ordinary judge of the High Court&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>and in order to salve their consciences they said he must be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court so that he would keep within their regulations.</P>
      <P>There is a great difference between the High Court and the Circuit Court. In the first instance, there is the hierarchy of courts.  In practice, a decision of a circuit judge does not bind a High Court judge and, no matter how learned that decision on any point of law, it cannot be referred to before a High Court judge.  That is so in order to preserve the right of independent judgment of the High Court in cases of appeal from the Circuit Court.  There is what is known as the comity of courts&mdash;judges of co-ordinate jurisdiction, although not bound by the decision of their colleagues, adopt those decisions and use them and allow the party aggrieved to go to the higher court to have the matter decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the President of the Circuit Court may sit as circuit judge one day and as a judge of the High Court the next day.  As a judge of the High Court, he cannot look at his decision in the Circuit Court, if the same matter should come before him, but his mind and his views on law will be exactly the same as when he was a <Col N="352" /> circuit judge.  Therefore, he is not absolutely free to act as a High Court judge.  In the Constitution, Article 36, it is expressly provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Constitution relating to the courts, the following matters shall be regulated in accordance with law, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) the number of judges of the Supreme Court, and of the High Court, the remuneration, age of retirement and pensions of such judges,</P>
    <P>(ii) the number of the judges of all other courts, and their terms of appointment,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is contemplated that there should be a distinct number of judges in the High Court and a distinct number in the Circuit Court, which is one of those &ldquo;other&rdquo; courts.  There is no provision in the Constitution for a judge of the Circuit Court to be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court, in other words, to be a judge of both courts.  That matter should have weighed with the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the circuit judges were consulted.  I am sure they were quite willing to agree, as every circuit judge had a chance of being made a judge of the High Court and had everything to gain and nothing to lose by agreeing.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that, in practice, this will not be satisfactory.  We know what human nature is and when a circuit judge sits once in the High Court he will be loath to go back and sit as a circuit judge.  No temporary judges of the High Court have been appointed &mdash;though at one time there were commissioners to hear appeals&mdash;as when that temporary service would be ended they would have to go back to the Bar and be one of the crowd.  Now, when his functions as High Court judge are ended, he goes back to the Circuit Court.  That is a step down which should not occur.  A judge should be a judge of the court to which he is appointed and of no other court.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary, for the purpose of giving the president the High Court status, that he should be a judge of that court.  He has status in being <Col N="353" /> president and in being endowed with all the powers of president as set out in this Bill and he has the status of being paid the salary of a High Court judge.  That is status enough and there is no necessity to add this novel provision to make him a judge of the High Court.  He is to act as president and direct the other judges of the Circuit Court.  He has that status under Section 10 and the mere fact that he is <i>ex office</i> a judge of the High Court will not improve in any way his position, status or prestige in carrying out his functions as president.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (4) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The person appointed to be President of the Circuit Court shall hold that office so long as he holds the office of circuit judge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So the section itself is contradictory. He is a circuit judge and at the same time an additional judge of the High Court.  He seems to be made a judge of the two courts at the one time, though he cannot sit in both on the same day.  If he sits in one on one day and in another on the next, he is in effect a judge of two courts; and the spirit of the Constitution does not allow that.  It says that the number of judges of the High Court and the number of judges of the &ldquo;other&rdquo; courts shall be regulated by law.  It makes a clear distinction and this merger of the judgeships is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This merger also is contrary to the views and opinions of the legal profession. It would have been advisable if the Minister had consulted informally the President of the Incorporated Law Society and the Chairman of the Bar Council on this matter.  That is why I think this whole idea has been misconceived. The Minister has been advised in this matter by members of the Civil Service and by the judges but judges do not constitute the entire of the legal profession.  I say that the courts could not function without the practising members of the profession, helping the judges to understand the law and to keep the courts going, to help the litigants.  The knowledge of the law is kept in the custody of the legal profession.  The members of the bench are chosen from that legal profession. <Col N="354" /> The members of the bench have no what I may call super knowledge of law.  They only get that either from their practice in the legal profession or from the practitioners who appear before them.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I say that the legal profession should be consulted.  As I have said, on the Health Bill, the medical profession has been consulted and in agricultural matters agriculturists have been consulted so I think it is nearly time now that the legal profession should be consulted when matters affecting the courts of the land are being dealt with by legislation.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter need not get hot about these things.  The lawyers are quite happy.  I may be permitted, perhaps, to intervene for the purpose of getting some information because it is not at all clear to me what case is being made against the section.  It seems to me that it is common practice in the courts to elevate a High Court judge to the Supreme Court bench on occasion and in his capacity as a temporary Supreme Court judge, he sits on appeals from his brethren in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of five.  Not singly.  In this case he sits singly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but he is sitting in appeal and he has a voice and a vote in the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>And his could easily be the deciding voice or the deciding vote. If there are five judges sitting on appeal and two take one view and two take another, the judge who is temporarily elevated to the Supreme Court may in fact decides in these circumstances. I am not arguing against the proposition put forward by Senator Sweetman.  I am looking for information <Col N="355" /> because it seems to me that it is hardly competent for us to say that a Circuit Court judge is unsuitable for temporary transfer to the High Court bench while we agree and when it is the practice that a judge of the High Court may be temporarily lent to the Supreme Court.  There was a constitutional issue considered in the Supreme Court two or three weeks ago and one of the five judges was promoted for the purpose from the High Court to the Supreme Court and he returned to the High Court the next day.  In that case the High Court judge was in fact sitting in judgment on an issue tried a few weeks earlier by the President of the High Court and I take it that he has a voice and a vote in deciding whether the president of the court to which he normally belongs was right or wrong.  If that is acceptable, I find it very difficult to see the substance in the argument that the President of the Circuit Court should be disqualified from sitting on the High Court bench simply because he is a Circuit Court judge.  I am not making any point about it but I do not understand the argument and nothing that has been said has made it clear to me why there is this objection in relation to the President of the Circuit Court when it does not apply to an ordinary judge, much less the President, of the High Court in corresponding circumstances.</P>
      <P>Personally, I do not think there is any need to put in this section in order to give dignity or authority to the President of the Circuit Court.  I entirely agree that he has all the authority, power and dignity he needs for his office by reason of the fact that he is President of the Circuit Court and that he has the right to order the business of the Circuit Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I expressed the view that, if this avoids the appointment of an additional High Court judge, the section should be welcomed.  It seems to me that circumstances might arise, in fact, I imagine they do arise from time to time, in which it is necessary to have available the assistance of an additional judge of the High Court and as these circumstances are of a <Col N="356" /> temporary character there would be no justification for the permanent appointment of an additional High Court judge.  It seems a natural enough arrangement, if you must have temporary help to carry on the business of the High Court, that a named judge from the Circuit Court should be transferred rather than that a temporary High Court judge should be appointed.  I think everybody agrees that the appointment of temporary judges in any court from the Circuit Court up is an unsatisfactory arrangement. I do not know anybody who defends it, except perhaps the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is one other consideration that I would like to put forward.  Again, I am open to correction from those who have more experience and more knowledge of these matters than I have.  It seems to me that there are duties which fall to the High Court judges other than the hearing of appeals from the Circuit Court.  I understand from solicitors that it is common practice that a judge of the High Court can preside over a criminal court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I imagine that in circumstances of that kind, should there be an objection to having the President of the High Court hearing appeals from his brethren, it would be preferable that he would be asked to do the work of the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>Another point arises and again I am subject to correction.  There are occasions, I think, in which a divisional court is assembled.  I do not know whether or not it is a common practice but I had an experience of being in the High Court where three judges sat hearing an appeal from the Circuit Court.  Is that not comparable with the position that exists in the Supreme Court, to which I referred a moment ago, of having a judge transferred from the High Court to the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I am merely asking questions because I do not understand from anything that has been said the objection to this section and therefore I do not understand the case for the amendment.  It is in order that I may understand it that I have been putting these questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question raised by Senator Duffy, as to the difference between a High Court judge sitting in the Supreme Court and a Circuit Court judge sitting in the High Court is, I suggest, simple.  Both the High Court and the Supreme Court are courts of unlimited jurisdiction.  The Circuit Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.  Therefore, there is a greater difference between moving from a court of limited jurisdiction into a court of unlimited jurisdiction than in moving from one court of unlimited jurisdiction into another.  I suggest that the Senator's argument about the High Court judge sitting in the Supreme Court being the man who turns the scale on occasions is slightly illogical.  It would be just as logical for me to argue in the case, say, of a majority decision in the Supreme Court where five judges sit that of the majority of three it was the two Supreme Court judges who were responsible for the decision rather than the High Court judge who happened to be one of the majority of three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the correct way to put it is this: in one case he is one of the three judges making the decision, but in the case that is proposed in the Bill he is going to be the single one who will do it.  In one case he has only one-third of the responsibility, but in this case he has the entire responsibility of dealing with the appeal.  Senator Duffy referred to what he called the divisional court.  That, I think, was the old method, and it is no longer operative.  A judge of the High Court goes on circuit to the various centres. He hears appeals alone from the Circuit Court.  That is what I consider particularly undesirable&mdash;that the President of the Circuit Court should hear appeals alone from one of his colleagues. I do not think there is the analogy between the High Court and the Supreme Court on the one hand, <Col N="358" /> and the Circuit Court on the other which Senator Duffy has referred to. I do not expect the Minister to accept the amendment as it stands.  I would ask him to bring forward an amendment himself to provide that the President of the Circuit Court shall not hear appeals coming before the High Court from the Circuit Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <P>It is with some hesitation that I intervene in this debate between lawyers.  I feel there is a certain element of holy sanctity about the methods of the law and of churchmen, and that a layman must be loath to intervene in these matters.  It strikes me that the proposal in the Bill is a rather businesslike arrangement. There are periods, perhaps, when extra work will fall rather heavily on the Supreme Court and on the High Court and when the work in the Circuit Court may be light.  Therefore, it seems to me desirable to have a certain amount of flexibility between the courts.  I feel that the President of the Circuit Court would be fully qualified as a lawyer to discharge the occasional work that may be allotted to him in the High Court and to dispense justice there.  I agree with Senator Duffy that temporary judges are undesirable.  I would not regard the President of the Circuit Court when sitting occasionally as a judge in the High Court as a temporary judge.  What happens is that he is simply transferred from one court to the other as a temporary convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman seemed to suggest&mdash;at least I understood him to suggest&mdash;that the President of the Circuit Court would be of a different calibre from the person usually appointed to the High Court bench.  I seemed to gather from him that the idea was running through his mind that such a person would not be of the same standing and would not have the same training and qualifications as those which are looked for in the case of a High Court judge.  I have a recollection that in the early days of this State, in one case at least, a judge of the same standing as our Circuit Court judges&mdash;in those days they were called county court judges&mdash;was transferred and appointed a High Court <Col N="359" /> judge.  That particular judge&mdash;Judge Johnston&mdash;was a county court judge for very many years, and as I say became a High Court judge.  When he was appointed to that position he was allotted work of a specialised character. I think I am correct in saying that he became the Chancery judge in the High Court.  I do not think the suggestion was ever made that he lacked the qualifications possessed by any of his brethren on the High Court bench.  There may be some reasons for the Senator's objection, but they had not been made clear to me.  The objection surely cannot be on the ground of qualifications.  I think that a Circuit Court judge can try a murder case and sentence a person to death. If he is competent to do that work in the Circuit Court, can it be said that he is less competent to do it in the Central Criminal Court?  I, personally, cannot see any backing for the Senator's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Duffy has fallen into an error because no Circuit Court judge has jurisdiction to try a murder case, and no power consequently to sentence a person to death for murder.  There is no reason why Circuit Court judges ought not to try a person for murder.  My objection is not based at all on any allegation that the President of the Circuit Court, whoever he may be, is not competent to act as a High Court judge.  It has nothing whatever to do with the competency of the Circuit Court bench.  It is simply a question of what I may call legal mechanics, the working out of this in the practical everyday life of the courts and also having regard to the working of the legal system by which each court is, so to speak, kept in a watertight compartment.  Now, the layman may not see the necessity for that but, having regard to the fact that judges differ in their opinions on law, it is necessary to have decisions by a final court.  Therefore, you have what is called a system of appeal.  If a Circuit Court judge decides a case in a certain way, the aggrieved litigant has the right of appeal to the High Court on circuit.  A High Court judge may decide a case in a different way. <Col N="360" /> Whether he is a better lawyer or whether his decision is right or wrong, it is final and conclusive, and it is for the purpose of having finality on questions of law that you have a hierarchy of final courts whose decisions are binding.  In this case, by breaking into that hierarchy, you have a person who is a judge of the Circuit Court and also a judge of the High Court.  In fact you have the same person occupying two different judgeships at the same time, because the section provides that &ldquo;the President of the Circuit Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the High Court&rdquo;.  &ldquo;He shall be&rdquo;; in other words, by virtue of the fact that he is President of the Circuit Court he is an additional judge of the High Court; he is a judge of two courts at the same time, which, I say, was never intended by the Constitution.  There is nothing to prevent the President of the Circuit Court sitting in the Supreme Court, because as a judge of the High Court he can be invited to sit in the Supreme Court.  Therefore he can go two stages&mdash;he can sit one day as President of the Circuit Court as a Circuit Court judge and the next day he can sit as a judge of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>No High Court judge can sit in the Supreme Court unless he is invited.  The President of the Circuit Court is <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court; in other words, he is not invited to become a judge of the High Court. &ldquo;He shall be <i>ex officio</i> a judge of the High Court&rdquo;; in other words, he is a judge of two courts at the one time and that is the objection to this provision in the Bill.  A judge of the High Court is not a judge of the Supreme Court. He sits in the Supreme Court, but he is not a Supreme Court judge; he is a High Court judge.  If there were a provision in the Courts of Justice Act that every High Court judge shall <i>ex officio</i> be a judge of the Supreme Court, it would mean then that he was a judge of the Supreme Court, not a judge of the High Court.  This section provides <Col N="361" /> that the President of the Circuit Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the High Court.  The word &ldquo;additional&rdquo; means nothing there except in relation to the others.  It means that he shall be a judge of the High Court. That is what I cannot understand.  That is the position under this section.</P>

      <P>Listening to Senator Ryan's last remarks, it struck me forcibly that the President of the Circuit Court, being an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the High Court, would be subject to the orders of the President of the High Court.  That might create a very interesting situation.  There might be a clash of views between the President of the High Court and the President of the Circuit Court.  When the President of the Circuit Court decided to sit as a Circuit Court judge, he might be ordered by the President of the High Court to sit as a High Court judge.  Surely that is a situation that steps ought to be taken in this Bill to avoid.</P>

      <P>I do not think that situation could possibly arise at all.  He would only go to the High Court when invited by the President of the High Court.  The President of the High Court is a man who has a great regard for all courts, whether the High Court, the Circuit Court or otherwise.  He would take the greatest care not to interfere with any of the work of the Circuit Court and would not invite the President of the Circuit Court unless he was absolutely free at the time and had no work of his own to do, or unless he could get another Circuit Court judge to do his work, which very often can happen.  I do not think that situation is at all likely to arise.  There would be no clash, because he would only go when invited by the President of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I think the case made by the various representatives of the legal profession is a very strong one.  Personally I think that every effort should be made to preserve the lines of demarcation, as it were, between the different courts&mdash;to preserve that hierarchy referred to by Senator Ryan.  I believe that the courts are the last bulwark of liberty in this <Col N="362" /> country.  I have expressed that view very frequently.  This might be interpreted as something equivalent to what is commonly called in warfare sapping and mining.  If we once muddy, as it were, the boundaries between the two types of courts we do not know where that arrangement may stop and eventually it may be carried forward from the High Court to the Supreme Court. In that way the step here proposed is much more serious than perhaps appears on the surface.  We are all familiar with a lot of parallels such as that of Jekyll and Hyde.  We may have a person who is a Circuit Court judge and the next time the same man appears as a High Court judge.  You have then the character in <i>The Mikado</i> known as &ldquo;Pooh Bah&rdquo; who held various offices.  Is this not the commencement of a similar state of affairs? Generally speaking, I think the case is a very strong one for reconsideration. The Minister at least should take precautions in the Bill to provide that a man who has given a decision in a certain case shall not be called upon to review that same case.  There ought to be some provision at least made so as to prevent something like that occurring. I would be inclined to join with those who have asked the Minister to reconsider this provision and to introduce some suitable amendment to prevent evils that may arise if the Bill is allowed to stand as it is.</P>

      <P>I must say that I am surprised at the opposition to this provision. The first thing to be remembered is that all the business in the High Court is settled by the President of the High Court.  The matter of going on circuit is provided for definitely in the 1936 Act.  It is arranged between the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court. Surely we can leave them to use their common sense to see that a judge will not be put on a case which he dealt with before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chief Justice and the President can look after all these things.  I cannot see anything in the objection raised to the President of the <Col N="363" /> Circuit Court hearing appeals from other Circuit Court judges, because, as Senator Duffy pointed out, that practice obtains already.  The Central Criminal Court is presided over by a High Court judge, sometimes by the President of the High Court.  An appeal can be taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal consisting of three judges, two of whom are High Court judges.  Is not the same thing happening there?  I can see no objection to that.  All the Government want to do, as I said in the other House, is to see that there is no question about the prestige and status of the person who would occupy the position.  He would be there to be called upon in the event of there being a great deal of work to be done in the High Court, arrears of work due to some unforeseen circumstances, such as the possibility of two judges being ill at the same time. Generally speaking, I think anyone who knows anything about the courts knows that the Circuit Court is a much busier court than the High Court, that it has more cases to deal with.  It is most unlikely, therefore, that the President will be called away, but if the President of the High Court wishes him to go I can certainly see no objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the provisions of the Constitution, of course I do not happen to be a lawyer, but at the same time I may have a certain amount of common sense.  It is just possible that I have. So far as I can see, the courts are very well mixed already.  As a matter of fact, the only one that stands out by itself is the Supreme Court.  As I read Article 34 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court is set out by itself as a court of appeal.  It is not a Court of First Instance.  Paragraph 2 of Article 34 states: &ldquo;The courts shall comprise Courts of First Instance and a Court of Final Appeal.&rdquo;  It appears to me that there is more joining up, under the Constitution, of the High Court with the other courts than with the Supreme Court.  Nevertheless, the judges in the two courts are interchangeable. With regard to the point raised by Senator Ryan as to whether a judge is a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, or merely in <Col N="364" /> the Supreme Court by invitation, I refer the Senator to Section 6 of the 1924 Act, which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The President of the High Court shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice shall be <i>ex officio</i> an additional judge of the High Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are both definitely judges of these courts, of two courts at the same time.  There is your Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in the Act of 1924.  We are doing nothing here but extending that in a very desirable way.  Undoubtedly every judge of the High Court is not a judge of the Supreme Court, or <i>vice versa,</i> but two particular judges are&mdash; and the <i>ex officio</i> position, by the way, is left for legislation; it is not in the Constitution&mdash;and we are following that precedent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the lawyers, I do not mean to be disrespectful to the lawyers. I fully appreciate their position, but I think that, when dealing with any particular class of the community, it is desirable that we should consult them, and, when dealing with the circuit judges, I think I have done all that could be expected of me when I submitted the Bill to them for their consideration and observations.  I took particular pains to do that.  We consulted two other judges, too, but I just gave the opinion of the Circuit Court judges on this matter and I think that, having done that, I have done very well.  If I had got considered opinions from the Bar Council, I would have regard to them, but I simply got a resolution saying that they did not approve of what was being done.</P>

I would appreciate their help, and, if I had felt that this Bill affected them <Col N="365" /> to the extent suggested by Senator Ryan, I would have consulted them beforehand, but I did not think it did and I am not yet convinced that it does.  It did affect the position of Circuit Court judges because we were putting somebody to preside over them, to tell them the places in which they should hold their courts and to direct them to sit in any circuit in which there was pressure of work if the work in their own circuits was light at the time. That was really a changing of their position and it was only fair that they should be consulted, as they were.  I do not want to speak in any way disparagingly of the Bar Council but I do not agree that I should have approached the Bar Council or the Incorporated Law Society about the matter.  If there was something dealing with these two professions directly, I would, but I have done all that is required of me by consulting those directly and immediately concerned with the legislation.</P>

    <P>The purpose of the amendment is perfectly clear.  The Minister is giving the new President of the Circuit Court powers to deal with the direction of the work.  The president is to be the <Col N="366" /> person responsible for that work, and, in these circumstances, before circuits are altered, it would be only fair to give the man who is to be held responsible the opportunity of concurring in these arrangements, so that arrangements will not be made of which he would not approve, although he would have to carry them out.</P>

Perhaps there might be a case for it if it were a Minister, though I do not think there would be, but surely the Senator does not suggest that the Government should be asked to hold their hand for the concurrence of a judge.  The Government ought not to be asked to do so, and I would object most strongly to it, but it would be unthinkable that we would do anything without consulting the president.  What Senator Ryan says is what will happen.  He will say that a certain thing should be done and the Government will give effect to it.  It is not a matter for a Minister but for the Government.  The Senator will admit that there is a point in that&mdash;that you simply could not ask the Government to wait for the concurrence of a judge or for consultation with a <Col N="367" /> judge.  It will be done, without any question whatever, not alone after consultation but very likely at the request of the president.  The amendment is entirely unnecessary because any Government will try to work with the judges as well as they can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up very much time in dealing with this matter, but I think it is fitting and of considerable importance at this stage to have a Ministerial statement on the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the other House, on 3rd July, a question was asked with regard to the possibility of alien females coming here as domestic servants and there was an indication from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to that question, that the restrictions that have operated up to the present would be relaxed under certain circumstances. I want to carry this matter further. It is within the knowledge of all of us that there are to-day hundreds of <Col N="370" /> thousands of displaced persons, some in Britain and many on the Continent of Europe.  I have especially in mind members of the Polish forces in Britain and Poles in camps in Europe.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that these people, in their tragic position, afford us an opportunity to procure a type of skill for the building up of industrial activity that we do not now possess. We have here an opportunity that may not offer again.  After the last war a somewhat similar situation existed, though it was nothing as bad as to-day; but quite definitely there were opportunities then to bring here from the Continent many technicians who would be prepared to give their services almost for what they could find to eat.  If we had had the imagination to rise to that occasion and avail of their services it would have put us on the highway now, probably in many industrial undertakings that we have not even thought of establishing.  It seems to me there are available to us at this moment many technicians who would be in a position to show us how to do many things for ourselves that we have not yet thought of.</P>
    <P>We have to admit that in a variety of respects we are rather backward. That is due to historical reasons.  It is true that there are a number of things we cannot do without external assistance and training; that is, through having made available to us the skill of foreigners, which is not easily obtainable.  I believe there are thousands of people&mdash;we do not, of course, want thousands, because that would create another problem for us&mdash; including a great many technicians, whose services could usefully be employed in this country, because they have skill of a type not possessed by any of our nationals.</P>
    <P>I think myself that we should be wide awake to such a situation as that and that we ought to avail of the opportunities opened up before us.  I believe that, in so far as it is possible, so far as it is wise and justifiable, we should open our doors to the Christian peoples of Europe, to the people of the smaller nations, many of whom have been banished from homes to which they can <Col N="371" /> never return.  I think that there are people here who should like to have this situation clarified.  I am quite certain that there are in our midst enterprising individuals, who have certain views about the manner in which the services of people, whom we now certify as aliens, could be utilised.  I hope that the Minister will give us a clear indication of what Government policy is in this regard.  I recognise the difficulties which the open door would create for the Government.  I am not suggesting any such step as that but I do feel that a declaration of policy, which would indicate that the Government are favourable to the employment of people here who have a certain type of skill which we could utilise, would stir the imagination of our people and probably get us going on lines of production that we have not heretofore attempted.</P>
    <P>I know many of the difficulties that the country, the Government and certain individuals would be faced with, in trying to implement a policy like this but I suggest that we should try to see how we can make it operate even in regard to the question which was answered the other day in the other House.  I do not know how that can be effectively operated although I believe it is really an urgent question. I believe that it would be a valuable acquisition to the country if a number of people who are prepared to give domestic service in this country could be selected and brought into it.  I see certain difficulties, of course, in regard to selection and I see difficulties in discovering exactly how people are to go about this.  I think that if we could have some form of bureau established here that would be at the disposal of those who are in need of such services it would be a help.  There is the other problem of selection.  There again responsible people, very responsible people with competence for the task, would have to be available to make the selections so that we would have no regrets afterwards.  Anyhow I feel that it is a question about which probably a considerable number of our citizens are concerned to a greater or lesser degree.  I think it would clarify the situation for all concerned if we knew <Col N="372" /> exactly what the Ministerial policy in regard to it was.</P>

      <P>I saw this motion only a few moments ago.  May I say that it is one that has my fullest sympathy and support?  I think we have got only half an hour to discuss the matter so I shall be very brief.  It is not on humanitarian grounds alone that I welcome Senator Baxter's invitation to the Minister.  I think it calls for very little imagination to picture the plight of the poor people in the displaced camps and it would be a very valuable contribution to the cause of humanity if some measures of the type suggested were adopted.  I welcome the proposal also on national grounds. I have seen, and I know, what we all owe in a limited way to foreign technicians in this country and I feel that it might conceivably add to the volume of our production and to the efficiency of our industry, if we received, within limits, a certain number of selected technicians.  We cannot claim to have in our short industrial life the technical experience that some European industrialised countries possess.  I feel that there is very valuable technical material in these displaced camps that could make a valuable contribution to our industrial effort.</P>

I think very few people realise the depths of tragedy that lie behind these two words &ldquo;displaced persons&rdquo;.  I can assure the House that if we do require any form of expert technicians the camps of Europe at the moment are full of trained and skilled people of every kind and description, skilled in every conceivable trade that one can think of. I think it would be very useful to the House and particularly to the industrialists of this country to have a statement from the Minister as to what Government policy will be in this matter. Naturally, I quite agree with Senator Baxter that it is a matter that should be proceeded with with caution and that it would be necessary before people are admitted that they should <Col N="373" /> be very carefully screened by the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>The motion appears to have been very well and carefully worded by Senator Baxter.  It proposes to admit technicians who have a knowledge that is not possessed by people in this country.  It appears to be very well worded in that way.  As Senator Sir John Keane has said, we had examples in this country, from the time of the Huguenots down, of important trades, established by foreigners, trades which were previously unknown in this country.  It would be a very good thing if these people could be brought here to start industries which would provide employment for our own people at home.  The question of emigration of Irish boys and girls has become a very serious question indeed and if anything could be done to stem that emigration or to prevent it entirely, I think it would be a very welcome development.  Until recently I was not so much opposed to it but recent information I have got about those who have gone abroad is very disheartening indeed, and any industry that could be established to stop emigration would be a step in the right direction.  As the last speaker said, it will be necessary, of course, to investigate the character of those who would be admitted.  That is very important. So far as the Minister for Industry and Commerce is concerned, I know he is always anxious to start a new factory and to take full advantage of the services of any skilled technician who can be procured.</P>

      <P>I shall take only three minutes.  We welcome the motion in so far as we have from members of the House an expression of their opinions and views as to the policy that should be pursued in relation to allowing in people from other countries&mdash;technicians who possess a knowledge that is very necessary for the establishment of <Col N="374" /> industries here.  We all, I think, appreciate, some to a greater, some to a lesser degree, the position of these people in Europe to-day.  From my experience I think that at no time has any barrier been put in the way of persons of that type coming into the country if it could be proved that their knowledge or their equipment would be helpful in the building up of Irish industries, but more than the good will of the Government will be essential in order to bring about what Senator Baxter has in mind.  The good will of the trade union organisations, the good will of political Parties and the good will of the people in general will be needed if they are to be allowed in to help us to build up our industries, and we must not hear it stated on platforms up and down the country that industries are being established under the protection of the Government to give employment to foreigners.  We must drop that if we are to adopt the policy advocated by Senator Baxter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the putting of this question because of the care with which it has been drafted and, particularly, because we should welcome a statement regarding the policy of the Government as to the admission of aliens who have skill and technical training which are badly required in the country.  Where any alien is willing to come in here, if he has skill and technical training which would be available in strengthening the industrial arm of the country, that person is welcome if otherwise acceptable to the Department of Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that I am just asked to state what the policy of the Government is on this matter.  Aliens who, in the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, possess technical qualifications or special knowledge of value to the country, are permitted to enter the country provided they have an offer of employment or have means to maintain themselves for a reasonable period or have friends who undertake to be responsible for their maintenance. In issuing a permit for the alien's employment, of course, the Minister must have regard to the <Col N="375" /> question whether or not an Irish national is available to fill the job. There is always, in addition, the overriding requirement that the Minister for Justice must be satisfied that the alien is desirable from the point of view of character.  I understand that, owing to the number of inquiries reaching him at present on the question of alien employment, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in contemplation the issue of a printed leaflet setting out the conditions under which aliens may be admitted here for the purpose of taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This leaflet will be communicated to the Press and will be given widespread publicity.  That is the position.  I think that it always was the position.  As regards persons like domestic servants, so long as there was a sufficiency of our own nationals available they were not allowed to enter.  I do not think that anybody would favour the admission of technicians for whom there was no employment.  If anybody wants the services of a technician, every effort will be made to help him.  The Minister is preparing this printed circular <Col N="376" /> because of the great number of requests which he has had.</P>
