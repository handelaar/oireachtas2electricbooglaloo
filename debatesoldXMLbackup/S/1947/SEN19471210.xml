      <P>This measure, as the Seanad is aware, is an annual one.  The Acts specified in Parts I and II of the Schedule are due to expire in normal course on 31st December next and it will be necessary to have the Bill enacted before the end of the present calendar year.  It is proposed to continue in operation for another year all the enactments which were continued in force by the Expiring Laws Act, 1946. The Combined Purchasing Act, 1925, will be replaced by the Combined Purchasing Act, 1929, when the time becomes opportune to bring the latter Act into operation.  The position in regard to the replacement of the other measures in the Schedule by permanent legislation is set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Senators.  As will be apparent, each of these Acts is portion of a code scattered through many statutes and their replacement by permanent legislation must necessarily form part of the wider work of consolidation of the various statutes relating to electoral law, housing, sanitary services, or borrowing by local authorities, as the case may be. I think Senators who have read the memorandum which accompanies this Bill will find all the necessary details therein, and, as I have said, we hope to avoid repeating some of these statutes in the next Expiring Laws Bill because consolidation measures are engaging the attention of Departments in regard to a number of matters.</P>

      <P>I have very great pleasure in bringing before the Seanad this Bill, which received very high recommendation and practically unanimous praise in the Dáil.  It is very rarely that a measure comes before members of the Seanad which has received practically no criticism and particularly when it is a Bill involving a certain number of novelties.  The Bill has its origin in two sources&mdash;first, the pressing need to improve the library services in the country which vary both in quality and degree throughout the country and, secondly, the necessity to make some permanent arrangement for the future administration of the Central Library for Students.</P>
      <P>I might give a short history of library legislation in this country in order to enable the House to understand the nature of this measure. The Public Libraries Act, 1855, enabled urban authorities to levy 1d. in the £ for library services.  The 1920 Public Libraries Act raised the maximum rate to 3d.  The 1925 Act transferred the rural district councils administration of library services to the county councils and enabled county councils, where desirable, to absorb the library administration being carried out by an urban or borough council.  At the present time, there are library administrations for all county councils&mdash;in some cases, a joint library administration for two county councils.  There are also libraries attached to the boroughs and Dún Laoghaire, Bray and Clonmel administrations have their own library services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> For some considerable time, the principal difficulty attaching to an improvement of the library services has been the rate limitation, but, in the Local Government Act, 1946, all rate limitation was removed and local authorities or library authorities may now spend all the money they desire upon the library service.  As a result of this, it has been possible, I am glad to say, to increase the salaries of librarians very considerably&mdash;in some cases, by as much as 100 per cent. It has also been possible to devise new scales of salaries attaching to the position of librarian and these have been adopted, I think, in practically all counties.  Concomitantly with this step, it will be possible in the future to make the qualifications somewhat more advanced for persons seeking positions as librarians in order that they will be better able to carry out this very arduous task, a task which requires a considerable amount of knowledge, not to speak of personality.</P>
    <P>To give members of the House some idea of the progress of the library service, I should like to give some figures showing what has been accomplished in an area where the librarian has been particularly successful and where he has had the co-operation of the local authority and where no difficulties have beset him.  In one particular local authority area, 75,000 books were issued in the year.  Of these, 15,000 were non-fiction&mdash;roughly 20 per cent. &mdash;and of these 15,000 non-fiction books 10,000 related to travel, biography or history, showing the great interest of the public in these subjects.  These 10,000 books also included books relating to social and economic problems. Of the 5,700 books given out to children, a little less than 10 per cent. were non-fiction, mostly books of general knowledge interesting to children.</P>
    <P>The variation as between fiction and non-fiction in this area was somewhat extraordinary.  It was from 10 per cent. to 38 per cent., according to the locality.  In quite a number of counties, we find the best reading done in remote country districts, amongst small farmers, and the lightest reading done in the towns.  That may be of <Col N="1396" /> interest to members of the Seanad. In general throughout the country the proportion of non-fiction to fiction varies from 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. Although fiction has itself no value from the standpoint of adult education, I do not think that percentage is in any way too low.  I think it shows that the libraries are serving a useful purpose. The number of active borrowers per cent. of the population, taking it large and wide over the country, varies from 7 per cent. to 15 per cent., and that, obviously, is capable of expansion.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the percentage of non-fiction is the highest.  It is one-third of the books issued by the Dublin libraries, and, what is still more interesting, one-fifth of all the books issued to children in Dublin are non-fiction, showing that children take great advantage of the juvenile service provided by the Dublin libraries to acquire general knowledge in a form suitable for them.</P>
    <P>There are about 2,600 book centres in the country.  The rates vary from 1d. to 3d. in the £ and the total cost of the library services in a recent year is estimated at £90,000.  About half of that amount goes to salaries and it is always the object of every library authority to increase the percentage of the cost of books as a percentage of the total cost, and one could almost judge the activity of a library authority by the high percentage of the cost represented by books and issues of books.</P>
    <P>Many advances have been made by librarians during the past 15 years. Librarians very specially qualified for their work, with zest and enthusiasm; have carried out a great deal of what is known as library extension work and I should like to give a few examples of the kind of work done by pioneers who have received co-operation from their local authorities, who have had the money and also the personality to carry out what I would describe as work of special importance and value.  A number of authorities have travelling vans, a service which is of very great importance in remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>A number of librarians have collected <Col N="1397" /> books on the history of the locality where they work; have arranged for lectures to be given on important monuments and places of interest and the local history of the environs.  Some librarians have actually founded societies for studying antiquities in the area.  Other librarians have collected volumes of photographs of all the notable places in the district for use at exhibitions of various kinds.  Some librarians have started lending gramophone records as well as books and have met with some success in spite of what one could imagine would be the high rate of breakages.  In fact, the records have been looked after very well and that feature of library work has proved successful.  Some librarians have acquired pictures and have assisted in the promotion of an art museum attached to the library or to the local town hall.  A good number of librarians have maintained very close contact with the local dramatic societies and have helped local dramatic societies to choose plays and have got them copies of the plays from which to work.  Other librarians have maintained very close touch with all agricultural associations and I regard that as perhaps one of the most important activities of any librarian. Where young farmers' clubs have been formed, librarians have often given lectures on books interesting for farmers to read, books written not only by theorists but by practical farmers on modern methods of farming.  The same thing applies to the Irish Country-women's Association, where contact is being maintained by the librarian.</P>
    <P>Some librarians have prepared lists of books designed to interest fiction readers in non-fiction and have succeeded in increasing the percentage of non-fiction readers by preparing a list of books interesting to those who up to a certain time had been interested only in novels.  Other librarians have request lists much like a private library service in which people send in their requests and the books are reserved for them in rotation.</P>
    <P>I mention those things to show the progress that has been made.  At the same time we are acutely aware of the need for the extension of the library service.  In many areas the books are <Col N="1398" /> badly housed, in utterly inadequate buildings.  In a number of areas no juvenile reading service exists and we regard that as very important indeed. Not to have books freely available for children living in remote areas, in long winter evenings, would seem to leave a great gap in our juvenile educational service.  The school teacher in many areas is only too willing to distribute the children's books and to regard the school as a library centre or is very willing to give out these books in rotation if they are brought to him.  At the same time we feel that it is necessary to improve the library service because it forms what might be described as the only universal adult education available in this country.</P>
    <P>The world is becoming so complex, as all members of the House know, that it is impossible for anyone to complete his education even up to the time he leaves the university at the age of 25. He is only just becoming sufficiently experienced in life to take an interest in the world around him.  Life has become so complex and our existence so intimately associated with that of other countries that we can no longer afford to adopt an isolationist attitude towards general education.  Whatever happens to a Chinese small farmer in the remote mountains of China may sooner or later affect the history of this country and its destiny.  At the same time members of the House, I feel quite sure, will agree with me that the development of national culture depends here, as it depends in other countries, on the absorption of good culture from other countries and its re-expression in Irish form.  That has always been the case with all cultures that have developed and the more librarians can assist by having the maximum amount of books likely to interest people in these subjects, the better.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this to decry in any way the value of fiction.  Fiction has a great educational value of its own but nevertheless novels and books on general subjects go hand in hand together. Librarians have faced great difficulties, difficulties in acquiring books during the war, difficulties of <Col N="1399" /> binding books that become damaged&mdash; and the damage done to library books, I am sorry to say, is terrific throughout the country.  Local authorities themselves have had many more pressing problems to consider and, if the library service has been considered by many people the Cinderella of all local services, it is perhaps rather natural because the development of a library service depends on training of a very particular kind and local authorities have been fully occupied in dealing with housing, sewage, water, road and other problems.  So it is quite natural that we should have adjourned until now the proper consideration of this problem.  In general, the degree of reading has greatly increased in the country.  I think about 50 per cent. more books are issued now from local libraries than were issued, say, some ten or 15 years ago, but there can be still more improvement.</P>
    <P>Some time about 1944 the Library Association of Ireland, which includes representatives of local authority libraries as well as other institutions, prepared a memorandum for the Minister for Local Government.  Many of the proposals in this Bill are based on that memorandum.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the position of the Central Library for Students. The Central Library for Students was started in 1923 with funds from the Carnegie Trust.  The Carnegie Trust has since then been contributing the entire expense of that body, which is about £3,000 a year.  The Carnegie Trust principle is to start something new, to inaugurate some new institution for cultural advancement and to hand it over when the work has been begun well and when it is possible for some authority to take over the financial responsibility for whatever institution they start.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Carnegie Trust for the interest they have taken in local authority libraries, most of which, as members know, have passed over to the administration of local authorities.  The Central Library lends books of specialist character, lends expensive books, acts as a reserve bank in respect of local authority libraries and for this purpose it can borrow books from the National <Col N="1400" /> Library, from two libraries in England and Scotland and from university libraries.  The lending goes two ways. The Central Library lends books to students in the universities, lends books to the National Library, if desired, and so you have a two-way movement of books, of great advantage to students and of great advantage to people in remote country areas who seek special books.  In fact, it is possible for a student of botany living in the extreme western part of the country, miles from anywhere, to borrow a most complicated technical book on botany, of which there may be only one copy in the whole country, through the Central Library for Students.</P>
    <P>The Carnegie Trust have recently expressed the desire to hand over the Central Library to a suitable body and to make a gift of the equipment, the books and the stock to some new body, and they propose decreasing gradually their contributions over a period of five years until at the end of five years their contribution would be completely ended.  This Bill, therefore, proposes to establish a permanent body which will act as a central co-ordinating and advisory body for local library services and which will also manage the Central Library for Students.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from Section 5 of the Bill that the constitution of the proposed council is based both on what may be described as the academic element and the local element.  We wish this new council to represent fully the interests of local authorities and, therefore, there are representatives of the General Council of County Councils, representatives of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, and a representative of the Library Association who must, however, be an officer or a member of a local authority.  He must either be a county councillor or an urban councillor or a librarian or assistant librarian of a local authority. On the other hand, there are representatives from the universities and from the National Library of Ireland. They will be asked to nominate persons who will be appointed by the Minister and we hope they will nominate people who will have a good practical interest in books and who know <Col N="1401" /> what young people like to read and, particularly, how to encourage the youth of the country to read books of every kind.</P>
    <P>The Government thought well to establish this body on a statutory basis and not to administer the Central Library or to engage in any functions devolving upon it through a Government Department, and to give the maximum freedom possible, under the circumstances, to this new council.  I am very glad to say that the universities, the National Library and the other bodies have expressed their willingness to co-operate.  It will be noted that the approved association mentioned in Section 5 will in fact be the Library Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The financing of this council is dealt with in Sections 16 and 17 of the Bill. The council will incur two kinds of expenditure. The first kind will relate to the normal running of the council and the payment of the staff and the management of the Central Library for Students.  It is contemplated that in future this expenditure will be about £5,000 a year.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to provide £2,500, or half the cost of the administration, whichever is the less.  It is proposed that that moiety of the cost would be made by assessments on local authorities, assessments which for the first five years will be negligible and which at any time will not be very great, and they will be levied in proportion to the valuation of the area concerned.  There is a precedent for this in the establishment of the Local Appointments Commission and combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government, whose expenditure is defrayed in the same way, by an assessment upon the local authorities.  As I have indicated, the Carnegie Trust will make interim grants towards the cost of running the council in its initial stages and their contributions will diminish.</P>
    <P>One of the most important functions of the Act will be to make a survey of the existing library services.  We anticipate that the library council will appoint a number of surveyors&mdash;one, two or three, according to their wish <Col N="1402" /> and desire in the matter&mdash;and these surveyors will, we hope, go abroad first of all to countries where there are conditions similar to ours and get acquainted with all the new ideas they can about the running of a library service. Then they will come back and go through the country inspecting the library services and will make, as it were, a &ldquo;blue-print for progress&rdquo; for each local authority.  They will report to the library council, which will report to the Minister stating the position of the library service and the way in which it might be improved.</P>
    <P>It is not mandatory in any way on the local authority to adopt their report. The report will be purely of a stimulative kind, designed to interest the local authority in the question of libraries and general education in their area.  If the local authority desires to adopt the report or any part of it, they can do so and it will be open to them, if they desire, to make a contribution towards the cost.  It is possible already for local authorities to borrow money for the improvement of buildings.  It will be equally possible for them in the future to receive grants from the Minister for Finance towards the cost of improving this service.  I want particularly to mention the fact that it is not mandatory upon them, because the whole point about this Bill is that it should stimulate library activity and that the work of the council is advisory in character as far as local services are concerned and nobody is obliged to adopt any particular report.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties we have experienced in all improvements to local administration is that practically everything costs a great deal of money. Luckily, however, in this Bill there cannot be very much question of the cost to the ratepayers, since a very great improvement could be effected in the next ten years by a very small increase in rate contributions.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with particular sections of the Bill.  Section 2 establishes the council, the functions of which are to run the Central Library. Section 3 sets out the functions of the Central Library.  I have already dealt with Section 4, which is linked to Section 16 and enables the council to receive grants for the improvement of <Col N="1403" /> the local library service.  Sub-section (3) of Section 4 is intended to enable the council to continue its fruitful co-operation with the Hospitals' Trust library.  It is not intended that it should absorb the Hospitals' Trust library, but there has been a good deal of useful exchange of ideas between the two bodies.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned Section 5. It will be noticed that if a person ceases to be a member of a local authority he will cease to be a member of this council and a new person must be nominated from the body concerned. We provide for a representative from the corporation of a county borough, because there are few urban authorities which have a library service, and it was thought important to have the borough interests represented.  The purpose of Section 8 is to deem the council to be a local authority for the purposes set out in the Schedule, namely, the payment of remuneration, removal of officers and servants, their superannuation, travelling and subsistence, the auditing of accounts, local inquiries, removal of members and insurance.  The enactments set out in the Schedule are the various legal provisions relating to these matters so far as they would be applicable to a body of this sort.  The effect of this is to put the council on all fours with the local authority.  It makes it very easy for the Minister for Local Government of the day to deal with all matters of staff, appointments and conditions that are likely to arise.</P>
    <P>Section 9 enables the council to make by-laws for the conduct of the Central Library.  Section 10 transfers the staff now employed by the Carnegie Trust in the Central Library to the central authority and safeguards the rights of two pensionable officers.  It will be noted from sub-section (3) that the Carnegie Trust have agreed to contribute portion of the pensionable officers' pensions, just as if the Trust had been the local authority.  I have no comment to make on Sections 11 to 15, except to point out that Section 12, relating to insurance, does not conflict with No. 7 of the Schedule, which also relates to insurance.  I have already referred to Sections 16 and 17.  Of the <Col N="1404" /> remaining sections, only Section 19 calls for comment.  This repeals Section 89 of the Local Government Act, 1941, which enabled local authorities to contribute to the funds of the Central Library for Students.  In fact, no local authority did contribute, and now that the Central Library is being transferred to this new body, this provision becomes obsolete.</P>
    <P>In the course of the discussion in the Dáil, a number of points of interest were raised.  I should say here that we anticipate that the Central Library Council will have a moral obligation to assist the language movement as much as possible.  It will be possible for the members of the Central Library Council to consult societies interested in the Irish language, particularly those concerned in interesting young children in the language and everything possible will be done in that way, I am sure, by the Central Library Council.</P>
    <P>I wish to indicate once more that the powers of the Central Library Council are purely advisory.  I hope the Bill will receive favourable consideration from members of this House in the same way as it did in the Dáil and I hope Senators will agree with me that it provides, perhaps an inadequate but nevertheless a satisfactory, way of expanding opportunities for adult education in this country, an aspect of education which up to now has received too little consideration from us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary's wholly admirable speech on this Bill, it struck me that there is no correct appreciation very often in the country of how many topics there are upon which the two Houses of the Oireachtas do good work without any partisan or political discussion at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated upon his treatment of the case, to which he has evidently given thought and on which he has very sound views.  Those of us interested in libraries will welcome the Bill, in particular because it gives an opportunity of recognising the type of service that librarians and assistant librarians and assistants in libraries give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a foolish idea for quite a <Col N="1405" /> long time, and indeed even to some extent there is at the present moment, that a library assistant was a kind of messenger who found a book and handed it out to the borrower.  These ideas die hard and unfortunately a great many library assistants even to-day are paid on that basis, whereas in fact, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated, the librarian and his assistants need considerable general education to begin with and specialised education for their posts in the library. One might say that a good librarian, like a good teacher, needs to be very interested in his work and to have a vocation rather than a job.  We are indeed fortunate in that a great many of our librarians and of their staffs have that vocation.  It is very satisfactory that an opportunity has been afforded recently, and will continue, to give them the kind of salary to which their work entitles them.  If I understood the Parliamentary Secretary aright, that is to say, if our whole library service costs us only £90,000, I think we may say that it surely must be the best spent £90,000 in either central or local expenditure.</P>
    <P>The provisions with regard to the Central Library of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke will, I hope, not do anything to impair the immense work which that Central Library has been doing since its establishment for students, both for students who are actually attending a university or other course and for adults who desire to continue serious reading.  The library has been of immense benefit and has been splendidly and very helpfully run by its present head.  I am sure that nothing will happen under this Bill which will impair that greát value.  Perhaps it should be known that the library accommodation in this City of Dublin for students is extraordinarily bad.  I do not know if there is any capital city which has less actual physical accommodation for students by way of libraries than this city has.  There are 3,000 students, for example, in University College, Dublin, with absolutely miserable library accommodation.  The National Library, which is, of course, splendidly run and is very helpful to everybody, is so small that no accommodation can be found in it for undergraduates, <Col N="1406" /> so there is considerable scope for improvement in our library service.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the type of book which is read and said that the non-fiction varies from between 15 per cent. to 20 per cent.  Of course, it is difficult in classifying books to decide which is fiction and which is non-fiction.  A good deal of biography is fiction.  Mr. MacManus's book about the Taoiseach is largely fiction and there is a good deal of the written history of recent events in this country which should most certainly be classified as fiction and which ought to be so labelled before being put into the hands of young people.  But perhaps I would be asking the Parliamentary Secretary to accomplish miracles if I asked him to do that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to impede the progress of this Bill.  I entirely agree that education itself does not conclude when one leaves school or the university and that our facilities for adult education have been miserably poor.  The libraries are a place where that adult education could be continued, but I wonder whether this particular service should not be under the Department of Education rather than the Department of Local Government.  I do not wish to make any personal comparisons between the Minister for Education and the Minister for Local Government, or between the Parliamentary Secretary and anyone else.  Obviously, he himself has a very enlightened outlook on the whole matter.  It seems to me, however, that this library service would dovetail more suitably into vocational education and the lecture services, and that the Department of Education would be more likely to have a staff, or be able to recruit a staff, to deal with this type of work than the Department of Local Government.  If I am told that the matter of local rates arises, I think the answer is that that also arises with regard to vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Those schools are run by committees and have representation from local bodies, there is a Government contribution and also a contribution from the local rates; but the responsibility of <Col N="1407" /> providing the teachers and setting out their qualifications rests, not with the Minister for Local Government but with the Minister for Education.  These library services under the Department of Education would be able to combine with vocational schools not only in urban but in rural areas.  The lecture services of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke and which are such a desirable adjunct to a library service, would also get assistance, as I think he mentioned himself, from many of the teachers, not only national and secondary but also vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I remember that in 1922, as Minister for Education, one of the first notes that I received was from the Minister for Agriculture who, on the fourth day of his office said he had made the discovery that the following branches were under the Department of Agriculture&mdash;the National Library, the College of Science, the School of Art and various other bodies. I think he said, in his characteristic fashion, that anything I would sign with regard to these matters he would himself counter-sign for legal purposes. Subsequently, all those functions were transferred to the Department of Education&mdash;the National Library, the School of Art and so on.  It might be a better arrangement to have all the library services looked after by the Department of Education rather than by the Department of Local Government although I agree entirely that the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary is very sympathetic.  With these words of praise added to what has already been said in the other House I would like to conclude.  It is particularly gratifying that an attempt will be made to increase the number of books available, to increase the facilities in the Central Library and to raise the qualifications and increase the remuneration of librarians and their staffs in keeping with the great value they are to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>The importance of this Bill is so well recognised and its provisions so clearly presented by the Parliamentary Secretary both in this House and the other House that I do <Col N="1408" /> not think it necessary for me to say much about it as a university member except that I am very glad at its appearance and to read its contents. There are, however, a couple of things I would like to know a little more about.  The first is about the question of switching over from the Carnegie Trust.  We receive from this trust the Central Library as a gift.  It is a very valuable gift.  While we are warned in the proverb not to &ldquo;look a gift horse in the mouth&rdquo; I would like assurances that the gift horse will be properly housed and fed.  I presume that the £5,000 provided is for running costs but it is a really low figure.  As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out the expenses of maintaining a library are rising, the price of books is increasing and the output of books especially technical books, as I know to my misfortune, is increasing.  I think it will be necessary also to establish a micro-film department because so many works nowadays are contained in micro-film form and it will be necessary I think, to establish such a department for lending where necessary and it will have to be maintained.  For those reasons I should have thought that the sum of £5,000 per year is a low estimate of the cost.  Senator Hayes already pointed out the difficulties many of us experienced as students of getting accommodation in the libraries long ago.  I understand that our National Library is taking wings and moving across town.  I do not know whether there is a project for enlarging the Central Library when it is taken over by the State but it would be necessary to provide accommodation for students working with reference books on the premises as distinct from working at home.  There is another point I am puzzled about.  The Parliamentary Secretary stated, and I quote him:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been assured that when this Bill is passed and they cease finally to contribute to the Central Library (they, meaning the Carnegie Trust) that will not mean a diminution in the income to this country from that source.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very important.  The Carnegie Trust has done excellent work in maintaining this library and I hope that <Col N="1409" /> when we take it over their resources will be switched to something else. While they are going to step down their support of the library through the years I hope that this stepping down will mean a stepping up in other directions.  It is a very well-intentioned trust and I hope it does not mean the curtailing of their interest in this country.  There is another point, a technical one.  I think that in the constitution of this council consideration should be given to a member representing the Royal Irish Academy. It might be desirable for the reason that it is a very important and fine library and it is particularly interested in the provision of text books for students.  Lastly, a word of correction. In connection with Section 5, page 3, line 30, the reference to &ldquo;the Board of the University of Dublin&rdquo; should be to &ldquo;the Board of Trinity College&rdquo;, which is the governing body of the university.  I wish the venture every success and I hope it will provide me with some of the books that I have been unable to get owing to the freezing of dollars.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom a rá chomh mór agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil an Bille seo Ós ar gcómhair sa deireadh.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, freisin, chomh mór agus a thaitnigh óráid an Rúnaí Phárlaiminte liom tráthnóna agus an Bille seo á chur ós ar gcomhair aige. Ba bhreá an cuntas a thug sé dúinn ar scéim agus ar chuspóirí na Leabharlanna Poiblí sa tír agus ar an méid atá déanta ag na leabharlanna sin.</P>
      <P>Sé an rud is mó a thaitníonn liom an réiteach atá déanta sa mBille le Árd-Chomhairle a cheapadh le dul i mbun an Central Sudents' Library agus le comhairle agus treóir a thabhairt do lucht na leabharianna poiblí ar fud na tíre maidir le eagrú agus feabhsú a gcuid seirbhísí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí baint agam féin, ar feadh blianta, le Coiste Leabharlann Poiblí. Is cuimhin liom gurbh é ceann de na rudaí is mó a theastaigh uaim an uair sin Coiste Ceannais éigin a bheith ann a thiúradh comhairle dúinn ar nithe a bhain íenár gcuid oibre.  Admhaím gurb é an rud is mó a bhí ar intinn agam an uair sin go gceapfaí plean <Col N="1410" /> éigin leis na leabhra féin a cheannódh muid a thogadh.  Dá mhéid dar smaoiníos ar an gceist sin, theip glan orm aon tseift a cheapadh d'fheilfeadh do na cuspóirí a bhí ar intinn agam. Chítear dom go réitíonn alt a 5 den Bhille seo an deacracht sin.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil mé sásta amach is amach le alt a 5.  Níl fhios agam an gá an oiread sin teachtaí a bheith air ó na hOllscoltacha ná níl fhios agam ach an oiread an gá an oiread teachtaí a bheith air thar ceann an General Council of County Councils. Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh teachtaí ar an gCoiste thar ceann na múinteoirí náisiúnta, thar ceann na múinteoirí gairme beatha agus thar ceann na múinteoirí meán-oideachais.</P>
    <P>Ag an am céanna, tá mé sásta go bhfuil an cheist sin ar fad scrúdaithe ag an Rúnaí Párlaiminte agus go bhfuil cúis mhaith aige an Ard-Chomhairle a bheith ar an mbealach atá molta aige in alt a 5.</P>
    <P>Ní mheasaim gur pointe an-tábhachtach é gur ceart scéim na leabharlannaíochta poiblí a bheith go díreach faoin Roinn Oideachais.  Is dóigh liomsa gur cuma é.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a bhí mé im bhall de Choiste Leabharlann, bhí scéim againn le boscaí leabhra a chur timpeall go dtí na scoltacha. Na múinteoirí féin a mhol an saghas leabhar a bhí uatha agus is iad a thug na leabhra amach agus a bhailigh isteach arís iad.  Do réir mar thuigum, is rí-fhurasta comhoibriú a chur ar bun idir an leabharlanna agus na brainsí éagsúla oideachais faoin scéim agus faoin rialú atá ann. Brathann chuile shórt ar an leabharlannaí féin agus ar an dúil atá ag lucht an oideachais in obair na leabharlann.</P>
    <P>Is maith, creidim, atá an moladh tuillte ag na leabharlannaithe contae a thug an Rúnaí Párlaiminte doibh as ucht na hoibre atá déanta acu ar mhaithe le oideachas i gcoitinne. Thugas faoi deara, i gContae an Chláir go raibh trucail ghluaiste feistithe amach ag an leabharlannaí; bailiúchán deas leabhra ann, pictiúirí spéisiúla ar crochadh ann agus taispeántas de nithe a bhain le saoithiúlacht agus gnéithe na gceantar éagsúla.  In a lán den obair seo thaispeáin na leabharlannaithe go raibh &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; acu agus thaispeáineadar <Col N="1411" /> nach ar an gclog ná ar an airgead a bhíodar a smaoineadh.</P>
    <P>Déarfainn féin nach gá dóibh an oiread sin a dhéanamh feasta i gcás oideachais daoine fásta.  Is iomaí deis atá anois ann le obair den tsaghas sin a chur chun cinn.  Déanann na Coisti Gairm-Oideachais agus na Coistí Talmhaíochta a lán di; is iomaí sin cumann atá ann atá sásta léachtaí a sholáthar i gcomhair oideachais daoine fásta.</P>
    <P>Sé an rud ba mhaith liom, agus ba mhaith liom go n-iarrfadh an Rúnaí Párlaiminte féin orthu é, go gclaífeadh na leabharlannaithe le seifteanna a cheapadh d'fhreastalódh go speisialta ar na daoine óga.  Ní hé amháin go gcuirfidís na leabhra ar fáil ach is dóigh liom go bhféadfaidís a lán a dhéanamh le léachta agus siamsaí taitneamhacha a sholáthar agus cuidiú a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí agus lucht na Gaeilge i slite eile.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, ba bhaith liom a admháil go poiblí chomh mór agus támaid fá chomaoin ag lucht an Carnegie Trust as ucht a bhfuil déanta acu i gcúis na leabharlannaíochta poiblí agus ar mbuíochas a ghlacadh leo as ucht an Central Students' Library a bhronnadh ar an náisiún.  Ag an am céanna, ní beadh sé mí-thráthamhail in aon tslí, ar mbuíochas a ghlacadh le oifigigh an Central Library faoin obair agus an tseirbhís mhór atá gafa acu chucu le blianta i gcúis mac léinn na tíre.  Mar shean-mhac léinn a fuair go leor cabhrach uathu sna blianta atá caite ba mhaith liom an buíochas sin a chur in iúl dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is maith an Bille é seo agus guidhimid go léir an rath ar an mBille a bhfuil súil ag an Rúnaí Párlaiminte agus againn go léir leis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Since both of the preceding speakers happen to be university professors, perhaps it may be well if I as an ordinary business man, add a few words of support for this excellent Bill.  It was delightful to see the unanimity with which it was received in the Dáil.  It is apparent from the speeches which we have already heard, that its reception in this House is not going to be any less <Col N="1412" /> cordial.  I feel, with Senator Hayes, that the expenditure which will fall on the State as a result of the putting into operation of this Bill will produce better value per pound than any other moneys which the nation spends.  In regard to the expenditure of money under this Bill, I think we may look upon it as a sort of insurance for inculcating a sense of responsibility, and a desire for serious reading, amongst our citizens.  Serious reading is certainly a factor that will contribute very largely to the creation of a sense of responsibility amongst our citizens. From that point of view alone, I think that the Government would be justified in incurring far more expenditure than is envisaged.  It would be a pity, I think, now that the control of the libraries is going to be vested in the hands of Irish authorities if there was to be any unreasonable curtailment of expenditure on this service.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers that our libraries ought, first of all, to be properly housed.  They should also be properly staffed, and staffs should be properly paid.  If these three considerations are taken care of, then I feel that the expenditure on library education will be fruitful of great good for the nation.  I feel that it is not out of place to say that the Parliamentary Secretary has made a really excellent case for the Second Reading of this Bill and for its final passage through this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the remarks made by Senator Hayes regarding the desirability of having work of this nature under an educational authority rather than under the Department of Local Government. I have had a considerable amount of experience of the working of the Libraries Act locally, and an opportunity of noting several defects, defects that could easily, in my opinion, be corrected.  I see here a list of eight bodies which are to have the power of nominating a member of the new council. There is a very important body, a body of national dimensions, known as the Irish Vocational Education Association which has been in existence for about 40 years, and I note that, while municipal authorities and the various <Col N="1413" /> university colleges are all given the right to nominate, this particular body, to which I have referred and which in my opinion, is more representative than any of the bodies set out in the Bill, is not mentioned at all.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that is a weakness in this measure that ought to be corrected.  When he is replying, I should like to hear him say what is his view regarding that particular matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the local libraries' committees, a similar principle should, in my opinion, apply.  The county vocational education committee or the city vocational education committee, as the case may be, should really have the right to nominate some representative on the local library committee.  The county committee of agriculture should have a similar right.  These are extremely important bodies.  They administer very considerable sums of money. They are in direct touch with vast numbers of people who, in turn, are specially interested in education.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the young farmers' clubs which are springing up all over the country.  I think I am fairly correct in stating that the inspiration for the formation of these clubs has come from the county committees of agriculture and the county vocational education committees. Now, to my own knowledge, I know at least six of these clubs which have been formed in South Tipperary as the result of the work of the employees of the county vocational education committee.  These clubs require text books and help and therefore co-operation is, I suggest, very desirable as between the clubs and the county libraries committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We sometimes visualise wonderful things happening if provision is made for the representation of representative bodies.  A very important thing in that regard is the type of person who is nominated by these bodies.  As far as my observation goes, a sort of professional type of public representative is coming very much into the picture of late, and it does not seem to matter whether these representatives have any special knowledge or not, but they are dumped on to the county library committee <Col N="1414" /> or on to various other committees. That is a weakness in all these measures.  Theoretically, they are all perfect, but in their actual working there is, in my opinion, that great weakness, because no attention is given to the particular qualifications possessed by the persons representing these bodies.  I do not know how that matter can be dealt with.  I raise the issue now as one which, in my opinion, is of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon referred to the desirability of having films and so on provided.  That involves film units. Within the past couple of weeks the committee, of which I happen to be an employee, has been told by the central authority that their funds are not sufficient to allow them to purchase film units, and so this modern development in educational practice is not available for vast numbers of people. I have been connected with adult education for a considerable time.  We have given, and have arranged for, illustrated lectures on history and various technical subjects.  In fact, we do a considerable amount of work in the matter of adult education.  It is a pity, then, in my opinion, that finance is not sufficient to enable the committee, which has been more or less a pioneer in this work, to purchase one of these film units.  If the new body which is envisaged under this Bill&mdash;the Central Council&mdash;can do anything in that matter, it should certainly lead to a great advance.  If there was co-operation of that kind between the local and the central authority a considerable amount of overlapping could be avoided as well as economy in the expenditure of money.  The appliances that would suit one body could be circulated to other bodies.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I would like to mention.  I am glad that some other Senators have already drawn attention to it.  I refer to the salaries that are paid to librarians. I was appalled to discover some time ago, from a conversation that I had with one of our most active county librarians, that his total remuneration, including cost-of-living bonus, was only £300 per year.  He is a married man, and as I say, I was appalled when he <Col N="1415" /> told me that.  My own clerk is paid considerably more than that, and he is not a married man.  I believe that recently some attention has been given to this matter.  I have not the actual figures before me but, if the salaries of librarians have not been substantially improved, I suggest that this Bill affords an opportunity of doing something for them.  I believe that when the salaries for librarians were originally fixed the opinion seemed to be held that these positions would be filled by ladies, and because of that the salaries were considered good enough. But, as things have turned out, many men have been appointed as librarians, so that while their salaries were barely sufficient to enable them to live as single men they are not at all adequate for a married man.  I am sure that all members of the House will agree that, with the present cost of living, a married man cannot live on a total remuneration of £300 a year.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with other Senators in congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill which, I consider, is a very admirable one.  Before concluding, I would like to urge the desirability of having some form of co-operation between the various local educational bodies.  If they want to give any encouragement, say, to art work, to organising an art gallery, it is found that they cannot devote any portion of their funds to that purpose. They cannot buy a picture or do anything like that.  Any expenditure of that nature must be defrayed out of the rates, or out of moneys levied under the Libraries Act.  Therefore, the position is that while the primary factor or mover in local education is the local vocational education committee, they find that they have to apply to what is in a sense a subsidiary body, a comparatively minor body as far as finance is concerned, for the necessary contribution in that direction.  That all tends to emphasise the need there is for co-operation between the various local educational bodies as well as for representation for the standing council for technical education on the central body that is to be set up under this Bill.  I suggest, also, that while the county committees of agriculture are <Col N="1416" /> not linked up through the central body at present they do occasionally arrange general meetings for special purposes. I think they should be given the opportunity of nominating one representative on the council.  It would be in the interests of the country generally if that were done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a relief to find that, once in a while, when a Bill comes before this House it does not arouse the anger of the Opposition.  I gladly join with those in this House and in the other House who have been so loud in their praise of the Parliamentary Secretary for having introduced this Bill. I would go a bit further and say that he deserves to be congratulated not only on having introduced the Bill but for the work, enthusiasm and interest which, obviously, he has put into this measure.  We gathered all that from his opening statement.  Senator O'Reilly apparently finds fault with the system by which library committees are formed.  If I understood him correctly, he seemed to think that some method other than the existing method, should be devised when forming these committees, and that the wrong people were being sent forward by the local authorities as representatives on the library committees.  I am quite sure that the local authorities seriously consider who are the right people to put forward, and, if any other system were devised and embodied in the Bill, I am quite sure that one of the first people to object would be Senator O'Reilly.  I suppose we will always have people who will say: &ldquo;They are all out of step but our Johnny&rdquo; and once in a while we may find people who would be regarded as unsuitable, but generally I think the people put on these committees by local authorities are selected on the best lines, in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to join with those who support the Bill which I believe is a step in the right direction and which supplies a long-felt need.  Particularly at present, when prices of books have gone considerably higher than they used to be, it is desirable that libraries should be provided, in so far as it is possible to provide them, not alone in cities and provincial towns but in <Col N="1417" /> villages as well.  As I say, books of any consequence have become very expensive, and, in conjunction with a scheme of this kind, there should be a system of propaganda not only for the younger people but for the people of more mature years, designed to induce them to treat books as they deserve to be treated&mdash;not to turn down corners of pages or poke them out of their positions in the shelves in a way which will injure them.  Without ramming it down anybody's throat, some sort of polite propaganda should be devised and circulated to induce people to treat books as books deserve to be treated.</P>
    <P>I am glad also that we seem to be in general agreement with regard to the salaries of librarians.  The librarian in any community is a very important person who will have much more to do, as I think the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, than merely to take a book off the shelf when asked for it. His advice will be sought, and, I am sure, appreciated, by hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the year, and a man in that position should not be treated in an ungenerous manner in the matter of his salary.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's references to the proportion of non-fiction and fiction books read by the public.  He pointed out that the demand for non-fiction was, roughly, 15 per cent. to 20 per cent.  Senator Hayes came to the rescue and said it was very difficult to decide what was and what was not fiction.  By way of argument, he mentioned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Nobody will suggest that Senator Hayes could be accused of putting forward an argument when he had no argument against the Bill. By way of illustration&mdash;I stand corrected&mdash;he referred to <i>The Life of de Valera,</i> by MacManus, and, with his typical sarcasm, said: &ldquo;I suppose we shall have to regard that as fiction.&rdquo; The reason Senator Hayes would regard that as fiction is that, in his opinion, that book is biased in favour of de Valera.  Opinions would differ on that point, but, on the other hand, <Col N="1418" /> if we were to discuss <i>The Evolution of Sinn Fein,</i> by P.S. O'Hegarty, Senator Hayes would regard that as history of the most important kind.</P>

      <P>How does the Senator know?  The Senator should not quote me because I have made no declaration on that book.  I read that book before Senator Quirke read it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

      <P>I said that I supposed the Senator would regard that book as history of a most important kind.

      <P>I hope that they will look more to the future of the education of the people and give the people an unbiased opinion as to the books which they would regard as of interest to a local community.  It is interesting also to learn that the provision of books of local interest will be encouraged in these libraries.  I believe it is a great thing to encourage the reading of local history, to encourage the reading in any town of the history of that town, because the history of any town of any importance in the country is largely the history of the country itself.  A lot of good will be done by the provision of such reading material for the younger people and I am glad to join with those in this House and the other House who have welcomed this Bill.</P>

Is eol dom gur tuigeadh, an chéad uair nuair a tógadh na hallaí sin, go dtiocfadh an lá, agus an nós, nuair a bheadh léachtaí agus teagasc don phobal i gcúrsaí litríochta, agus ealaíon agus cultúra, agus intleachta, á dtabhairt iontu, agus níor mhiste dá mbeadh sé in aigne an Rúnaí Phárlaiminte go bhféadfaí feidhm a bhaint as na hallaí sin, d'obair den tsaghas sin.

Ach measaimse gur seirbhís í seo ba chóra a bheith faoin Roinn Oideachais nó dá mbeadh sé ann, faoi Aire Cultúra Pobail.  Is ag á leithéid sin ba chóir seirbhís den tsaghas seo a bheith, agus ba bhonn tosaigh ag Aireacht Chultúra gléas na leabharlann chun obair den tsaghas seo.  Ach, in iongnais Aireacht Cultúra measaim gur chóir go mbeadh seirbhís leabharlann agus leabhar faoi chúram na Roinne Oideachais.  Is dúchasaí dó sin é pé scéal é.</P>

Níl éinne ann ó na léitheoirí ná ó na scríbhneoirí, nó ó na daoine a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint acu le soláthar leabhar agus na gnóthaí a tháirgeann leabhair. Is trua ná féadfaí slí éigin a bheith ann go mbeadh a dtuairim sin le fáil ag an gComhairle nuair a bheadh seirbhís don phobal á chruthú agus á chur ar fáil.  I bhfo-alt (4) d'alt 5, tá sé ráite aon duine bheas ainmnithe ag ComhChomhairle na gComhairlí Contae go geaithfidh an duine sin bheith ina bhall de Chomhairle Chontae.</P>

Tá seachaint ann arís, ar ndóigh, ar aon duine d'fhéadfadh labhairt ar son, abair, léitheoirí, nó ar son scríbhneoirí, ná ar son foilsitheoirí féin.  Níl éinne ann go bhféadfaí a rá go raibh údarás aige ón ngnáth-phobal a bheidh ag dul isteach a tógaint leabhar agus a bheidh ag braith ar an tseirbhís sin atá chómh tábhachtach sin anois dá ngnath-saol.</P>

Is rud le moladh é ach ba mhaith liom go dtuigfimis go soiléir nach é an Carnegie Central Library a bheas ann a thuilleadh, ach eagras a mbeidh leabharlanna agus cumhacht agus tionchur aige ar sheirbhís leabhar ar fuaid na tíre go léir.</P>

      <P>At any other time it would probably be desirable for the House to spend a good deal of time in debating a Bill on which there is substantial agreement but on which there are many interesting points that could be made.  Having looked at the agenda and realising that if we spend the same amount of time on all the Bills we will not possibly have them finished by Christmas, I propose to content myself with expressing approval of the Bill and my appreciation of the way in which it was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I cannot resist the temptation&mdash;it occurs so seldom&mdash;<Col N="1423" /> of expressing my agreement with the speech made by Senator Quirke, particularly when he is in favour of nice, polite propaganda.  I think it is the most excellent kind of propaganda and, just at the moment, to have it advocated from that quarter deserves a little publicity. But, when he suggested that he was in favour of penicillin injections, presumably to his political opponents, I assume he has never had one.  He would not wish them to his worst political enemy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with the object aimed at in the Bill.  Two things will matter for the success of the object aimed at here&mdash; finance and the committee.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why it is that there should be at least five representatives of the universities and no representative whatever of the people who require the libraries more than any other section of the community. It has been mentioned here already that the cost of books is prohibitive and has made it impossible for the children of the working class people to purchase books.  Consequently, they have to rely on the libraries.  Why has the national teachers' organisation not been given representation on this management committee?  I think it is class legislation.  There are five representatives of the universities on a committee of 12 and there is no one who would be directly representing the masses of the people, the working class.  Is it too late to suggest an amendment to give representation to these people on the committee?</P>
      <P>Naturally the national school teachers are more in touch with the masses of the people than are the representatives of the universities, and have a more intimate knowledge of their requirements.  There is no doubt whatever as to whether it is working-class people or the people who can afford a university education who are in the greater need of the library service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that this matter requires attention.  It is out of all proportion to have the universities represented by five persons on a committee of 12 and no representation whatever of the <Col N="1424" /> national school teachers, or the people dealing with national schools.  I would like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary thinks about that. He has already said that he has given a lot of attention and consideration to this Bill.  If so, how does it come that he overlooked this very important section of the community?</P>
    <P>In regard to the salaries and other matters already discussed here, I am in general agreement, but I do think that this is a glaring mistake in the setting up of the committee and I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give further attention to that aspect of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that when we do get unanimity in the House on a measure, Senator Quirke should not accept it in such a very sour and grudging spirit.  He really did not approach the matter in a friendly, open-hearted way.  I do not say we would expect, but we would like him to do so.  I was very much interested in one aspect of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, that is, where he suggested that this was an attempt to make the library an educational centre&mdash;the germ, rather, of a local educational centre.  I mean education in its widest sense, not merely from the point of view of lending books, but in the spirit of the C.E.M.A.R.&mdash;the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts&mdash;that all local cultural activities should centre around the Library Committee, so that if, say, some voluntary body wanted to show pictures in a local town or village, they would have the co-operation of the local librarian.  The only thing to be careful about in pursuing that idea is that the regulations governing libraries should be as elastic as possible. They should not become merely a centre for the borrowing of books but should be a centre for intellectual encouragement and in due course of time one might even hope for an increase in the number of those seeking adult education.  To my mind the salvation of democracy lies in adult education.  I do not like the term &ldquo;classes&rdquo; as Senator Foran uses it, since I regard myself as a worker.  I am classed, I hope, as a <Col N="1425" /> worker, and the term &ldquo;working class&rdquo; has a significance which I think we should try to get away from.  We should all be co-operating.  Some of us are more fortunately situated than others, but in these days nearly everybody is a worker in some form or another.  I hope that in any regulations the Minister makes he will allow the utmost elasticity in the library work and will not tie them up too much in a Civil Service or rigid way. I welcome this Bill very much indeed and hope it may gradually grow into the library becoming a centre of cultural interest in country districts.</P>

      <P>With the hope expressed by Senator Sir John Keane in his concluding remarks I heartily join. There are great possibilities in the development of the library service and we feel that it is in safe hands.  For my own part, I am very glad that the Parliamentary Secretary is in charge of the scheme.  He has got so much praise that a note of criticism or warning may not seem ungrateful.  A great part of the success of the scheme will depend on the personnel of the central council, An Comhairle Leabharlanna. The first thing that struck me when I read the various sections was that it was very strange to find that there was no mention of the national teachers.  Their advice on such a council would be most useful, in fact, it is absolutely necessary that they should be on it.  The pattern of the council in the Minister's mind seems to have been five representatives of the universities and six of the local authorities, one of whom would be interested in books to the extent that he would be a member of an association for the advancement of public libraries in the State.  However, the only thing we have to rely on as an assurance that those on the council will know something about libraries and the technique of libraries is the mention that one of the nominees is to be that of the Council of Trustees of the National Library of Ireland.  People who have given earnest of their interest in libraries and who will realise the responsibilities of this council should be insisted upon. When the Minister is making his appointments, <Col N="1426" /> he should insist on people who know something about libraries being nominated.  As the section reads, it looks as if he would have to appoint one on the nomination of the governing body of University College, Dublin, etc., and that, therefore, they would have the choice.</P>
      <P>We know a good deal about governing bodies of universities and I do not know that they would be the very best people to select representatives who would have a good knowledge of library technique or, what is more, that they would have high aims for the council in the direction of libraries in this country, to make this scheme what the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have in mind, to make this movement one to spread adult education and right centres of culture.  That is one of the things I am in doubt about, that is, the constitution of the council.  The Minister must keep in mind that, if the Bill is to be a success and if the aims are to be accomplished, it largely depends on the personnel of the council.</P>
      <P>Another thing I am rather worried about is the finances.  The central council does not seem to be very adequately financed and if they are to pay for the surveyors I think it will cost more than this £2,500 in Government contribution plus the balance to come from the Carnegie Trust Fund.  These are things which made me pause, but in respect of everything else I join with those who have praised the Parliamentary Secretary for the spirit in which he has entered on the task imposed on him and I hope that what he has in mind may conduce to the glory of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the members of the House for the friendly way they have received the Bill and I am very glad that there appears to be no fundamental objection to its provisions.  We have had a good many observations by different Senators on the constitution of the council and I must be frank and say that, in examining this matter, both the Minister and myself had great difficulty.  We ourselves thought of at least 25 different bodies which should be represented on the academic <Col N="1427" /> side of the council and if we chose even half of those and then equalised the local authority element with those 12, we would have too large a council.  We also had to consider the two functions of the council.</P>
      <P>First, it has to administer the Central Library, which requires considerable academic knowledge and close contact with university life, since the books that are sent to students all over Ireland are of a highly complex technical nature.  Then we had to consider the other aspect of the work of the council, namely, that of improving local authority libraries.  We considered all the aspects of the case.</P>
      <P>Regarding the suggestion that representatives of vocational teachers should be placed upon the council, we considered the question of teachers and, in fact, I think every group that has been mentioned here as one which should have the right to nominate to the council.  We came to the conclusion that the best thing we could do would be to constitute the council in the manner indicated in the Bill and hope that universities will have a high sense of their responsibility&mdash;which I think they will&mdash;in nominating their representatives.  I hope that those interested in library work in universities will read the debate in this House today and will appreciate the feelings of members here that the persons appointed should understand library work and should also have had constant contact with ordinary people in the country.  For example, it would be possible for the university to nominate a teacher, one of the teachers on the governing body of the university.  We hope that universities will nominate people who are interested in labraries. No matter what combination we could create of representatives of different groups, we always ended up with the one indicated in the Bill as being the best under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Hayes' observations, he suggested that the Department of Education might be more suitable as the Department in charge of the Central Library Council. The Minister and I felt that we should <Col N="1428" /> interest local authorities to the maximum in library work and we did not wish to disturb the current interchange of ideas as between the Department over which the Minister has control, the General Council of County Councils or any of the other people concerned with library work.  We felt that library activities are only in the initial stages and, as Senator Sir John Keane said, would grow to be much more important, and we wished local authorities to have the fullest possible connection with them for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon spoke of the rising cost, especially of specialists' books.  It is possible for the Central Library Council under the Bill to increase the annual expenditure, and it would be possible for them, after due consideration, to add to the present library stocks or to have regard to the increased cost of books when they make their annual appropriation therefor.  The chairman of the Library Council is appointed by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Education.  In that way the Minister for Education will take an interest in the Library Council.  The council will have power to buy or lease property, to extend buildings, can purchase new buildings, or build new ones under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Carnegie Trust took the initiative in asking us to take over the Central Library for Students, in accordance with their general tradition, and they are anxious to devote their funds for that purpose in this country. As a matter of fact I helped in an indirect way to interest them in Young Farmers' Clubs, and I think they are about to make, or have already given a contribution for the central organisation of the Young Farmers' Clubs.</P>
    <P>The House will be interested to know that when members of the Carnegie Trust were over here looking for ways and means of improving amateur musical societies, a difficulty they found was that these amateur musical societies in Ireland were not organised as a whole.  They wished to show their interest in education and in culture, by trying to find some way by which they <Col N="1429" /> could give money to amateur societies to assist them to develop, if there was in existence a body sufficiently responsible financially.  Members of the Carnegie Trust are most interested to maintain the total level of their contribution to Irish culture and to the development of Irish life, and the fact that they are ceasing gradually control of the Central Library in no way diminishes their interest in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla spoke of the vital necessity of supplying children with books.  I agree with him.  We hope that the Central Library Council will have an ideal plan for children's libraries in every county, so that even before the surveyors have done their work and reported to the council, some local authorities who wish to have children's libraries will be able to get really good advice as to the best way of providing them, how such books could be obtained, the books that children like reading, and whether it would be possible for such authorities to have children's reading rooms in any of their towns.</P>
    <P>Senator P.J. O'Reilly referred to the low salaries of the librarians.  As I indicated, these will be increased very largely in certain areas.  The present scale is from £450 to £550 yearly.  One of the things the Central Library Council can do, if they consider it desirable, is to recommend alterations in the qualifications of librarians, and also in their salaries. They can make these recommendations to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha referred to the contribution of local authorities to the Central Library Council.  These contributions will be very small for the first five years, as the Carnegie Trust contributions pay in the initial stages. At the end of five years, unless the Central Library is expanded by agreement with the local authorities represented on it, and they choose to increase their contributions largely, they will be from £20 to £70 in local county council areas, and about £400 in the case of the Dublin libraries.  Such contributions will not worry the rate committees on local authorities I imagine. <Col N="1430" /> I wish to make it quite clear in reply to Senator Ó Siochfhradha that members of the Central Library Council will have considerable moral influence over local authorities but the council has no mandatory powers.  There are one or two local authorities whose library services are very primitive indeed. There is no question, that when the surveyors go in a friendly way to a library committee their interest will be to prepare a blue print and when that is sent to the local authority I feel that they will have no need to be ashamed of their position.  As I indicated these authorities had many other pressing matters to attend to.  This is a highly technical question and they can adopt or amend plans as they wish, according to the amount of money they can extract from the Minister for Finance and the amount they can get from local rates.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran referred to the position of the teachers and of having them represented on the council.  Senator Sir John Keane also suggested that the librarians should work under a very flexible system.  Under the present Act of Parliament libraries are able to undertake library extension work. Speaking purely personally I would like to see that done without recourse to the Government.  I am not nearly satisfied with the limited scope that they have. I frankly feel that if our citizens are to make a stand in the world in which we live, village universities are absolutely necessary in the country within the next 20 to 30 years.  With village universities these libraries will have great work to perform and will be able to do extension work.  I speak purely personally in that regard.  I feel that to be one of the most important features of education in this country, whenever we can find the money and other means.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon expressed a hope that the right people would be nominated on the library council.  I quite agree.  I think a matter of great importance would be the character of the surveyors.  They would have to be men of high educational qualifications and, above all, people who have the right touch, people who understand the <Col N="1431" /> work of local authorities, know all about the working of libraries, people who are sympathetic and able to make suggestions in a way which would make them acceptable.  It would make all the difference in the world between slamming a blue print on the table of a local authority, with suggestions for trebling the library rate, and for all sorts of library extension work, and doing so in a way which would create enthusiasm.  Surveyors with considerable personality will be needed.  I wish to thank the members of the Seanad for the sympathetic way in which they received this measure.</P>

      <P>So far as Section 16 is concerned, the Minister for Finance envisages in the future the desirability of making a contribution to local authorities when they adopt a scheme recommended by the Library Council. When the Minister for Finance grants the council these moneys it will be the duty of the councils to see that they are properly spent by the local authorities, and to report back to the Minister for Finance that such was the case.  It is very difficult for me to say anything about the effect of Section 16 until we know the extent of the problem.  It would be quite impossible for me or a future Minister for Finance to say what attitude will be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will have to study the report of the Library Council, and have regard to the increased rate that would take place if no contribution were made by the Minister for Finance.  He will have to say how he could support the council from the Central Fund.  The council would have to send the money to local authorities which the surveyors would have to ensure was properly spent.  My own belief is that if county councils desire to build libraries, or to extend libraries, they will have to borrow money for that purpose. <Col N="1432" /> It would not involve such a large annual charge on the Central Fund.</P>

Otherwise they pay the full contribution to the Central Library next year, 20 per cent less in succeeding years, and for two years afterwards they make gifts of the sum required to pay the surveyors, which is an additional gift given by them for library work.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1939 members of local authorities had a very close relationship with the electors they represented.  One of the principal objects of this Bill is to restore the position in that each representative of a local authority may have a responsibility for checking and improving the administration of the local services over the area of which he has the most full and intimate knowledge.  It has been said that what is everybody's business becomes nobody's business and that principle has had a very great application to local affairs.  The Bill is designed to impose upon members of local councils a personal obligation on each individual.  This personal responsibility ended when multi-member areas were formed to conform with proportional representation principles to the maximum degree.  Proportional representation, as Senators are aware, is a theory of democratic government which may have various phases.  It may result in the election of a great number of small minority Parties in any particular assembly or it may result in the representation by one person in a local area who himself is a person believed to be best liked by the majority of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two consequences have flown from <Col N="1435" /> the changes taking place consequent upon the decision of the authorities at a later stage to make local authority elections conform with Parliamentary elections.  There is no one individual to whom a ratepayer can go with his grievance or say to himself: &ldquo;This man is the representative of my district and is responsible for bringing my grievances to the local authority, and is responsible for speaking at meetings of the county council and giving his views as to the lack of efficiency in regard to the administration of any particular feature of local government.  This man is responsible for seeing that different features of administration are properly looked after and administered.&rdquo;  This applies to questions like dispensaries, their repairs, conditions of roads, sanitary or public health services, pumps, refuse, and so on.  The area for which a local authority member now acts is far too large.  It amounts in some cases to the whole pre-1921 Parliamentary constituencies.  These local representatives are not paid.  They have to perform their services free.  They are given travelling and subsistence allowances, but that is all.  They have their own business to attend to and it is felt that it would be most desirable to increase their personal interest in the administration of the area which they represent by reducing that area.  Proportional representation was extended to the local authorities to the maximum degree to enable what might be described as the embittered minority in the State to have some representation during the early stages of the foundation of the State; so that these people who did not accept the new status of the country would be represented on local authorities.  These people, I am very glad to say, have largely merged with the remainder of the population and there is no reason to maintain the present system on these grounds alone. No man in the State, no matter what his creed or class, is debarred from public life if his talents and eagerness are in that direction.</P>
    <P>The combination of proportional representation in Parliament and single-member constituencies in the local authorities should in our opinion be <Col N="1436" /> effected and should, above all, restore the individual personal responsibility of the representatives of the local authorities.  The managerial system confers executive powers on one man, very large executive powers and we think that is a good experiment.  We think it may perhaps be necessary to amend the County Management Act in the light of experience.  But, obviously, if representatives are to be alert and vigorous, if they are to make use of their powers to check the manager's activities, his efficiency and his fairness, they should be able to do this continuously over a particular area.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House of the difference there is between the Parliament of the country and the local authorities.  For the purpose of the argument, I would remind them that Dáil Eireann is the sovereign Assembly of the country.  It has power to make laws within the Constitution, it has power to direct the activities of local authorities and to give them additional functions, to enforce their undertaking new responsibities and Parliament may direct a contribution to them in aid of local services.  The local authorities, on the contrary, are delegated bodies subordinate to Parliament.  It is their duty to administer the law and not to make it.  They have no responsibility for legislation.  Even the by-laws which they enact must be <i>intra-vires</i>, that is within the law as framed by Parliament.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the granting of subventions from central funds to local authorities necessitates, and always will, a suitable degree of Ministerial inspection and supervision. Local authorities have sometimes willingly, and at other times unwillingly, accepted the dictate of the Minister of the day, fortified by an Act of Parliament, to ensure that there shall be a universal minimum standard of service in respect of each aspect of administration over which they have control. Equally, local authorities have been obliged for many years to ensure stability for their finances by the supervision of the Minister, again fortified by an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, think that it is necessary for each representative to be fully <Col N="1437" /> responsible for the area which he represents. We wish to avoid the confusion and the overlapping of responsibilities which, we think, is now occurring. Our experience has been that, in the large electoral areas, some of which are from 50 to 60 miles long and from ten to 12 miles wide, the representation, instead of being widely distributed, tends to be concentrated in the more densely populated areas.  We consider that the rural areas are under-represented on the county councils, and that the concentration of representatives from urban areas is highly inequitable.  The main revenues of each county council come from the rural areas.  The contribution of individual boroughs or of urban district councils within the county councils is not so considerable.  The areas representing the main spending sources are, on the whole, under-represented.  We made some calculations and found that one-fifth of the persons elected on county councils reside in urban districts, while on the valuation of the urban districts as compared to the valuation of the whole country, the contribution of the urban districts to county charges was less than one-tenth of the total.  I think the House will agree that there is something inequitable in this state of affairs.  We consider that it is an anomaly that must be corrected.  If the electorate use their preferences intelligently in the single-member areas now proposed, the results should be satisfactory, and the most popular man and the best man should be elected.</P>
    <P>We have had demands from all sides for the encouragement of parish councils.  Under the 1941 Act, the parish councils were given some status.  The new electoral areas will be approximately the size of a parish, and so the effect should be that the electors in those areas will take a greater and a more lively interest in local administration. It seems to me to be completely logical that if, on the one hand, one enlarges the functional area of a local authority administration, if one enormously increases the number of specialist functions undertaken by a local authority, we should at the same time, ensure that each representative on the local authority will have a small <Col N="1438" /> area to represent, and, will, therefore, be more easily able to examine the functioning and the administration in regard to all these multifarious services. I think I am right in saying that no less than 33 new functions have been added to local authority administration since 1933.  In contrast, in the case of the Dáil men of wide experience are required.  While these men represent particular areas such as the Galway Gaeltacht, they will be acquainted with widely different parts of the country, in order that they may pass judgment on legislation in regard to a great number of different subjects.</P>
    <P>I have given the House some outline of the purpose of the Bill.  I shall now give a description of the various sections.  Section 2 contains the two main provisions of the Bill.  The first is that there will be single-member electoral areas in the counties, and secondly, that the urban areas will be separately represented on the county council on the basis of the county charges on the area.  The single member area will be very small in comparison with the huge areas which now return councillors.  For example, Donegal and Galway are each divided into five areas.  Effective representation is, we claim, not possible under such conditions.</P>
    <P>As regards the urban areas, taking the 1945 elections in the counties which included borough and urban areas and in which the elections were contested, of the 540 candidates elected, 184 came from the urban areas. That is about one-third, but the valuation of those counties was some £7,857,000, and of the urban areas £708,000&mdash;about one-eleventh of the total counties valuation.</P>
    <P>I have given now a measure of the distortion in the representation.  No remedy that proportional representation can supply will cure this state of affairs.  The solution is to be found in this particular section.  In the case of the rural part it is not intended that population will be the basis for apportioning the representation.  That is all right for large areas.  The local government electorate will be taken, as it is the ordinarily resident population, and a more true measure, but regard <Col N="1439" /> will also be had to the sparsity of population and the general character of the areas.  A rigid rule can produce anomalies.  Take the County Mayo as an example.  You have areas there where the population is sparse indeed, and other areas where you have a congested population.  It would be desirable, therefore, to give a little bit more weight in representation to the sparsely populated areas, so that a county councillor, on the basis of this Bill, will be able to understand the administration in his area and give the best possible service to the people who elected him.  The urban areas will be divided into three-member areas. There the total area is smaller and the population more congested, but there also the representative character of the council must be preserved over the whole area.</P>
    <P>The principles to be followed in framing the Orders dividing a county into local electoral areas are set out in sub-section (3) of Section 2.  Briefly, they provide that in the case of purely rural areas, due regard is to be had to the number of local government electors registered, the rateable valuation, the density of population and the general character of such areas.  So far as county electoral areas which are constituted within boroughs or urban districts are concerned, paragraph (ii) of the sub-section provides that where the average amount of the county charges charged upon the urban area in respect of the three years which preceded the year in which the Order is made, justifies it, the urban area shall be constituted as one, or, if the financial position justifies it, more than one electoral area.  That is a fairly simple proposition applied to some of the very large towns.</P>
    <P>As things are, this will only apply to a certain number of boroughs and urban districts.  If, however, the average amount charged upon an urban district would not justify the creation of a special urban electoral area or areas, but is at least half the amount which would justify it, the urban area may be divided into two or more parts, and each part shall be amalgamated with a contiguous non-urban area to <Col N="1440" /> form an electoral area, the county charges upon which would have approximated to the average of the county charges upon the purely rural electoral areas.  This will apply to many of the urban districts and will afford a larger representation to these areas than could be given by the application of the first rule.</P>
    <P>In other words, in an urban area, if the proportion of the county charges is not large enough for it to elect one representative by itself, it will be divided into two and each of the areas will include a rural area, and the representative from that area will have to have both a rural and an urban bias in his attitude towards the local authority's expenditure.  It provides an intermediate compromise between the position of the very large towns that will have their own representatives and the towns of medium size where this difficulty of apportioning the number of representatives in proportion to the county charges arises.</P>
    <P>Where the average of the amounts charged on an urban district is less than half the average charges in the same period upon the average rural electoral area the urban district will not be divided, but will be merged with the surrounding rural area to constitute an electoral district, the average county charge upon which would have approximated to that upon the rural electoral area.  That applies to the very small towns.  They will have no separate representation.  They will appear as part of a rural electoral area and in some cases the representative will have to have an overwhelmingly urban bias as compared with a rural bias in dealing with local affairs.</P>
    <P>I have given a very detailed description of one of the most important sections of the Bill and I now proceed to the others.  It has been the universally-demanded practice to postpone the local elections when they are due to take place in the year of a general election.  The Minister proposes to conform with this precedent and Section 4 provides that the next local elections will be held in 1950.  The last elections were held in 1945, a five-years period, and subsequent elections will be held on every fifth year thereafter. <Col N="1441" /> That suggestion, I think, was generally agreed to in Dáil Éireann.  It may happen that, at some future time, there may be good reasons why these elections should be held in the fourth or sixth year on a particular occasion. It is therefore proposed to give the Minister for Local Government some discretion in either bringing forward or postponing the date of the local elections; but if the Minister desires to do this, he must make an Order to that effect at least nine months previous to the elections and obtain the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas for it, so that members will see that the Minister is very definitely obliged to take account of the views of the Oireachtas in making that decision.  In order the more effectively to avoid having to hold the local elections within a too brief period following a general election, it is provided in Section 4 (4) that if Dáil Éireann is dissolved within nine months before the local elections are due to be held, the Minister may postpone the elections for one year.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines the qualification for membership of a local authority.  In the case of a county council, a candidate must be a local government elector for the particular local electoral area for which he is nominated.  In the case of any other local authority, he must be a local government elector for the functional area of the local authority. Section 6 indicates the method of election and gives the voters a transferable vote.  With such a vote, the elector can indicate the order of his choice for the candidates and his vote can be transferred to a subsequent preference in the usual way, if it is not required for the first choice who may have been elected or eliminated. Section 7 declares that a candidate who is accredited with a number of votes equal to, or greater than, the quota is elected.  The quota is defined in Section 1.  It is ascertained by dividing the total valid votes by the number of vacancies, plus one, and adding one. The quota is the lowest number that may elect a candidate.  Senators are already aware of these provisions.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it is now, two irresponsible electors can nominate an irresponsible candidate at no cost to <Col N="1442" /> themselves and the returning officer has no recourse but to accept their nomination.  We consider that it is quite wrong that the ratepayers should be involved in such expense and we propose, therefore, in future that candidates for election shall deposit the sum of £10 with the returning officer.  This deposit is returnable to him, unless the candidate fails to get one-fifth of the quota, in which case it is forfeitable and remains with the local authority.  I do not think that members will consider this to be an onerous condition. In a single member area, where there are 500 votes cast, if a candidate cannot get 51 votes, he could scarcely be regarded as a person likely to succeed or as a candidate of a serious kind.  It is generally clear that candidates at local elections, with extremely few exceptions, get votes sufficient to justify their candidature, so that this provision will not operate as a bar or deterrent to any <i>bona fide</i> candidate.</P>
    <P>Section 9 consolidates the existing law in regard to filling casual vacancies and I should say in this connection that this Bill effects a good deal of consolidation. Section 10 is consequential on Section 2.  An amendment was passed on Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann, providing for the election of aldermen which was found satisfactory to members of the Dáil who felt that aldermen with long experience who happened to be independent would not be elected under Party influence by the borough concerned.  In the Bill, as amended, persons receiving the highest votes in each area will be automatically elected aldermen.</P>
    <P>Section 11 merely provides that existing members will continue in office for their current term.</P>
    <P>Section 12 requires some study.  I have already mentioned that Section 4 of the Bill provides that no elections for local authorities will be held in 1948 or 1949.  Section 12 makes an exception to this.  It is desirable that where the members of a local authority have been removed from office at the passing of the Act&mdash;in fact, the section applies at the moment to Counties Dublin and Kerry&mdash;these councils should be reconstituted <Col N="1443" /> as soon as possible.  The commissioners are engaged in overhauling the administration, improving it in every way, and the Minister hopes that the election will be held, in Kerry in any event, next year or, if not, in 1949. In Dublin, a different problem arises. Reorganisation is more far-reaching. It involves the complete reorganisation on a new basis and under a new authority of the health services and also the social welfare services, and also involves readjustment of the relationship between the county and the county borough in respect of the ordinary county services.  The Minister, however, is hopeful that all this will be done in time to permit the new local authority to be reconstituted in 1949.</P>
    <P>Members will realise that if an election is held in 1948 or 1949 there would be no point in holding another one in 1950.  On the other hand, to wait until 1955 would be undesirable. It might give a period of office of six or seven years to an entirely new body. So, it is felt desirable to give the Minister power to direct that another election shall be held for either or both of these county councils in any of the years between 1950 and 1955 and thereafter there will be an election in 1955.  The Minister has discretion in this matter.</P>
    <P>Sections 13, 14, 15 and 18 make adaptations in the Vocational Education Acts, the Agriculture Act, the Public Assistance Act, and the Harbours Act which are consequential on the alteration of the triennial sequence of local elections.  Bodies which have to be elected arising from these Acts will now be elected every five instead of every three years, and there is also the question of the creation of single-member areas for electing county councillors.</P>
    <P>Section 16 is another more complicated section and amends the Local Government Act, 1941, to bring that Act into conformity with this Bill and extends by not more than six months the time within which an election must be held to a local authority, the members of which have been removed from <Col N="1444" /> office.  We have had a case in County Dublin and in County Kerry but, in future, if members should be removed from office&mdash;I hope this will not be necessary&mdash;we have to make provision for new elections.  The rule will be that a new election must be held after three years but if the following year is a year in which elections under this Bill are to be held, the new election may be held in that year also.</P>
    <P>In other words, in the ordinary way, in the case of authorities that have been removed and replaced by commissioners, an election must take place within three years but, if there happens to be a local government election before then, the election can take place in that year.  This will enable the regular sequence of local elections to be preserved.  The same observations apply to the elections for the Boards of Assistance of Balrothery, Rathdown and Dublin, to be held in the year 1948.  In that year, but for this Bill, there would have been an election to Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation and the boards would have been elected at the first meeting after the election.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that these elections will be held in the year in which an election of members to Dublin County Council is held under Section 12 or Section 4.  If the year is not 1950 it will be necessary for the Dublin Corporation to elect their members on the joint board at a meeting within one month of the day of election of the county councils and the members will come into office on the day on which the election is completed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 makes a general adaptation of the term &ldquo;triennial election&rdquo;, which is necessary by reason of the provisions of this Bill and any particular adaptation or modification may be made by Order.  In order words, where the holding of local elections every three years affects legislation of any kind, the period is now five years and there will have to be adaptation. This is a consequential provision to provide the adaptation necessary under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There have also been two small amendments in the Dáil making clear <Col N="1445" /> the position of urban councils within an area where a local authority has been removed from office&mdash;in other words, the urban councils of County Kerry and Dun Laoghaire.  It is provided that whether or not the elections of the bodies took place within this five year period or as indicated in the section dealing with them, the election for these urban bodies will take place regularly and in sequence with all the other local elections for the country.</P>
    <P>I trust the members of the House fully understand the implications of the Bill.  There was a certain amount of criticism in the Dáil in regard to various features of it but, as far as I can see, there were very few members of the House who commented on the principal purpose of the Bill, an interesting change, namely, that of giving an opportunity for one man to represent an area.  We do not feel that it is necessary to apply the principle of proportional representation at its maximum to the election of local authorities because they are delegated bodies, because, while they have considerable initiative to see that money is spent wisely and well to improve their services, they are largely administrative bodies carrying out the law, and we feel, for that reason, that it is most essential to restore the personal contact between each representative and his area.</P>
    <P>I recall, myself, for a period of time when I was representing County Roscommon there was an area there where, because of the distances between the residence of the county councillor and those who elected him, I found myself unconsciously doing a great deal of local authority work which I should not do, and I know that under the present system in widely separated areas, a number of members of the Dáil find the same thing.  They find themselves receiving representations at a place 50 miles from where the county councillor lives.  They either deal with the matter direct or simply send the person concerned to the county manager or write a letter to the county secretary, saying: &ldquo;Will you attend to this?&rdquo; It is most undesirable and proof of the need for a change in the law and I recommend this change to the House with every enthusiasm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I do not know what the Parliamentary Secretary has to be enthusiastic about in this Bill.  I do not know what its purpose is at all.  The end of a session like this is entirely the wrong time to introduce such a measure.  It surely is not the purpose to improve local government. That is not the fact because it is not going to do it.  There must be other reasons for the introduction of this measure, so obscure to some of us that we cannot see the purpose of it but I am satisfied from my experience as a member of a local authority that, instead of being a help, it will be a further hindrance to efficient local government. The whole idea, apparently, as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned, is to bring the elected representative into more close contact with the people who elected him.</P>
      <P>He speaks about the responsibilities he has got.  A person who has a grievance now has too far to go to get his grievance remedied!  Does not the Parliamentary Secretary know quite well that the elected representatives to-day are playing practically no part in local councils and have nothing whatever to do with the removal of grievances?  To pretend that, by breaking up the districts, a man will be brought more closely into contact with the difficulties in his area and be able to get them smoothed out is a grotesque distortion of the situation in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary cannot be really serious about the case he makes, as it will be much more difficult under this Bill to get people to go forward for local government service at all.  He himself has a peculiar concept about how grievances are to be redressed by local representatives. Apparently he thinks that the whole purpose of local government is that the local representative is available for people who have difficulties; but in another capacity the same Parliamentary Secretary took very good pains to ensure that where people had grievances in the matter of central administration he and his staffs would not be available to them.  The argument he makes here to-day contradicts his policy <Col N="1447" /> in another respect.  He will remember the circular he issued in regard to old age pensions.  That is the position which local representatives are in to-day.</P>
    <P>What authority have we?  What can we do?  We cannot employ anyone and we cannot give a shilling increase to any official of ours anywhere.  If there are any grievances in hospitals or anywhere else, these are all the responsibility of the manager.  Of course, we have managers and managers&mdash;some very sensible and some not so sensible. From the point of view of bringing the local representative into more close contact with the people who elect him, this whole thing is going back on the original plan of amalgamation which was carried out when the State was set out.</P>
    <P>It is not clear to me as a local representative just where my responsibility will begin and end under this Bill, with regard to the making of a particular road.  I will have responsibility for a main road or a by-road or a county road up to a certain point and when it crosses my boundary into the next man's district, I will have no responsibility.  Is it to be the same with drainage?  I sat on a sub-committee of my county council the other day, where the council appointed a number of those from the various districts who were interested in drainage. We had a problem of drains&mdash;not only drains that flow through our own county but that flow through half a dozen other counties as well, before they reach the sea.  We have the Parliamentary Secretary coming along now and saying I am to be concerned only with what happens in this townland and am not to be concerned with what happens in the place beyond.  It is absurd and ridiculous&mdash;the whole idea is really fantastic.</P>
    <P>I often think we have difficulties because a great many of our people live on small farms and it is difficult to get them to raise their minds and imagination to the point that there are other farms beyond and problems beyond, just the same as their own, if they could only realise it.  This Bill aims at <Col N="1448" /> driving every man back into his own little area and making him responsible for that, so that he does not care a button what injustice is perpetrated outside it.  His whole idea will be to get as much money spent in his own particular area as possible, no matter what it may be spent on, and if he gets away with it there may be poverty and destitution produced beyond and that can go on as far as he is concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the people in the Department of Local Government do not really know how the country runs its business.  The Parliamentary Secretary speaks of Donegal and tells us about wide spaces where there are areas as large as the area of County Carlow.  If we want to remedy that, we should add to the number of people to be elected to those particular areas, instead of breaking up the area as he is doing.  I have very strong views about this.  This is a futile and retrograde measure and, far from getting the best people, it will get the poorer type.  The selection is being confined to a particular district, but in that particular townland there may not be one man, from the point of view of local government, worth three-half-pence, while there may be two or three who would make excellent representatives just outside the borderline.  This Bill will damage local government and make people have less respect for it and make them have more petty minds. There will be small areas and the whole administration of the county is bad. The general attitude is to-day that county councillors regard the whole county and every end of it as their concern and that the money they take off administration everywhere ought to be on a just and equitable basis.  The fact that you have areas fairly large, with a number of people representing those areas, gives a broader view, a better approach and a fairer distribution of the money that is to be spent.</P>
    <P>When people have grievances, they wish to approach someone.  I come in contact with grievances where there is a demand for payment to a hospital and they say they are not able to pay, though they are assessed up to a <Col N="1449" /> certain point.  You examine that and say what you think about it.  The Parliamentary Secretary's Party did a great deal to ensure that there would be a political atmosphere in local government elections.  Let us suppose you have a small area and there are three or four candidates.  One is elected.  There are many people who did not support him, but supported others much more strongly, but the candidates whom they supported are defeated.  Now, these people have a certain grievance.  I do not know how much the Parliamentary Secretary knows about country districts, but he will find that if they have a grievance it is not to the man who is elected for their area they will go, but to somebody from another area who is politically in closer communion with them.  That is the truth.  That is what is taking place to-day.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that this is going to be eliminated.  I say it is, mar dheadh.  While you have the whole plan of local government elections the basis for Seanad elections, you are not going to eliminate politicians and politics.</P>
    <P>Another objectionable feature, which I am surprised the Parliamentary Secretary has not seen, is that the present electoral system, which gives minorities an opportunity to express their point of view in support of people of their own religious persuasion, is being ended now.  I would much prefer to see a situation where there would not be such separate points of view, but it is a fact that that is so.  That change is going to happen in my county, in Monaghan and in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is the way to do it.  I think it is too soon, and I would much prefer to see people get a chance to be absorbed in any way we can. This sort of pressure is very undesirable. There are four or five of those people sitting with me on my council to-day.  They are colleagues with whom we can all work very amicably.  Now, by a stroke of the pen, a situation is created which will have heartburnings which none of us desires.  The whole measure is unnecessary and unwanted and will be a definite hindrance and <Col N="1450" /> handicap to progressive local government.</P>

      <P>On the last measure before the House I was able not only to approve of the Bill but quite sincerely to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his speech.  I am sorry that I cannot do so in relation to this Bill.  The oftener I read this Bill the more I am opposed to it.  I should like to say that I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary did not deal with what seemed to me to be one of its most important aspects, and that is why it should be passed before the general election.  This Bill, for good or evil, makes a number of quite important changes, with some of which I shall deal shortly.  It is introduced by a Government which is not sure that it has the support of the electorate, and is sufficiently doubtful about it as to feel it necessary to go to the country at a very early date.  Yet it introduces a measure which contains drastic changes, and is pressing to have it passed before the general election, although it is not proposed to hold most of the elections affected by the Bill until 1950.  There could be, I know, a few cases where they could be held in 1948 or 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless a really good case is made that this Bill is an urgent measure I suggest that it ought to be postponed and be discussed at leisure.  It ought not to be what is commonly known as a Party measure, because all Parties are or ought to be equally concerned with the methods by which local bodies are elected.  In view of another Bill which is on the Seanad Orders of the Day, we, in the Seanad, are peculiarly interested in this Bill, which is one to decide how the people who will elect us are to be elected.  It is proposed in the Seanad Electoral (Panel Members) Bill that the 43 panel members should be elected by a new electorate, of which roughly four-fifths will consist of people to be elected under the system which is being introduced in the Bill we are now considering.  Therefore, for many reasons, it seems to me <Col N="1451" /> that this is the kind of measure which should be discussed leisurely and carefully by the Seanad instead of being rushed.</P>
    <P>I hope when he replies the Parliamentary Secretary will give us a very clear indication of what grounds there are for passing this Bill before the election.  Apart from the merits of the measure, if he has good grounds for passing it before the election, I would let it go, and let some new Government amend it, if there is a new Government, or let the present Government, after further consideration amend it, as they will, probably, want to do, if returned to power.</P>
    <P>There are a number of quite important aspects of the Bill to which I desire to refer.  Probably the most important of all is the power given the Minister under the Bill.  Most of the Orders which he can make are Orders to be made without reference to either House and will not even be laid on the Table.  It is proposed to allow him to divide the areas into quite small constituencies. That could be a matter of very considerable significance, and might be done on Party lines or without adequate local knowledge.  It is certainly a very big power, having regard to the fact that the results will affect elections to this House.  That is all to be done by a stroke of the Minister's pen.</P>
    <P>As far as I can find, the only check on his power is to be found in Section 4, for what he does under sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 4 he must obtain Parliamentary approval, but he need not obtain it for anything else.  To pass into law, in a hurry just before an election, a measure which is designed to give all these powers in relation to a new system of local government is irresponsible and, to say the least of it, unwise.  In some ways I was sorry that the Minister for Local Government was not here instead of the Parliamentary Secretary.  He stated, unless I got a wrong report of his speech, that he was introducing a one-member system of proportional representation.  These were the words in the report of his speech.  The Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1452" /> is much more honest and frank.  He admits he is abolishing proportional representation in many areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have misunderstood the Parliamentary Secretary. If he did not say that, then I must argue the matter still further. We had a striking illustration of what I mean in the County Dublin by-election where there were four candidates. The lowest vote, I think, was about 10,000 and the highest about 14,000. Mr. MacBride was elected, and I take it, according to Mr. MacEntee and possibly according to Mr. Childers, that he has been proportionately elected. How he has been proportionately elected is beyond my conception. According to the Parliamentary Secretary, all the people in County Dublin should feel that Mr. MacBride is their representative.  Personally, I disagree politically with Mr. MacBride, but he is an old friend of mine and, consequently, I would have no hesitation in going to him but to argue that the people of County Dublin would go to him or to Mr. Rooney or to Mr. Mullins or Mr. Dunne if any of them had been elected has, I think, no relation to the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might after a long period of political education reach this standard, but the fact of the matter is that in most areas and certainly in Dublin the people who want to discuss matters of politics or in connection with local affairs will go to people with whom there is a certain amount of political affinity whether those people are the representatives of the area or not.  I think the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary is a bad one.  Even if my argument is wrong and if the people will prefer to go to local representatives to have their grievances redressed I would say it is not a good system.  I want less and less of it.  I believe that the more local representatives you have who are prepared to give their minds and their ability towards improving their district and co-operating with the local managers the better and the less time that they give in either adjusting real or imaginary grievances or in pretending to adjust grievances, and in <Col N="1453" /> most cases it is pretending, the better. If the case made by the Parliamentary Secretary will increase this tendency it would make me even more against the Bill.  There is one other matter which, I believe, is of a very considerable importance and particularly in relation to the City of Dublin, but I am sure it would apply also to Cork and other cities.  I have for a very long time been an advocate of representation in city councils and corporations for the representatives of limited companies who pay rates.  Now I do not think this should be an unduly large representation, but I have always regarded it as a matter of very considerable importance.  We used to have a special representation in Dublin of five members, but the present Government objected to this and abolished it.  Why they are so anxious not to have limited companies, whether manufacturing or trading, represented in the Corporation is beyond me.  But this Bill goes one step further.</P>
    <P>A very large number, without hesitation I would say the majority of the businesses of size, whether manufacturing or otherwise, are now limited companies and a very large number of the smaller ones also are limited companies.  A limited company cannot be registered as a voter, and the directors, unless they reside within the particular area, are not registered as voters.  I cannot give the numbers of directors in Dublin or Cork who reside outside the city area, but on going through the businesses of which I have knowledge, I find that the large majority of them reside outside the city area.  Under this Bill, they cannot become members of the city council, and I estimate that of the present city council eight or nine members will be disqualified on those grounds after 1950.  They would be disqualified immediately but for a saving clause.  All the people I have in mind are engaged in business in the city and all of them are fairly substantial ratepayers.  I think this is retrograde step.  I am not asking for any special representation at the moment.  I am simply saying that it is desirable that men of business ability should be persuaded to go into the Dublin Corporation and similar <Col N="1454" /> bodies.  It has been very difficult to persuade them to do so and it will be always difficult to persuade them.  The powers are limited and they cannot make anything out of it.</P>

      <P>Why should such a Bill be introduced to make it impossible for those who have sufficient civic spirit to go forward as candidates to get elected?  Why should you say that they should not go forward?  Although their main interests are in the city and although they pay rates in the city, they are disqualified under this Bill because they live outside the area.  The directors of limited companies are in that position to a very large extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a mistake, and that it is a retrograde step.  I have emphasised this entirely from the commercial point of view because I am more or less a commercial representative in this House.  But the argument is not confined to that section of the people.  It would not at all surprise me if before very long, one were to find that the officers of unions and others will be disqualified because they reside outside a particular area.  I know one or two who, as a matter of fact, do so reside.  I have put down an amendment for the Committee Stage, but I do not know that it is fully satisfactory.  I am totally opposed to the bringing in of this Bill now and of having it passed through quickly, a Bill which proposes the abolition of proportional representation over a large area and a change in qualifications so as to make it impossible for large ratepayers in the cities to remain members of the council. Most important of all, I object to the handing over, without any control, of complete and autocratic powers to the next Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be&mdash;we do not know what Party will be in power&mdash;to decide particular areas and boundaries and how they are to be divided.  It is quite irresponsible, I think, to do all that in <Col N="1455" /> a hurry a few weeks before a general election, and for these reasons, as I say, I am totally opposed to the Bill.</P>

Before going on to deal with it further, I want to say that it was a pleasure and an education to hear the Parliamentary Secretary speak on it.  I hope that many such men as he will be found in our Parliaments in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the Bill, where is the use in introducing it?  For centuries our people struggled to secure the right of national and local self-government. We were termed &ldquo;Hottentots&rdquo; because of some racial defects, and for some unknown reason we were told that we were unfit for national self-government.  It is 67 years since Lord Salisbury said that we were not fit for local government.  The Fianna Fáil Government says it to-day. I wonder if Lord Salisbury could come back from the Great Beyond and were to examine the developments that have taken place since the right of local government was conferred upon the country, would he not think that he was justified in what he said 67 years ago? We have this Bill with its geographical manipulations and undemocratic system of representation.  In my opinion, it would be better if, instead, we had a Bill to alter the Managerial Act and to give back to local authorities powers which they have not to-day.  There is nothing in this Bill to increase their powers or to give an interest to the people to select representatives.  I can tell the House, with my 22 years' experience on a county council, that at the last local elections we found it very difficult to get intelligent men to go forward for election.  There has been a gradual lowering in the standard of public representatives on local bodies.  I know quite a number of very capable and efficient men who take a deep and abiding interest in local administration.  They want to see local affairs carried out in an equitable and intelligent way and with proper regard for the people in their area, but they are just longing for the moment to <Col N="1456" /> come when their term of office will expire.  They will not go forward again for election and the reason is that the county councils to-day have no powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the local bodies are being limited and circumscribed. By reason of that, public interest in the selection of public men to administer local affairs has been lessened.  Public bodies have nothing to administer now.  The one appointment they can make to-day is that of a rate collector.  Even the estimate for the coming year is submitted to the county council by the county manager. They are obliged to approve of it.  If the Minister is of opinion that the sum stipulated in the estimate is the sum that is required to finance the local services, the council has to approve of that, or else a sealed Order is sent down by the Minister removing the council from office and appointing a commissioner in their place.  Since the advent of national government there has been a dangerous tendency towards centralisation.  We find that in this Bill.  The Minister is being invested with extra powers so that local administration is to be administered almost wholly from Merrion Square. I suggest that, instead, the policy should be one of decentralisation.  If that were done, we would find the local people taking a greater interest in local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all remember the fine representatives we had on the local bodies that were elected after the passing of the Local Government Act of 1898.  Those men received no remuneration for the services they gave to the public.  They gave their time, attention and interest to the work of the local bodies.  In the main, their administration was efficient and it certainly was local.  All that has been done away with since the advent of national government.  The <Col N="1457" /> people were not consulted, and then we had the Managerial Act.  The local bodies have very little power to-day. The only power they have, as I have said, is to elect a rate collector, but they will have even less power when this Bill becomes an Act.  The Fianna Fáil Government appear to agree with what Lord Salisbury said 67 years ago, that the people of this country are not fit for local government.  What the motive may be behind this Bill I do not know, but it seems to me that the passing of it will be a bad day's work for the country because, as I have said, it will lessen the interest which the people should take in their local affairs.  In a few years, unless there is a change, no responsible man will care a hoot about going forward, because he will merely be dealing with matters in which he has no jurisdiction. The whole thing is a matter for the county manager and then for Merrion Street.  It is the antithesis of democracy as exemplified by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately there is somebody with some experience who does not feel inclined to take as pessimistic a view of this Bill as other Senators who have spoken.  I have considerable experience, and, as soon as I saw this Bill published, I regarded it as a step in the right direction, because I knew electoral areas, of which my own town was part, which extended right across the county and I knew representatives on the county council living in my own town who knew nothing about the area at the other end or even in the centre.  It is a step in the right direction that the areas should be cut up and that every man representing the people should know about his own area.  If he does not, it is easy to bring him to book. When there are five or six representatives for an electoral division, as somebody here said, everybody's business is nobody's business.  There is no competition as between the various representatives, but in this case, the areas being joined together, with the centres quite close to each other, there will be a stimulus in the direction of doing work well.  If, in a small area, there is an active representative, or two <Col N="1458" /> active representatives, the effect will be to incite others to a greater exercise of their functions, if they are not already doing so.</P>
      <P>I was really surprised to hear Senator Baxter arguing that one of them might get a drain made through his area, which, when it came to the end of the area, would not be continued. No local authority would allow such a thing to happen.  If a drain or a river clearance scheme is started, it must be done from start to finish and due provision to that end will be made before the work is started at all, so that argument has no validity.  Senator Madden talked about the county councils' lack of power, but the general opinion is that if these bodies exercised the powers they have in an intelligent way, they could do a lot more than they are doing.  Senator Madden talked about the very worthy people on county councils in the past.  That is so to a great extent, but they were exceptions, and even at the present day I hear exclamations about what it cost such-and-such a doctor or engineer to get his position under the old bodies.  There was one doctor with whom I was acquainted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They will know what they are to do because they will have a circumscribed area and they will know the people within the area and will know further that, if they do not do their duty, they will not be elected as representatives a second time.  I think the Bill is a worthy Bill for these reasons, and, as a person in public life for a considerable time, I welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for which I dislike this Bill is precisely that the members of a county council under it are going to have a power which was not mentioned by Senator Madden which they can operate and <Col N="1459" /> utilise exclusive of any Ministerial control&mdash;the power, to which Senator Douglas referred, of selecting the members of this House.  It was an unfortunate day for local government in this country when politics were brought into the county councils.  It would be far better&mdash;and all Parties in my county agree&mdash;if there were no political blocs in the election of representatives to county councils and if these elections were conducted purely on the basis of local interests.</P>
      <P>The day when county councils had, of necessity, to deal with what were national problems went when we got our own Parliament.  Prior to that, the county councils and the General Council of County Councils were the only bodies through which national feelings could be expressed.  That day is gone, and I feel very strongly that county councils&mdash;using that term to cover all local authorities&mdash;should consider and should content themselves considering only the problems of their particular counties and should not discuss national problems in the wider sense which can and should be discussed in the Dáil and in this House. Having regard to that, it is very regrettable indeed that the Fianna Fáil Party decided to contest county council elections on a political basis. That contest has been continued and is bound to be continued so long as the particular provision remains in the Seanad Bill.  It is one of the unfortunate things which arises on all our county councils&mdash;not perhaps as a result of this Bill but as a result of the other Bill&mdash;but it is something we must consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, I find it extremely difficult to understand the mentality of the Department in dealing with this Bill.  The Custom House&mdash;using that phrase to cover not merely the present Department of Local Government but the old Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;has been at very great pains in recent years to try to ensure that in each local authority the system of having separate areas of charge would be abolished, that in each county there would be only one general <Col N="1460" /> rate and that the cost of all the health services of the county would be spread over the whole county as a county-at-large charge.</P>
    <P>Candidly, the result of that appears to be that there is not the same responsibility, if I may use the word, in the members of the council in considering the cost of what they are asked by certain of their constituents to do in a particular area.  It is one of the tendencies that has developed since the separate charges were abolished and there was a unified rate over the whole county.  It is exactly the reverse procedure that the Department is now envisaging in this Bill.  What is going to happen under this Bill is, quite clearly, a tendency for a small area to try to claim something off a county at large.  I think the two schemes which the Department has considered are entirely and absolutely contradictory.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I want to reiterate what has been said by other speakers in regard to the method by virtue of which these powers are going to be exercised. I find it very difficult indeed to follow the abstract method by virture of which the Minister is going to operate his Order.  I think it will be quite impossible to follow it or for any of us to consider how this scheme will operate unless each of us is given in respect of each county that he knows an example of approximately how it is going to work and how in each county the areas are going to be divided.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, it is very greatly to be regretted that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary has chosen the method that he has chosen in this Section 2.  You cannot divide any county in suitable and satisfactory areas merely by sitting down in an office with a map in front of you and certain tables of population.  It cannot be done.  You must have the local knowledge. You must know that the people in one area are accustomed to go to one particular side of that area to market, to shop and so forth; that the people of another area have special ties with the adjoining area to the south, whereas on a map it might look that they would be better joined to the north.  There is no provision whatever <Col N="1461" /> in Section 2 by virtue of which the Minister will consult the local authority before he makes this distribution. There is no provision in respect of the appointment of polling districts and polling places.  In Section 3, it is a reserved function of the council.  It should be a reserved function of the council, because only the united knowledge of all the members of the county council could deal with that question of geographical ties, just as the united knowledge of all the members, and not one particular person, could deal with the most efficient and most satisfactory method of dividing the areas so that local ideas, local feeling, local sentiment and local convenience could be considered.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, during the passage of this Bill through Committee there will be introduced into Section 2 a provision, by virtue of which, before any Order is made, it will be mandatory on the Minister to submit a draft scheme to the county council, that the consideration of that draft scheme will be a reserved function to the members of the county council and that, the county council having considered that scheme, the Minister will be bound to take into account any and every such representation that may be made by the council concerned before making the scheme into an Order.  I hope that, over and apart from that, there will be in addition a specific provision by virtue of which any Order made in pursuance of this section will be open for tabling and discussion in either House.  I want to be quite clear that I am not referring to any particular Minister or any particular person who may be there for the time being; this is an arrangement that can be made and that can be altered later on but there is in that section, without these safeguards of, first of all, consultation with the local authority and, secondly, the tabling of the Order, all the elements of the worst possible system of gerrymandering that there could be, a system that might be used specifically and purposely because the county council is the basic four-fifths of the electorate of the members of this House.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult also to see why the Minister has decided that there is not <Col N="1462" /> to be an election either in 1948 or 1949 and that the next election is to take place in 1950, unless I might perhaps allow the unworthy thought to enter my head that one of the reasons is that the Minister at present has a majority on the county councils but I suppose it would be utterly unworthy to allow such a thought to find expression.</P>

      <P>I approach this Bill from rather a different viewpoint from that taken by other speakers.  I feel the country is suffering because there is a lack of proper respect for the importance of local authorities and maybe that is due to the way in which their powers have been taken off them in recent years.  I agree with Senator Madden, to this extent, that the right type of man will not be attracted to local authorities unless he is given a real sense of responsibility.  No man is going to waste his time simply sitting around a table without having real powers to do something effective.  The striking of rates and the spending of rates is a very important item in our community existence and you will not get the right type of man if he finds that in fact he has to submit everything he does to what is in fact a paid servant of the State, who supervises all his actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But there is one feature of the Bill that particularly appeals to me and that is one that somehow or another has not appeared to those who have spoken before me.  I rather like the new type of more intimate relationship that the Bill is going to effect between the elected person and the people whom he represents.  I think one of the minor tragedies has been that there has been an insufficient degree of contact in local authorities between the elected representatives and the people.  I am old enough to remember when there was a very live interest taken in the elections to local councils, district councils as distinct from county councils, when there was keen rivalry to be elected, <Col N="1463" /> when it was something to be called &ldquo;councillor&rdquo;, when it meant something, and gave a prestige and cache to the person who occupied that position. These were the times when councillors had some real, effective work to do and effective powers to enable them to do something worth-while.</P>
    <P>I am not going into a long dissertation on the general scope of the Bill. Various points have been covered by previous speakers, but I will say how much I am in sympathy with Senator Douglas's remarks on the exclusion from the possibility of election of what I am going deliberately to call the very responsible type of citizen.  I think it is an absurdity to make a provision so arbitrary as this which will make it impossible for the largest ratepayer in our cities to be elected to a local authority, if he wishes to be elected, simply because his residence is outside the area in which his busness or other interests are.  You can easily have the situation that the most important ratepayer, from the point of view of employment and the amount he pays in rates, will be forever excluded from the possibility of participation in local work.  I think that is a flaw.  I find it hard to believe that it is deliberately intended that way, and I am hoping, with Senator Douglas, now that the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary has been drawn to it, that something will be done to remove what, in my opinion, is a blot on a Bill that otherwise has very many attractions for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that one point in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech impressed me very much, that is, the proposal to give representation to parishes.  From my experience of Roscommon, I know that there are three very large parishes in an area in which, two men out of each parish are elected, whereas there are two other parishes that are equally important, from which no representative is elected.  I know that there has been a good deal of discontent in these parishes on that account.  I would like to see every parish having representation. It is my personal opinion that <Col N="1464" /> Party politics should be cut out of the county council and until that is done the best type of man will not come forward.  If this new Bill aims at giving decent representation to the parish, I welcome it very much, but I am entirely with Senator Sweetman when he suggests that the draft should be put before the county councils.  The Bill should not be rushed through without the county councils being able to express their opinion on it.  After all, they know the various districts in their own counties and if they were asked for suggestions there is no one who could help the Minister better than they.  I am not going to suggest political motives to this debate, but if there are such motives at the back of it, it will not do much good.  Party politics should be completely unknown in the county council, and every ratepayer in a district should be able to feel he was getting a square deal from every representative, no matter to what Party he belonged.</P>
      <P>With regard to powers, I must say that, speaking for my own county, the councils have no power.  Senator Madden said councils have the power of electing the rate collector.  They have and they have not.  There have been a couple of cases in my county where rate collectors have died and the county manager divided their districts among existing collectors, his idea being to make it practically a whole-time job and a decent one.  I think the majority of the county council would hold a different view.  Most of the collectors have other means of living, perhaps they have farms, and they are not depending on these positions, so that it is a kind of side-line which helps out small farmers.</P>

      <P>I think we have had a good deal of gross misrepresentation in regard to this Bill and I must try to convince the House that we have no sinister intentions in placing the Bill before the Oireachtas.  First of all, in regard to the urgency of the Bill, arrangements for local elections in 1948 have to be begun well in advance.  If the Dáil is dissolved as we anticipate and a general election is held at the end of January or the beginning of February, it will be much too late to make alternative arrangements of this kind.  That is the reason for the urgency.  We do not wish to make arrangements for a local election in 1948 and we must make alternative provision before that time.  The Bill is extremely urgent and I would ask the indulgence of the House in pressing it forward in every way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Baxter said this Bill is a further hindrance to more efficient local government and that it will be very difficult to get good representation when it becomes law.  I do not know whether I should at this stage give a more detailed description of the work and functions of county councillors, but in order to enlighten some Senators who appear to be very worried about the Bill, I want to give some idea of what county councillors do.  First of all, under this Bill, the county councillors will represent their own immediate areas.  They will be able to do that much more easily than before, because it will be a smaller area. Secondly, there is nothing to prevent them taking representations from people living in contiguous areas who happen to have some personal objection to the person elected in their own areas.  Thirdly, the county councillors elected will continue to have collective responsibility for the work of the county council as a whole and there is nothing in the Bill that diminishes in any way that collective responsibility or the capacity of a county councillor to discuss general local administration problems in the county council.  There is nothing to prevent him from discussing the mushroom resolutions that float around county councils all over the country.  He can still continue to debate the level of the old age pensions or the means test or any other matter, <Col N="1466" /> whether or not it is genuinely the ordinary business of a county council.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prevent persons who desire to acquire experience of local administration and thus become interested in the Dáil from using the county councils as stepping stones from their position of ordinary citizens to that of members of the Dáil.  The whole point is that from now on a person going forward for election knows that the amount of work he will have to do on behalf of his constituents is limited in area.  He will know them all personally and know the pitfalls to avoid in dealing with them.  He knows his own people intimately and knows those who are going to make excessive claims on his attention and how to get rid of them.  He knows how to deal with every aspect of local administration in his area and he will have more time to devote to the larger considerations of local government, just because he represents the interests of an area somewhat the size of a parish.  I speak with the utmost sincerity when I say it is a very interesting and useful change in the system of election for that reason.</P>
    <P>I know very well that, if I were myself to take an interest in local government, I should first of all wonder whether I would have the time to do that as well as attend to my duties as a Deputy of the Dáil.  One of the things that might influence me would be that I could do my business either as a member of the Dáil or in my private capacity much more easily when I was aware that I knew my area was small and could tell what was going on without even seeing the people.  If a pump went out of order, I would know about it before someone came to me to complain.  Instead of people having the humiliation of travelling long distances, only to find a councillor away from home on business, because some engineer was not doing his job well or not seeing to the pumps, or because a contractor for pump repairs was not doing his job and let the council down, they will know whether their representative is available.</P>

      <P>Donegal.  Naturally, the quality of a county council depends on the quality of the representatives elected.</P>
      <P>I think this Bill should encourage the election of men who have a wide point of view in regard to local administration and matters of that kind generally, and who understand the needs of their constituents.  We do not want to encourage what might be described in a purely vulgar sense as parish pump politics through this Bill.  We believe that we ought to be able to get representatives who will have a good broad point of view regarding local administration, and, who, at the same time, will represent a particular area and not try to encourage the election of people who have a very narrow point of view.</P>
      <P>Senator Sweetman and Senator Douglas suggested that the Minister's Orders in connection with the delimitation of electoral areas should be laid before the House.  This practice is not general.  The Minister for Local Government in 1925 was entrusted with the responsibility of making new electoral areas and when he did so there were no complaints.  Why should the present Minister be the subject of any potential suspicion in this regard?</P>
      <P>I look at the matter in two ways. In the first place it would be political suicide for any Party or any Minister to make these divisions in a way that could be suggested as having a political background.  Secondly in regard to the work done by the present Minister for Local Government, no one has ever suggested a breath of suspicion against him.  He has had enormous responsibility in regard to town planning, the sanctioning of housing schemes, and the provisions of the recent Constituency Bill, in which he must show and has shown the utmost integrity.  Whatever criticism has been made against him, it has always been accepted that he personally is utterly impeccable in his conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should such suspicion be cast against him when it was not cast <Col N="1468" /> against the Minister for Local Government in 1925?  If Senator Sweetman must take a cynical point of view, they may believe what I said, namely, that it would be political suicide for a Party or a Minister to make use of this Bill for gerrymandering purposes in connection with local authorities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the business franchise in Dublin it was never regarded as very successful.  I do not think there was any regret when it ended.  We do not intend to change the proposed method of election.  Under the present method a person who is an elector of a local authority must have business premises in, or must be a resident of, the area. That is the position under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I may have misunderstood the Senator.  Senator Madden spoke very pessimistically.  He said that Lord Salisbury spoke of the Irish people as not being fit for local government. The Senator suggested that local government was ending in this country, that representatives were of a less desirable kind, that there was more centralisation and that it was becoming more difficult to find responsible men going forward for election to county councils.  He also suggested that this Bill was in some way undemocratic.  I cannot find anything undemocratic in it. It removes anomalies as between urban and rural areas about which no one has spoken this evening.  Rural areas have been given greater representation in relation to county charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Madden also said that there was now less work for county conncils and representatives of local authorities as a result of the county managerial system and of centralising influence. Surely I am not compelled to give now a history of the development of local government.  It would take too long. To put it briefly, everybody knows that what is called centralisation has been the result of larger subventions from <Col N="1469" /> the Central Fund towards local authorities' services, that with these subventions more satisfactory services exist, and this inevitably necessitates control and supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the specialised functions of local authorities which require the assistance and supervision of specialists at the head of any particular service. How impossible it would be to maintain the old type of purely decentralised government with regard to the development of such a service as the tuberculosis welfare scheme, in view of the fact that everyone concerned has to have an intimate medical knowledge of this subject.  How equally impossible it would be to maintain the administration of road services without some control from the centre, when roads are more and more a matter of modern engineering practice, on which local authorities require advice and guidance as to standards.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it would seem to me that compared with 1910 local authorities under the managerial system have far more matters to discuss. They have 30 or 40 new functions, the carrying out of which necessitates their supervision.  Older members of the Seanad know what work local authorities had in 1910 compared with the work they have to do to-day. Every service carried out by the manager is subject to the supervision of members of local authorities.  A local authority has power to suspend a manager, they have power to supervise the performance of his duties and to examine and revise estimates.  That is a very important function.</P>

In fact, <Col N="1470" /> a number of authorities divide themselves into committees for that purpose. There is nothing to prevent a road committee going through the road estimates paragraph by paragraph and agreeing among themselves about the works that must be carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They still have reserved functions.  They also can regulate the acceptance of tenders and they have the power to appoint committees to examine every aspect of the manager's administration.  They can regulate to a considerable degree the rate of housing and by voting more money they can build more houses.  A lot of those things are done reluctantly <Col N="1471" /> by local authorities because they mean more money.  If they employ their time usefully they can do a great deal.  I can see from reading the report of county council meetings in the local newspapers every week that progress is being made.  I read those reports religiously and I notice that many councils are beginning to realise their powers in regard to the supervision of the county manager's work.  In some areas the whole trend is very satisfactory, but in other areas county councils do not appear to have accepted the managerial principle so well, but I believe as time goes by their understanding of the system will be in the right direction.  If in time it is necessary to amend the system, I am sure the Minister of the day will do so. Senator Sweetman spoke of the need of having local knowledge in the formation of those new electoral areas.  So far as I am aware, in the Department of Local Government, there never has been any criticism of the Department in regard to the operation of the franchise in general.  We have a rather fine tradition in this regard.  In making his Orders, the Minister will have regard, no doubt, to local circumstances. One could commence with the unit of the dispensary area as a first basis for the new electoral area.  I think it will be quite possible to work out a scheme that will be satisfactory to the local authorities concerned.  The obvious thing is to tackle the urban areas first and reduce their representation, as I indicated earlier on the Second Reading.  Having seen how they fit into the scheme, the Minister will deal with the remaining areas.  Due account will be taken of such factors as the towns to which people go marketing.  If there is a sparsely populated and scattered area separated by mountains the officials of the Department responsible will have to use their intelligence and have regard to the section of the Bill which says that population and the numbers of electors are to be taken into account. Sanitary services are levied over the county ex-urban and that explains to a degree why existing councils have an undue preponderance of urban representation. One of the proposals of this <Col N="1472" /> Bill is to give county health representatives a greater bias.</P>
      <P>One member of the House spoke of the abolition of proportional representation. Well, the single transferable vote applying to a one-member constituency is referred to in the Constitution, Article 12, Section 2, dealing with the election of President. There is no suggestion for abolishing proportional representation underlying this Bill.  There is nothing in the Constitution providing that local authorities should be elected in any particular manner.  It is purely a matter of law.  I think that political heat and the emphasis of the political viewpoint will be lessened by this Bill.  I hope that the people of the country will have the intelligence to elect the man who is best qualified for undertaking local administration.  At the same time, such a person will have some political bias.  I do not believe in the theory of people having no politics.</P>

      <P>I see members of this House who call themselves Independent, but they are really anti-Government. There may be some exceptions, but I do not know them.  The same applies to the members of local authorities.  Generally speaking, the people who call themselves Independents are against the Government of the day.  There is no use in saying that there will not be politics in the local councils as a result of this Bill, but I think that a man will need to have a personality, an appeal to the electorate, who will know his weaknesses before he is elected.  So long as the electorate are intelligent, they will elect good men.  I ask the House to have second thoughts on this matter.  There has been a suggestion that there is almost something sinister in this Bill.  It seems to me that it is a Bill designed to give back to the local authorities zest and interest in their work and to base representation on the conception of the parish. During the war there was a great deal of talk about parish councils, but they did not survive the emergency period. <Col N="1473" /> Under this Bill, areas about the size of a parish will have administrative significance through the reduction in the size of the local electoral areas. In conclusion, I would like to recommend the Bill to the House as an advance in local administration.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of the Bill is to give members of the Garda Síochána who retired between the dates 1st July, 1940, and 31st October, 1946, exactly the same rights are regards pension as have been given to civil servants under the recent Superannuation Act, that is to say, to give them the benefit of the cost-of-living index number up to 270 instead of the pre-emergency number of 185.  Widows of members of the <Col N="1474" /> force, where their pensions are calculated on the basis of their husbands' length of service, will also benefit in like manner.</P>
      <P>At the start of the emergency, the scales of Garda pay had been formulated on the basis of a cost-of-living index number of 185.  This was also the index number on which Civil Service bonus was based.  As from 1st July, 1940, Civil Service bonus was formally stabilised by the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations at this index number of 185, and remained so until it was formally permitted to rise to 210 on 1st February, 1945.  It was stabilised at the latter figure until 31st October, 1946, when the operation of the Stabilisation Orders was brought to an end, and the index number of 270 was applied to Civil Service pay. Garda pay was not formally stabilised throughout this period but it was, nevertheless, kept in step throughout with Civil Service pay.</P>
      <P>As the cost-of-living index number rose steadily throughout the stabilisation period from 185 to 290 it will be seen that the consequences of stabilisation was that the scales of pay of the force did not increase with the cost of living as might otherwise have been expected.  In the case of men who ceased membership during the period this had an adverse effect on their retiring pay, and, consequently, on their pensions.</P>
      <P>Now that pay scales reckoned generally on the 270 index number have been brought into operation as from 1st November, 1946, it is proposed to make compensation by reassessing Garda pensions awarded during the stabilisation period on pay reckoned on the index number applying at the time of ceasing membership subject to a maximum of 270.</P>
      <P>There is another provision under Section 8 which provides that where a Guard left the service for political reasons, the period during which he was out will be allowed for pension purposes as was done in the case of civil servants who left the Service for a like reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the House generally will agree with this <Col N="1475" /> Bill, although I am not any more satisfied with it than I was with the Bill dealing with civil servants.  I am not satisfied that this is the proper method of dealing with this particular matter. I am not at all convinced that a Guard who retired in 1938, when the cost of living was on an entirely lower basis than it is to-day, will be any better off than if he had retired after 1940 when the bonus was stabilised, or will be able to live on a small pension now. I do not think that this is the most equitable manner of dealing with this. The case here is not quite the same as that of the civil servants.  I think the Government should have met the strong case that I made some weeks ago.  I think it would be far more equitable to face the fact that a man who had given service to the State as a Guard, sometimes under very difficult conditions, may now be in very poor circumstances by reason of the fact that his pension, calculated at the time of his retirement and intended to be adequate at that time, has now become completely inadequate by reason of the cost of living.  It does not seem to me to be equitable to pick out a particular year and say the pension is to be related to it.  That is one of those things which is bound to be raised again.  One of the theories put forward by the Minister for Finance was that the man may have had the bad luck to go out in a particular year. It has to be remembered that in 1940 the Government intervened and, by law, reduced what would have been the normal bonus under the arrangement which existed previously.  Therefore they feel that they are obliged to give something as from 1940 and do not feel under any obligation whatever to deal with those who retired in the earlier years.  I know that, in theory, you can draw that distinction, but, from the point of view of the State as an employer, I do not think it is a moral distinction or one which we can properly draw.  If it were to be looked at from the point of view of what I call a good employer, he would decide the amount of money he could find for the purpose of dealing with his ex-emplovees and would try to see if he <Col N="1476" /> could not help all and not just those who happened to retire in a particular year.</P>

I do not know whether the Minister has taken it into consideration, but there are still a few old R.I.C. pensioners throughout the country.  Their pensions were fixed when the cost of living was much lower than it is now.  They are few in number; they are old; and they feel that they have nobody to speak for them. The instruction of the day was to get them out of the force, if we could, and I was especially appointed for that purpose at the time and several members of the R.I.C. very patriotically left the force and joined the friends of Irish freedom, Sinn Féin, as it was then. Now, at the end of their days, we should not forget the high motives they had when they left their employment at great risk to themselves.</P>

      <P>There is not a hope. When Senator Douglas raises one hare, Senator Honan raises another.  That is what the Minister for Finance has to consider.  If he starts to go back to 1938, there will be a borderline then, and, no matter how far back he goes, there will be such a borderline.  He is dealing here with a matter with which he feels morally bound to deal because, by Government action, stabilisation was brought in and what he has done for the Civil Service he is satisfied he must do for the Guards, but he is not going beyond that.  If he did, all these other questions would arise and we would not know where it would end.  This is a simple Bill dealing with a particular matter and only with that matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 27, page 2, to delete the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It would be absurd in sub-section (1) of this section that limited effect should be given to the application of the Bill in relation to statutory instruments. The sub-section says that this Act primarily applies to every statutory instrument which satisfies certain conditions and the proposal in the amendment is to delete the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;. I propose that deletion because I want to ensure that the Bill will apply to all statutory instruments.  I do not understand the use of the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;&mdash;the Bill either applies to instruments or it does not.  I think the purpose of the inclusion of the word is to save the reservations made subsequently where a certificate is given by the Attorney-General. Without taking account of that at all, it seems to me that there is no need for the word.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  What statutory instruments are is distinctly <Col N="1478" /> set out in the section as any Order, regulation, rule, scheme or by-law made in exercise of a power conferred by statute.  They are divided into these classes, namely, those to which the Bill primarily applies and others. The statutory instruments to which the Bill applies are set out in this sub-section and they embrace all instruments made under Government authority or by any person or body discharging any public duties in relation to public administration throughout the State and which are either required by statute to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas or are of such a character as affect the public generally or any particular class or classes of the public.  All the obligatory provisions of the Bill in relation to printing and giving notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> apply to these instruments. As will be apparent from the classes of instruments covered by the definition clause, the idea is to secure that all instruments which are really of public importance will be dealt with as provided in the Bill.  The obligatory provisions do not apply to other statutory instruments.  The Bill provides that such instruments may be dealt with similarly, by permitting such instruments, if printed and published, to be included in the statutory instrument series.  For example, Section 4 (1) of the Bill provides that the Stationery Office shall assign to each statutory instrument to which this Act primarily applies and may assign to any other statutory instrument printed and published by the Stationery Office a number as of the year in which it is made.  What the Senator has in mind is to secure that the principle of the Bill shall apply to all statutory instruments. So far from achieving his object, he is going a long way to defeat it by the amendment, because the effect will be to restrict the Bill's applicaton to the class of instruments defined in sub-section (1) of Section 2. As the Bill stands, other classes of statutory instruments may be printed and included in the official numbered series.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.  I do not know why the Senator wants that word deleted.  I cannot understand it.</P>

      <P>I can quite understand why the Minister says you cannot take the word out, but I cannot understand why it is there.  It seems to me most unusual.  If the practice were to be adopted in all our legislation of putting in the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; I think it would be completely misleading.  I take it the intention is to give a better idea of what this applies to, Clearly, the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; is not exclusive. It must mean something else as well. I am possibly wrong, but I cannot remember any Bill framed in the same way.  I was hoping the Minister would explain the reasons for using that peculiar phraseology in this case. I agree with him in regard to the amendment that simply deleting the word would only be restricting it and would not achieve the object aimed at.</P>

      <P>You must take first of all the expression &ldquo;statutory instrument&rdquo; in Section 1.  It means &ldquo;an Order, regulation, rule, scheme, or by-law, made in exercise of power conferred by statute&rdquo;.  There is a great number of statutory documents or instruments made under different Acts from time to time.  I have an amendment down relating to those made before 1st January, 1948.  I do not know whether the Minister intends to accept that amendment or not but, if he does accept it, the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; will certainly be necessary because it refers to every statutory instrument made before the 1st January and I have asked in that amendment that, notwithstanding <Col N="1480" /> the repeal of the Act of 1893, every statutory instrument made before the 1st day of January, 1948, which complied with the provisions of the said Act shall remain in full force and effect.  If that is accepted it will be necessary to leave in the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; as well as what the Minister referred to in Section 4.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2, standing in the name of Senator Quirke:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) (a)  If the Attorney-General certifies in writing that, in his opinion, a particular person or body is an authority of the class mentioned in sub-paragraph (v) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (i) of this section, such person or body shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said sub-section (i), to be an authority of that class.</P>
      <P>(b)  If the Attorney-General certifies in writing that, in his opinion, statutory instruments of a particular class (defined in such manner and by reference to such things as the Attorney-General thinks proper) are of the character described in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of sub-section (i) of this section, such statutory instruments shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said sub-section (i), to be statutory instruments of that character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to meet a point raised in the other House.  Making the decision of the Attorney-General final was possibly unconstitutional. The Deputy who made that point was not quite certain, but in case there was something in it we had it considered. The amendment provides for his giving a certificate instead of his decision being final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provided that, if any question arose as to whether a proposed statutory instrument was or was <Col N="1482" /> not, by virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 2, a statutory instrument to which the Act would primarily apply if the instrument were made, the question should be referred to the Attorney-General whose decision would be final. The only two questions that could arise for decision are: (a) whether an authority was of the class referred to in sub-paragraph (v) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2; and (b) whether a statutory instrument was of the character described in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (c) of sub-section (1).  The amendment now proposes that, in lieu of the existing sub-section (2), the Attorney-General may certify (a) that a particular person or body empowered to make a statutory instrument is an authority of the class mentioned in sub-paragraph (v) of Section 2 (1) (b), or (b) that statutory instruments of a particular class are of the character described in sub-paragraph (ii) of Section 2 (1) (c).</P>
    <P>These new provisions, apart from the fact that they may be regarded as unimpeachable on any constitutional grounds, have the positive advantage that they will enable the Attorney-General to take action without having to wait for a question to be raised. For example, if a particular body or person considers itself not bound by the provisions of the Act or tries to evade the Act on the ground either that it is not a person or body of the class referred to in Section 2 (1) or that the statutory instruments it makes are not of the class described in the sub-section, the Attorney-General, if he considers it desirable and proper to do so, may give his certificate, and the person or body concerned must thereafter comply with the obligatory previsions of the Act in regard to the printing, publishing, etc., of its statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>I think that is a more satisfactory way than the other, which might be questioned as to its constitutionality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never like to say what might be raised, but it is not quite clear to me that this makes a very fundamental difference.  If it is the Minister's advice that this may cause <Col N="1483" /> trouble, no one wants a constitutional difficulty in this Bill and I think we should agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress the point set out in amendment No. 3.  The amendment now proposed by the Minister is an improvement.  It does at least limit the power of the Attorney-General to exclude from the provisions of the Bill in relation to printing and publishing certain instruments. When the Attorney-General forms the view that certain instruments may be excluded, he may be required to give a certificate.  In a subsequent amendment, No. 5, provision is made for the publication of the fact that the certificate is given. That is a considerable improvement, but I still have grave doubts as to whether this is a kind of function that should be handed over to the Attorney-General.</P>
      <P>I agree that someone must have the power to decide whether a particular document comes within the purview of the Bill or not and I am not questioning the choice of the Attorney-General. However, if the document is to be exempt from the obligations imposed on the Government by this Bill, information to that effect should be given to the chairman of each House of the Oireachtas.  That, in short, is what amendment No. 3 proposes to do.  It accepts the remainder of the scheme, but provides that the matter of the exemption of a particular instrument from the provision of the Bill will be formally reported to both Houses by the Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is more than that in the amendment?  In it the Senator proposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute therefor the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where in the opinion of the Attorney-General Section 3 of this Act should not apply to a particular statutory instrument then and in that case the Attorney-General shall refer the question whether in fact the said section shall apply to such statutory instrument to a committee consisting of a judge of the High Court <Col N="1484" /> appointed by the President of that court, a senior counsel appointed by the Benchers of the Inns of Court and a practising solicitor appointed by the Incorporated Law Society whose decision on the question referred to them shall be final.</P>
    <P>The committee is to decide whether an instrument shall be printed and numbered or not.  Surely the Senator is not serious on that?  The Attorney-General is the person to settle that question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder why this would not be regarded as serious.  We are introducing legislation to take the place of legislation which has been in existence but was not applied for a number of years.  The question arose before as to whether the Rules Publication Act applied here.  Had that Act been held to apply to any of the regulations made by Government Departments&mdash;with the exception of certain excluded regulations&mdash;there would be 40 days' notice before an instrument came into force.  That Act was set aside and has not been complied with.  Advertence was made to that fact here on one or two occasions in the last couple of years, and the Government have become conscious that the situation is not satisfactory. They are introducing legislation to provide for the printing and publishing of certain instruments; in other words, they are making an obligation on themselves, upon the Departments and upon subsidiary bodies, to have instruments made under statute printed by the Stationery Office, made available to the public and published in numbered form so that they can be referred to easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an obligation which has been accepted by the Government and, on the motion of a Minister, both Houses are asked to pass a law imposing that obligation on all Governments for all time.  I am suggesting that, if an exception is going to be made, if the suggestion is made by a Government Department or by any subsidiary body to whom this Bill applies that a certain instrument need not be published, the submission should be referred to three <Col N="1485" /> named persons.  I do not think there is anything extraordinary about that or anything unreasonable.  It is not good enough merely for a Minister to say he thinks it is nonsense.  It may appear so to him, but there must be some coercive reason why we should leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Attorney-General rather than in the hands of a more representative body consisting of three people, one of whom would be a judge nominated by the President of the High Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill puts a compulsion on the Government to do something it has not been required to do.  In this country it was held that this Act did not apply and in England a subterfuge was resorted to and Section 2 of the 1893 Act was availed of, whereby provisional orders were made and never made permanent, so that even in England this did not apply. Now, to facilitate the public, we are requiring the Government to print, publish and number in a series, certain items, compulsorily; and making provision that they print and number others.  Instead of the Government taking powers, it is simply imposing an obligation to do this, in order to facilitate the public and those interested. If anyone wants to go to the bother of contesting that, let him go to the court to contest the certificate of the Attorney-General.  One might do that now.  To say that we should refer it to a committee like that in amendment No. 3&mdash;well, I do not want to say it is nonsense, but it does not appeal to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is so used to taking drastic powers that when he comes down to this Bill he thinks it is virtuous, where it is a case of the Government instructing themselves to do something.  When he adds the words &ldquo;to facilitate the public&rdquo;, I suggest that that is nonsense. This is for the purpose of making it possible for the public to know what the law is and, where it is to facilitate the public to know the law, I would not use those words.  It would be definitely unjust to find people <Col N="1486" /> guilty of a law if they could not find out what it was.  I think this is not to facilitate the public at all.  It is a question of having published any legislation which has any interest for the public.  In general, the principle ought to be approved and it is only a question of finding the most practical manner of getting it carried out.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a copy shall be sent within seven days to each of the following: <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the National Library, the Law Library, Four Courts, Dublin; the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Registrars of the Supreme and High Courts, the Chambers of Commerce of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter was discussed on Second Reading the Minister stated that this was not the appropriate place to raise the question of delegated legislation.  He said that it should be raised on whatever Statute under <Col N="1487" /> which such delegation might be given. This is eminently the proper place to raise the subject of delegated legislation, because this Bill is the machinery by which it is controlled and safeguarded. If there are any dangers in delegated legislation, Parliament is given certain powers to annul, and this Bill seriously deals with efficacy of these powers.  Let us become factual and see what this Bill proposes.  A Statutory Order is made and at present is laid on the Tables of both Houses. That is to be continued under this Bill. What is the next intimation under the Bill that any citizen gets regarding such Statutory Order?  This is very important unless I am living in dreamland. The next intimation a citizen, whose business may be vitally affected by such Order, gets comes under paragraph (3) (b) which states that notice of the making of the Order shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Orders form the bulk of our legislation now. How soon is it likely, from past experience, that a citizen will get intimation? I got a printed Order dated January 11th in August.  The delay there was rather extreme, but generally there is a delay of three months from the date of printing.  I look at these Orders critically when I get them.  It will be three months under present conditions before statutory notification is given to any citizen of the making of an Order. That is the effect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose that a copy shall be sent within seven days to a number of people.  All those mentioned in the amendment will get statutory notices in seven days that the Order has been made.  The only people who will know of these Orders within a reasonable time if this Bill passes will be members of the Oireachtas when they get the Order Papers.  If the Dáil is in session a member will not know for three weeks or a month that such an Order has been made.  I know that the Minister will say that is not what happens now.  I am not concerned with that.  I am concerned about what the law prescribes.</P>
    <P>What happens now is that when an Order is made and laid on the Tables of both Houses stencil copies are sent <Col N="1488" /> to the Stationery Office, but as the supply is limited they are frequently sold out and latecomers cannot get copies.  Notice appears in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> under a short title, but that procedure is not necessarily by statute, but by what is called an act of grace on the part of the authorities.  I want to ensure that people who may be primarily concerned will get a copy of the Order within seven days.  Let the present practice continue and have the law that, in general, the making of such an instrument shall be made known in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and sent to the various bodies set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention one point in furtherance of what Senator Sir John Keane said.  I had occasion yesterday to look for an Order that was of vital importance to a great many people.  It was an Order controlling the profit margins in the whole textile industry.  It was not available in Government publications and would not be available in Government publications for some considerable time.  It was not available even in stencil form and only for the fact that I was a member of this House and was able to get it in the Library it would not have been possible for me to ascertain the position.  The Minister will agree with me at once that this is unsatisfactory.  The Minister may be able to say that nothing like that would happen in his Department but we will leave that aside.  There should be a rule whereby these Orders would be available for inspection as soon as they are made and I think there is a great case for Senator Sir John Keane's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite so sure that the amendment as it appears on the Order Paper is quite satisfactory, but if the Minister accepts the proposal <Col N="1489" /> that Sir John Keane propounds in his amendment there is no doubt that the draftsmen can look after the matter for the next stage.  The feeling I have is that Government Departments are aloof from the people and are often in a hurry when compiling Orders of various kinds.  They know that they have unlimited powers so far as the statute is concerned, to make Orders with the force of law and the temptation is to take the short cut and make these Orders with the force of law while disregarding the fact that interested parties may not be in the way of knowing that the Orders have been made.  I think that the Minister is in a totally different position from other Departments in this matter.  He is the custodian of the public interest. The Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Industry and Commerce have a different approach to this question.  The Minister I think should regard himself in this matter as the custodian of the people's rights, even the rights of the citizens against his own colleagues in their interests.  I urge him to accept the principle of the amendment and to reintroduce it on Report Stage in amended form so as to give expression to the intention of Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the principal section of the Bill. It requires that the information be printed as soon as may be after it is made.  Sub-section (1) provides that as soon as may be after it is made the instrument shall be printed, that is, the statutory instrument, and that after it is printed, notice of the making of it will be published and intimation given as to where copies may be obtained. But sub-section (2) destroys all this provision, or at least nullifies the effect of it.  It provides that subject to sub-section (3) the coming into operation of any statutory instrument to which the Act primarily applies shall not be affected by any non-compliance with sub-section (1).  It appears to me that if sub-section (2) remains in the Bill we are discussing something that is not valid, because if a Government Department fails to comply with the requirements of sub-section (1) their failure has no effect whatever with one exception.  The exception is that if a person is charged with an offence under an Order which has not been published, <Col N="1491" /> or printed, or made available, he is entitled to a dismiss unless it can be shown by the prosecution that he had a reasonable opportunity of knowing about the Order.  I have grave doubts about the wisdom of this procedure.  I ask the Minister to look at sub-section (2) and see whether it is necessary to provide against error.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision is merely precautionary.  It could happen that through an oversight by an official something of great importance might not be put into <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not think that is likely to occur, but I think that it is necessary to take some precaution against the possibility of it occurring.  It is not an invitation to people to neglect to publish or to print the Order.  I think we are entitled to make provision for an oversight.  That, really, is all that is intended.  This is a purely precautionary sub-section, and I think it ought to be left in the Bill. I agree that it can be represented as giving, say, a loophole to people to evade the responsibility of publishing and printing, but that is not so.  What is contemplated may never occur, but if it does I do not think the Orders should be invalidated because of an oversight on the part of some official.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to think the matter over between this and to-morrow.  Sub-section (1) provides that the Order must be printed and notice given where copies of it can be obtained, while sub-section (2) provides that a prosecution may be effectively brought, even though the Order is not printed and even though no notice is given as to where the Orders are to be obtained.  I think that if my amendment, which is to come on later, is accepted, it will make sub-section (2) a bit innocuous.  Senator Duffy has said that, if the document has not been printed, a dismiss will be given.  That is not so.  Paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) says that where:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the defendant proves that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> In my amendment I am proposing to delete the words &ldquo;the defendant proves that&rdquo; and insert instead the words: &ldquo;whenever the prosecution shall fail to prove&rdquo;.  If those words are inserted, sub-section (2) will not be as dangerous as it is at the moment.</P>

On the last occasion, I referred to a corresponding Act which became the law in Britain last year.  I have not a copy of it before me, but I am wondering whether there is any provision in it similar to sub-section (2) in this Bill.  I cannot remember that there is any such sub-section in that Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), paragraph (b), page 4, line 6, to delete the words &ldquo;the defendant proves that&rdquo; and insert instead the words &ldquo;whenever the prosecution shall fail to prove&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 3 provides that certain things must be done, such as the printing and publication of the notice, and sub-section (2), as Senator Duffy has pointed out, says that the instrument may be valid even though these things have not been done.  Section 3 says that where:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  a person (in this sub-section referred to as the defendant) is charged with the offence of contravening (whether by act or omission) a provision in a statutory instrument <Col N="1493" /> to which this Act primarily applies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the defendant proves that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>,</P>
    <P>the charge shall be dismissed, unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that at the said date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public or of persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This seems to be a revolutionary method of bringing a prosecution.  We all know that, according to the law, every defendant is innocent until he is proved guilty, and he can only be proved guilty by the prosecution making its case properly.  If he is prosecuted under a statutory instrument, and if the instrument is published and a copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is produced that will be held to be sufficient evidence of the making of the Order.  I have no objection to that, but here we say that if it has not been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&mdash;I do not care what the reason is&mdash;and if no notice has been given of where copies of it may be obtained, the position will be that a man may be prosecuted and an unprinted, type-written document may be produced in court.  If this section is left as it is, when that unprinted document is produced, instead of the defendant or his advocate having the power to say: &ldquo;I object to this; it is not a proper document because it does not comply with sub-section (1) of Section 3,&rdquo; the defendant must go into the box and swear that he has made a search in copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from the date of the making of the Order up to that date and could not find that the Order had ever appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    <P>In other words, you want the defendant to prove a negative before any case is made against him.  Under the law, as it is, no defendant need go into the box until all the proofs are complete.  Once the prosecutor says that he has completed his case he is not allowed to heel tap, but here, before the prosecution is completed&mdash;<Col N="1494" /> if the Section is allowed to stand as it is&mdash;the defendant must prove a negative&mdash;that he has searched for a copy of, the Order in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> Imagine asking a man from Connemara to say that he has searched copies of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from 1943 to 1948, and that no such notice has appeared in it. The section is an absurdity.  It is for the prosecution to prove something. The sub-section says further that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the charge shall be dismissed, unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that at the said date all reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public, or of persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even if the defendant proves that it did not appear in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, if the prosecution can prove that it has taken steps to bring this to the notice of the public or to the notice of persons likely to be affected, or to the notice of defendant, that will be held to be sufficient.  This certainly loads the dice against the defendant and in favour of the prosecution.  It makes the prosecution easy, and I think that is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he put in sub-section (2) for fear that by a mistake the document was not printed.  Why should a prosecution take place on an invalid document, and why should it lie on the defendant to prove that the document on which he is prosecuted is invalid?  Is it in the hope of getting him into the box so that he may be cross-examined and the case proved out of his own mouth, which is contrary to public policy?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to allow the Bill to be passed in this form because it is too revolutionary.  What I suggest is reasonable, if the prosecutor fails to prove that the notice was published, the charge shall be dismissed, and I leave in the rest,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;unless the prosecutor satisfy the court that on the date of the offence reasonable steps had been taken to bring the purport of it to the notice of the defendant and persons affected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the prosecution can prove, even <Col N="1495" /> though they fail to prove that it was printed, that the purport of the Order was brought to the notice of the defendant, there could be a prosecution, and that is going very far.  It provides too many alternative methods of convicting a man charged.  I have no sympathy with a man charged under these orders, but I think he ought to get fair play, and the law ought not to be radically changed as is being done in this case.  It is a dangerous precedent and I have seen cases of orders made by local authorities which have gone very far indeed towards presuming a defendant guilty before he has been proved guilty, and that is contrary to natural justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands at present and as, I feel, it will stand under this Bill, unless it is amended, an offender could have three months' grace, because an Order is not valid until printed and frequently the period before printing is three months, so that an offender would have a free run for three months, unless, as I read it, there was some publication by notice in the papers.  What happens, in practice, is that, although the printed Order may not appear for three months, there is in all cases of important Orders, such as price and anti-black market Orders, a notice in the papers.  That is reasonable enough.  If there has been a notice in the papers, an offender could be held to have had notice and to be liable.</P>

      <P>There is one point in the amendment which causes me some difficulty. Senator O'Dea is concerned with sub-section (3) and a later amendment of mine is also concerned with that sub-section.  I am wondering whether we fully appreciate what sub-section (3) deals with.  This is the exception mentioned in sub-section (2). It says that, subject to sub-section (3), the validity or effect or coming into operation of a statutory instrument shall not be affected by any noncompliance with sub-section (1), and then in sub-section (3) the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; is again used.  I understood the Minister to say earlier that this word was employed to designate the instruments made under paragraph (b) <Col N="1496" /> of sub-section (1) of Section 2 and that there would be other Orders to which the Bill did not primarily apply.  If that is so, this exception clause will not apply to all Orders.  It will apply only to Orders or instruments to which Section 2 primarily applies.  If that is so, even the defence provided for in sub-section (3) will not apply, in the case of certain instruments and Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with Senator O'Dea in this matter at all. The onus is certainly on the prosecution to show that reasonable steps were taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public or persons likely to be affected by it or of the defendant. As Senator Sir John Keane has said, when some of these Emergency Orders, like Price Orders, are made, they are not published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> for perhaps two months, but almost immediately they are broadcast and published in the papers, and the court has to be satisfied by the prosecution that reasonable steps were taken to bring to the notice of those concerned the fact that such Orders have been made. All that is provided in this paragraph (b) is a line of defence.  I understand that it is a fact that it takes a couple of months, as a rule, to get these Orders printed and that is a line of defence, if he cares to avail of it, though there is no obligation on him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a definite onus on the prosecution, as there ought to be, to establish that reasonable steps were taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the said instrument to the notice of the public or persons likely to be affected or of the defendant. That is an onus which is always on the prosecution to prove their case and I cannot see that there is anything revolutionary or against natural justice in the paragraph.  I would not stand over any such thing.  All we are doing is providing a line of defence.  We are not changing what has always been there, the provision that the prosecution must prove their case and show that reasonable steps were taken to bring it to the notice of those concerned. A couple of months might be <Col N="1497" /> vital in the case of a food prices Order which would get wide publicity.</P>

They need not prove it was brought to the notice of the defendant if it was brought to the notice of the public generally by publication in any paper, or in whatever other way it is done.

The prosecution must prove that.  If they do not read the papers, or listen in, surely they will not read <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  I do not see any better way than the steps taken at present. When one of these Orders is made, it is broadcast.  Everybody has not a wireless set.  Most shopkeepers, I would imagine, would read the papers. It would be a very backward place where the shopkeeper would not get a paper and I should imagine that the shopkeepers would get them.  I do not see any better way except that it is suggested now that a copy should be posted to every shopkeeper, which would be an impossibility.</P>

It is 54 years <Col N="1499" /> since the last Act was passed in the British Parliament in relation to publication of statutory instruments. This is our first Act dealing with this subject.  It may be 50 years before steps are taken to amend the law or to bring it into conformity with new conditions. Every statutory instrument that is made in the meantime, when controls and all these things have passed, will be affected by this Act.  I think that is what is wrong.

      <P>He can go in, if he wishes to make that defence.  He is not required to do it at all, and the court has to be satisfied that reasonable steps were taken to bring this to the notice of those likely to be affected and surely that is not changing the position.  The onus is definitely on the prosecution.  We are doing something that was never done before.  We are providing an extra line of defence.</P>

      <P>I do not see the difference in practice between a statutory instrument and an Act of Parliament. The ordinary defendant will not have personal knowledge of an Act of Parliament.  How does the person get to know?  He does not read the Act. He does not see the Act.  He gets to know.  He is not given statutory protection in the case of a statute, but I think he really deserves it in the case of a statute just as much as he does in the case of an instrument.  It is not my business but if I were the law adviser to the Minister I would say that that protection to the defendant was very dangerous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Dea from the theoretical aspect but I want to put a point of practice to the Minister.  How does he propose that the defendant shall prove that, at the date of the alleged contravention, notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>?  There is only one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>By getting copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one way that I know that can be done. Take for example an Order that is made on the 1st January next&mdash;the operative date in this Bill&mdash;and the prosecution is brought in the month of October, 1948.  There is only one way in which the defendant can prove that notice was not published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and that is by producing to the court every copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that has been published from January to October, getting the justice personally to look through every such copy and examine every such copy and satisfy himself that every such copy contains no notice of the instrument concerned.  It is going to be bad enough for ten months but when you consider that it may be an Order that has been made some years beforehand the thing becomes completely farcical. If it is going to be dealt with like this I should have to ask the Minister for Justice to make representations to his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide, in cases like this, adequate petrol allowances so that I can bring a lorry to the court to convey all the back copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that will be necessary.  It will mean that District Court proceedings in regard to this will be dragged out in a most ridiculous way.  It would be perfectly easy for the prosecution in any particular case to bring along and hand in the copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in which the notice has been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has been published. Then if the prosecution do that, that is that.  As the situation is, <Col N="1502" /> what has got to be done is that the defendant has to produce every copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and show that it is not in it.  As a matter of practice it is going to be quite farcical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the prosecutor will base the prosecution on the Order and then the judge will say: &ldquo;What is the date of the Order?  Have you a copy of it?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he will, and we are providing for where it has not been printed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and proof will have to be given that reasonable steps were taken, that is, that it was published in the Press.  The court, remember, has to settle this question. The court has to be satisfied that the thing had been brought to the notice of the people concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been very stupid.  I have not made myself clear to the Minister.  The defendant proves that at the date of the alleged contravention notice of the making of the said statutory instrument had not been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&mdash;sub-section (b).  Would the Minister tell me how the defendant is going to prove that?  That is the net issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If he wishes to avail of that line of defence, the only way I can see is that there will be a date on which the Order was supposed to be made.  I imagine that the court will have to be told that by the prosecutor. He will then have to search back the copies of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to see if they were published and if they were not the prosecution has to show they were published somewhere else.  He need not take that line if he does not wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a safeguard, but the words are clear that, if the Department fails to observe the provisions of sub-section (2), it does not affect the validity of the Order.  Let us assume we are dealing with an <Col N="1503" /> Order regarding the shooting of rabbits.  A guard or a gatekeeper takes a prosecution and exhibits a copy of an Order, saying: &ldquo;I am proceeding on this Order against the defendant&rdquo;.  The defendant's solicitor says: &ldquo;I never heard of it, it was never published; it is a statutory instrument which requires to be published under the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947&rdquo;.  The prosecutor refers to sub-section (2) and says: &ldquo;No, it was overlooked; the Department forgot about it; and because of sub-section (2) it is not for that reason merely invalid&rdquo;.  Then the defendant makes a case that he had no opportunity of knowing about the Order.  The prosecutor says: &ldquo;The Order was published in the Press and over the radio&rdquo;.  Is the defendant not then confronted with the task of proving everything that is in this section?  It is only when he has established the fact that it was not officially published that the prosecutor comes in to say that it was published in some other form.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to score a cheap point over the Minister, but there is a quite genuine thing which the Minister has not yet grasped.  No doubt, it is my stupidity in not making myself clear.  Senator O'Dea's amendment does not quite cover the situation, because he has left out the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; later on.  All I want to do is to save the time of the justice.  I want to ensure that, if the prosecutor is prosecuting under an Order notice of which has been published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, he will give to the justice the copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and, if he does not do so, he must prove the reasonable steps that the Minister has provided in lines 10 to 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only this difference between the Minister and myself.  I suggest that it shall be the duty of the prosecutor, where he is relying on <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and only where he is so relying, to hand the copy in to the court.  The present draft provides that where the prosecutor relies on <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, I, for the defendant, have to bring into court every issue since the date of the Order and hand them up to the justice <Col N="1504" /> to let the justice satisfy himself that the notice was not published in it.  It would be very much more expeditious if the prosecutor handed in the copy, which would end the matter and the proviso would not operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to provide for cases where it has not been published in an interim period.  He might show that, in that period and before the Order became operative, reasonable steps were taken to bring it to the notice of the people concerned that the Order had been made.  It would be a queer prosecutor who would not do that as the first thing.</P>

      <P>That only appears where the defendant has brought in all the copies of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and has shown that there is no notice in it.  I know perfectly well what will happen.  A client of Senator O'Dea's is prosecuted in June next for a breach of the Clothes Rationing Order.  The prosecutor goes into court and it is up to Senator O'Dea, first of all, to show that the Order was not published, before he puts the Department on proof of the reasonable steps.</P>

      <P>It is going to mean that a trifling point of legal technicality will waste the time of the court for a couple of hours, because the justice must go through each and every copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> to satisfy himself that the Order is not in it.

      <P>I hesitate to intervene from the point of view of a layman, but it seems to me that the Bill intends <Col N="1505" /> to provide for what is to occur in two different cases&mdash;one where it has been printed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the other where it has not.  Where it has been printed, the prosecutor relies on that and produces it.  Where it has not been printed, the judge will have to find out whether the Order has been published elsewhere or not, where it is claimed that it has not been published elsewhere.  How is the judge to find out?  The Bill says that &ldquo;the defendant must satisfy&rdquo;.  We think it better to say that &ldquo;the prosecutor must satisfy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two distinct cases.  Where a judge is satisfied&mdash;whether by admission of the prosecutor or by proof of the defendant&mdash;that it was not in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the prosecutor will have to proceed and show to the judge that reasonable steps were taken and that the person concerned knew, or ought to have known, all about it.  That does not arise if it was printed.  It will only arise where it was not printed.  All we are making this debate about is the one case where it was not printed.  Who is to satisfy the judge that it was not printed?  The Bill says it must be the defendant, that the onus of proof that it was not printed is on the defendant. <Col N="1506" /> Senator O'Dea and Senator Sweetman agree that that would save a lot of time and I think they have made a clear case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is practically the same provision in sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the English Act&mdash;the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In any proceedings against any person for an offence consisting of a contravention of any such statutory instrument, it shall be a defence to prove that the instrument had not been issued by His Majesty's Stationery Office at the date of the alleged contravention unless it is proved that at that date reasonable steps had been taken for the purpose of bringing the purport of the instrument to the notice of the public, or of persons likely to be affected by it, or of the person charged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no case of the defendant proving it there.</P>
