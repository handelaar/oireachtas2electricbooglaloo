    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the operative section of the Bill.  I intimated to the Minister on the last occasion that I proposed to raise again on this section the matters I then put before him.  I hope that, since then, he has had an opportunity of considering in greater detail and appreciating the point which is at issue.  I can understand the Minister's argument as regards the date on which the increases in pay and pension are to become operative.  Obviously, there must be some date and I entirely agree with him that, no matter what date is chosen, on the general issue there would be room for discussion <Col N="888" /> as to whether the increases should be payable before or after that date and whether the persons concerned were being generously treated or otherwise.</P>
      <P>However, that is not the case I made. The case I made was that the only relevant and fair date to take was the date the Minister and the Government chose, which was, I think, 6th May, 1945.  That was the date upon which the Minister and the Government introduced their scheme of demobilisation, the date upon which they decided it should be published that the Army was to be cut down after the war had passed and that it was to be cut down according to a certain schedule. That was the date on which the Minister and the Government urged soldiers to get out of the Army and into civilian employment.  That is the sole, net issue.  So far as I am concerned, the sole issue is that the Minister should not choose a date for one purpose and another date for a different purpose. The Minister determined, early in 1945, that men who could find employment should be pressed to take up that employment. I suggest to the Minister that the date when he took up that stand is the date from which all pensions should be calculated.  As I explained to the House on the last occasion&mdash;I do not want to weary members by repetition&mdash;the difference is approximately between 25 per cent. and 33? per cent.  Those members of the Army who stayed in the Army and got out between 1st September, 1946, and 1st November qualified for pensions at the increased rates.  But those members who, between May, 1945 and September, 1946, followed the advice given to them by the Government, who followed the Government's own request, have been penalised by having to accept pensions at a rate that is lower, by between a quarter and one-third, than that which is given to those who stayed on to the bitter end, even though urged by the Government to get out as soon as they could.  That does not seem to me to be a reasonable line to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister considers it in that way and considers that the reason these people got out was his own action, he will even now change the basis of <Col N="889" /> operation in relation to any men whose contract was expiring during the war but who were held on and who were told then, when the demobilisation paper was issued, to go back into civilian employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Senator on the last occasion when we were discussing this Bill, pensions can only be made payable on the basis of the remuneration which the individual receives and on no other basis that I know of.  It may be true enough to say that Government urged members of the forces to leave the Army if it was possible to secure employment&mdash;and I think everyone will agree that that was good and desirable advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If we refer to the regulations which were published in the White Paper, it will be found that it was only a case of urging and not of forcing an individual to leave the Army. We were urging individuals who could find suitable employment to get going while the going was good.  What we said in paragraph 59 of the White Paper regulation was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As soon as all concerned have had an opportunity of considering the question of further service in the light of the regulations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the demobilisation will commence&mdash;subject, of course, to the overriding consideration of national security&mdash;of those who apply for release from service on the grounds that they desire to resume their studies or that they have employment awaiting them. When the members of that group have been released, all others who apply for release will be demobilised, irrespective of whether or not they have employment awaiting them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Paragraph 60 then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The release will then follow in due course of all who have not permanent engagements in the Defence Forces as well as non-commissioned officers and men of the permanent force who have completed long-service engagements and are eligible for discharge on pension.  Demobilisation <Col N="890" /> of these categories will be the subject of constant liaison between the Department of Defence and the Department of Industry and Commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>During that demobilisation, no distinction was made between the married and the non-married personnel, except in the case of those who were mentioned in the first sentence of paragraph 60.  The result was that, unless a man actually applied to leave the Army, he was not demobilised.  For instance, if any individual made an application to his commanding officer and said that he desired to continue serving until the latest possible date, then, if he was what was described as a suitable soldier, he was allowed to continue serving until the end of the period of demobilisation&mdash;which was calculated to take roughly about 12 months, as we were demobilising men at the rate of 2,000 per month.</P>
    <P>Our difficulty was not the question of releasing men, but that of giving priority to those who were anxious to get out and to settle back into civilian life.  We had the type of individual who had not steady employment to go out to, such as the regular soldier who had been in the Army for quite a long number of years.  We did urge these men, and said that, if they could find suitable employment, we would release them and allow them to take up whatever employment was available.  However, I have had the matter examined and it would be quite impossible to make any other arrangement than the arrangement which has been outlined in the Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand at all why the Minister says it would be quite impossible.  If he wishes to imply that it would be impossible as a matter of machinery, I cannot agree at all.  As he says, it is perfectly correct that men were not put out unless they applied to leave.  The Minister himself admits that the Government urged them to apply if they had employment to take up.  I very deliberately refrained from making any comparison on this section until I had heard what the Minister had to say in the light of his consideration of it since last week; but to show that the Minister is wrong <Col N="891" /> when he says it is impossible, I must make the comparison with what was done elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The British Government brought in a demobilisation scheme.  They published a White Paper rather on the same lines as ours and they subsequently published notification to the Army personnel that there would be increased rates of pay, which would have effect from a future date; and in the same notification they published the announcement that the rates of pension would also be increased, and increased retrospectively to the date on which they had issued the White Paper, so that any man who had gone out of their Army, as a result of being urged to do so by the Government, would not suffer by way of a decrease of pension. It does appear to me that, if it is possible to operate in one country, it should be possible to operate in another.  Therefore, if the Minister means &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; in the sense of machinery, I am afraid that I cannot agree with him.  Of course, if he means that he is not going to do it&mdash;well, he is the Minister, not I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It means merely that the repercussions which would follow the amendment of this particular question would be such that innumerable other pensioners of various descriptions would be so affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared, of course, to do something that is going to have that type of repercussion.  If, for instance, we had mentioned in our White Paper the fact that we were going to increase pay, then, of course, automatically individuals would have been entitled to it from the 11th May, the date on which we agreed demobilisation was to begin.  We did not do that, and therefore the increase in Army pay has nothing to do with the demobilisation. The increase in pay was designed to attract, into what I might almost describe as a new Army, the type of personnel that we were anxious to attract into the Defence Forces.  That pay had no relation, good, bad or indifferent, to the people the Senator has been discussing, because they had the calculated rate of pay upon which their pensions were based.  The men who served <Col N="892" /> from the 2nd September also had the calculated rate of pay on which their pensions would be based.  That is how I see the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, there is one other thing I want to say on this Bill.  I do so because I do not want what the Minister stated on the last day to go without being dealt with. He seemed to suggest&mdash;I am not saying that he did so deliberately or anything like that&mdash;that I was alleging that the medical boards did not consider these disability pension cases sympathetically. That was not the case I made at all.  The case I made was that, on the existing law, the onus of proof rests on the soldier who claims to be disabled. I am quite satisfied that the law as it stands is sympathetically worked out and considered.  I do suggest, however, that, having regard to the difficulties in these cases, it is a wrong basis for the law to set.  I suggest that the correct basis for the law would be that, where a man is passed fit at an Army medical examination, if he subsequently becomes unfit during service, or during the emergency, it should be the business of the State to prove that his disability did not arise out of his service.  In other words, I am suggesting that the burden of proof in a particular case should be thrown on the State and not on the man.  It would, I think, in all the circumstances be fairer to look at the matter in that way.  If that were the law it would work out in a far more equitable manner than it does at present.  I do not want to let this matter go without mentioning it, because I am not suggesting <Col N="893" /> and did not suggest that the boards did not consider these cases sympathetically on the existing law.  It is the law and the burden of proof which it imposes that I suggest should be changed. I am not at all suggesting that the attitude of the board should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>If I in any way suggested such a thing as that which the Senator has mentioned, I certainly never intended it.  In fact, I have no recollection whatever of saying anything of the kind, or of suggesting that the Senator had deliberately stated that the board was unsympathetic.  I do not remember having said anything of the sort.  If I did, I want to withdraw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not say it.  It was only that such an implication might be taken from his words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the points that have been raised by the Senator, it must be presumed that the sympathy of the Army authorities is with the ex-soldier.  In the first instance, when a man is medically boarded out with some complaint which makes him unfit for military duty, the Army medical authorities examine the individual and give a decision as to whether his complaint has arisen out of service or not.  That record goes to the board.  At some subsequent date the ex-soldier makes an application for disablement pension.  The pensions medical board then examines the individual as well as the history of his case before making a decision.  I do not think it is wrong to make an applicant prove his case.  I think it is highly desirable that an individual who is making an application for money from the State should be made prove that he is entitled to it.  In spite of that, again, however, the medical authorities on the pensions board go out of their way to help the individual to prove that his disability was attributable to his military service.  If he can prove that, he is entitled to whatever pension the board is prepared to grant him.  I feel that is a reasonably fair method of dealing with an applicant's case.  How an individual is going to prove that his disease is attributable to his service is <Col N="894" /> a matter that is beyond me, because from my own experience I can state this: I have seen at a particular date strong, virile individuals in civilian life and in two or three months' time they were suffering from a complete breakdown. If these individuals had been members of the Army their breakdown in health would be ascribed by them to their military service.  Therefore, I do not quite understand how the board is to decide that question.</P>
      <P>It is on the history that the medical board is able to secure through its own efforts that the decisions are usually made.  I think that on the whole they are reasonably fair but of course every applicant who fails in his application is naturally dissatisfied and goes out and advertises the bad break he has been given by the board.  This is something that none of us can overcome.  As I said the decisions of the board, generally speaking, are reasonably fair.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 34, page 2, to delete the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments I propose to make for this amendment will also apply in general to amendment No. 2.  As far as I understand, it is not intended in this Bill to give any monopoly or specific privileges to house agents and auctioneers which they did not have before.  The object in the main is to protect the public.  It seems to me that there is a danger that the definition of house agent may mean that ordinary members of the public in their ordinary course of business may find themselves debarred, unintentionally I think, from doing certain things they ordinarily did in the way of business.  For instance, I am head of a private limited company. I am not negotiating for any property at the moment or am I likely <Col N="895" /> to do so but when I did, I did not consider the best way of negotiating for private property was by doing it myself. I sent a member of the staff, very often a junior member of the staff, to make inquiries regarding the letting of a premises.  He would be doing that for reward because he was a member of the company but it seems to me that in accordance with the strict definition of house agent here in this Bill he would be doing it as a house agent.</P>
    <P>I do not know how a limited company would do this business now.  I think that negotiations for the purchase of a house, certainly negotiations for the letting of a house, not ordinarily the work of a house agent for reward and not involving advertising on behalf of the client and all the other necessary work involved should not apply.  I am putting this down for the purposes of calling attention to what may be a restriction.  It may not be in the proper form.  I think there is a very marked difference between the sale of a house which generally involves advertisement and other work which you will not send a junior member of the staff to do.  The definition here in the Bill may have the effect of restricting legitimate work of the type I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Douglas about this.  I think his point is a very good one.  Very often people are sent to an auctioneer's or to a solicitor's office to purchase a house on behalf of their employers and they would be held to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; under this definition.  It is a very big question and I think the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; should be left out of the section altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Senator Douglas's most apposite amendment will the Minister explain how a limited company will sell a house at all?  Supposing I am a paid director of a limited company that has a house for sale and somebody comes directly to me.  What am I to do?</P>

      <P>We could, of course, <Col N="896" /> discuss it on those lines, but perhaps Section 6 would be more appropriate for dealing with the Senator's remark. Allowing for the fact that I did not want to go to this firm of auctioneers, how would I proceed to sell?  I think the Minister will have to tighten up his definition.  I think Senator Douglas has made an unanswerable case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this with the draftsman and he says that a servant is not in the same position as an agent. A person sent by a company is the servant of the company or a director of the company.  He certainly is not an agent and, consequently, it is not a restriction. I am advised that that is the case and to me it seems reasonable. An agent is a person who may have no connection with the firm at all.  He may hold a deposit and we want to make sure that anyone who is an agent of that kind is a person who can be safely entrusted with a deposit.  If a person is a director of a firm or a servant there is no need to put him in the same position as an agent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be perfectly clear if we state that it means a person who is not a servant.  Servants can also be agents.  Take this point of view for the purpose of getting it on record so that it can be discussed with the draftsman afterwards.  If director of a company goes along to an auction and bids for a property, he is acting as a servant of the company.  If he is the highest bidder and signs a contract for his company he is still a servant of the company, but the <Col N="897" /> moment he signs a contract he also becomes an agent of the company.  The same applies to private negotiations. He may be negotiating as a servant, but there will come a time, if his negotiations come to fruition, when the vendor may ask him to bind his principal company as agent, and then he will be both servant and agent.  If, as Senator Douglas suggests, the definition was extended to include an agent who is not a servant, it would make the matter clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask whether the Minister gains anything by retaining the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; in the place from which Senator Douglas proposes to delete it?  He has already in the definition section a prohibition against purchasing, against inviting offers to purchase and against selling.  Is there any advantage in retaining the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; where it has reference to negotiation for purchase only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment, I take it he will delete the word where used in that connection altogether.  The amendment suggests that it be deleted from line 34, but I think it also ought to be taken out of lines 32 and 33.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw a very clear distinction between the two uses of the word.  It seems to me that inviting offers to purchase is the work of a house agent and I do not want to stop that.  Negotiating for purchase is not necessarily, or even frequently, the work of a house agent.  With regard to the other point, the Minister says it is met because the employee would not be an agent.  I am not satisfied that a person cannot be both, but, apart from that, I do not think there is any need to restrict to house agents the negotiating for purchase, and that is the reason I propose to delete the word in that particular place.  In the earlier case, the inviting of offers for purchase in the form in which we have it is pretty generally known and regarded as house agents' work.  I agree entirely with what Senator Duffy says.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable to prevent loopholes.  If we do not leave the word &ldquo;purchase&rdquo;, people styling themselves house finders or something of that kind may take deposits and defeat the whole object of the Bill which is to protect the public.  There is the danger that a person may call himself a house finder and take deposits while being unlicensed. All he is required to do is to take out a licence and give an opportunity for any one who may think he is unsuitable to make an objection before the court.  It is not a very big obligation to place on a person who proposes to engage in this business.  I can see little reason for leaving anything which appears to provide a loophole and that is why I think we ought to make it as difficult as possible for undesirable people to evade these provisions.</P>

You do not object to Paddy Murphy advertising a house for sale for £2,000 or best offer if it is going to be <Col N="902" /> quite certain that Paddy Murphy will not get a deposit on that house?  I agree with the Minister he will have to be certain that he will leave no loophole whereby he could get a deposit.

      <P>The Minister will appreciate I am speaking from recollection but I think the definition of an auction is there at the moment in one of the old Revenue Acts.  That definition does not at present include &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo; and it is because it does not include &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo; that these people do not at present have to take out an auctioneer's licence but are able to work on a hawker's licence. Now from this on, the other auction, which is not to be found in the old Revenue Act, is to be found in this Bill, which does include &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of 1845 does not refer in the definitions specifically to a Dutch auction but, in effect, it refers to a Dutch auction because the words used are &ldquo;either by increasing upon the biddings made by others or decreasing of sums named by an auctioneer or a person acting as an auctioneer or other person.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is the accepted meaning of a Dutch auction.  Perhaps that could be put in instead of the definition I quoted, so that it would cover any offer at a decreased price.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise on this section a subject which I mentioned on the Second Reading.  In sub-section (2) (b) provision is made for excluding certain persons from the scope of the Act.  This paragraph states that sub-section (1) of this section does not apply to &ldquo;an auction conducted by, or by an officer of, a sheriff, under-sheriff or county registrar&rdquo;. I am not resisting the proposal to exclude the sheriff, under-sheriff or county registrar but I want the Minister to explain what is meant by &ldquo;an officer of&rdquo; a sheriff.  That should be defined or the phrase should be taken out completely.  My view is that the words &ldquo;by an officer of&rdquo; should be cut out because we do not know what is meant by an officer of a sheriff.  Does it mean a bailiff?  Is he to be permitted to discharge the functions of an auctioneer?  If he is already so permitted, I object to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (d), sub-section (1) of Section 6 will not apply to &ldquo;an auction, under any enactment relating to distress in respect of rates, conducted by a rate collector or by any person authorised by him&rdquo;. Again, I am not objecting to the rate collector being permitted to carry on an auction but I am objecting to the addition of the words &ldquo;or by any person authorised by him&rdquo;.  That is going very far.  If, in cases of distress, the auction is not to be conducted by the rate collector, then it should be conducted by a licensed auctioneer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Senator Duffy not to press this matter because it would put expense on very poor people. These are people who would have been seized upon for debt and it generally happens that they, or somebody on their behalf, buy in the stock&mdash;perhaps a cow or a calf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that that makes any great difference, either. Certain abuses have occurred in certain counties which had an unfortunate effect on poor people.  I knew of cases in which people used to make a trade of coming in and buying such stock at very low prices.  These people made fortunes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there is much point in the argument which has been put forward.  If there is no objection to a sheriff or a rate collector acting as auctioneer, I do not see what objection there can be to one of his clerks so acting.  That happens at present.  I should be glad if there were no such things as seizures but, as long as there are, we must have provision for auction of the seized property.  My memory is not sufficiently good to recall the point which Senator Sweetman made on the last occasion regarding paragraph (h) of sub-section (2).

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Nothing in this section shall prevent a person who is an architect from negotiating for the purchase of a house or the taking of a letting on behalf of a client or a person who is a regular employee of a corporate body negotiating for the purchase of a house or the taking of a letting on behalf of that corporate body.</P>
      <P>This amendment has some bearing on the discussion which has already taken place, which shows the importance of public discussion in Committee of Bills of this kind and the important points that might arise&mdash;and which generally are far better dealt with in this House than elsewhere.  As I am passing bouquets, I will add that that is so particularly when we have a Minister who meets us like the present Minister. Even what start as small points often turn out to be important ones.  Part of this proposed new section deals with a matter which the Minister has said already he will consider.  The other portion deals with a matter which is of some importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be quite unnecessary if the Minister did not consider that he must keep the words &ldquo;negotiates for the purchase of&rdquo;.  It is not unusual, and in some cases it is desirable, that a person interested in property would employ an architect to examine it and estimate the cost of the necessary repairs. He finds out the price.  He is not paid for negotiating but is paid as an architect.  The Minister may tell me he is an employee in that case and not an agent, but I think it is the usual practice and should not be excluded.  It is very often the best and safest way to tackle the question of buying such property. The amendment would not do <Col N="908" /> in its present form, so I will not press it.  It should not be impossible to employ an architect and send him to negotiate for the purchase.  In the question of sale, I do not see any need for a house agent coming in at all. The architect is a competent person and the best one to do the preliminary negotiations.  We obviously have to exclude the solicitor, as he has to act for the purchase and sale, but the architect should not be excluded.  He certainly gets no deposit and there is no ground for excluding him, but I think he is excluded under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent an architect being employed and giving a report as to the structure of a house and as long as that right is preserved there is no attempt in the Bill to infringe on his functions.  I disagree with Senator Douglas when he goes so far as to say that, after the examination by the architect, the architect could become a negotiator for the purchase of the property.  I do not think that should be his function at all.  He is perfectly free to examine the property and make a report, and take a week over it if necessary.  A lot of the things which it is most essential that the prospective purchaser should know about are more within the engineer's ambit than the architect's, but while either the engineer or the architect is perfectly free to be employed by any prospective purchaser, it would not be at all proper that they should continue as negotiators for the purchase of the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the view which I understood from the Minister in the beginning, that is, that he is not proposing to change the law or the practice, in so far as he can safeguard the public against the taking of deposits without doing so.  He may have to change the practice but does not want to change it at the moment.  In some cases, where you know the price that is being asked, you send an architect to make a report on the value at the particular price, but in other cases the person who is thinking of purchasing does not want to disclose himself at all or make known the price.  In some cases, an architect simply sends a report and nothing more is heard about <Col N="909" /> it.  Senator Hearne has no objection to that.  In some cases, the architect is sent to the country and finds out the price and does something in the nature of negotiations.  He does not finalise it and do the solicitor's job, but in this Bill there seems to be the danger that he would find himself caught.  A very simple amendment would prevent that and I think the first part of my amendment would be perfectly safe to have in the section.  I have no objection to adding the word &ldquo;engineer&rdquo;.  If I had been drafting this amendment after listening to what Senator Sweetman said, I would probably have put in the words &ldquo;but cannot take a deposit&rdquo; in order to make it clear, although it does not arise in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the practice of sending a man to vet a house, but as far as I know any man could sign himself an engineer or an architect, as there is no registration for either.  He might be any type of engineer or architect and have no legal standing and no one might contradict him.  We are trying to prevent such people taking deposits.  In fact, it would be entirely wrong for us to try to prevent people employing competent persons to examine a house.</P>
      <P>People often send someone who knows something about buildings, although he may not be an architect at all; and they may value his opinion more highly than that of a well-known architect, as they may think he would take more care.  That would be a very wise precaution.  We want to prevent those people negotiating the purchase, as that would give them the loophole to take deposits and would bring in undesirable people.  We are not trying to change anything but to prevent dishonest people getting money they should not get.  I am satisfied the other part is not necessary and I will look into it.  As regards the second part of the amendment, dealing with a corporate body, I undertake to look into that.</P>

I introduced a Bill to achieve that purpose, <Col N="910" /> but it was opposed by the Government of which the Minister is a member.

      <P>The Minister is a member of the Government that opposed the principle set out in that Bill.  I think the Government were wrong in doing so, and that architects should be registered.  The Minister says they cannot be recognised now because they are not registered.  I do not know what the general practice is in this matter, but I know that in the courts architects and engineers holding certain degrees are recognised as witnesses in their professional capacity.  Therefore, it is true to say that they are recognised by certain institutions of the State.  I am not going to press this particular point because the Government will not agree to it.  The Minister has promised to look into the second part of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) a person collecting rents not exceeding in value £200 per annum which he has collected on behalf of the same landlord or landlords, or his, or their predecessors, for a period of at least seven years before the operative date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out that there are certain persons to whom sub-section (2) does not apply.  They are a licensed auctioneer, a solicitor, a person acting as an agent for a Minister of State, the Commissioners of Public Works, the Irish Land Commission or any person authorised to acquire land compulsorily.  I want to add to the list of exempted person collectors of rents dealing in small sums.  There are a great many of them in the different towns.  I was rather conservative when drafting the amendment, and set out in it persons collecting rents not exceeding £200 a year.  I think I should have taken a very much <Col N="911" /> bigger figure.  A person collecting rents that do not exceed £200 per annum, and who has been collecting them on an estate for a period of at least seven years should not, I think, be obliged to give a bond.  It would be rather difficult to ask a man who is collecting small weekly sums to give a bond for £2,000.  His whole commission on collecting £200 would be only £10 a year. If he had to give a bond, the cost to him would be not less than £15 a year. Therefore, if the sub-section were to be operated as it stands it would exclude those people who collect small sums annually.  Perhaps, instead of £200, I should have put into my amendment £800 or £1,000.  I do not think the man who has been collecting small sums in rent over a period of seven years should be asked to give a bond. It is probably because he is an honest man that he was selected for that position. I should point out that the amendment will not entitle him to collect rents for any estate other than the estate on which he has been collecting rents during the past seven years.  The amendment is a mild one, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept it.</P>

      <P>The objection to the amendment, as it stands, is that if any person is collecting rents of less than £200 a year for one estate he can act for the letting of houses not merely on that estate but on other estates.  What Senator O'Dea is anxious about is this &mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;that where a person has been acting as rent collector on an estate that he can continue to make lettings for that estate, but for that estate only.  I do not think that, point is quite covered in his amendment, but that, I think, is what is in his mind.  All this brings us back to the point on which I stated, that the real kernel of the trouble is the taking of a deposit and not the making of a letting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I would like to put some points to the Minister arising out of some remarks that he made to-day.  He said that the purpose of the Bill was to see that no undesirable people got into the auctioneers' business.  Every right-thinking man will, of course, subscribe to that principle.  Is there not, however, the danger that when this Bill becomes law quite a number of very desirable auctioneers will be forced out of business under its provisions?  Within the last week or so quite a number of auctioneers, as well as the representatives of some insurance corporations, have interviewed me.  Judging by what some of the representatives of these insurance <Col N="913" /> corporations have said to me, they would seem to be getting rather dubious about accepting a bond for £15 from an auctioneer to cover the very serious financial obligations that may arise under this Bill.</P>
      <P>That is one aspect of the matter.  Let me take another.  I have been an auctioneer for quite a long time&mdash;since 1915.  I have knowledge of the whole western part of my county and I have known only one person in this long period who defaulted in his obligations to his clients.  I have before my mind four auctioneers, each with a small plot of land, four or five cows and a small shop.  They do a small but very satisfactory auctioneering business as well, and have got the confidence of the people in their district.  Combined with their little business the auctioneering enables them to maintain themselves and their families in a proper atmosphere and to educate their families. I also know of a rate collector who is also an auctioneer but he, of course, had to get bonds to submit to the county council and, in addition, the names of two people of good financial standing willing to sign a guarantee that if he defaulted they would make good the deficiency.  It is going to be difficult to get the insurance people to supply the necessary bonds.  Take the small country auctioneers.  They must be in good financial standing and in a position to get the necessary imprimatur from their bank manager. They may not be able to get that and the Minister, in their case, might force them out of business, even though they are respectable, decent people and in their business dealings have the respect of the community.  So far as the insurance corporations are concerned, I discussed the position with one auctioneer who was about to sell a property.  I asked him what it would make, and he said about £9,000.  The deposit on that would be £2,250, plus the fees.  I asked him how long he would be in possession of that money, and he said he would have it until the sale was completed, which was often unreasonably long, due to the dilatory tactics of the legal profession.</P>

      <P>I had thought that there would be no difficulty in getting the necessary bonds from an insurance corporation.  I thought that all an auctioneer would have to do would be to fill up the necessary forms, pay his premium and take them to the court for his licence, but since this Bill was discussed in the Dáil and in the Seanad the position seems to have changed.  I think that this House should be slow to do anything that would have the effect of putting decent people out of business, people who have always discharged their obligations. I have been in this trade or business since 1915, and the fact that only one person in the business defaulted, so far as I know in my district, is evidence of the integrity and capacity of the people engaged in this business and of whom I am proud to be one.</P>

I think the Senator is unduly apprehensive in this matter.</P>

      <P>It seems harsh to ask a small man to advertise each year in respect of this.  His application to the court is going to be granted automatically unless certain objections are made. Once a man is given a certificate of qualification he should continue to hold it until there is an objection.  When there is an objection he would have to go back into court.  Take the present circumstances in regard to the intoxicating liquor licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person purchases a licensed premises he has to advertise in the papers and go before a district justice to show that he is a fit and proper person.  After that he applies automatically <Col N="916" /> each year for a renewal of the licence, without advertising, and gets it as a matter of course.  When there is an objection, however, he must again go before the court.  I think it is rather unfair for a mall man to have to go through this procedure set out in the Bill each year to get his licence renewed when there is no objection. Unless the Gardaí serve notice of objection he should be able to have his licence renewed without going through this procedure.  The district justice could, if necessary, direct that an advertisement be inserted, but compulsory advertisement every year appears to be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Sweetman's view.  We frequently hear the lawyers abused in this House, and I think it is commendable that we should have Senator Sweetman and Senator O'Dea agreeing on this point. What would automatically happen is that most of these auctioneers would not attend the court at all, but would brief a solicitor going there to seek a renewal of their certificates.  In addition, it will mean advertising in the Press as in the case of dance halls.  I do not know what the position in other counties is, but, in respect of one particular session of the court every year, our local paper carries scarcely anything but advertisements with regard to applications for renewal of dance hall licences.  This provision is unnecessary, undesirable and onerous, and unless the intention is to penalise the auctioneer, it is not a method which should be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the suggestion made by Senator Sweetman, with the proviso that it would be necessary to make some arrangement for an examination to see that the auctioneer's or agent's bond was covered yearly.  I could quite see a man making his application in the first instance, having the required bond, and then, if there were no examination, allowing that bond to lapse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman and I are speaking against the interests of our profession in arguing that it is too bad that an auctioneer should have to apply every year, particularly if he <Col N="917" /> has to engage a solicitor and go to the trouble and expense of going to court to give evidence on his own behalf. Perhaps the point could be met in another way.  A licence is renewed every year as a matter of course, unless at least seven days before the date of the court before which the application is to be made, notice is served of an objection, and if a section were added to the Bill to prevent the making of an objection to the renewal of an auctioneer's licence, unless seven days' notice had been served, it would get over the difficulty.  The applicant would then not have to appear either personally or through a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An answer to Senator Sweetman's contention may be found in Sections 12 and 13.  Section 12 provides that a certificate of qualification shall be granted, subject to Section 13, which sets out the several grounds upon which a certificate may be refused.  It may so happen that, since the previous grant of the certificate, an auctioneer may have become bankrupt or his licence may have been suspended under Section 18, and a situation may have arisen which, in order to safeguard the public, requires that the position of each individual auctioneer should be scrutinised at regular intervals.  Yearly intervals are a reasonable provision to make.  I am personally of opinion that the provisions of the Bill are far preferable from the public point of view to the suggestions put forward by Senator Sweetman. The object of the Bill, namely, to protect the public against fraudulent auctioneers holding deposits, would be defeated if these provisions were not included.  In fact, these provisions are the essential machinery of the Bill and, without them, the Bill would be worthless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not at all agree with Senator Ryan that the Bill would be worthless without these provisions. It is possible to provide safeguards to ensure that a person will not have committed any of the offences set out in Section 13 without putting him to the expense of advertising and of making application in court.  Under Section 8, the certificate of qualification must be <Col N="918" /> not less than 28 days old, and, further, there must be a certificate from the accountant which must not be more than 28 days old, which covers Senator Hawkins's point.  Surely it should be possible to provide a system under which it would not be necessary for an auctioneer to go to the expense of advertising and attending personally in court, unless objection was taken?</P>
      <P>While saying that, I want to make another point which arises on this section but which is perhaps also covered by Section 13.  It hangs on the point of annual application.  Is it suggested by the Minister that this application for a certificate of qualification should be every year a court hearing at which it would be open to an objector to adduce evidence of the fact that, during the previous year, the auctioneer had been guilty of such disreputable behaviour, without having committed an offence under Section 18, as would debar him? Although I think an auctioneer should not be put to the expense of advertising and employing a solicitor every year, I claim equally there should be a provision by which the position could be safeguarded, and by which, if anybody had evidence that a particular auctioneer had been guilty of improper conduct, he could bring that conduct before the district justice.  The only way of dealing with it that I can see is that there should be some procedure by virtue of which a person, on giving so many days' notice, would be enabled to ensure that there would be no renewal for such an applicant, unless the district justice heard the application in open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me in this, that the situation which will arise under the section, as he has framed it, is that an auctioneer, Patrick Murphy, will put an advertisement in the local paper, and will then have to put in an application for a licence. He is going to have to get that application filed in the District Court and is going to have to put a stamp on it. He is going then to have to bring along an advertisement to the District Court clerk and then he is going to have to come along on the day of the court and pay Senator O'Dea or myself a fee for saying: &ldquo;Will it please your worship to grant Patrick Murphy's licence.&rdquo; That is all that will happen.  The justice <Col N="919" /> will say, &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and we will sit down.  It is going to be dealt with on a purely routine basis like that and I do not think it is reasonable to put the auctioneer to that expense in a routine matter.  I would suggest that the routine should be that the licence is granted by the district justice in his office as a matter of course.  Then there will be no necessity to advertise or to employ a solicitor; but if there is any objection, then the district justice must hear the application in open court and, if the justice is not quite satisfied, that he will have power to direct an advertisement to see if it was only Sweetman who was objecting to the licence or whether there were ten or 20 other people objecting as well.</P>

      <P>I do not think it covers it.  It is a different person altogether. A different person may conduct the business from the person who carries out the auction.  I should have added: &ldquo;To those nominated to carry on the auctions on his behalf&rdquo;.  That could have been added.  I think if that amendment is not made a district justice will have no power to consider the character of the person nominated and it is the person nominated to conduct auctions who is capable of doing undesirable work.  You can have a different manager and a different person carrying out the auctions.  You may have the manager very good and the person carrying out the auctions very bad, and it would not do if the district justice has not power to inquire into his character as well as the character of the applicant.  In other words, the person nominated to carry out the auctions should not be able to shelter himself behind the name of an individual of good character. Supposing, for example, a man wants to get a licence and he says to himself: &ldquo;I am not a man of good character.  I can go to John Brown&rdquo;, and he says to John Brown: &ldquo;You are a man of good character.  I want you to apply for a licence and nominate me to carry out auctions on your behalf&rdquo;. This man then carries out the auctions and nobody knows what arrangements exist between the two.  Possibly the man carrying out the auctions will have everything to do with the auctions, including the handling of deposits and the receiving of commissions. That is what I want to ensure, that such a person will not be able to get a licence under the name of a person of good character.</P>

      <P>There are matters to be considered over and above the question of deposits.  For example, a person who conducts auctions is able to do puffing of an improper nature.  He may know that certain persons will bid any price for a particular property in order to get it. He may dishonestly extract money from one of those persons by pretending he has got bids which he has not, in fact, got.  That has happened time after time and is a practice which ought to be stopped.  Such an auctioneer may say that he has a bid of £5,000, without having any such bid, and induce an anxious purchaser to give a price entirely beyond the value of the property.  Apart from mere embezzlement, such a person can do a tremendous number of things.</P>

      <P>On the section, I am in a little difficulty in regard to paragraph (a).  I am afraid it will be construed in different ways in different parts of the country.  A possible construction is that the applicant has done nothing which is prohibited by Section 18&mdash;in other words, that he has not been guilty of an offence involving fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust. One district justice may take that interpretation. Another may be of opinion that he had touted for business and may strike his application out. Another district justice might take a mid-course between the two.  What the Minister really wants to say in that paragraph is that the applicant's character is such that the district justice thinks he is sufficiently reliable to be entrusted with somebody else's money.  That is what the Minister wants to say but he does not say that.  There is far too much possibility of divergence in practice in the various district <Col N="925" /> court areas under this paragraph as it is framed.  It should be possible to insert a more clear-cut phrase which would make for more uniform practice and leave less to the opinion of the district justice, though leaving him a proper discretion.</P>
      <P>Very recently, I came across a practice by a person who is a licensed auctioneer.  I mention this case because I think the practice is so reprehensible that the district justice should be empowered to treat it as an objection if he has evidence of it.  As the section stands, it might be construed too tightly by one district justice, while another district justice might hold that he had no power of refusal unless one of the actual offences as set out in Section 18 had been committed. The auctioneer to whom I referred went to a man who was not of very great education.  He put before him a letter which he said he wanted him to sign.  He knew that this person was looking for premises of a particular sort and he asked him to sign a letter in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To &lsquo;Patrick Murphy,&rsquo; Auctioneer &mdash;Dear Sir, I hereby appoint you as my sole agent to purchase and negotiate on my behalf for the premises known as&mdash;&mdash;.  I agree that I will not buy those premises from anybody else but only through you. If I am to buy those premises I will pay therefor the sum of £x.  If you&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is to say, the auctioneer&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;buy those premises at less than £x, the whole of the difference is to belong to you.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That letter was put in front of a man and he was asked to sign it and the premises were not even named in the letter but were to be put in later after the signature had been put in.  I want this Bill to be crystal clear on the point that, if evidence of a case like that is brought to a district justice and he believes it, that man would not be allowed to carry on as an auctioneer.</P>

      <P>On Section 13 I agree with Senator Sweetman that clause (a) is very wide.  It must mean that the applicant in the opinion of the district justice is not a fit and proper person to hold the certificate.  District justices may differ and auctioneers may suffer.  In this Bill there is no provision for an appeal from the decision.  Section 8 provides that the Revenue Commissioners shall grant to a person who applies therefor a licence to carry on the business of auctioneer under the name specified in the licence. The application shall be accompanied by a certificate of qualification which is defined in Section 2 to mean a certificate under Section 12.  In Section 12 we find it is a certificate granted only by a justice of the District Court. Therefore, it would appear that a judge of the Circuit Court has no power to give a certificate of qualification.  The Bill provides that the certificate necessary in order to secure a licence from the Revenue Commissioners is one given by a district justice.  You cannot have an implied right of appeal from a decision of the district justice in this case and, if it is intended that auctioneers should have a right of appeal to the Circuit Court, there should be an express provision in the Bill enabling such an appeal to be taken.</P>
      <P>I do not see that there should be any objection, from the point of view of the public, to the insertion of a right of appeal.  We know that up to recently it was believed there was no right of appeal to the Circuit Court in the case of the refusal to grant a publican's licence, but apparently that has been overcome.  I do not think the reasons which applied in that case would apply in this.  Therefore, as this Bill imposes obligations and liabilities on auctioneers in the interests of the public, no auctioneers should be penalised through any chance decision of a district justice, which would be final so far as that auctioneer was concerned and which might put him out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> The auctioneer should be afforded an opportunity, if his certificate is refused by the district justice on any of the grounds in Section 13, to appeal to the Circuit Court.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider, between now and the Report Stage, the advisability of inserting a provision to give the right of appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete paragraph (a)  and substitute therefor the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the deposit shall be of the value of £2,000 when the principal place of business or the residence of the applicant shall be in a county borough or in a town the population of which exceeds 20,000, and where the residence or principal place of business of the applicant shall be elsewhere, shall be of the value of £1,000.</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) it is provided that there shall be a deposit of £2,000. Senator Madden was afraid there would be a difficulty in the way of certain auctioneers getting security.  That would apply particularly to people in certain towns.  In the smaller towns, property is not at all more than a trifle as compared with the values in the larger towns.  It is impossible to get more than £1,000 or £1,500 for a house in a small town, or £2,000 at the outside. A quarter of that purchase money would be very small.  It would be in the hands of the auctioneer only for about a month.  Senator Madden says it is sometimes longer than a month and blames the solicitor for the delay.  It is easy for him to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has no responsibility at all, but the unfortunate solicitor who has to do the conveyance for the purchaser has to be certain that he gives a good title and very often he has a case where the title is not perfect.  And the people who have to be got to join may be in America.  I had a case in Dublin where I purchased an estate.  I found that the vendor had no title whatever.  The only person who could give title was in America.  We had to get a conveyance <Col N="929" /> from the person in America before we could get title.  That may have caused some delay, but I acted as quickly as I possibly could.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the delay arises from the fact that the auctioneer draws the contract instead of giving it to a solicitor to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That happens sometimes: that the contract provides for, or does not provide for, certain matters which ought to be set out in the conditions. In any event, it does not seem fair to treat people dealing in hundreds of pounds in the same manner as you would treat people dealing in thousands of pounds.  We know that properties in Dublin&mdash;some public houses&mdash;have been sold for £30,000 and £40,000, and that some very big sales take place in towns with a population of over 20,000.  Take the town of Galway, for example.  Some time ago a house was purchased there for £8,000.  That was considered to be a very large sum of money for a house in the town of Galway.  Since then a house in the suburbs of Galway&mdash;I admit there was a good deal of land going with it&mdash;was sold for £12,000. These would be considered exceptional prices in provincial towns.  In the case of the £8,000 purchase&mdash;the deposit would be only £2,000&mdash;the purchase money would be in the hands of the auctioneer for say a month or six weeks, and would then be handed up to the vendor.  The auctioneer would have no more responsibility in the matter.  It is a different matter when you put a small man in the position of having to depend entirely on the goodwill of an insurance company.  In other words, you are leaving it to the insurance companies to say who are to be auctioneers and who are not.  That is the trouble as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Madden has pointed out that, in the case of rate collectors, they have to apply for a bond, but that they are not given it until they get two other men who will go security for them.  I suggest that it is a rather difficult matter in a small town to get men who are sufficient security for £2,000.  It might be difficult for an auctioneer to find friends of that capacity.  I am afraid that the Bill will <Col N="930" /> put a good number of auctioneers out of business, especially in the smaller areas.  Senator Duffy pointed out on the last occasion that a great number of country auctioneers auction only meadows once a year.  They do not even receive the money for the auctioned meadows.  It is given to the owner, so that they have very little responsibility.  They just make a few pounds a year selling meadows on conacre or small patches of land.  They find it very hard, some of them, to pay the auctioneer's fee of £10 a year.  It would be entirely out of the question for them to give security for £2,000. That would simply drive them out of business.  I think some differentiation ought to be made between the auctioneers in the large towns and those in the smaller towns.</P>
    <P>I put in this amendment because I felt that we were rushing this Bill too much, and that it might be better if the operative date were fixed for next year instead of this year.  If, as the Bill provides, it is to come into operation in July next, that will leave very little time for the forms that will have to be prepared and the applications that will have to be dealt with.  Therefore, I suggest that the operative date be fixed for 1948.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  If the operative date is to be some time in July next there is great danger that between the passing of the Bill and some date in July, some of the smaller men will not be able to get the security required and, therefore, will not be able to renew their licences.  I ask the Minister to do one thing or the other, either to accept the amendment or to push back the operative date for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to discuss the amendment without discussing the principle of the section. The principle of this section is, of course, the principle of the whole Bill. All the registrations, all the restrictions on persons carrying on the auctioneering business, house agency or anything else, are all designed for the <Col N="931" /> purpose of getting those persons within the provisions of Section 14.  I made it clear on the Second Reading that, in my view, that was a wrong approach. I pointed out that the correct approach in regard to security was to prevent a man muddling up other people's money with his own money.  The Minister indicated that he did not see eye to eye with me on that.  I had considered dealing with this matter by way of an amendment to the section.  I had regard, however, to the fact that such an amendment would have to be exceptionally involved.  It would have to cut across the whole principle underlying the Minister's point of view, a principle which was accepted on the Second Reading here.  Having said that I do not like this system, and that I think the other system would be the better one, I have, of course, to consider the system as I find it.  In my opinion, a deposit of £2,000 will, in some cases, such as Senator O'Dea mentioned, be unduly harsh, but at the other end of the scale it will, I think, be entirely farcical.</P>
      <P>The Minister and myself had some discussion a few moments ago on Section 11.  The Minister, as I understood him, wishes to retain the provision in Section 11 by virtue of which an applicant has to put in his advertisement in the newspapers every year, and has to go before the district justice every year.  He made the point that, in his view, that practice was absolutely essential.  I did not think the Minister was going to take that view, but since he has taken it I am prepared to accept it and I now want to transfer it to Section 14.  I think that Senator O'Dea's amendment, in one direction, goes sufficiently far and that the district justice should have a discretionary power to reduce the deposit from £2,000 to £1,000 if the applicant was able to satisfy him that he was only carrying on business in a very small way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I equally accept it that Senator O'Dea's amendment is not quite that.  But that is the principle behind it&mdash;that the £2,000 is too big a <Col N="932" /> sum for the small man, and that if he is able to satisfy the district justice that instead of fixing the deposit at £2,000 he can fix it at £1,000, the district justice should have the power to so fix it.  That would be a help to the small man and would keep him going.</P>
    <P>At the other end of the scale, I would add a further provision that on the application of a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of inspector, the district justice would have to be satisfied that £2,000 was a totally inadequate deposit as it would be in respect of some of the big auctioneers in Dublin and that he should have the discretion, in the interests of protecting the public, of raising the deposit from say £2,000 to £10,000.  Let us provide a maximum and a minimum, a maximum of £10,000 and a minimum of say £1,000.  As the Minister himself has determined that the district justice must be appealed to each year and that there must be personal application in open court let us add that when this application is made to a district justice he shall have discretion of saying whether a deposit is too big or too small in relation to the business transacted and of fixing the amount of the deposit within the limits of £1,000 in the case of a small man and £10,000 in the case of a very big man.  I think it would be a far more equitable arrangement and I seriously urge the Minister to accept this point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the general principle embodied in Senator O'Dea's amendment.  I think the House, with considerable freedom from auctioneers to-day, should have the courage to say that through this measure we are laying the foundations for tremendous vested interest.  I do not think that it is any exaggeration whatever to say that.  The fact is you have here in this city numbers of people the limit of whose incomes one cannot imagine.  One can only say that they must be enormous.  They have their names in many of the English newspapers where they are advertising as people who can find houses and lands for Britishers with plenty of paper notes who want to come over here and exchange them for good sound Irish property.  There is <Col N="933" /> no limit in this Bill to the fees which these people can charge for their services and we are unquestionably closing the door to the business in this Bill.  I come from a part of the country where the value of property is definitely lower than in the City of Galway, about which Senator O'Dea has spoken.  I suppose property in either place would not bring one-twentieth of what it would if situated around Dublin, certainly a similar house in either place would not bring one-twentieth of what it would in Dublin.  I am puzzled as to where the idea of a flat £2,000 originated.  Did it originate in the council of the auctioneers' organisation or in the Ministry of Justice?  Its purpose is to provide security so that if an auctioneer defaults in payment of moneys entrusted to him there will be some security.  But there should be some relationship between the amount of the deposit required and the turn-over in the business of the auctioneer concerned.  A man selling £50,000 or £60,000 worth of property in one lot is not at all in the same category as a man selling £500 or £600 worth.  Yet that is what we are doing here.  It may be very difficult for some of these auctioneers to get the security required, the security that may be asked for by the insurance company over and above the premium on the bond.  There is not much to be said against auctioneers in our remote part of the country.  They are poor but honest.  But when it comes to anyone getting security for £2,000 it is not an easy matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result may be that some of these small auctioneers may have to go out of business.  At the same time you are building up vested interests.  Many of the older people will be dying out and you may prevent the entry of young and desirable people into the profession. If you are going to create a vested interest in that way there should be adequate protection for the public in relation to the amount of money handled by these individuals.  This House, in equity, has got to find a basis for this security in relation to the turn-over of the individual.  For the big auctioneers the amount must <Col N="934" /> be considerably increased and for the small man correspondingly reduced. The Minister should not be obsessed too much by the prices ruling around Dublin.  He must take into consideration the prices of properties in Cavan, in West Galway and in West Donegal. I suggest this whole section should be seriously examined if justice is to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill was discussed here on the Second Stage considerable surprise was expressed by people in a position to judge, that it was proposed to have a flat rate of guarantee instead of something in the nature of a sliding scale.  Some auctioneers have a turn-over of not more than £1,000 a year and I am sure there are others with a turn-over up to £500,000.  It seems inequitable that the same guarantee should be asked of each.  The responsibilities of a man with a turn-over of £1,000 are vastly different from those of a man with a turn-over of £100,000.  I think that the guarantee should be fixed on a sliding scale, £1,000 to £5,000; £5,000 to £10,000, £10,000 to £20,000 and so on in relation to the amount of business transacted.  We pay rates according to the size of our premises and income-tax according to the size of our profits. I think the Minister should give consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Senator Sweetman knows little about the auctioneers' administration in rural areas.  There is no analogy whatsoever between the business in the country areas and the colossal business done here in Dublin.  I jotted down a few little items which may be of interest to the Minister with regard to the calls which are made on auctioneers in the rural areas.  Generally speaking, these men are benefactors&mdash;it is a kind of benefaction which is anticipatory of business for themselves later on and there are many calls upon them, as these items will show.  Yesterday morning, a farmer for whom I had been doing business came to me.  I had advised him very strongly against a system of living with which I do not <Col N="935" /> agree and I have talked him into seeing matters from a different angle, with a view to bettering his position, which he never would do, if he continued on the lines on which he was going.</P>

The third man came to me with a demand for rates of £12 18s. 10d, a man for whom I shall be doing business at the end of the year.  The last item given to me was a threatening notice by the county registrar in respect of money due to the Land Commission.  I had to contact the county registrar and tell him that if the man involved had not paid within a certain period&mdash;the amount was £15 &mdash;I would be responsible for it.  This will be information for Senator Sweetman.</P>

      <P>This point was discussed in both House on Second Reading, <Col N="936" /> and, as I said here and in the other House, the £2,000 bond is not expected to cover every case.  It could not do so.  I cannot see how anyone is to know that some of the small auctioneers for whom the Senator is concerned are not going to get a big job.  I have known cases in backward places in which windfalls came and a man got the sale of a big house and land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but that cannot be covered in advance.  It is not possible to say six months in advance what business will come in.  If an auctioneer cannot get a bond for £2,000, which so far as I can find out, would cost no more than about £15 at a maximum, I do not see what business he has in being an auctioneer at all.  We have heard about the man who makes practically nothing.  If he makes nothing, he will not lose anything either.  That is fair enough.  It would be better to let one man get all the small jobs which will provide a living for somebody, and provide, at the same time, more security for a person's deposit.</P>
      <P>If it is worth a man's while to be an auctioneer, there is no good in his having to auction one field&mdash;I do not think that is done, however; they generally auction a number of them&mdash;and the amount involved would be no more than 10/- a week and is not worth talking about.  I do not see how we could put on the district justice the duty of determining how much one man should pay and how much another man should pay.  How could he do it?  He would have no idea of what business might fall to the auctioneer in the course of a year.  All we are doing is fixing a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that point, and I explained on the last occasion that I myself had experience of one case, a case which Senator Sweetman probably knows.  It was the case of a man who was a decent man, but on whom the bank closed without warning and withdrew his deposit.  The poor farmer who sold his cattle got a cheque which was returned to him.  I did all I could to get that point covered, but I found it could not be done.  As I said before, if a man intends to default in the matter of a deposit, he will default in keeping separate accounts also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, it would be necessary to have an audit every year, which would mean more expense.  Even the solicitors do not want audits, and, if there is to be an audit, they like the auditor to be someone from a distance and not someone from their own locality.  That all costs money.  It would involve an audit and certified accounts every year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That would mean another item of expense.  This is a flat rate of £2,000 which will not cover the big cases, but which, we think, will cover the small cases, and a man who cannot get a bond for that amount ought not to be in the business.  I have thought over this very carefully for a long time, particularly with a view to covering the point involved in the case I mentioned, because I thought it a very hard case.  In the case of salesmen, the money is not in their hands for any length of time, but still that man's money was impounded, and I can find no way of dealing with the point.  I think the provision in the Bill very reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there will be some arrangement by which people will get this bond at a reasonable rate?  I am informed that, <Col N="938" /> in certain cases, an insurance company, which usually will be the party to issue the bond, is likely to discriminate against certain people, and that there will be difficulty in getting the bond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the credit-worthiness of the individual. If the company thought they were not taking much risk, they would give it for a much smaller sum.  We cannot compel an insurance company to have a flat rate.  They have to take into consideration what the risk is likely to be, but the information which I can get &mdash;I cannot be sure&mdash;is that in or about £15 would be about the maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied about this.  The last point which has been raised by Senator Duffy, I think, gives rise to considerable difficulty.  I have no doubt at all you have a number of auctioneers in this country perfectly credit-worthy, respectable business people, but it may very well be that their bank account may not actually be to credit.  It may very well be that when the insurance company will go making inquiries about the financial position of these particular people they may be very reluctant to produce a bond at all if indeed they will produce one at all.  People like these may be very reluctant to come along to public representatives to talk about their private affairs.  As far as I am concerned no such person made any such representations to me but I think it may very well be that we will discover we have excluded quite a number of respectable people from the business of auctioneering that they have been <Col N="939" /> carrying on for many years.  Take the man, for instance, who in a poor district would be discounting a considerable number of bills and let his account be presented when he may actually be carrying £10,000 or £20,000 in bills that are being discounted.  He is going to do some trade in 12 months if the grass grows or something like that, but when such a man is questioned by an insurance company as to how he stands and when a bank reference is asked for, he may have very considerable difficulty in securing the bond which we are imposing on him under this Bill and for that reason quite a number of people may be excluded from the business of earning a livelihood that they had enjoyed for many years.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister at all from my point of view. I have a feeling that he more or less does not look at it as we do in the country.  It is all very well to say if a man does not do a big business he does not lose much.  That to an extent may be true but the little that he does earn may be the difference to him between poverty and comfort for himself and his family.  Is he going to lose that because of this Bill introduced by an organisation composed mostly of people whose interest it would be to shove as many people as possible out of the business?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should not have said that, but we have a great number of small towns in every county. Take, for example, auctioneers in the towns of Headford, Tuam, Dunmore and Clifden.  Are they going to be sniffed out of business and will people who want to have an auction in the town of Headford have to send to Galway or elsewhere for an auctioneer? Are they going to pay the expenses of those auctioneers as well as commission <Col N="940" /> they generally charge for the conduct of auctions?  I know that in the town of Galway itself there are probably auctioneers who will not be able to find security.  Even they would have to get security of £2,000 under my amendment, because the population is over 20,000.</P>
      <P>You have a great number of auctioneers in other places.  They buy and sell furniture and auction furniture&mdash; mostly their own property.  That is a case where they cannot embezzle because they would be embezzling their own funds.  What they would do outside of that would not amount to anything at all that would justify a security of £2,000.  They would want to have auctions to the extent of £8,000 before they would have £2,000 on their hands.  Every month they would be handing up the proceeds of auctions of the previous month and it is very unlikely that they would have a good auction twice in one month.  It is absurd to ask people who would not have more than £100 in their possession belonging to other people to enter into a bond of £2,000.  I think the Minister should consider this between now and the Report Stage because it is of importance to the people who are going to be sniffed out.  I think we ought to be very careful as a legislating body in interfering with the rights that exist of certain people who have never done anything wrong in their lives and we are doing it because there may have been one or two unfortunate instances &mdash;or four&mdash;in a very short period of time.  I think it is a matter that should be considered gravely and carefully before we do any injustice to people no matter how small they are, because when there are small people a sum of £100 or £50 or even £25 means a great deal and that should not be lost sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, furthermore, the fact that we should not debar any young man from coming into the profession.  A young man is generally a man with no money in the bank to his credit.  The Minister says if he is a small man perhaps he should not be an auctioneer but everybody is small until they are established.  Some of us started perhaps with a negative quantity and it does <Col N="941" /> not mean that a man is dishonest because he is poor.  It may be the other way round.  Maybe the man who has money is more dishonest than the man who is poor.  Are we going to deprive honest young people of the means to make an honest living because an insurance company will say: &ldquo;We have asked for your bank account and you have not produced it and it is we and not the auctioneers who are the people to decide who is or is not to come into the profession&rdquo;?  I think the matter is very serious and if the Minister does not accept the amendment now I would ask him to reconsider it.</P>

      <P>Of course I cannot.  An attempt was being made here for years past&mdash;I think it was first moved in this House&mdash;to get a different type of Bill and make a closed borough of the profession.  This Bill is more in the interests of protecting the public and preventing people who are not fit and proper on behalf of the Bill from acting as auctioneers and not with making it a closed borough for anybody. I think that a person who cannot get a bond for £2,000 would be a very small person.  A young man should not have much difficulty in getting the amount required.  The whole amount be would be required to pay would be only about £26, as between the licence fee and the premium for the bond.</P>

      <P>If I were to go into this question again, I do not think that I should arrive at any other result.  I <Col N="942" /> went into the matter very carefully. The question which has been raised here was also raised in the other House and, on the whole, the figure for which we provide was considered reasonable.  It was thought that, in some cases, it might not be sufficient and that, in a few cases, it would be more than would be necessary.  It is better to have a flat rate than a variable rate.  The alternative to a fixed sum such as this would be a variable sum and I cannot see how you could ask a district justice to deal with the matter on that basis.  A series of inquiries would be necessary and I do not see how such a provision could be worked.  It would be very difficult to operate such a provision and it would be more costly than having a flat rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in regard to this amendment seems to <Col N="943" /> hinge on two points&mdash;whether there should not be some kind of classification and the deposits fixed in accordance with it and whether it is within the ability of applicants to get cover from the insurance offices.  The Minister has expressed his doubt as to his ability to secure anything in the way of a suitable classification, and I think he is right in that.  I tried to think out some kind of an ordered classification which might follow on these lines: metropolitan offices; urban offices, divided into people entitled to deal in lands and houses, others only in houses and others in lands; rural auctioneers, entitled to deal in lands and houses in the rural area and others entitled to deal in lands only.  Then, to cater for that class about which Senator O'Dea and others were uneasy, the very small man, there might be a classification in which men could deal only in grass lettings, meadow lettings and conacre generally.  I am sure no one in the House would agree that that is a reasonable suggestion which would prove to be workable, so I think we must reject it.  It follows, then, that it is likely there will be some casualties.  If there must be casualties, that is that, but we have to keep in mind the public good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the fidelity bond, I do not think there would be any difficulty in getting it.  My name is handed in very often to insurance companies by applicants as a reference for bonds or fidelity cover and I do not know of any case yet where anybody has been refused, though many of the applicants who have used my name as a reference, to my own knowledge would not have a sixpence in the bank.  Yet they have had no difficulty in getting their bonds. It could be that insurance companies might use their power to keep certain people out of this profession by refusing to provide them with the necessary cover, but it ought to be possible to get after that.  As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the time has come when some inquiry must be made into the whole question of agency in general, as well as in regard to certain matters dealt with by insurance <Col N="944" /> companies.  It seems to me that if men find they have a grievance, that applicants for this cover are not being fairly treated, it ought to be possible to have their cases examined, and of the companies refusing cover being made to answer.</P>
    <P>I make this suggestion with regard to this difficulty, that perhaps the auctioneers' organisation itself might undertake the underwriting of these bonds.  It is a very big, widespread organisation, and it seems to me that there is no reason why it should not be in a position to provide the necessary cover where it is satisfied that the applicants are fit and proper persons for admission to the organisation.  We are all agreed with Senator O'Dea and with the other Senators who have spoken that, if we can avoid inflicting hardship upon anybody, it should be done.  I am sure the Minister agrees with Senator O'Dea on that, and that we are all in agreement with him on it.  The difficulty is to find a formula that would be satisfactory.  No formula has been suggested, and, perhaps, while not asking the Minister to commit himself, he might between this and the next stage see whether he and his advisers might not be able to find some formula on the lines of classification that might meet the wishes of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point with regard to the amendment which has not yet been adverted to.  This is a deposit not merely for an auctioneer but also a deposit for a house agent. There are in cities just as many very small house agents carrying on a very small business as there are small men in the country carrying on a small auctioneering business.  I agree with Senator Ua Buachalla to this extent, that the borough classification would not be sufficient.  I think, however, that the Minister should consider house agency classification as distinct from the auctioneers' classification.  No house agent carries on a very large business, as such, unless he also carries on an auctioneering business.  In that case he is covered under the auctioneering section. I think the Minister might perhaps agree to give the small house agent a better chance.  He would not <Col N="945" /> be holding the same deposits as an auctioneer, and in any event there would not be the same case for putting him on the same flat rate of deposit.</P>

      <P>I have been approached by certain insurance companies in regard to their obligations on the question of safe custody.  The phrase &ldquo;safe custody&rdquo; is of vague and indeterminate application.  Some insurance interests feel that they would like to know more specifically what are their obligations in regard to &ldquo;safe custody&rdquo;.  They know their obligations as regards defalcations, but &ldquo;safe custody&rdquo; might involve them in matters relating to night watchmen, adequate safes on premises and so on. They would also like to have from the Minister some indication of the form that he intends to adopt with regard to these bonds.  I think that until these things are known, and until the position is made quite clear, it is rather doubtful whether the insurance companies will be able to give bonds at the rather small rate suggested by the Minister.  Can the Minister give the House any general indication as to how insurance companies would be disposed to give bonds that would stand under this rather indeterminate obligation for &ldquo;safe custody&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I can say is that at the present time an auctioneer is bound to see to the safe custody of any article that is given into his care. If, through negligence, he lets it out of his possession, or if it is stolen while in his custody, then he is liable to the person whose property it is.  It is to insure a person against that misuse of his property that we are bringing safe custody within the provisions in the Bill, so that it will be covered by the deposit.  At the present time if an auctioneer who has property in safe custody allows it to be stolen or steals it himself or neglects it, the owner can bring him to court and get damages. Under this Bill, the deposit will be liable for the damages awarded.  If the court thought he should pay more than the deposit money it was a matter for the court itself.  I think that the insurance companies, some of them at any rate, understand this and accept it as a common risk.  Some of them are prepared to accept it.  That is the information I have.</P>

I am sure the Minister does not anticipate having to disturb these bonds which have stood the test of time.  Personally I can see nothing in this Bill that will interfere with those.  I never had any difficulty and I do not foresee any difficulties now except something very unusual is being looked for.</P>

The matter is well in hand and personally I would like to have some shares in any insurance company that <Col N="947" /> will take over this business.  It is gilt-edged.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Senator Sir John Keane under Section 14 really comes more appropriately under Section 15.  I understood that the purpose of the deposit in this case was to protect the public in respect of money received by an auctioneer.  Now I gather from the Minister that he visualises not merely protecting the public in respect of moneys received by an auctioneer but in respect of a wider field, that is to say, negligence.  If an auctioneer, for example, has an article of furniture for sale and it is broken inadvertently, is not this going to mean that the premium on the bond will be higher than a mere premium against dishonesty?  As I understood it, the Minister's anxiety is to prevent dishonesty. Now it looks as if we are going into a wider field and considering compulsory insurance for auctioneers against accident.  I wonder is this fair to the small man.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;in respect of any liability incurred by a defendant in the course of or in relation to the business of auctioneer or house agent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the auctioneer's assistant drops a china vase in the course of an auction it is an accident and an action probably lies against the auctioneer because he did not provide that this man should be sufficiently careful.  In this section the Minister is forcing an auctioneer to insure against accident.  This would be a liability in the course of his business and a liability for which the Minister is making the deposit liable.  I hear Senator Quirke saying that every auctioneer is covered against that. Every big auctioneer is covered but I do not want this Bill to be considered from the point of view of the big auctioneer only.  The small country auctioneer is not covered and if we are going to make him insure against it let us do it with our eyes open.</P>

If I were sick in the morning I could give the names of 50 auctioneers in Dublin who would take on an auction for me without any reward. Senator Sweetman wants to suggest that there is terrible jealousy amongst auctioneers because he saw Stokes and Quirke's calendar in the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department he happened to go to when he probably wanted to pull some &ldquo;wangles&rdquo; on behalf of his friends.</P>

      <P>I think that the furniture of a small person down the country is as much entitled to protection as that of a big person in the city. It is the public we are trying to protect, and an auctioneer down the country should not be allowed to throw a person's furniture around anyway he likes.  I think an auctioneer is liable at present, if he does not take proper care, and it is to ensure against that sort of thing that this provision is inserted. I do not want the Seanad to do anything with its eyes shut and I welcome the most minute examination of any of these Bills.  I should not like the implication to be put forward that I was making any such attempt.  It is there in black and white.  Senator Sir John Keane raised the matter and I have explained it so far as I can.  I believe from what I am told that, with a full knowledge of what is implied in all this insurance certain well-established insurance companies are nevertheless prepared to insure auctioneers at a very moderate rate.  That remains <Col N="950" /> to be seen, but I am told that that is the position.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that a difficulty may arise in connection with this section.  Senator Sweetman referred to the kind of action which might arise where injury was sustained by a member of the public in connection with an auctioneer's business.  Suppose an auctioneer in relation to his business is involved in a running down case.  A decree for £2,000 may be given against him, and it seems to me that in that case the person holding the decree could go to the High Court and claim the discharge of the decree for £2,000.  If that were so and the auctioneer held moneys, £2,000 or £3,000, being the amount of deposits placed with him, the security is gone. That is the real difficulty.  If the bond which is intended to protect the person whose money is held by the auctioneer can be used to compel an insurance company to pay a different kind of claim, then the person whose money lies with the auctioneer is deprived of protection. The Minister will say that in that case the bond lapses and the licence is cancelled, but, before the licence is cancelled, a substantial sum may lie with the auctioneer and there is no further protection.</P>

      <P>Hitherto, I take it, auctioneers have been liable under a number of counts&mdash;dishonesty, negligence, or perhaps failure to insure against fire.  Cases have gone to court and they have had to pay or have been absolved.  Is it now to be that any decree given against an auctioneer for neglect in the course of his business will automatically fall on the insurance bond or on the cash deposit?</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy suggests that if an auctioneer ran somebody down with his car, the deposit or portion of it would be claimed.  Of course, it could not, because the auctioneer is already covered.  He cannot, go on the road unless his car is insured, and, if he has an accident, the insurance company is liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but I merely instanced a case in which decree is given in respect of a particular claim. It could occur in other cases.  An auctioneer might have a horse and dray, or it might be that he was carrying on business in a premises in which a person attending the sale is injured or killed by reason of a plank or a brick falling.  The point that I am trying to make is that if the claim is made, not by the person whose deposit is held by the auctioneer, but by an outsider, and the auctioneer is unable or fails to pay, the insurance company can then be called upon, on foot of its bond, to pay the amount of the decree, taking away entirely the sum of £2,000 which is designed to protect the people whose moneys are in the custody of the auctioneer.</P>

      <P>There is a point in what Senator Duffy says, but I point out that it must arise out of a liability incurred in the course of, or in relation to, his business as an auctioneer. There is this about it, that in the case <Col N="952" /> of the example he quoted, of an auctioneer holding an auction at which a member of the public is injured and the auctioneer being liable because he had no insurance cover, it is quite possible that a decree given to that member of the public against the auctioneer would be enforced against the deposit of £2,000, and, I think, quite rightly.</P>

      <P>All I want to get clarified is that if this Bill is designed to protect the public in respect of their financial relations with auctioneers, it should stop there.  Section 15 does not stop there.  It gives the right to any citizen, whether he has business with an auctioneer or not, whether he has given auctioneering business to the auctioneer or not, to go into court and have payment made to him in respect of a decree against the auctioneer in relation to auctioneering business, such as advertisements.</P>

It is intended to be provided for dishonesty and the deposit should be kept to be available for dishonesty and should not be available for a type of right such as if I break my arm in the <Col N="953" /> chair in which I sit and on which there are only three legs instead of four.

      <P>I think reference is made in the Trade Union Act to this point.  Trade unions must deposit certain amounts of money in order to obtain negotiating licences.  That is intact against any claim whatever other than an abuse committed by the trade union under the Act.  I think if the Minister would refer to the Trade Union Act and see where a deposit there is immune it would serve the purpose in this case.  I think the confusion could be cleared away without any trouble.  A deposit laid down by a trade union is immune from any other claim&mdash;and trade unions can have claims&mdash;but the deposit is immune and cannot be used for any other purpose than a fine imposed by court of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the last line of sub-section (2).  This sub-section provides for penalties where an auctioneer fails to produce his licence to an officer of customs and excise.  Let us remember that, in this case, the auctioneer has a licence.  If he had no licence and proposed to carry out an auction, he would be guilty of an offence under another section.  This is a case in which the person concerned is entitled to carry on an auction.  He has a licence but he has forgotten to bring it with him. He is asked by an officer of customs and excise to produce his licence and, within a limited time, he must do so. If he fails to do so, he is liable to conviction and a fine of £50.  I am not complaining about any provision of the section except the amount of the fine, which, I think, is out of all proportion to the offence.  In my opinion, a £10 fine would be quite ample.  We ought not to write into Acts of this kind what seem to be preposterously heavy fines.  My suggestion is that the Minister should alter that figure to £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision was brought in as the result of an amendment in the other House.  Originally, in this sub-section, we had the same provision as was in the Act of 1845, which is now being repealed.  Under <Col N="956" /> the original provision, any officer of the Garda Síochána could arrest without warrant any person conducting an auction who, when requested by such officer, failed to produce his licence. In lieu thereof, there was a provision relating to an immediate deposit of £10.  It was as the result of an amendment in the Dáil that seven days were allowed to the person concerned to produce his licence, and, failing to do so, the penalty was fixed as set out in the Bill.  I think that there is a case for that.  The amendment was not mine but I accepted it and there seemed to be general agreement about it.  The person concerned gets seven days in which to produce his licence.</P>

An auctioneer from Dublin may go down to Longford to conduct an auction.  In such cases, I think that there should be a practice similar to that which obtains in the case of driving licences.  If I am asked by a Garda to produce my driving licence, I can, within a limited time, produce my licence at the Garda station in my own area or at any other Garda station.  In the circumstances which I have mentioned, a Dublin auctioneer should be permitted to produce his licence to an officer of customs and excise in Dublin.

      <P>The Government authorised the putting down of this motion.  The British are introducing summer time next week and they propose to have double summer time.  If we did not take this step, a large number of alterations of time-tables would be required.  In addition, this change will bring about a saving in light and gas.  Everybody <Col N="958" /> realises that no saving in that connection at the present time could be regarded as negligible.  By proceeding in this way, we shall have only two changes to make, whereas five or six changes would be necessary if we did not adopt this course.  If the motion were not approved, time-table changes for communications with Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be necessary on the 16th March, when the British introduce summer time; on the 13th April, when the British introduce double summer time; on the 20th April, when summer time commences here in the ordinary way; on the 10th August, when double summer time ends, and on the 2nd November, when summer time ends in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

      <P>In all the circumstances, there is hardly any alternative but to do this.  One could discuss the general question of summer time in regard to different parts of the community, but this is a particular case.  We would be adopting summer time in any event on the 20th of April and we are simply antedating it by about a month, so the Minister's argument in bringing it in is quite a sound one.  The only discussion is whether we ought to have summer time or not, which I think is really not the point that arises now, as we have decided to have summer time.  In the particular circumstances in which we find ourselves, it does seem from the practical point of view to be just as well to put it into operation from the 16th of March instead of from the 20th April.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>As a countryman, I would not like to let the Minister away with the idea that this is satisfactory to the country people, because it is not.  Frankly, although the Minister is generally persuasive, I cannot pretend to be very strongly convinced about the difficulties involved in the altering of time schedules.  Is he referring to the trains that do not run?  My colleague talks about the trains going across the Border, or that used to go across. They are being cut in two as well as most of our other supplies.  This summer time creates all sorts of complications in country districts.  The Minister has been talking about the difficulties that would confront him or somebody else if we do not acquiesce when the British are making changes. They are nothing to the difficulties that confront the country people as soon as the changes are made.  There are difficulties regarding the schools and Masses and postal services and there is utter confusion between old time, mew time and summer time.</P>
      <P>There may be some saving, too, in that coal we are not getting, like the trains that are not running.  There may be some saving in electric light or power.  The Minister never had a weaker case to make for any motion, but this is a Government decision and I suppose he must do his best.  The countryman, however, must record his dissatisfaction with this decision to go against the sun, as it is not getting us very far on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at Senator Baxter making such a speech.  He must know, as anyone in contact with the country knows, that you can say what you like about changing the time in Dublin but the country people just keep the old time.  If the trains which are not running are supposed to run at 9 o'clock new time, people will take the hour into account and will arrive at the station at the right time.  The same applies to Masses, fairs and everything else, and I cannot see that it makes much difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> Senator Baxter suggests that it is a matter of very little importance. Surely Senator Baxter understands that, in a big city like Dublin, if we can save an hour's lighting it means a big thing in the drain on electricity? The same thing applies in the big towns in the country, in Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  An hour's saving is a very important matter.  It is absurd that there should be such suggestions about the trains that do not run and about the coal that has not arrived, the suggestion being that, if Fine Gael were in power, we would have trains running five days a week and coal coming in in shiploads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is there any suggestion that there will be a saving of fuel <Col N="961" /> here in Ireland during the five weeks in which this motion will have the effect of advancing the clocks?  The Minister says it would be important to save one hour's fuel or lighting in Dublin, but if you save it in the evenings you will lose it in the mornings. Let us see the effect on school children &mdash;and this is probably more important in the country than in Dublin, as they have to travel two or three miles to school.  They have to be in at 9 o'clock; that will mean 9 o'clock summer time, which according to natural time is really 7.35.  Some of them will be leaving their homes at 6.30 natural time in the morning, to be in school according to the school hours.  Make no mistake about that.  It is a tremendous hardship that children should have to get out at that hour in the morning and travel a long distance to school in weather like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is ludicrous to talk about summer time when the snow is still lying on Leinster Lawn, not yet swept away.  Snow has been falling last week and this week in parts of the country, yet we talk of summer time.  I suggest that there are very valid objections to making this Order, and I am utterly opposed to it.  I cannot understand why the Minister should make it, unless it be to synchronise our clocks with the British.  There was a time when we thought it a virtue that they should not be synchronised and there is no case I know of for changing our mind in this matter.  It will probably be regarded as a compliment to the grand old dame, Britannia, that we move our clocks in sympathy with hers, but it is going to mean endless hardship for all the children going to school.  It is going to mean a good deal of hardship for people starting at an early hour in factories, and for people starting on various kinds of work at an early hour. The first tram for Dublin leaves Dalkey some time about 5 o'clock in the morning.  It is leaving Dalkey at 4 o'clock according to the present time, but from the 17th March it will be leaving at 3.30 a.m.  We are already one hour 25 minutes in advance of the sun, and now we are asked to go one hour more ahead of the sun without any explanation whatever being given to us for doing so.  If the Minister <Col N="962" /> tells us that he is not influenced by what they are doing in Britain, I suggest that the only other influence working on his mind is that of the gentleman who will be travelling across the Irish Sea in two weeks' time to see the Grand National.</P>

      <P>I am not going to attempt to follow Senator Duffy in his flights of fancy over the hurdles at Aintree.  Surely, we must accept the Minister's motion as one that had to be brought in at an unusual time to suit an unusual condition of affairs. Nothing has been said about the serious position facing the country through the curtailment of the supply of electricity for industry.  A good deal has been said about country people sticking to the old time or to God's time, but we must remember that conditions in the city are quite arbitrary.  In industry, official time has to be observed, and due to a curtailment of power for industry, there is the possibility of the wholesale dismissal of work people.  A reduction in fuel for power purposes has already been announced by the Electricity Supply Board.  If this motion means that there can be a concentration of power for industrial purposes, then that alone would justify the Minister in bringing it before the House.</P>

      <P>It is.  The use of electrical power for industry is cut by 25 per cent.  If the acceptance of this motion means the saying of an hour's electricity for power purposes&mdash;that is, the current that would otherwise have been used for light&mdash;it will be of great advantage to industry.  It is not my intention to discuss the question as to whether we should have summer time or not.  That principle was discussed many years ago and has long been accepted.  The reason why the Minister is introducing summer time a little earlier than usual this year is because we are facing a very serious situation, a situation far more serious for industry than some of the speakers on this motion seem to realise.  I can tell Senators that industry is going to be in a jam within the next few weeks if there is no easing of the situation with regard to fuel for power.  If, as I have said, we can use some of the current at present available for light, then clearly we are going to have more of it available to keep our factories going.</P>

It is quite obvious that everything possible must be done to save as much light as possible.  It is quite obvious that light will be saved by this measure.  The whole idea of summer time, when it was introduced <Col N="964" /> many years ago, was to save light.  That proposition, I think, has never been disputed for a moment&mdash;that summer time does save light.  We know, of course, that the people in the rural districts have their own way of dealing with this, and that is by not observing it.  Senators should not forget that when the war was on we had summer time during the whole period. We had it even during the winter months, and it was not considered a hardship.  We are all hoping that we shall soon have good weather and therefore I think it is a very small thing that we should be asked to pass this measure.</P>

      <P>When the first Summer Time Bill was introduced in the Seanad many years ago, I supported it because I thought it would not affect the farming community in any way.  My farming colleagues <Col N="965" /> objected to it.  I see now that they were right, because a number of people in the country want to have the conditions in regard to summer time which are observed in the cities also observed in the country.  If we could have summer time in the country during November, December and January it would suit us to get extra work done, but that is not allowed. Summer time in the country during the months of June, July, August and September does not suit the farmer at all.  In fact, it means putting back operations on the land.  The farmer cannot work too far ahead of the sun. He cannot engage in hay-making or harvesting work.  I would have no objection to this motion if Senator Duffy and Senator Foran, who is not here, would agree that summer time should not apply to agricultural workers.  If they want to have it applied to them, as it applies to workers in the cities, then the motion should not be passed at all.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy in his opening remarks tried to convey to the House that the Minister made no case or the Bill.  This must be due to the Minister's brevity and I think that members of the House would be pleased if other members took a leaf out of the Minister's book and were as brief in putting their case as he was.  I think he made the reason clear for the introduction of this Bill.  We, on this side of the House, at any rate, understood those reasons.  One thing we cannot understand, however, is Senator Duffy's objection to summer time.  My recollection is that speakers in the Labour movement over many years have advocated the introduction of summer time and have put forward the view that it benefits workers in the cities and towns and enables them to have additional hours off in the evening for relaxation.  I know that in Galway and in other towns it has been a great benefit and a great inducement to the workers to cultivate plots and save turf on the bogs.  If this Bill was never introduced until this year I think a very good case could be made for it. I quite appreciate it is hardship on young people going to school, that is, <Col N="966" /> where the schools adopt summer time, but that is a question for the managers and in many parts of the country the managers do not adopt the summer time and in other places they go between and halve summer time.  For that reason there can be no great hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

      <P>I am glad Senator Hawkins raised this point.  I want to object emphatically to the passing of this Bill unless we can get an assurance from the Minister that the hours will not be enforced or observed for education.  I have sympathy with Senator Summerfield's interest in industry.  Every one of us is interested in the industrial side, but nevertheless, I can assure the Minister and Senators here that if applied to school children this summer time will inflict great hardship, which is not necessary.  As Senator Duffy has stated these children have to be at school at the present time at 9 o'clock.  This means that in the next few days they will be at school at 8 o'clock, and instead of having to be up out of their beds at 7.30 a.m. they will have to be up at 6.30 a.m. That would be inflicting a great hardship on their worried mothers, who have to get them out in the mornings. And let us remember that they will be getting them out for school at a time when home comforts do not exist. There is no firing and food is scarce. I feel that the Minister should request the Department of Education to see that the hours are not observed in the schools.  It will mean that the children being up so early and for so long must get more food during the day.  Bread is rationed and a young lad playing around during the day will come more often to his mother looking for bread. You are also doing an injustice to the farmers in introducing it.  The harvest is the most important time on the farm and you cannot do anything at it in the mornings until the dew rises off the grass.  The farmers, however, can arrange it themselves and I feel that its adoption for them is not as bad as for the children who would be getting up at 6.30 in the mornings.  Instead of bringing this forward three weeks earlier this year, I suggest it should be put back for a month.  Having regard <Col N="967" /> to the scarcity of firing and food there is also the question of the children running around the streets at night when they would be safer in bed.</P>

      <P>If this was proposed at another time or in another year I would strenuously oppose it, but owing to the case that has been made, and owing to the shortage of power, and recognising the serious situation that is confronting the country, I will agree to it.  I would like, however, that it should be known and recorded that were it not for the situation confronting us presently I would oppose it for the reason that it does not suit rural Ireland.  Take, for instance, hay-making in summer time.  The dew is not off the grass in the morning, and in the evening council workers, road workers and bog workers, recognising official time, will be leaving their work one hour or one hour and a half before the farm worker.  The farm worker, naturally, will be dissatisfied and will not be very anxious to continue on the farm.  It is a very great hardship, too, on youngsters, and medical men have already recorded that it is a hardship getting them up at this hour in the morning.  In some parts they have to travel miles to school, and in my district they have to travel across a bog for a couple of miles in the morning. In North Roscommon there are from two to five feet of snow.  Nothing is clear except the principal bus routes and some of the main roads.  It would be a definite hardship on children who have to travel to school in these conditions at such an early hour of the morning.  But for the serious situation confronting the country I would strenuously oppose it, and I would like it to be known that when it comes up next year I will oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation was established following the passing of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927, which implemented certain recommendations of the Banking Commission of 1926. The capital of the corporation was fixed at £500,000 and dividends at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the paid-up capital were guaranteed by the State.  In addition the corporation was empowered to borrow money by issuing certificates of charge, that is a form of security backed by first mortgages on land and guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Minister for Finance, to an amount not exceeding £7,500,000, but subject to a maximum issue in any one year of £1,000,000. These provisions in relation to certificates of charge, as extended by the Act of 1929, are still in operation and are not altered by the proposals in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation had only commenced to operate when it was found that the main security which farmers could offer <Col N="969" /> was first mortgages on land.  As a very large number of the farms in the country have been registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1891, subject to equities, many prospective borrowers could not show title to their lands without incurring undue expense and, accordingly, the Agricultural Credit Act of 1928, a short enactment, was passed, which solved this difficulty in the main by giving the corporation the right to register a priority charge for a principal sum not exceeding £400 against a farm without requiring the discharge by the borrower of the note as to equities.  The provisions of the 1928 Act in this respect are in a slightly extended form continued by Chapter II of Part IV of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1929 made certain changes in the capital structure of the corporation. The nominal capital was increased to £1,000,000 in 1,000,000 shares of £1 each, which are at present paid up to the extent of 10/- only, and are held in the manner described in the third paragraph of the White Paper which has been issued in connection with the present Bill.  The balance of 10/- per share is payable only upon a winding-up.  It is proposed to replace the present capital by a capital of £300,000, consisting of 600,000 shares of 10/- each, fully paid up, and all in the ownership of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>These provisions relating to reorganisation of capital will bring to an end a situation which is out of keeping with present-day monetary conditions, whereby a Government guaranteed security is yielding 5 per cent. interest to holders.  The original provisions of the 1927 Act relating to capital were early seen to be unsuitable, as it was recognised that the corporation, set up without free resources, could not make loans at a reasonable interest rate and at the same time carry out the obligation imposed on it by the Act of paying 5 per cent. on all its capital.  The only relief afforded to the corporation was that if its profits were insufficient to pay the 5 per cent. dividend, it could borrow the necessary moneys from the Exchequer at such rates of interest as might be fixed by the Minister for Finance.  The 1929 Act tempered the <Col N="970" /> position to some extent, by providing that any money obtained by the corporation from the Government for the purpose of paying dividends should rank not as a debt owing by the corporation to the State, but as a bonus right on the shares owned by the State. That Act also divided the shares into &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares, all the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares and 109, 237 of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares being held by the State.  By this device the Minister for Finance became, as it were, a deferred shareholder, the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares being given priority of claim to dividend over the &ldquo;B&rdquo; shares.</P>
    <P>This arrangement worked in accordance with anticipations for a few years but farmers' incomes were subsequently so reduced by the depression that for the time being at any rate, many borrowers were unable to meet their commitments to the corporation. Faced as it was with a heavy potential loss, the corporation decided to build up a substantial bad debts reserve. About 1936, it began by degrees to make contributions, small at first and gradually increasing, towards the statutory dividends on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares which had in the meantime been paid from the Exchequer.  By 1942, the financial position of the corporation had so improved that it was able to pay the full 5 per cent. dividend on its &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares, other than those held by the State, having in the meantime built up adequate reserves.</P>
    <P>The corporation had carried a further burden during these years in its mortgage bonds, of which it had issued £500,000 at 5 per cent. interest.  Under the terms of issue, £250,000 of these were payable on 1st November, 1944, and the remainder not earlier than 1st May, 1946.  Arrangements were made in 1942 to provide funds to meet the 5 per cent. mortgage bonds in anticipation of their maturity.  Accordingly, £500,000 3 per cent. mortgage stock was issued and the proceeds temporarily invested, until the 5 per cent. bonds should mature, when they were duly paid off.</P>
    <P>By 1942, it had become clear that the corporation's interest rate on loans was high by comparison with current interest rates and the directors decided to reduce the rate to 4½ per cent.  As this reduction applied to existing as <Col N="971" /> well as future loans, it involved a considerable sacrifice of revenue &mdash; about £10,000 a year &mdash; by the corporation.  The 5 per cent. bonds having been paid off, however, the corporation is now in a reasonably good profit-earning position and should in the future be better able to fill a useful rôle in supplying farmers' long-term credit needs.</P>
    <P>The proposed reduction in its paid-up share capital from £500,000 to £300,000 will simplify the capital structure and strengthen rather than weaken the corporation because it cannot at present invest its surplus resources at rates which will give a higher return than about 3 per cent. while the dividend on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; shares is 5 per cent.  The savings resulting from this capital reorganisation will be at least £4,000 a year.  To this can be added also the saving which will result from the reduction in the number of directors, at present seven, to a maximum of five.  These savings will be a material advantage to this company, having regard to the level of its net profits which for the year to the 31st October, 1946, amounted to £16,222 only, when interest on the mortgage bonds had been met.</P>
    <P>To strengthen the position further, there are the provisions of Section 13 which enable the Minister for Finance to advance to the corporation, from moneys voted by the Oireachtas for the purpose, up to £250,000 at a rate of interest not less than the rate on advances from the Central Fund to the Local Loans Fund, at present 2½ per cent., and also enable the corporation to borrow from credit institutions up to £250,000.  The first of these provisions is designed to tide the corporation over a period of general financial difficulty when additional resources which might be required for the continuance of lending operations might not readily be obtainable otherwise.</P>
    <P>The reorganisation of the corporation's share capital involves no effective reduction in its lending resources in view of the extent of its power to raise loan capital.  Only £500,000 of mortgage bonds are at present in issue out of the statutory maximum of £7,500,000 available for creation, and it is unlikely that the demand for new <Col N="972" /> loans will so seriously exceed repayments of loans already made as to require in the coming years the issue of more than part of the available balance of £7,000,000.  At present many farmers have money in bank which they are unable to employ productively on their farms partly because of the acute shortage of materials.</P>
    <P>The lending powers of the corporation are being widened because it has been found that the existing limitations are too restrictive.  For example, the corporation cannot at present make a loan to a co-operative society which even as an incidental part of its business sells goods retail except these goods are produced by the society itself or by its members or are requisites of agricultural production or marketing. Many co-operative societies which are clearly agricultural in character cannot at present obtain loans from the corporation because they sell ordinary household requisites produced by industrial concerns even though such sales may form only a very small portion of their retail business and an infinitesimal part of their total business. It is now proposed to exclude only co-operative societies which, in the opinion of the directors of the corporation, engage in retail sales of nonagricultural goods as a substantial part of their business.</P>
    <P>In general, it is proposed that loans may be made to the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  individuals who are farmers; (b) bodies corporate which are farmers in the sense defined in the Bill, and (c) bodies corporate which have as their principal business the supplying of agricultural goods or services to farmers.</P>
    <P>In Section 3 of the Bill, a &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; is defined as any person who carries on some form of agriculture or any body corporate which as its principal business carries on some form of agriculture. For this purpose the term &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; is defined in the Bill as including, in addition to the activities covered by the definition in the 1927 Act under which the corporation is at present working, the processing, manufacture, preparation or completion for sale of any farm produce.  Loans may accordingly be made to qualified persons for all purposes which, in the <Col N="973" /> opinion of the directors, relate to agriculture.</P>
    <P>These wide powers are qualified by certain restrictions and prohibitions contained in the Bill, of which the most important are:&mdash; (1) the limit of £10,000 in the amount of the maximum loan which the corporation may make to any person with the exception of a co-operative society; (2) that power is not given to make loans for the purchase of land, save for the purpose of realising a security held by the corporation, and (3) that the corporation cannot alter the lending powers as expressed in its memorandum and articles of association in accordance with the terms of the Bill without the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with chattel mortgages, which were first introduced into this country by the Act of 1927. It is proposed to establish a system which will enable chattel mortgages to be taken by the corporation or by a bank from any borrower in the ordinary course of business, and such mortgages may relate to specific stock or to the floating stock from time to time on the borrower's land.  The proposed system will have the effect of restricting severely the manner in which the owner of stock the subject of a specific chattel mortgage may deal with it without the consent of the mortgagee.  It is hoped that these provisions will have the result of enabling farmers to borrow from the corporation and the banks by means of chattel mortgages to a greater extent than has been possible up to the present.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill codifies and amends the law relating to charges on land in favour of the corporation.  The ten sections numbered 37 to 46 in Chapters I, II and III correspond to the provisions of the 1928 Act and Part III of the 1929 Act.  To remove doubts, it is made clear by this Bill that the priority of corporation charges on land over the rights of equitable or puisne claimants covers not only principal but extends also to interest and to any expenses incurred in realising the security for the loan. The power given to an executor or administrator, by the Act of 1929, to <Col N="974" /> charge lands with repayment of a loan not exceeding £400 obtained from the corporation for any purpose for which the corporation is entitled to make advances, is strengthened and clarified. The corporation is also being given statutory power to sell and convey lands registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1891, without discharging the note as to equities.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with miscellaneous matters.  Section 53 re-enacts Section 26 of the 1929 Act which provided that debts due to the corporation might be proved in the Circuit Court by sealed certificate, instead of by sworn affidavit.  This provision is necessary in view of Circuit Court Rules made subsequent to the Act of 1929.  Section 54 abrogates the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to make loans for farm improvements under certain existing enactments. Section 55 was inserted on the Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann in implementation of the general policy regarding Irish in relation to appointments to State sponsored companies and organisations.</P>
    <P>The principles on which the Bill has been drafted were not subjected to criticism in Dáil Éireann and on the whole its proposals were favourably received by Deputies of all Parties in that House.</P>
    <P>It was possible for me to meet by amendments on the Report Stage a number of the points made by Deputies during the discussion in Committee. The paragraphs of Section 24 which gave the corporation and the banks the right to inspect chattel mortgage registers were criticised severely by several Deputies on the grounds that they militated against the secrecy of the registers and, although these provisions merely re-enacted existing law under the 1927 and 1929 Acts, an amendment was submitted in the name of the Minister for Finance on the Report Stage providing that the corporation or a bank cannot in future inspect a register of chattel mortgages directly but must do so through the county registrar.  In addition, any request to the county registrar for information contained in the chattel mortgage <Col N="975" /> register for his area must be made under seal, and must be specific and not general.</P>
    <P>Section 28, under which it would have been possible &mdash; even though unlikely to occur &mdash; for the corporation or a bank to require immediate repayment of the full amount due on a floating chattel mortgage when the mortgagor sold any of the stock off his lands, was amended so that the obligation of repayment would not arise if the mortgagor within one month restored the value of the stock on the land to the value of the stock at the date on which the mortgage was made.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 29 regarding the service of notices for the purpose of converting floating chattel mortgages into specific chattel mortgages were amended in the Dáil so as to provide that such notices must be delivered to the mortgagor or left at his residence or place of business with a member of his family or his agent, clerk or servant.</P>
    <P>I might say a word about Sections 26 and 53 in regard to which there has been some misconception.  These provisions are designed to mitigate legal expenses recoverable from defaulters and do not involve any new principle not enshrined in earlier legislation. Section 53 merely re-enacts Section 26 of the 1929 Act.  The section does not deprive any person sued by the corporation of the protection which the law affords him against an unfounded claim. A certificate under the section is <i>prima facie</i> proof only and if a defence is entered and the correctness of the corporation's claim challenged, the corporation would find it necessary to prove the claim in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Section 26 of the Bill replace the provisions of Section 26 of the 1927 Act under which the mortgages has the right to seize the stock when any moneys due under a specific chattel mortgage are outstanding for more than seven days.  Seizure and realisation will in future be carried out by the county registrar acting on the direction of the lending body and the period that moneys may be outstanding is extended to 14 days.  I am quite satisfied that unless a lender of money on foot of a specific chattel is in a position <Col N="976" /> to realise his security promptly when the need arises, there is no future at all for this means of credit for farmers.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, the members of the House may desire that I should give some facts in relation to the financial position of the corporation and the service which it has rendered to farmers. The report and accounts for the year ended on the 31st October, 1946, show that up to that date it had made, since the commencement of business, 26,403 loans aggregating £2,716,000.  The average loan was thus £103.  The amount of loans outstanding at that date was £844,000, and the other main asset of the corporation consisted of trustee securities to the value of £328,000, the total of its assets being £1,181,000.  The corporation's main liabilities consisted of £500,000 Three Per Cent.  State-guaranteed Mortgage Stock and the paid-up capital of £500,000.  Sundry creditors stood at just over £125,000, the great bulk of which consisted of reserves, including a reserve for bad debts of £110,000, approximately.  This substantial reserve has been built up to the extent of almost one-half by the recovery in recent years of sums deemed irrecoverable during the period of agricultural economic depression.  There was a bank overdraft of about £47,000.  The total of these and other minor liabilities was £1,181,000.</P>
    <P>Attention may be directed to the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill, which ensure that full annual statements of the financial and other aspects of the corporation's business will in future be presented to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill to give the corporation a more flexible instrument than has hitherto been in their possession, so that they may be enabled to give financial assistance to farmers in need of it without imposing too great a burden on them; and also to include among its beneficiaries many classes of small holders who in the past were precluded from consideration on purely technical grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that this Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary presents it, demands from me any considerable criticism.  One might say <Col N="977" /> that, to a large extent, it is a machinery Bill and an addition, in some respects, to existing legislation.  However, there are certain radical changes. It is definitely a change of significance that private interests will cease to have any function in the corporation and that it will become a purely State institution on the passing of this measure.  I shall not comment on that; I shall leave that to some of my colleagues. This measure is, in itself, very disappointing.  It is even more disappointing inasmuch as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance came to both Houses of the Oireachtas with the measure.  I have no desire that the Parliamentary Secretary should take any personal offence at what I am going to say but I fail completely to understand why a Bill dealing with agricultural credit should be handled in the Dáil and in the Seanad by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance when the Minister himself was present at the introduction of the measure in the other House and when, presumably, both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture could be available here to-day.</P>
      <P>So far as I know, the Parliamentary Secretary's duties in the past did not bring him into any very intimate contact with the problems of agricultural credit or the needs of the farmers. This was not the method adopted when the original Bill was introduced and I suggest that, if the Government were serious in facing up to this problem of agricultural credit, either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture would be handling this Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary is given the task and I suggest that that is done because either of the Ministers would be expected to answer questions as to what was the Government's policy on agricultural credit.  Because there is no policy to fit into the times and circumstances through which we are passing and which we shall have to face in the future, the Parliamentary Secretary is given this, perhaps to him, unwelcome task.  The Government's approach to this vast problem can be only depressing to any of us who appreciates the necessity of credit for farmers both now and in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> I shall expect the Parliamentary Secretary to have something to say when replying on this question.  Let us get some insight into the Government mind.  Are we still living in the year 1927, when the original Bill was passed?  Have any changes taken place in the world or in this country since then?  If so, are they visible to the Parliamentary Secretary's colleagues? Are they doing anything to provide us with the instruments which we need to face the future?</P>
    <P>When talking about agricultural credit, we have to ask ourselves what is the purpose of providing credit for agriculture.  Perhaps we should, firstly, ask ourselves what is the purpose of agriculture at all.  In the opening paragraph of the second minority report on agricultural policy by the committee of inquiry, we have briefly put, in my judgment, the purpose agricultural policy should be directed towards&mdash;&ldquo;the maximum and most economic utilisation of the land in the interests of the farmer and of the community as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Any of us could accept that.  If policy is to be directed towards the maximum economic utilisation of the land, the land must be properly equipped to have it fully utilised.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield is not in the House, but if he were speaking on behalf of industry he would be definite and explicit that no industrial project in this country or anywhere else can be a success if it is under-capitalised.  There is a minimum amount of capital requisite for economic production and if that is not available you cannot hope to have economic production.  Has any thought been given to that by the Government?  Is there any policy in regard to it?  We have no sign of that in the Bill and no evidence of it from the Parliamentary Secretary.  His Minister was in the House when this measure was debated.  Why did he not speak?</P>
    <P>In a very able analysis of the position by Deputy Hughes, which I would advise Senators to read if they are interested in the comparisons between here and elsewhere, the Deputy threw out a challenge, which no one saw fit to answer.  It may be said that the <Col N="979" /> Parliamentary Secretary answered it, but we will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>Do farmers need credit?  Where are we to get the answer?  In the Report of the Commission of Inquiry on PostWar Agricultural Policy, set up by the Government, we find the views of specialists of considerable ability, who gave some years to the task of providing the Government with reports on which to work.  What have they to say on this?  Some Senators not directly interested in agriculture may be glad to get a glimpse of their viewpoint on this subject.  There is a Majority Report, one of the signatories to which is the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation himself.  Briefly, they discuss capital and credit and their view is that while these can be met by existing institutions the rate at which long-term credit can be obtained is important.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We recommend that interest rates should be as low as possible and that every facility should be afforded to competent and enterprising farmers to obtain reasonable credit for permanent improvements calculated to increase production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They continue:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We also recommend that the possible requirements of our agriculture for borrowed capital should be borne in mind before large-scale commitments are made involving the expenditure of capital on non-agricultural projects.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is given on page 89, paragraphs 302 and 303.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first Minority Report, given on page 151, they say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Credit.&mdash;It is recommended that long-term loans on favourable terms be made available to farmers for the remodelling of old and the erection of new dwellings and farm buildings as well as for land reclamation and <Col N="980" /> other farm improvements of a permanent character.  All such loans should become a claim on the farm rather than on the borrower.  We would particularly emphasise the necessity for a low rate of interest on loans in respect of both long and short-term borrowing in view of the poor returns from capital invested in land as pointed out in Parts IV and V of this report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we go on to the Second Minority Report and we find reference to the question of credit.  On page 207, the conclusion is reached, briefly, that to get the production outlined, additional capital of something of the order of £200,000,000 is necessary.  There you have three views which were submitted to the Government more than 12 months ago.  Senator Johnston, who was a member of the committee, can tell us just how long ago it was.  On some portions of the report, White Papers have been issued already &mdash; on dairying, on the veterinary situation, on cattle breeding schemes and on poultry production.  But on credit there has been no White Paper and no evidence of policy.  We are doing practically the same thing as in 1927.</P>
    <P>The beginning of everything is the money, the capital the farmers need to start the wheels turning.  Unless the Government appreciates that, there is no use in getting commissions or committees of inquiry to plan agricultural policies for us.  There is no use in the Government issuing White Papers about their policy unless the mechanism is provided to enable the farmers to operate the policy.  The Parliamentary Secretary's own view appears to be that we are doing quite well and are better off than other countries &mdash; judging by something he said in the House the other day.  I suggest that one small country with which comparison can be made is Denmark.  According to Dr. Beddy, the amount of capital invested in agriculture in Denmark is £179,000,000.  We are supposed to have £14,500,000 invested here.  Denmark is two-thirds the size of Ireland and the national income is £66,500,000, or 45 per cent more than ours.  In Denmark the net output per acre in 1937 was £10, while the net output here was £4</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that due to inadequate capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only make our own deductions from the facts as they are.  Some may make one deduction from them and others may make another.  At any rate, we can only assess the value of the material presented, and then take our decision on policy.  The net output per worker in Denmark in 1937 was £155.  In Eire, it was £76.  That is not anything to boast about, but there are reasons for it.  There are certain other figures available.  They were presented in the other House by Deputy Hughes and the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is the national income per head of the population.  Deputy Hughes gave a number of extracts, many of them from Dr. Beddy's paper which is a very valuable contribution to the whole subject of agricultural thought in this country.  The Parliamentary Secretary, speaking on that, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not propose to follow the bad example set by so many different speakers but I propose to deal with some criticisms which have been levelled at this Bill.  The first speaker we had was Deputy Hughes. Deputy Hughes made a comparison between agricultural conditions in this country and in Denmark and by a most extraordinary system of reasoning, he suggested that the amount of money borrowed by farmers in Denmark should be regarded as assets.  That is a new process of reasoning in my opinion.  Other Deputies who followed made comparisons also with Denmark.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to continue making comparisons between this country and Denmark but may I, once and for all, dispose of these arguments by quoting from a work written by a gentleman who can scarcely be accused of being pro-Fianna Fáil? I am referring to <i>Conditions of Economic Progress</i> by Colin Clarke, M.A., Director of Queensland Bureau of Industry, government statistician, financial adviser to the treasury and formerly university lecturer at Cambridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 40 of this book is given a table which compares the real income <Col N="982" /> per head of the population in the various countries.  We can cut out borrowing and compare the real income, as this writer has done.  In Denmark, despite all the borrowing and all the lending and the various wonderful schemes that we are told are denied to the people of this country, what do we find by comparison of the real income?  In Denmark, the real income per head of the population, as expressed in terms of dollars, is 680 dollars while here in Eire &mdash;(I ask Senators to note the way it is put) &mdash; it is 705 dollars despite the fact that in Denmark the farmers have been able to borrow according to Deputy Hughes to the extent of 170,000,000, whereas the amount which the Irish farmers, being far more conservative perhaps, have been borrowing is something in the nature of 12,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I think my friend, Senator O'Dea, seems satisfied on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>He knows there is a snag in it somewhere.  The Parliamentary Secretary said: &ldquo;While here in Eire it is 705 dollars&rdquo; having said that it was 680 dollars in Denmark.  When asked: &ldquo;In what year was that?&rdquo;  he replied: &ldquo;From 1925 to 1934.&rdquo;  I wonder who will suggest that, here in Éire in 1947, the figures are exactly as stated by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would like to draw the attention of the House and of the Parliamentary Secretary to this, that we have got to face the facts of the situation as they are.  We have to find a way out of this situation, and we can only do that by critical and impartial examination of the facts.  In that way we will see the light if we want to see it.  What are the facts?  According to the Report of the Banking Commission, the figures in 1935 were earnings per head of the population in Eire, £50, and in Denmark, £58.  It is interesting to note that the Parliamentary Secretary was able to select the period, &ldquo;1925 to 1934&rdquo;&mdash; during which his mark and that of his colleagues was being left on agriculture and on agricultural incomes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the earning per head <Col N="983" /> of the population of Éire in 1935 was £50, and in Denmark, £58.  There is additional information which is of importance from the point of view of the Parliamentary Secretary in the figures which he quoted from Colin Clarke, to this extent that when they are further examined they reveal the fact that Colin Clarke was quoting the earnings of the employed population in both countries.  We have a practice in this country&mdash;it does not obtain in Denmark &mdash;which gives this result: that probably 40,000 of our recorded unemployed are amongst the agricultural community&mdash;small farmers and so on. Now, if you take these out of the &ldquo;earnings&rdquo;, it is easy to advance the &ldquo;earnings.&rdquo;  As most of us know, these people are actually working.  That is so in my county and in other counties. As we say, they are working &ldquo;awhile of the day anyhow&rdquo; for somebody. There are the figures for what they are worth.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine them again, because there is not any use in trying to pretend that this country is so much better off than other countries.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary was correct in his argument in the other House it would, I take it, be right to assume that the standard of living was higher in Denmark than it was here. I have not been to Denmark, and I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has ever been there.  But here is what Dr. Beddy says with regard to living standards &mdash; in the last analysis the test is the income which the people have &mdash; and I should like to have it on record:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite substantial payments by so large a part of the Danish community for interest and amortisation charges, there is a higher standard of living than in Eire as indeed is suggested by the respective national income of both countries.  While available statistics do not admit of precise measurement in this matter, a few facts will serve to support the point.  In Denmark, in 1938, there was a telephone to every 10 or 11 persons; in Eire there was not quite one to every 100 persons.  So also, nearly one out of five persons had a <Col N="984" /> wireless set as compared with a little over one to every 20 persons in Eire. These and other amenities are not confined to urban districts.  Unlike Eire, in nearly all rural houses there is electric light; in many there is central heating, a bathroom and a telephone; while in even the smallest house there is usually a wireless set. In addition, Denmark had over two and a quarter times more automobiles than Eire in 1938.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position in a country two-thirds the size of this.  We are all familiar, of course, with the story of how much higher the standard of living is here as compared to Denmark.  We used to hear it said that, while the Danes exported their butter, we eat ours.  Here is what Dr. Beddy says on that with regard to tea, coffee, sugar, and tobacco.  He gives the following figures:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of tea, the figure for Denmark is 0.3 lb. and for Eire, 8.6 lb.; coffee, Denmark, 16.5 lb. and Eire, 0.2 lb.; sugar, Denmark, 7.9 stones; Eire, 5.4 stones; tobacco, Denmark, 4.9 lb., and Eire 3.2 lb. These figures relate to the consumption per head per annum in 1937.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While we are among the heavy tea-drinking nations, Denmark, as a consumer of coffee, drinks about one-third more per head than the United States of America and is also one of the world's heaviest consumers of sugar.  In butter and milk she falls far short of Eire, some figures regarding this being: Butter, Eire, 32 lb.; Denmark, 12 lb.; milk, Eire, 31 gallons; Denmark, 19 gallons; milk equivalent of butter and milk (gallons), Eire, 111; Denmark, 50 (increased greatly after 1931).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This, however, is no indication of a higher standard of living, since the figures in the final column compare with 65 for Great Britain and 82 for U.S.A.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is milk consumption, and I do not know if anyone will challenge the standard of living here as against these countries.  The figures signify that we use butter and milk as alternative foods to a greater extent than other countries.  In meat, however, which is <Col N="985" /> a dearer commodity and one which must usually be purchased in shops, our consumption is substantially lower than that of Denmark.  Per head of the population, we eat about 40 per cent. less bacon and only about half as much fresh meat.  So also in cheese, our consumption is trifling, while that of Denmark is, in weight, over 75 per cent. of her butter consumption.  Finally, Denmark's consumption of fish in 1938 was 36 lbs. per head of population, which contrasts with approximately 12½ lbs. in Éire.</P>
    <P>The Minister can examine these figures, the standard of output and income; output per man and output per 100 acres and income per head of the population, to see if he will, once and for all, dispense with the argument. Now I could continue on these lines for a long period.  I could quote from other countries, like New Zealand, to indicate what has been done there, but we all have the evidence of our eyes and we all know the backward conditions in agriculture.  We all know that agricultural output in this country, far from increasing in the last 25 or 30 years, is on the decline and actually declined during the war despite all the talk. Great Britain increased her production by 70 per cent.  I just do not know what the full drop in production here might be.  It might be in the region of 10 per cent.  I have figures here regarding output and if we take the position in 1929-30 as 100, we find that in 1938-39 it was 97, in 1942-43, 87.1, in 1943-44, 88.3, and in 1944-45, 93.6, showing a net decrease of 6.4 since 1929-30.  Can we be satisfied with this position?  Clearly we cannot, and we have got to discover where the fault in our economy lies and how we will improve that situation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever in the world but that our first essential is capital.  I am in agreement with Dr. Kennedy's viewpoint that we want hundreds of millions of capital put into agriculture to increase the productive effort of the people on the land if we are going to raise the living standards for the whole community and ensure that the nation is strong, nationally, politically, spiritually and economically. I am convinced that nothing that has been given us by way of machinery or agricultural credit, even from the <Col N="986" /> beginning, can be regarded as satisfactory. I had the privilege of being one of the original directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  A number of my colleagues of these days have passed to their reward.  One of the first decisions of the original board was to go to the Minister for Finance, before, I think, we had even two chairs, and to tell him frankly that in our judgment the scheme was not really workable as an inducement for providing the kind of credit farmers needed. I cannot say that we made a hasty exit, but at any rate we did not take any more money away with us than we had when we were going in.  The position to-day is only slightly better and I am not surprised that the progress is so slow.  I have complained at the beginning that neither of the Ministers who should deal with this question has put in an appearance.  We have had many discussions in this House, as there were in the other House, on this problem and we were always met with the same attitude.  There are a number of Senators here now who were here when I raised this question before the war.  We had a debate in this House on March 15th, 1939, when the then Minister for Finance spoke, and I would like to refresh his colleagues' minds of his attitude then, so that they can draw their own conclusions about the kind of crops we have been reaping as a consequence of his attitude in these years.  I had spoken first and then Mr. MacEntee spoke.  He was Minister for Finance then.  I think the present Minister is the third since.  Mr. MacEntee on that occasion said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is all very well to say: &lsquo;Give the farmer money and let him produce the things that he can produce.&rsquo; After all, he does not produce these goods for himself alone.  He produces them for sale and if there is no ready market for these goods then his increased production represents a dead loss to himself, and, accordingly, in these circumstances, production may be foolish and may be harmful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder are there amongst the Minister's colleagues in his Party any one who can recall that statement from him in March, 1939.  He went on further and said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" />&ldquo;I think that in the present circumstances the best thing for our people is to try to work ahead here as best they can.  If they have capital at their disposal and they think that with their own money they can exploit the present situation, by all means let them go ahead and do it. They do it at their own risk, and if their speculation happens to turn out right, well for them &mdash; they will get the whole gain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Mr. MacEntee's attitude then.  No encouragement whatever!  If the farmers liked to take the risk, they could.  Look at the encouragement he is giving them to produce.  Is it any wonder that to-day these goods are short?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not a question of tariffs.  It was a question of credit, and he went on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is £35,000,000 of farmers' deposits in the Irish banks and my contention is that if there was such an opportunity of putting a couple of these millions into agriculture, as Deputies and Senators tell us about, it would be better employed in agriculture than in lying in any bank in this country earning 1 or 1½ per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There you have the mentality of the Minister for Finance in 1939.  I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us if there has been any change, or when can we hope for a change.  There is no change so far as this measure reveals the attitude of mind of the Government to agricultural credit, and in so far as we are still practically in the 1927 position, we are not facing up to the problem of agricultural development at all.  I do not know whether the Government appreciate the fact that we have land here of which we could make much more, if we had the equipment.  Had we had the equipment &mdash; Senator McEllin may glibly or light-heartedly, jocosely or perhaps seriously, interrupt me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Seriously, then.  He may seriously interrupt me and say that the Minister had another policy then.  We were trying to press on the Minister then what we regarded as a wise policy, a policy which would enable the country to get equipped for greater production, but he would not listen, and we were not equipped.  We had nothing when we entered the war years and then we could not get the equipment. It is a fact that the potentialities for increased production here are immense.  The Committee on Post-Emergency Agricultural Planning have attempted to measure them.  I have given a good deal of consideration to this, but it is time we were beginning this task.  We need not be afraid of putting money into agriculture for the purpose of increasing production. Specialists have told us it can be done. We need not be too much afraid of the competition of the others because the fact is that never in human history was there enough food for all the peoples of the world.  We cannot hope to live in the world side by side with people whose production is increasing steadily, even if only fractionally, year after year, while ours is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said that our production fell during the war, but something else fell to an extent which it is impossible to measure &mdash; the fertility of our soil. The Post-Emergency Committee suggest that we have somewhere over 9,000,000 acres of arable land, although we used to think we had 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 arable acres.  We have been tilling now since 1939, and I suggest that, on at least 6,000,000 of those acres over which our ploughs have gone, we have cashed in practically all the phosphates, nitrogen and potash that were in them.  I should like some of the specialists to attempt a measurement and an evaluation of what that means to future production, how long it will take us to restore that fertility and what capital will be necessary for its restoration.  It is a frightening task for anybody who wants to see it accomplished, and who, at the same time, <Col N="989" /> sees a position in which no effort is being made to tackle it.</P>
    <P>We come then to the method adopted to provide this capital on this very limited scale, with this small piece of mechanism in which savings of hundreds and thousands have to be calculated when we ought to be thinking of a scheme involving hundreds of millions. What do we find?  The scheme lions.  What do we find?  The scheme appears to be that money is to be provided by the State for the Credit Corporation at 2½ per cent.  It is to be handed over to the corporation at that price.  What will it be when the farmer gets it?  From my experience, 1 per cent. additional will barely cover the costs, which makes it 3½ per cent., and the borrower has to defray certain expenses, such as mortgage charges and such things, which will probably bring the cost of the loan into the region of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, that is beyond the capacity of agriculture, unless food prices are to rise to a very exorbitant level.  You cannot have it both ways. The people who want low food prices must make up their minds that farming costs must be reduced to the lowest possible level.  There are certain costs which will have to be raised.  Costs of labour will have to be raised, and machine costs are going up.  Other charges like rates are rising year after year.  If human wages are to cost us more and machines are to cost us more, the wages of money must cost us less. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me what is the justification for making money available to a local authority to build a house for a labourer which will cost the local authority 2½ per cent., while, if the farmer wants to borrow to build a house for himself, the money will cost him 4 per cent.?  Why must you always differentiate against the countryman?  The only reason is that there is, as yet, no proper approach to the rebuilding of our countryside.</P>
    <P>Somebody will tell me &mdash; perhaps Senator Sir John Keane, though I hope he will have more sense&mdash;that you cannot expect money to be cheap.  One of the difficulties, I know, with which the Government are confronted in this matter is that they are undertaking to find money.  There are various ways of finding it, and I suggest to the Government <Col N="990" /> that the time has come for them to amend their Central Bank Act in such a way as will make it possible for the Central Bank to provide the credits for the Credit Corporation which will go out to the farmer to rehabilitate the land, the farmhouses and the farmyards of the country.  I am not going into a discussion of amendments suggested to another Bill on this measure, but I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might do some &ldquo;stewing&rdquo; over that.</P>
    <P>I should like to see Government policy in this matter much more courageous and unorthodox than it is. I should like to see them, if they are making a State organisation of this Credit Corporation, providing them not only with the capital which would be attractive to men who wanted to make greener fields, pleasanter farmyards and better and more economically managed homes than we have but with the equipment to do something else. In my time on the board, a certain problem very frequently presented itself for the directors' consideration. They made loans which did not turn out fruitful.  They made loans in instances in which they were not able to collect the interest, much less get the principal repaid.  I cannot say from memory what the reasons were &mdash; there were various reasons &mdash; but one perhaps naturally was that they were limited to 50 per cent. of the value, and it very frequently happened, I am sure, that it would have required a loan 60 or 70 per cent. of the value of the assets being mortgaged adequately to capitalise a farm.</P>
    <P>You have either got to have sufficient capital or you are, as we say, pulling the devil by the tail.  We had in my time various discussions about the possibilities of doing something about these farms &mdash; doing something to rehabilitate them &mdash; and in my view there are thousands and thousands in this country that are very badly in need of rehabilitation.  Nobody is bothering about them.  They are supposed to be carrying rents and rates.  They are supposed to be giving output and a reasonable and decent standard of living to their owners.  They are not doing that. They are doing none of these things, and somehow or other the community <Col N="991" /> is having to bear the burden.  Somehow or other&mdash;I have not tried to think out and it is not my problem from beginning to end but I am quite sure that somehow or other not alone should much more capital be made available but it should be made available to reach the farmer as Deputy Hughes said in the other House at a rate of interest at 2 per cent.  In addition, there should be some organisation constructed somehow or other &mdash; not to be the equivalent of the T.V.A., the Tennessee Valley Association &mdash; but there is necessity all over the country for an organisation that would reestablish a man properly on his farm. It would take nurturing and advice, and a proper, careful investigation of capital, advice about productive efforts and so on along the lines on which no one in the country to-day is attempting to provide.  But the necessity is there and we are not going to get the best out of the land of this country until we provide some machinery like that because these people to-day are no man's children.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this Bill &mdash; it is a machinery measure and some of the things the Parliamentary Secretary is attempting to do I heard discussed in my own period of office ten years ago &mdash; is not getting us very much forward in attempting to solve the whole problem that faces this country with regard to more capital for agriculture and more and better productivity from the land, higher living standards for the people on the land and for the people in the cities and towns who are dependent on our productive efforts for what they get to eat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose at this late hour to follow Senator Baxter into his high flights in rural economy, but I do want to join issue with him on one general principle which he stressed and emphasised. That is that ample capital is the solution of our agricultural difficulties.  I totally disagree with him.  He talks about Denmark and their higher standard of living and higher standard of production, all of which I admit. Then he makes a totally unwarranted <Col N="992" /> assumption when he says that these are due to the fact that Danish farmers have had, and use effectively, more capital than the Irish farmer.  I say it is due, as far as it can be due to any one main cause, to the long and well-established co-operative movement in Denmark which has been established for well over 100 years.  It is a movement very far wider than mere agriculture &mdash; a spiritual movement.  Is it known that the Danish co-operative movement was established by a bishop and that it had a spiritual urge behind it?  It had a moral purpose&mdash;the betterment of the people &mdash; and it has built up a system of agricultural organisation which is I suppose the most efficient in the world.  And connected with that there is a highly-developed standard of agricultural organisation, and so we see in Denmark the most orderly marketing, the most highly-developed methods of production, and that in my opinion is the reason for Denmark's outstanding position as an agriculturally-producing country.  And that explains why it has been able to use so effectively and to such good purpose the large amount of capital it has.  I accept those figures which Senator Baxter says it has been able to use.</P>
      <P>And what does Senator Baxter propose?  He talks of £200,000,000.  Is somebody going to go out and proclaim: &ldquo;Here is £200,000,000, come along boys and help yourselves.&rdquo;  That is not the way it works.  It works from the individual below.  The farmer by education is out to improve himself if he can.  He finds he will want more capital and he goes out to see where he can get it.  I say there is no difficulty in farmers getting capital to-day if they are credit-worthy and in a position to use it.  The difficulty is, a lot of farmers do not want capital.  You cannot make a man take capital who does not want it.  It may be defective education but it may be good sense. The farmer himself is the best judge of his own case and this £200,000,000 if it were let loose would be a most profligate procedure and would cause unwarranted inflation at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, any farmer who wants <Col N="993" /> capital to-day and is credit-worthy and can show that he is a deserving person can get it.  He can get it from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and he can get it from the banks.  I do not want to develop that matter any further because it is a very big question but I do want to make my few remarks as a curtain-raiser to the debate which I hope will take place to-morrow or next day as to the proper activities of the Government or State on the motion in Senator Sweetman's name.  In that you have a startling example in the whole of this attempt on agricultural credit of how not to do it.</P>
    <P>When I was on the Agricultural Credit Commission in 1923 this question of credit for farmers came up and a recommendation &mdash; not a minority recommendation but a majority recommendation &mdash; was made that the machinery of the banks should be used for the purpose of credit for smaller farmers. The difficulty at the time was&mdash; and it still appertains to a certain extent in theory but much less in practice &mdash;that the banks will not make long-term loans, and it seemed to be necessary to set up some machinery for that purpose.  It is true the banks do not advisedly like long-term loans &mdash; much over ten years&mdash;but they frequently make them.  If you were to take the record of agricultural loans in the banks you will find many of them have run a great deal longer than ten years. What we suggested then was that we should use the credit and organisation of the banks and ask the banks to set up an organisation somewhat similar to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The suggestion was to earmark a sum&mdash; £1,000,000 as a start&mdash;to set up an organisation among the banks combined in association with the Government and let that organisation cater for long-term credit and for rather smaller and less credit-worthy farmers, with the class of assets that the banks might not be alone satisfied with.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was that there should be a member of the Government on the board of this body and that the advances should be in the nature of trade loans; that where a bank, as a bank, did not want to accommodate a certain person, that person could go to this <Col N="994" /> special body and there, in association with the Government, a guarantee might possibly be given and the loan could be made for any agreed term at a lower rate than would ordinarily be the case inasmuch as the loan would carry a Government guarantee.  That seemed to be a good business proposition. But were the banks ever approached? Was the recommendation of that commission ever given consideration? Whatever consideration it was given, the matter never came before the banks.  I say that the Government of that day&mdash;it was not the present Government which was responsible&mdash; suffered from lack of vision when they ignored that recommendation and embarked on a State organisation where no State organisation was necessary to achieve the purpose desired.  In England, I may say in passing, an organisation of the type I have suggested was set up and has worked satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>What is the record of this body, with its complicated capital structure, its certificates of charge and financial mumbo-jumbo?  In fact, it has cost the State about £350,000 to meet interest on the capital&mdash;interest which could not be provided out of the profits of the organisation.  Roughly, £350,000 of the ratepayers' money has been spent to provide an organisation which could have been supplied in association with the banks, who have the resources of credit necessary to meet all the purposes required.  Look at the difference between the banks and this organisation. Here, you have set up an organisation in Kildare Street, with no organisation throughout the country, which has to use the Garda Síochána in some cases to give reports on the status of borrowers.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that, once the Government start this sort of thing, you cannot stop it.  It takes a revolution to stop these things.  If the Government really had the courage, they would go to the banks to-morrow and say: &ldquo;This organisation is quite unnecessary; you can do the work; come into consultation with us and see whether you cannot do all the work even at cheaper rates than we are charging.&rdquo; Ample resources would be available and the services of the bank agents all over the country would be at the disposal <Col N="995" /> of such a body.  A first-class information service would thus be available.  If that had been done, the country would have been saved £356,000.  But once you set up a State organisation, you cannot go back.  If this had been a private organisation and if it had the record of this body, it would have been bankrupt.  Then, it would have started on a proper basis.  You may be sure that, as time goes on, more subventions will be required for one reason or another.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the details of this measure.  I know that the organisation is going to stay and that, by some means or another, it is going to widen its powers.  It has so stretched the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; as to enable it to make a loan to anybody remotely connected with industries ancillary to agriculture.  It is going to be a burden round the neck of the country for years to come.  The work could be far better done at no higher cost by the banks.  I cannot speak for the banks but I am sure they could put up a scheme to-morrow which would do this work far more efficiently than it is being done.  They have ample funds for legitimate credit &mdash; not the astronomical and absurd figures which Senator Baxter mentioned.</P>

      <P>Is this money to remain out for all time?  Is this sum of £200,000,000 never to circulate?  Is this debt of £200,000,000 to lie out indefinitely on farm lands to keep agriculture on its feet?  I think that that <Col N="996" /> would be wild inflation.  That is all that I can see in it.  I feel that this is a warning.  You have got to have this Bill.  I do not know that it is any worse or any better than the one which went before.  Senator Baxter says that it is a machinery Bill.  It is a thing of shreds and patches and an example of how not to do it.  Even at this late hour, if the Government had vision, it would say: &ldquo;Let us get out of this whole thing.&rdquo; The former Government did get out of an early land bank.  There was a Minister with vision in those days and there was a thing called a land bank.  The Government went to the banks and said: &ldquo;We are bothered about this thing; all sorts of political opportunists are coming to us for one thing or another; we want to get rid of it.&rdquo;  They got rid of it and it remains a small, successful institution.</P>
      <P>If the Government were wise, they would go to-morrow to the banks and say: &ldquo;Can you meet us in doing all the work we want done even at rates cheaper than we are doing it?&rdquo;  We can do all the work.  We shall co-operate with you, take members of the Government on whatever new body is set up and provide a banking service suitable to the small agriculturist, with long-term loans and all the rest.  That is my contribution to the debate on this Bill.</P>
