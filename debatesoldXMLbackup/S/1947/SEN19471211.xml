      <P>In actual fact, the administration of the Central Library is very flexible in character, and on occasion, when asked, they do supply books of a special character to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed that the Central Library, under the new direction, will be a borrowers' library in the sense that the Dublin Corporation libraries are?  The Dublin Corporation has in contemplation a project for the building of a central library at considerable expense. Is it contemplated that the Central Library, under the new direction, will perform the same function as the Dublin Corporation libraries&mdash;that is to say that it will supply borrowers in the same way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Library does not encourage the practice of lending books to readers directly; not as part of its ordinary procedure, but in order to avoid unnecessary red tape it may occasionally lend specialist books to a student who is not able to procure them from a Dublin Corporation library.  It is not intended by this section that there should be a general tendency to lend books to large numbers of people.  I have here some figures giving a record of book issues <Col N="1508" /> for the year ending 31st December, 1944, and I find that out of 11,000 books lent, only 497 were to individuals.  I think we may take it that the Central Library will continue that tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>So that it will be used to supplement, by way of specialist books, the Dublin Corporation library service, and will not run parallel with it in the matter of lending out books to borrowers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 18, to delete the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; and substitute therefor the word &ldquo;fifteen.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I feel that 15 would not be too big a number to have on a committee of this character.  By adopting that number, an opportunity would be given for other important bodies to have representation on the committee.  I do not want to say anything on this amendment that would have any bearing on my later amendment.  The Bill stipulates for a committee of 12.  I am of opinion that if the number were increased to 15 an opportunity would be given for wider representation on it. Already, out of the 12 members who are to constitute the committee, the universities will have five members.  I consider that is out of proportion to their numbers and, consequently, I am moving this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given some thought to the various observations made by Senators in regard to altering the character of the council or the numbers thereof.  I am in great difficulty over this matter because it is essential to keep a balance between the local and academic elements on the one hand, and at the same time we wish to keep the council at its present size. We think that any additions to it would make it too unwieldy.  If we assume that it would be no harm for the council to have 15 members, there is still the difficulty that I have indicated of balancing it by adding to the number a sufficient number of representatives of local authorities.  If, for example, we were to agree to Senator Foran's proposal, we would have to add two representatives from the General Council of County Councils.  If we do that we shall overbalance the interests from the rural districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not mentioned anything about the General Council of County Councils.  Do not quote me as being responsible for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the belief of the Minister and of myself that the numbers must be equal, with the chairman to balance the issue.  A great deal of the work of the Central Library Council will have the effect of increasing the local rates, and will be closely related to the work of local authorities.  I had great difficulty in deciding in my own mind, even if we agreed to overbalance the academic element in this council, whether it would be best to have representatives of secondary school and of primary school interests with representatives from the Irish Vocational Education Association.  We have to bear in mind, in that connection, that all these interests can be represented on the local library committee and can influence the work of the Central Library Council indirectly in that way. We have also to bear in mind that there are persons attached to the universities who may be teachers or who may have the teaching profession very much at heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having thought the matter over, I am proposing two amendments which <Col N="1510" /> have been circulated in typescript to Senators.  The effect of these amendments is to make the Central Library Council a county council in respect of Section 58 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  Under that section, a county council may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as it thinks fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of any of the powers.  Now, the Central Library Council, under the terms of this amendment, may appoint these committees and may, in accordance with this amendment, actually have a permanent sub-committee, if it so desires, of all teaching interests, including representatives from the Irish Vocational Education Organisation, as well as of primary and secondary teachers, and can, if it so wishes, defray the travelling expenses of those persons so that they can attend and give their advice to the committee or committees without any hindrance to themselves.  That is the best compromise that I can think of under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>We feel that we need to have experts on books forming the largest part of the academic element on the council. It is the best compromise that I can consider under the circumstances. Otherwise, I am involved in the issue of whom I am to choose out of the three interests mentioned here, and of how to balance the council between the local authorities and the academic interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not serious in the compromise he suggests.  It puts the library council in power over the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Parliamentary Secretary means is that the Central Library Council will have power to appoint sub-committees of itself and of persons, not being members of the Central Library Council, as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Col N="1511" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>So that it may appoint a sub-committee which will include some members of the Central Council, and a primary or secondary teacher, or a manager of either a primary or a secondary school, if it so desires, but these sub-committees will have no other function but that already exercised, of advising the Central Library Council whose powers are not in any way being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It will allow certain powers to be delegated to these committees but obviously the Central Library Council must conserve its ultimate governing function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same way as a county council delegates its powers under the scholarship schemes to a scholarship committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Parliamentary Secretary's compromise, I think it very important that this side of education should be represented on the Central Council.  The Central Council, as it is to be constituted, gives no recognition whatever to the primary or secondary schools and therefore at the top there will be a body which will appoint sub-committees with no contact with either primary or secondary schools.  To that extent, the compromise loses much of its value and importance, whereas, if these bodies had direct representation on the Central Council, they would ensure that the sub-committees would be representative of these sides of education.  It is important that they should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion made by the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfactory, so far as it goes, but I feel a little disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary will not go the whole hog.  Perhaps I should remind the House of the nature of the body for which I am trying to secure representation.  Take an ordinary county vocational education committee. It is composed of members appointed by the county council, in the first instance, a minimum number, and then each urban authority within the area has a right to nominate one or two members.  In addition to the <Col N="1512" /> members from the county councils and the urban councils, there is a class called external members who very often include highly educated people, people who would certainly be very appropriate for appointment as members of library committees.  All such committees attend an annual congress and they appoint what is called a standing council, and if you were looking for an example of a representative body, a body which represents practically all classes of the people, you could scarcely get a better example.</P>
      <P>What is more, and, from my standpoint, very important, is that the committees are the best example of vocational education we have in the country inasmuch as, in addition to members of the committees who may be called the employing class, there are also officers of the committee represented on the standing council and so you have an excellent example of vocational organisation, one which was in existence long before the commission on vocational organisation commenced its work&mdash;20 or 30 years before in fact.  Since this body represents the various types of people engaged in purely administrative work, people appointed for their educational attainments and so on, it is a pity that the Parliamentary Secretary would not try, even at the cost of reducing the number of members from the General Council of County Councils, to provide a seat on the Central Council for this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that the Parliamentary Secretary has gone some distance towards meeting the views expressed and to that extent his suggestion is satisfactory, but I should like him to give more consideration to it and go one step further.  I do not think there would be any great jealousy if the representation of one of these bodies was altered, because very often the personnel are more or less the same and there would be no element of jealousy or disappointment if the Parliamentary Secretary did see his way to reduce their representation.  I think I see what the Parliamentary Secretary is aiming at.  Since there is a certain amount of money to be levied, he wants to give all the representation he can to the county councils and to the municipal <Col N="1513" /> authorities, but the particular body I mention, the Standing Council of the Irish Vocational Education Association, is composed very largely of similar bodies and similar people, but it also has the advantage of having an admixture of people appointed purely for their educational attainments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down my amendment with a view to urging the claim of the Royal Irish Academy to representation on this council, one reason being that the academy has a unique collection of Irish manuscripts and is uniquely qualified to give very valuable assistance on a Central Library Council.  The other reason is that, of the bodies mentioned, the Academy is the only one which has international contacts, which is in communication with all the other learned academies of the world.  Looking at the Central Library Council from the outside, it would be a help in providing a doorway through which to get things into the library.  It could furnish considerable service in that way.  I am not pressing this especially as expressing the wishes of the Academy.  I have not consulted any of the other members&mdash;I do not know whether any other members of the Seanad are members of the Academy &mdash;but I think it has strong claims to be represented and I suggest that they be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Senator Foran should accept the compromise put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary.  We could not very well pass the amendments as set out on the Order Paper because they do not specify what body would appoint these representatives.  The Bill designates those who are to appoint the representatives and they might be representatives of secondary, vocational or primary teachers, but the amendments do not specify who is to appoint the representatives suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but Senator Foran is perfectly satisfied with the Minister, as usual, in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Minister will appoint a person on the nomination of another body, but these amendments do not specify who would nominate the representative whom the Minister is to appoint, so that there is a difficulty there.  There are vocational education bodies, primary schools bodies and the teachers themselves, and the amendments are indefinite in that respect.  I have been speaking to Senator Foran and I thought I would support him, but I suggest that the compromise now put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary should meet the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing indefinite about the amendment standing in my name.  It mentions a very definite body, the Standing Council of the Irish Vocational Education Association. They would nominate and the Minister would appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Fearon's amendments, we propose to accept the alteration set out in amendment No. 2, but in connection with the Royal Irish Academy we would like to leave two representatives to Trinity College and we cannot increase further the members on the council.  I mention this particularly because I have noticed that, in the past two years, there have been people in Trinity who have given considerable assistance to both voluntary and other associations with regard to such matters as the Michael Davitt and Thomas Davis Centenaries.  Their work and help during these centenaries were very notable and I should like to encourage that kind of contribution from the college towards library development.  A number of people there have a great knowledge of Irish history and have shown their willingness to help when their help was asked for.  We all recall the work done on these two occasions and we feel that we would like to keep the representation the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Foran's amendment, I must ask him once more <Col N="1515" /> to bear with me in this matter.  There is nothing in the 1925 Act to prevent the Central Library Council from delegating its functions, so far as the encouragement of juvenile education is concerned, to a committee consisting of a secondary and a primary school teacher and a vocational education teacher.  They could say: &ldquo;We want you people to deal with this matter.  You will see the surveyors and give them their instructions and they will report back to you.  We are interested in the education of children, so far as good books of fiction and general knowledge are concerned, and we think you are very good specialists in this matter.  Deal with it for us&rdquo;.  So that, in reality, if the Central Library Council appoints such a committee, that committee can do very valuable work.  The committee could, alternatively, be composed of one member of the council, and three teachers representing all the teaching interests.  In the circumstances, it is the best compromise we can effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole, I should like to support the Parliamentary Secretary. His amendment has the advantage of making the Bill more elastic. We have an immense programme to get through here&mdash;I think we shall have to meet at 10.30 a.m. to-morrow &mdash;and on this particular question I want to brief.  I am not particularly enthusiastic about committees which have on them representatives from all kinds of places and bodies, because it is the personnel of a committee rather than the representation accorded which is generally the important thing so far as its work is concerned.  I understand the value of the Royal Irish Academy Library, but there are already five representatives from the university colleges&mdash;three from National University and two from Trinity.  One of these might very well be a member of the Royal Irish Academy because a great many of the staff in these colleges are members of the Royal Irish Academy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's amendment, as I say, makes the Bill more elastic and allows this business to work and to include teachers.  It should be <Col N="1516" /> said at once that, without the teachers, the scheme could not work at all in the country.  That should be acknowledged, but the arrangement the Parliamentary Secretary suggests seems to me, in present circumstances, to make the Bill more elastic and more workable.  On the whole, I think it ought to be accepted and I think it will be found to work well with the teachers.</P>

We have circulated an amendment that I propose to introduce on Report Stage which, I think, meets the point that was made by Senator O'Dea and other Senators. It is putting the onus of proof definitely on the prosecution.  It is to delete paragraph (b)&mdash;that is where we gave that defence to the defendant, to prove that it had not been printed in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  We are substituting therefor&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment is somewhat analogous to the matter we discussed yesterday.

The manner of numbering is set out in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (1), but sub-section (2) says that non-compliance with sub-section (1) of the section shall not affect the validity or the coming into force of any statutory instrument.  It is approximately the same point as was raised yesterday and I think the Minister will agree with me that it is very unsatisfactory as it stands, that the Act should impose on the Stationery Office an obligation to assign to each instrument printed by the Stationery Office a particular number, making the numbering a part of the law affecting the validity of an instrument or Order printed on behalf of the Government and then proceeding to say that, however, if they do not do that, it does not matter, it will not affect the validity or the coming into force of an Order or instrument.  Personally, I do not know how we are to overcome the difficulty which the Minister is guarding against, namely, an oversight.  I do not know how he can guard against it, but I think the Minister will agree that, as the sub-section stands, it is unsatisfactory and needs tightening up.</P>

      <P>The Senator will remember that all Orders are not of a punitive nature.  There are some Orders that confer benefits and it might so happen that, by an oversight, something that was conferring a benefit was published and not numbered.  It could be an Order of that kind also.</P>

      <P>I am merely saying that that is so.  There may possibly occur a case when, through inadvertence, someone does not do what he is required to do and it would be too bad if the Order was not effective for that reason.  If it should become anything like a practice, as long as the two Houses of the Oireachtas are there, Senators and Deputies will soon draw the attention of the Government to the fact that there was non-compliance with the Act.  I am sure the Senator knows that is the case.  I think you must have this saver in case there might be, through inadvertence, neglect to comply with this provision. I have considered it since and I took it to the Attorney-General and he says it is essential that that saving clause should be left there.  I have met the House fairly well about other points and I think the House ought to let that go.</P>

      <P>I am not anxious to do anything that will embarrass the Minister in regard to this Bill now but I do point out to the House that it is a most unusual practice to introduce a Bill for the purpose of enacting a law and to insert in the Bill a saving clause, that, notwithstanding all the precautions we are taking in this Bill, notwithstanding everything we say must be done, if somebody slips and the provisions of the Act are not complied with, it will not matter a tu'penny ticket because it will have the same force and validity as if everything was done in order.  I think that is objectionable.  I merely draw attention to the matter because I realise, as I said in the beginning, the problem which the Minister is confronted with, that is, the problem where a slip is made.  It certainly is a bad practice for this House to agree willingly to the <Col N="1520" /> insertion in legislation of a saving clause which makes nonsense of all the provisions of the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A similar amendment was moved in the Dáil and debated at great length, but the Minister seemed to indicate a firm refusal to accept it.  Nevertheless, many of us feel there is a principle involved in the Bill which will take away from the citizen a right he has had for 54 years&mdash;that where he is affected by a statute he has 40 days in which to make any protest.  When <Col N="1521" /> taking away a right existing for that length of time we should be careful, and if I do no more than have recorded on the records of this House a protest on all fours with that in the other House, I will have achieved at least part of my objective.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I am wondering whether the Minister could not meet a reasonable feeling that exists; and, if he cannot agree to the 40 days, at least give some period of time in which an interested party can make representations, before the statute affecting him is made permanent.  I leave that to the consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot change the attitude.  I have taken up in this matter.  The Act was held not to have applied here at all and where it was supposed to have applied, the principal section, the one which gave the 40 days, was never observed and they relied on Section 2, which gave authority to make provisional Orders. I understand the practice was to leave them provisional and never confirm them.  Therefore, it may be said that neither here nor in Britain did this Act apply, so we are not really taking anything from any citizen in this Bill. We are making a definite arrangement that, in the future, these things will be printed.  Regarding the notice, that could not be done in modern times, where things are so urgent.  We could not possibly give time like that.  Fifty years ago, things were different.</P>

      <P>I think it is fitting that something should be said before the Bill passes from our hands.  In all modesty, we should congratulate the House on having achieved so much after such persistent effort.  We should also express our appreciation of the manner in which the Minister has met the points of view put to him.  He came here patting himself on the back that this Bill went through the other House almost without a word of criticism, until the last stage when there was a vote taken on whether it should pass or not.  With all due respect, the other Chamber did nothing to amend the Bill.  The Minister came in here with that knowledge and I am sure he felt pretty wroth when he discovered there were criticism and hostility here to the Bill in the form in which it was presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own attitude was that the measure would determine, perhaps for very many years, the manner in which the public are to be made acquainted with the regulations and Orders made by Government Departments and other authorities under the legislation of the Oireachtas.  I felt that it was not some mere transient legislation we were dealing with and that it was our duty, without embarrassing the Government Departments or the other authorities concerned, to insist that there be no short cuts and that steps be taken to ensure that where regulations and Orders were made the public would be made aware <Col N="1525" /> of them and have an opportunity of consulting them.  That has been done, and done in a very satisfactory manner. If I were doing it, probably I would do it in a different way, but I am quite prepared to say that it has been done in a very satisfactory manner. When some future Government makes up its mind to abolish the Seanad, I feel sure that they will be bound, in strict justice, to inscribe on our tombstone some reference to the fact that we did make due provision, in the Statutory Instruments Act, for the protection of the public against autocratic and bureaucratic Departments.</P>

      <P>I, too, should like to endorse what Senator Sweetman has said.  The bulk of our practical legislation nowadays appears to be by way of Order and it appears to be a growing tendency.  It is most important, therefore, that the House should be in a position to know as soon as possible when Orders are made and to be able to examine them.  I appreciate the Minister's attitude in this matter. I believe the Bill as amended will result in the House itself taking a closer interest in the proceedings and in watching the trend of legislation.  It provides a piece of machinery which was utterly lacking.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enact as permanent legislation a number of the Emergency Powers Orders which were made in connection with merchant shipping during the war.  I think that the House is aware that the general position concerning merchant shipping legislation here is unsatisfactory.  The Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which is the main Act, was framed by the British Parliament as an Imperial Statute intended to cater for the merchant Shipping position in all parts of the British Empire of that year.  It does not fit in with our position at the present time or with the concept of an independent Irish shipping service. There are, however, a very large number of problems to be solved before we can produce a comprehensive shipping Act.  The actual drafting of a comprehensive shipping Bill has been in progress for some time, but it is by no means completed.  There are a number of matters, however, which cannot be conveniently left until the comprehensive Bill can be produced and this Bill is designed to give effect to them.  The first matter for which the Bill makes provision is the hoisting of the Irish flag on Irish ships.  Until 1939, the law here required that Irish ships should hoist the British Red Ensign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a Bill prepared in 1939 to remedy that situation, but with the outbreak of war it was necessary to act quickly and an Emergency Powers <Col N="1527" /> Order was made which is now being established as the permanent law. The Order made in 1939 and the proposals in this Bill require every ship other than a fishing boat to hoist the Irish Tricolour when entering or leaving any port outside the State, and in the case of vessels of 50 tons gross or upwards on entering or leaving any home ports.  The hoisting of any other national colours on an Irish ship is prohibited.  In other countries there is a practice of permitting the use of a distinctive club flag instead of the merchant flag by yacht clubs, and powers are being taken here to authorise the use by members of such clubs of a variation of the national flag.</P>
    <P>During the emergency it was necessary to take power to enable a foreign ship taken on charter by an approved Irish charterer to be registered as an Irish ship.  It is proposed to continue that power so that a ship taken on charter may be registered temporarily as an Irish ship and be entitled to the protection of the Irish flag.  There is, however, in Section 8 of the Bill power conferred on the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at his discretion, to refuse registration to any ship or any class of ships.  It is not anticipated that this power will have to be used frequently, but occasion may arise when it may be advisable to refuse registration &mdash; for example, if the owner of a vessel was seeking registration as a means of evading less favourable conditions elsewhere, or if there were grounds for thinking that he might use the Irish flag as a cover for illegal or undesirable activities.</P>
    <P>In 1939 it also became necessary to control the transfer of registry and the sale or mortgage of Irish ships.  In practice, licences for transfer were refused only where it was proposed to sell or mortgage a vessel to a person outside the State.  Even yet licences are not being granted in such cases except where the vessel is a small pleasure craft, or an obselete ship which the owners are proposing to replace with a modern vessel.  There are still restrictions of a similar kind <Col N="1528" /> in force in all other countries.  Irish owners of vessels which are registered at ports elsewhere are still unable to effect the transfer of registry to this country.  When the tonnage position improves these restrictions can be materially eased.  On that account, Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill are framed so as to allow these matters to be dealt with by regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which regulations can be varied from time to time in accordance with changes in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Foreign going ships are required to carry masters and navigating and engineer officers with appropriate certificates of competency.  Up to the present such certificates have not been issued in this country.  It has been decided to set up an independent system of examination, and to issue Irish certificates of competency as soon as circumstances permit.  It is obvious that, for many years to come, officers on Irish ships will be men who have obtained their certificates as a result of examinations conducted by other States.  Section 7 of the Bill provides that the Government may recognise for service on Irish ships certificates of competency issued by other Governments where the Minister for Industry and Commerce is satisfied that they represent adequate qualifications.  In due course, when the Irish certificates are issued, it is hoped that arrangements will be made with other countries for the recognition of certificates of competency on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>The law requires the masters of foreign-going ships or of home trade ships over a certain tonnage to enter into an agreement with their crews in an approved form.  It became a common practice to include in such agreements a clause permitting the master to dispense with the services of a member of the crew at a home port without notice.  A member of the crew could terminate his service on giving 24 hours' notice.  In a recent High Court case it was held that the clause was void as it purported to deprive the seaman of his right to compensation if dismissed within a month.  The Merchant Shipping Acts provide that <Col N="1529" /> no agreement may operate to deprive the seaman of his right to recover the wages to which he would be entitled in the absence of agreement.  I am informed that both shipowners and seamen favour a clause in agreements permitting 24 hours' notice on either side. On the master's side, this is provided for in Section 5 of the Bill.  It is not necessary to have a similar provision in respect of seamen as such agreement would not be inconsistent with the present provision.</P>
    <P>There is another provision dealing with conditions of employment.  It is well known that, from time to time, despite the efforts of the representatives of shipowners and the officials of seamen's unions, the sailing of a ship is often delayed by the failure of one or two members of the crew to join before the time fixed for sailing.  With the shortage of shipping such delays should be avoided, apart altogether from the additional expense to which the shipowner is put by it.  The penalty under the present law is forfeiture of a sum not exceeding two days' pay from a seaman's wages, but in practice it is found that a seaman who fails to join his ship may have no wages due to him and, consequently, escapes the penalty altogether.  It is proposed to amend the law in that regard and substitute for the forfeiture of wages a fine not exceeding £10.</P>
    <P>The present law required safety precautions to be taken in the case of the larger type of passenger vessel.  Small boats plying for hire between the mainland and islands off the coast, in coastal waters and in rivers and lakes, have been exempt from control except in a few cases where by-laws were made by the local authorities who, however, had no staff to enforce them.  It is proposed in Section 11 of the Bill that small craft carrying passengers for reward should be obliged to comply with minimum safety regulations.</P>
    <P>Senators will remember that this country was represented at a special Maritime Session of the International Labour Office which was held last year in Seattle.  The report of the Government members of the delegation to the conference, and the text of the instruments which were adopted at the <Col N="1530" /> conference, were presented to the Oireachtas in June last.  The main purpose of the conference was to secure agreement on certain standards in respect to conditions for seamen.  I may say that the prevailing conditions for seamen on Irish ships are, in most respects, better than the agreed minimum standards laid down at that international conference.  Consultations between the representatives of shipowners and of the seamen's unions and the Department of Industry and Commerce are still in progress in regard to the standards agreed upon, and I hope that this will be one of the first countries to ratify most of the conventions that were adopted at the Seattle conference.  Power is given in the Bill to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, under Section 12, to make regulations for promoting the welfare of seamen on Irish ships or at Irish ports.  This provision will enable effect to be given to the conventions adopted at the conference.  These conventions are listed in the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill deals with bills of lading.  Bills of lading are documents given by shipowners or ship charterers to consignors acknowledging the receipt of goods, and setting out the terms upon which they are to be shipped and delivered.  An International Maritime Conference was held in Brussels in 1922 which agreed upon certain standard rules for inclusion in bills of lading with a view to the enactment of uniform legislation by all maritime countries.  Legislation to that effect has been passed in a number of countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Canada and Australia. Now that an Irish mercantile marine service is developing, it is desirable that this country should fall into line, and provision is made in the Bill for the adoption of uniform rules with regard to bills of lading which are set out in the Second Schedule of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The rules define the responsibilities and liabilities, the rights and immunities of sea carriers, and will, if the Bill becomes law, become part of all contracts for the carriage of goods by sea evidenced by bills of lading in this country.  Bills of lading are not ordinarily <Col N="1531" /> used in the coastal trade which is, accordingly, excluded from the scope of these provisions.  Trade with Britain is also excluded, as a reciprocal provision is contained in the British Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924, in regard to trade with this country.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  As will be appreciated, it relates to a variety of matters not necessarily connected one with the other, but all associated with merchant shipping.  It is desirable to have the law settled on the lines set out here pending the day when it will be possible to have the whole merchant shipping code brought up to date in a comprehensive measure.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would be fitting that this House should extend a hearty welcome to the Bill inasmuch as it is the first Bill of this kind which has come before either House of the Oireachtas in a period of 25 years.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish, in permanent legislation, the authority of the Irish flag in foreign ports.  That is a matter which, I think, is of great importance.  On that I think we are entitled to express our appreciation to the Minister for the action he has taken.  That gives rise to another thought.  I am puzzled to know what is meant by an Irish ship. I am raising the matter now rather than on the Committee Stage so that the Minister may be in a position to tell us more about it, if not this afternoon, then on the Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to refer to that.  Section 1 says that the expression &ldquo;Irish ship&rdquo; means</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) a ship which is registered in the State under the Principal Act&rdquo;</P>
      <P>or something else.  When we look at the Principal Act we discover that, so far as a British ship is concerned, there is no doubt in the world as to who may register.  Under Section 1 of the Act of 1894 we find this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A ship shall not be deemed to be a British ship unless owned wholly by the persons in the following description.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> It is well to emphasise this point, that, so far as the registration of a ship in Britain is concerned, it can be effected only by British subjects or other persons who are defined in the first section of the 1894 Act.  When we read that in relation to our Bill, we must regard the references in the British section to the United Kingdom and Great Britain as references to Ireland.  If that is so, a ship shall not be deemed to be an Irish ship, unless owned wholly by persons of the following description, that is to say, a natural-born Irish citizen or persons naturalised in pursuance of our laws, persons made denizens by letters of denization and bodies corporate established under and subject to the laws of Ireland, and so on.  If that is the position, if it is clear that only an Irish citizen or a body of Irish citizens can register a ship at an Irish port, the position is perfectly clear and satisfactory, but I doubt if that is the fact.</P>
    <P>In 1922, a large number of ships were registered here under the British Act of 1894, the owners of which were not resident in this country, were not domiciled in this country, were not citizens of this State.  A number of these ships transferred their registration in 1922.  Some remained, and I think that some of these are still on our register, although, if the reading of the Act of 1894 is to be subject to the interpretation I have given &mdash; substituting the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain&rdquo; and &ldquo;United Kingdom&rdquo;&mdash; I doubt whether that registration can be validly effected at all.  I have been looking at the names of certain ships which were lost during the war period.  In 1940, seven or eight ships were sunk and a number of lives lost.  In other years, also, other ships were lost.  Take the case of one ship lost after being bombed on the 2nd January, 1942, the <i>City of Bremen.</i> That ship, so far as I know, was registered in an Irish port, but I wonder whether it was owned by Irish nationals.  I raised the point because I want to have the matter cleared up. I do not know, as I say, whether in fact the ship was owned by Irish nationals, but I put this point, that Irish ownership and Irish registration <Col N="1533" /> means nothing whatever, unless it means that a ship is owned by our people.</P>
    <P>For those who have not made a study of this subject, perhaps I should point out that in every case the shares in a ship number 64.  There can be 64 owners, but not more than 64, unless one or more shares are held jointly. It may be that a body corporate will own all 64 shares, but in any event under the 1894 Act the shares are divided into 64 parts, and these, so far as Great Britain is concerned, must be held, all of them, by British corporations. If a British corporation like the B. &amp; I. can take a ship here for registration, it means that it is claiming the protection of our flag and asking us to defend the interests of that ship in foreign ports, although we have no control whatever over the proprietors of the 64 shares.</P>
    <P>It is known to most members of the House that registration in the case of a ship is somewhat different from registration in the case of land or other property.  The registration in every case is a local registration.  It means the entry of particulars of the ship in a particular port &mdash; it may be Dublin and it may be Kinsale, Galway or Tralee &mdash; and the registrar is the chief officer of customs and excise at that port.  No matter where the ownership of the ship is effected, the deeds and documents must go back to that local port. There is no record in the world, no effective record, of the ownership of the shares in that ship except at the local port which may as well be Galway or Kinsale as Dublin.  If, therefore, a body of Irishmen buy a ship and register their 64 shares in Kinsale, Kinsale becomes the home port of that ship and she is required, under the Merchant Shipping Act, to carry the word &ldquo;Kinsale&rdquo; in conspicuous letters. Should that ship be sold in China, the sale is not effective until it is registered in Kinsale.  But what control do we exercise over the sale of these ships? Does the chief customs officer at Kinsale refuse to register the transfer of shares if the purchaser is not an Irish citizen?  If he were a customs officer in Liverpool, there is no doubt that he would refuse to effect the registration <Col N="1534" /> of the transfer, unless the purchaser was a British subject or a British-owned corporation.</P>
    <P>What makes me very apprehensive about this Bill are the provisions of Sections 8, 9 and 10.  Section 8 provides that the Minister may direct that a specified ship shall not be registered at a port, save with the approval of the Minister.  Section 9 says that the Minister may provide by regulations that the registry in the State under the Principal Act of a specified ship or any ship shall not be closed or transferred to a port outside the State, save with the approval of the Minister.  That is the proposal in the Bill, a proposal empowering the Minister to authorise the transfer to a port outside the city of the share-owning in a ship.  If it is an Irish ship, to what outside port is it contemplated that the transfer will be made?  The transfer can be made to a British port only on the British assumption that we are British subjects.  A Frenchman cannot register a ship in a British port nor can a German or an American register his shares in a British port, so that if the British accept the transfer of the ownership of shares under this Bill, it is on the assumption that in British law we are British subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to me to be undertaking a responsibility which does not belong to him when he is proposing to give permission under Section 9 to transfer the ownership in shares to a port in a foreign State.  I think he is copying here the provisions of Section 53 of the British Act of 1894, but these provisions provide for the transfer of registry from one port to another in the British Empire and not for the transfer of ownership from a British to a foreign port.  I consider that the Bill requires examination, mainly in relation to the obligations which, under its provisions, will attach to our flag in foreign ports.</P>
    <P>I commenced by saying that I was glad to see this Bill introduced and I am very satisfied, as I am sure the House will be satisfied, with the intentions of the Minister in relation to it; but I am suggesting that the Minister has overlooked certain matters and is <Col N="1535" /> undertaking something which was not contemplated when the Bill was being drafted, that, in other words, the Minister is misdirecting himself in submitting the Bill to us in this form.  If the Minister assures me that that is not so, that something has happened of which I am not aware in relation to the transfer of shares in ships and that the British Act has been modified in some other respects of which I have no knowledge, I shall be very pleased, and shall withdraw the suggestions I have made; but, in the absence of that assurance, I can only interpret the legislation I am aware of to the House as I understand it.</P>
    <P>The second important provision of this Bill relates to the implementation of certain international conventions. That again is a provision which I welcome very cordially and it is especially satisfactory that the Minister should have the power, as he will have under the Bill, to ratify these conventions, because the ratification of an international convention is of considerable importance from the point of view of the persons affected.  It has this importance that, once a convention is ratified, it cannot be altered or denounced for a period of approximately 12 years.  In other words, once a convention is ratified by this State, it is binding for a period of ten years and, at the end of that period, the State can give notice of its intention to denounce it, when there is still a year to go, so that there is a guarantee that any convention ratified under this Bill is valid for a minimum period of 12 years.  That is very satisfactory from the point of view of seamen particularly and also from the point of view of shipowners who will be aware that the provisions of these conventions are to apply in relation to life at sea.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another point I want to raise on that.  A number of conventions other than those made at Seattle have been made from time to time in relation to seamen and shipping.</P>
    <P>I have not looked up the various Orders made under our legislation in relation to these other conventions and, <Col N="1536" /> therefore, I am speaking in the dark.  I did not have time, with the spate of legislation that we have had recently, to follow up the matter, but I draw attention to this fact, that we did have, so far as I remember, a convention some years ago relating to Seamen's Articles of Agreement.  That may or may not have been ratified.  There was also, if I remember correctly, a convention on the Protection of Immigrants at Sea.  I think it was 1926.  As a matter of fact, I have a distinct recollection of that convention because I was present when it was made.  I do not remember if that was ratified.  If not, I would ask the Minister why it has not been ratified and why the conventions other than those mentioned in the Schedule have not been ratified, or whether there is a difficulty in relation to ratification.  If they have been ratified, that disposes of the matter.</P>
    <P>I am not clear, however, as to the manner in which the Seattle Conventions are being disposed of in this Bill. It would appear to me that, to give the conventions validity, it would be necessary to reproduce the conventions as a schedule to the Bill.  Several conventions are referred to here by a title which, so far as I know, has no particular validity at all.  These conventions are not made in the same way as Acts of Parliament are made in this country or in the same way as regulations are made, which have numbers and which have certain records that enable one to identify them.  These conventions are not intended to be coded in that manner.  They are draft agreements made between the delegates of various States, which are taken home and are laid before Parliament by the Governments concerned and, if approved, are ratified.  But they are ratified for the purpose of guiding the law of the State.  It would appear to me that if we are going to accept the conventions and say that such and such a convention shall be part of our domestic legislation, the convention itself ought to be written in in its entirety as a schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>However, that is a matter on which I do not profess to have any expert knowledge.  I raise it so that the <Col N="1537" /> Minister may deal with the matter and clarify the position for us before we commit ourselves to this legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no other point to which I would refer at this moment although there are one or two small points that I would like to refer to when we come to the Committee Stage.  I wish to repeat what I said at the beginning, that I welcome very heartily the proposal of the Minister to introduce this legislation for the purpose of establishing the authority of the Irish flag in foreign ports and on Irish ships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only asking for information.  Even then, I think I will probably betray my ignorance of shipping law.  I see the Minister takes power to refuse registration.  There do not appear to be any conditions set out under which the Minister shall work.  Could he give the House some general indication of the circumstances in which he would refuse and that would influence his action in the matter?  There seems to be something very funny about shipping law, because I notice that when ships are doing rather dirty business, they are registered in all kinds of obscure American States.  I do not know why that is necessary, but it does seem to be so.  If there has to be illegal traffic or gun-running by ships it should not be done under the Irish flag.  I do not know how that situation is brought about, but we do notice that some of the smaller South American States seem to carry the registration of ships engaged in rather dubious traffic.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister can make regulations regarding the transfer of a ship.  Under what conditions would he, generally, work in such a matter? If I own a ship, or if I am associated with a body that owns ships, presumably I am able to sell to anybody who likes to buy.  Or, is that not so? Is not it like any other article of property that you can sell in the open market to anybody who likes to buy? Perhaps that is a matter which is bound up with the peculiarities of shipping law, but I would like the Minister generally to give the House information on these two points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the main point raised by Senator Duffy, I stated that the merchant shipping legislation in force here is not in a satisfactory state, that it is necessary to get a comprehensive measure prepared and enacted before it will be satisfactory. That comprehensive measure is being prepared.  It is a very difficult task to complete it.</P>
      <P>So far as admission to the Irish register is concerned, there was an agreement made in 1931 that we would admit to the register here only vessels which were owned by Irish citizens or by citizens in Commonwealth countries. That agreement was never ratified in legislation, but it has determined the practice since.  I think it is probable, having regard to our circumstances, that when we come to prepare the comprehensive legislation we will admit to our register ships owned by British citizens or owned by Irish citizens in partnership with British citizens.  That is a matter which can be considered at the time.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to keep in mind, however, that there is a number of ships on the British register owned by Irish citizens and that in any circumstance, rather more intimate relationship is bound to exist between ourselves and Great Britain in matters of this kind than between ourselves and other countries with which we have fewer commercial contacts.  When a ship is on the Irish register it is entitled to the protection of the Irish flag.  We are taking power in this Bill to refuse registration to a ship, even if it is so owned as to be entitled to admission to our register, because of the very circumstance which Senator Sir John Keane referred to &mdash; the desire to have some power to prevent the Irish flag being used as a cover for illegal activities or activities of an undesirable kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corresponding provision contained in Section 9, to which Senator Duffy referred, which gives us power to refuse sanction for the transfer of the registry of a ship from an Irish port to a port outside Ireland, is a temporary arrangement which was brought into force at the beginning of the war and designed to prevent the transfer of ships from the Irish flag to other <Col N="1539" /> flags while the abnormal conditions of war-time prevailed, and it is still being preserved because of the existing shipping shortage.  All countries have enacted similar legislation during the war and have that legislation still in force.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at the present time to get a transfer of registry of a ship from another country to this without the consent of the Government concerned, which consent is not given at present.</P>
    <P>The institution of control over the transfer of ownership of a ship or the mortgaging of a ship, even between our own nationals and between people here and people outside, again, is an emergency measure.  Ordinarily, there is no barrier placed upon the sale of a vessel by one Irish citizen to another.  There are certain difficulties in making distinctions between sales of that kind and sales to persons or corporations outside the country.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that we should give effect to these powers by regulations. These regulations will be subject to variation when circumstances improve. Ordinarily, I expect that very few restrictions will be maintained upon the transfer of ownership of vessels &mdash; even in the case of owners outside the country who might want to effect it in the ordinary course of business &mdash; or on the sale of ships, or the replacement of ships for the better operation of business. At the present time the main purpose of Section 10 is to prevent the sale of vessels to foreign owners or the mortgaging of vessels to foreign owners.  That power is rigorously exercised at the present time, except in the circumstances that I mentioned, where they have no commercial use, such as pleasure boats which were used here, but which have since fallen out of use, or where an owner decides that he wants to dispose of an absolete ship which is to be replaced by a more modern one.  It is only in these circumstances that permission to sell outside the country is at present allowed. These restrictions will be modified and there will come a time when they will be only nominal.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Duffy does not <Col N="1540" /> understand the position concerning International Labour Office Conventions. Section 12 does not confine the power of the Minister to the making of regulations to enforce the Seattle conventions, but is designed to give effect to other conventions, International Labour Office conventions also. Effect can be given to them by use of the Minister's powers under Section 12. International Labour Office Conventions are international agreements to which a State agrees to adhere.  It is bound by contract with the International Labour Office not to ratify any convention until its law has been brought into conformity with it.</P>
    <P>The procedure for the making of regulations in Section 12 will establish law and practice here in conformity with the International Labour Office Conventions or establish standards higher than those prescribed in the conventions.  When that is done the conventions will be ratified and, in accordance with normal procedure, our delegations to the annual conference of the Industrial Labour Office will be required to show that our law is in conformity with the conventions and has been kept in conformity with them.</P>
    <P>I think we need not anticipate any difficulty as far as these conventions are concerned because, apart from the Minister's power under Section 12, the prevailing practice in Irish ships has generally represented a higher standard than the minimum standard prescribed by the conventions.</P>

It did not make any difference where they had been employed as there was an obligation on the owner to bring the ship back to an Irish port.</P>

We permitted the transfer of registration of these ships to the country in which they were owned, so that there would be no conflict in our practice of the principles of international law to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue for another period the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, which was passed last year.  It will be remembered that last year the emergency powers Act under which the Government worked during the war years ceased to have effect, and was replaced by the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, which continued the power of the Government to maintain certain controls that were still necessary, such as price control, rationing regulations and so forth.  When we continued these limited powers under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act it was hoped that another year would see the end of the arrangement and that these powers would no longer be required.  We have not got out of the emergency.  In some respects the difficulties that existed this time 12 months have been accentuated.  It is quite clear that the powers the Government possess to maintain these restrictions on trade and prices must be continued for a further period. This amending Bill proposes to do so for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the general policy of the Government, and the undertaking given to the Oireachtas when the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act was passed, a number of Bills has been produced during the year to transfer into permanent legislation the provisions of Orders which it was desired to have continued on a permanent basis.  On the other hand, a number of Orders which gave powers that are no longer essential in present circumstances have been repealed.  The general desire of the Government is to keep on a temporary basis only such minimum powers as are required to cope with <Col N="1543" /> the circumstances that exist, and to dispense entirely with other powers, or have them framed in permanent measures enacted by the Oireachtas. A number of Bills which are now proceeding through the Oireachtas, such as the Bill the House has recently been discussing, have for their primary purpose the establishment as permanent law of powers taken under temporary Orders.  I am sure the House will have little difficulty in agreeing that we cannot well dispense with rationing, price control and other restrictions necessitated by scarcity, and that the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act must be continued for another period.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete pheasants from the category of poultry.  In ordinary daily life, I have never heard a pheasant classed as poultry and I cannot see any purpose in it.  I do not know of any pheasant hatcheries, but there might be some rich man who preserves game and wants to hatch some pheasants' eggs artificially.  It seems to me ridiculous that he should have to get authority from the Minister to do that.  The Minister may have some other explanation and, if so, the House would like to hear it.</P>

      <P>My information is that pheasants' eggs are hatched very often in poultry <Col N="1544" /> hatcheries and that a disease, which is known to be a very fatal disease in poultry, can be carried by pheasants. That is why they are included in this definition.</P>

      <P>The disease B.W.D., or Bacillary White Diarrhoea, is caused by the same organisms in pheasants, ducks, geese or any other poultry.  We want to get rid of the disease and there is no use in getting rid of it in one bird if another can propagate it.  I do not suppose we will reach a stage quickly where we will have mass artificial hatcheries of pheasants, but we must have control, since the disease can be transferred through a pheasant's egg or any egg. We are taking control in the case of guinea fowl.  We have not very many guinea fowl at present, but we are trying to control a disease that is common to several types of poultry and it is only reasonable that you include every bird possible.  For that matter, we may find that partridges&mdash;I could not answer that &mdash; and some other birds' eggs may be carriers.  In the interests <Col N="1545" /> of the community and the nation, we want to control the disease as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I am still unconvinced, but there are other amendments which are more important.  Speaking entirely without any statistical information, I should think that far more poultry are hatched by the ordinary method of the hen than by the artificial method.  This disease is going to go on in the case of the ordinary fashion, the hen sitting on the egg; and in order to control the artificial form of egg-hatching all this regulation is far too high-geared and far too complete and does not allow sufficient intelligent exceptions.</P>

      <P>I would like to go back on this matter again.  While the Minister for Finance merely comes into the matter inasmuch as he collects the fees or receives the fees, I cannot see how he can have any other function.  It is a matter entirely for the Minister for Agriculture and presumably he is the <Col N="1546" /> person who is going to fix the fees.  I do not know on what basis he is going to fix them.  Is it to be on the basis of inspection by his officials?  He has told me that he cannot give me any indication because another Minister comes into the matter.  Presumably this is his Bill.  There is no provision here to make grants to owners of hatcheries and the Minister for Agriculture should, I expect, have some idea what the cost was going to be.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to make a few remarks on the section.  I feel that I have a certain limited responsibility for this Bill as a whole because I happened to be a member of the committee which recommended it.  I should, therefore, perhaps have paid greater attention to it when it was in its Second Stage, but unfortunately, I was laid up with a cold and prevented from paying much attention to anything at all.  The Minister, in this Bill, is proposing to give effect to one of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy and I think we should have great sympathy for him in his attempt to carry it out.  Speaking now as a member of that committee, if I may be permitted to use the language of the metaphor, we asked the Minister for a cat and he presented us with a fully grown tiger complete with teeth and claws.  I think the Minister in giving effect to the recommendation is doing what perhaps is known as killing a fly with a steel hammer.  It was necessary and it is still necessary to license commercial hatcheries which are distributing day-old chicks broadcast throughout the country and who are enabled through operating largescale <Col N="1547" /> hatcheries to distribute disease also on a very large scale.  The committee of which I was a member recommended that this should be done. May I quote from the second interim report of the committee on poultry production:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is most desirable that eggs used for hatching purpose, should be derived from flocks which are suitable for breeding purposes and free from disease, whether these are run in conjunction with the hatchery or owned by other poultry keepers.  We accordingly recommend that distributors of hatching eggs and day-old chicks should be licensed, the conditions for the issue of licences to be determined by the Minister for Agriculture.  The holder of a hatchery licence should be prohibited from incubating eggs other than those derived from flocks certified to be blood tested and free from disease.  This requirement would necessitate the constant supervision of flocks by poultry instructors and the number of instructors would undoubtedly have to be augmented as the scheme developed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now Section 8 of the Bill is the crux of the matter.  It is the Minister's method of giving effect to the recommendations. It is the operative clause and it provides that no person shall operate a poultry hatchery save under and in accordance with the poultry hatchery licence.  There are various conditions and qualifications.  As I said, it is necessary to give effect to the recommendations by legislation to prescribe certain regulations under which commercial hatcheries should be carried on and naturally, in the course of this legislation, to prescribe that any person who conformed with these regulations should receive a commercial hatchery as a matter of right.  If, in the course of the business it was found that any of these requirements were not carried out&mdash;the person should first of all be advised by the Minister's experts and officials&mdash;and if he persisted, he should be hauled before a court and punished by being, I suppose, deprived of his licence. If the Minister had done this he would <Col N="1548" /> have given effect in substance to the recommendation of the committee but actually the language of Section 8 seems to regard the keeping of any kind of incubator or poultry hatchery almost as a crime like having a private still or a naughty book in one's possession. It states that no person shall operate a poultry hatchery save under and in accordance with a poultry hatchery licence.  The Minister may, by regulations, declare poultry hatcheries of a class defined in the regulations to be exempted but every person who keeps an incubator even for the purpose of producing chickens for himself as distinct from for sale is maintaining a poultry hatchery within the meaning of this Bill.  Consequently, it may happen that if the Minister brought this Act into operation and in the stress of an election, say, forgot to implement the sub-section (2) of Section 8, thousands of people throughout the country might find themselves breaking the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very careful at an election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister really expressed his intention of implementing sub-section (2) at some time it could be regarded as a statutory instrument. In this connection, it would be possible for the Minister to drive a coach and four through the whole Act by making such widespread exemptions that every hatchery would be exempt from the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that seems to me to be an extreme example of what is known in English history as the exercise of the suspending and dispensing power.  I would remind the Minister that, on a famous occasion, James II claimed to exercise that power, and that, in consequence of that claim, he went on his travels and lost his job.  I would ask the Minister, is he not afraid of something similar happening to himself? I think it ought to be possible, on the Report Stage, to draft an amendment which will give effect to the licensing provision in the more restricted manner which I recommend, and to deprive the Minister of that wide degree of autocratic power which he is claiming for <Col N="1549" /> himself under the terms of this and other sections.</P>
    <P>This whole matter of developing large-scale poultry production is one that requires co-operation between the Minister's Department and the people generally.  Behind such co-operation there must, of necessity, be the mailed first of some of the principles of enacted legislation.  I think there should also be the velvet glove of the tactful handling of the people concerned.  I think, in general, though we must legislate piecemeal in these matters, that the emphasis should be on education and co-operation rather than on coercive restrictions and bureaucratic regulations.  In fact, the committee to which I have referred laid very considerable emphasis on the importance of friendly co-operation.  That co-operation exists, and I hope will long continue, between the Minister's expert officials, the county committees of agriculture and the people who are engaged in poultry production and in other forms of agricultural activity.  I would dislike any form of legislation which, even in its very wording, seemed to suggest a different or unsympathetic attitude as between the Minister's Department and the people on whose exertions so much depends.</P>
    <P>The principal disease which this measure is designed to avoid being spread by large-scale commercial hatcheries, which in other respects are highly desirable, seems to be the one known by the initials B.W.D.  The essence of the control of that disease is the regular blood testing of breeding hens and of male birds, I suppose. Now, having blood tests is a very technical operation which requires the existence of a laboratory somewhere or another.  I understand that the veterinary college in Dublin is the only place where the necessary laboratory tests can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, Senator, that you are going away from the matter immediately before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think not.  It might happen that commercial hatcheries might increase in number so rapidly that they would find it impossible <Col N="1550" /> to get all these blood tests done by reason of the absence of adequate facilities up and down the country for doing blood tests.  After all, the veterinary college is only in one place, and if this thing is to be implemented properly you might require certain centres up and down the country where blood tests could be examined in a laboratory.  Under this section you might have a situation in which, owing to failure on the part of the Minister's Department to provide adequate blood testing facilities, people were unable to keep the law which the Minister had made.  The Minister, by his failure to provide adequate laboratory facilities, might, in fact, make it impossible for people with the best will in the world to carry out the terms of this section. Therefore, I think it would be well to proceed a little more gently in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to understand that the Minister, in taking power to exempt certain hatcheries, means to exempt what we call the hatcheries at present under the committees of agriculture? The regulations governing the administration of this scheme at the moment are satisfactory as far as my experience goes.  I do not know whether it is necessary to bring these hatcheries within the terms of this Bill at all.  I feel that it is not.  I realise that there is the other problem but I certainly think that any further difficulties that may be created for the station holders who have been carrying on this work, no doubt in a small way over a very long period, are going to have a depressing effect on the production of poultry.  These difficulties have been very great for some years now, and that is especially true of the present time.  If sub-section (2) is meant to give power to exempt these people it is satisfactory.  I believe that should be done and I hope that is the purpose of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Johnston made a point with regard to the facilities available for the blood testing of stock and for laboratory work where you have suspected cases of disease.  At present, these are not sufficient to meet the demands of poultry producers.  I have personal knowledge of the difficulties <Col N="1551" /> which instructresses up and down the country have been up against in trying to get this work done satisfactorily in the limited time in which it requires to be done.  I do not know what additional facilities will be available for the development of this scheme.  I would urge that it is unnecessary to bring people within this scheme who have been doing this work satisfactorily already.  The less interference there is with them by the imposition of additional inspectors the better it will be for the poultry industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke about the old hen and asked what was the good of all this legislation when eggs could be hatched by the old method of the hen. He referred to eggs being hatched in the old fashion, and said that the practice generally adopted throughout the country for the production of chicks was the brooding hen.  If the Senator were in Holland he would know that no hens are allowed for the hatching of eggs.  Therefore, I suggest to him that we are not bound to that totalitarian system that he is so anxious to prove is already in operation here.</P>
      <P>With regard to the producing of disease-free stocks, I must say that Senator Johnston disappointed me immensely because, even if he were sick last week, he might have read the Second Reading debate on this Bill.  If he had done so he would have found that he was simply repeating questions which had been raised by myself on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>At this stage, might I be allowed to ask why&mdash;I understand that the main purpose of the Bill is to prevent the spread of this devastating disease&mdash;it was necessary to approach it in this manner, through the medium of licensing?  Why is it not possible to deal directly with the disease, to make it a notifiable disease or to prescribe that every owner must have his poultry tested, and so on?  That method, if the prevention of the spread of the disease is the only purpose, would be far better and more human and humane than all the elaboration in the Bill.  I have put down many amendments to the Bill in an effort to mitigate some of its totally unnecessary procedure, but I should like the Minister to say whether he considered that approach, <Col N="1553" /> of dealing directly with the disease and making it an obligation on owners to have their poultry tested.  Would that not have achieved the purpose in view, just as well as all this super-regulation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long time since I read the report to which Senator Johnston referred and I do not remember what exactly the recommendation was.  The section seems to me to be quite reasonable.  We make it illegal for any person to run a hatchery and then give the Minister power to exempt.  I have not considered at this stage to what extent this power of exemption will be resorted to, but it appears to me to be the businesslike way of approaching the problem. I must confess that I cannot see what objection Senator Johnston could have to it.  He reminded me of the cat that would like fish but disliked wetting its paws to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

All those who have hatcheries are not entitled under sub-section (1) to have a hatchery without a licence and under sub-section (2) I have power to exempt.  I have not seen what the Department intends to recommend to me in that connection and I therefore cannot give the Senator the information he requires.</P>

      <P>I am not quarrelling with the Minister taking the power, or with what is in the section, because he is taking power and then taking further power to exempt, but I say that if there is a policy on poultry production, it ought to be clear to the Minister, when asking for this Bill, how he intends to use the powers, and I submit that the House is entitled to have from the Minister what his policy is in that regard, because it is not right to ask the House for powers without some clear indication as to how these powers are to be used in relation to people at present engaged in poultry production.</P>

      <P>I think it will save repetition if I state the general attitude to this measure.  This measure could take the form of about two sections, for all the protection it gives the poultry owner. It could simply have given power to the Minister to regulate artificial incubation and egg supply to people who carry on artificial incubation, because in this Bill there is no specific holding of the scales as between authority and the parties affected.  I notice that the attitude of the Minister always is: &ldquo;You can trust me; I would not do such a stupid thing.&rdquo;  He said that to Senator Johnston.  He does not realise that the poultry owner can say the same thing when you come along with a lot of irritating regulations: &ldquo;You can trust me to know what is in my own interest and not to do silly things which will affect the reputation of my product.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> In the Bill, small as it is, is involved the whole principle of Government control. I hope to show the House that in this Bill we have moved, not only one step, but many steps down the path towards&mdash;I am told not to use a certain word but I have another word&mdash; global authority and global powers.  I remember a certain local councillor in my young days, being very annoyed at something that was done, said: &ldquo;I will resign and, not only will I resign but I will resign <i>in globo.</i>&rdquo; Perhaps Senator O'Donovan and I can find accommodation on the phrase <i>&ldquo;in globo&rdquo;</i> because it suits my purpose just as well as the other word to which he objects.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of Parliament to hold the balance between the right of the free man to carry on his business as he wishes, and authority.  It is its duty to preserve his power to show enterprise, to strike out on new avenues without having undue control placed upon him.  That is where I join issue with the Minister.  The Minister is the third Minister for Agriculture that I have had to deal with in my public life and my first impression is that he does not seem to appreciate the need for any regard for the rights of the free man, the rights of the farmer, his right to carry on his business unfettered.  He says: &ldquo;You can trust me; I am not going to do anything against your interests.  I am a sensible man with a whole array of experts at my back.  I know what is best for you.&rdquo;  I think the history of regulations will come up in another form on a motion by Senator Counihan later on and he will probably show that regulations are not doing all they are intended to do, at any rate, to satisfy the farmers.</P>
    <P>Here is an example: The Minister takes power in Section 9 sub-section (2), in granting a hatchery licence, from time to time to attach to a poultry hatchery such conditions as he thinks proper, and may revoke or amend any condition.  The phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; may be important.  It may be when he finds time.  It may be as he sees fit or whenever he feels so disposed. May I refer, as it has a bearing on it, to the phrase used in sub-section <Col N="1556" /> (1) because these phrases show the spirit behind the regulation and reveal that we have gone far down the path to global authority.  I have been searching among regulations.  I have not made a complete search.  I have found nowhere the phrase that is used in sub-section (1) of this section&mdash;&ldquo;in his absolute discretion&rdquo;.  These phrases signify the jack-boot mentality: &ldquo;I am jolly well going to do it.&rdquo;  I do not say the words may not be used but they do imply the spirit that is behind the regulations.  In what way would it weaken the substance of the section if it read, &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;?  The spirit behind this is, &ldquo;I shall jolly well do so and I can jolly well do what I like.&rdquo;  The sub-section says: &ldquo;The Minister may from time to time attach to a poultry hatchery licence such conditions as he thinks proper&rdquo;&mdash;that means to say, as I read it, the poultry hatchery owner is entirely at the mercy of the Minister, not only with regard to regulations to ensure, say, the prevention of the spread of disease, but in any respect.  If the owner of a hatchery says: &ldquo;I want to specialise in a new breed of poultry; I want to go in for a breed that has not hitherto been very popular in this country but which I think has great promise; I want to have Rhode Island Reds, which are not popular in this district&rdquo;, the Minister can quite likely say: &ldquo;No; the condition of your licence is that you can only have a particular type of poultry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can visualise, under this power, the Minister saying, &ldquo;No, I shall not allow you to send your products to this district or that district.&rdquo;  You must supply the district that I say.  There is an example of what can be done under the loose wording of this section, as I read it.  He can apply conditions to the individual. He can say to A, do this, to B, do that and to C, do the other.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to say that these powers must be prescribed, must be made by Order, so that at least they must be general conditions, so that everybody knows where he is and so that, within those general terms, the owner of the hatchery is free.  That is my purpose.  This is an advance, it seems to me, in the encroachment of global regulations and <Col N="1557" /> we have to watch it very carefully.  This is a step forward that we have to watch.  The whole object of the amendment is to show the new dangers we are facing with this kind of legislation. The section says that licensing conditions may be prescribed and &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; means automatically a form of regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the humour for fighting with the Senator to-night, but I am in the humour to refuse to accept the amendment.  I do so for the simple reason that that is the advice tendered to me and is in accordance with my own judgment.  I could not make general regulations and conditions for the control of this business in the way which the Senator describes. There are matters which undoubtedly can be covered&mdash;and will be covered&mdash; by general regulations, but general regulations could not be of such a comprehensive nature as to give the Minister or his Department the right and the power that they would require in every type of case.  Different conditions and regulations would have to be made in different cases.  While I admit that it is possible to make general regulations, and that such regulations will be made, it would be inadvisable to do so.  I do not propose to accept an amendment that would restrict me in the way that this one undoubtedly would.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a weak argument to use but the power I am seeking is a power that will be found in a previous Bill that I had before this House, giving the Minister exactly the same power in relation more or less to similar questions.  The power will be found in a number of Acts of Parliament. While that may not be a good argument, or mean that that is to continue, I do not believe it is a wrong power.  It may be undesirable but apparently experience has shown that it cannot be done without.  I have not made the case that the Minister will not do wrong.  I always leave it to the other fellow to think that.  I do not believe in repeating that from the Minister's chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I believe that most people feel that a Minister can take a perfectly balanced view of these matters, <Col N="1558" /> and that there is no analogy between the view he would take and the view of an interested party.  An interested party will view a particular matter from his or her point of view, and naturally such judgment will be influenced accordingly, but a Minister should be free, and is free to decide on the evidence before him.  I cannot accept the amendment or the idea behind it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister challenges my statement that this proposal is a step forward, and a very big step towards a more rigid form of legislation, I think he ought to give some argument.  I could bring forward arguments totally different from his. The Minister says that these powers to make any conditions he likes attach to other legislation.  He referred to a Bill which was passed recently which I think was a terrible one, dealing with insemination.  Surely that does not justify the continuance of an undesirable power.  I asked the Minister to give instances, seeing that he has officials and information available to him, where arbitrary powers are attached to licences in the form contemplated here.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) The Minister shall give notice of his intention to refuse a person a licence for a poultry hatchery and if <Col N="1559" /> representations are made to him by such person within seven days he shall consider such representations.</P>
    <P>This is simply intended to apply to the refusal of a licence and the procedure is the same as the Minister deems it fit to apply in the case of revocation of a licence.  Why, when a licence is going to be revoked, should the Minister think it fit to receive representations from a person affected and not do so from a person whose licence is refused? The effect of refusing is every bit as serious as revocation, seeing that a person in business could not carry on without a licence.  A licence is to be refused without reason and in the Minister's &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; without hearing any representations.  The Dairies Act is hardly comparable, as the Minister there is the Minister for Local Government and the licensing authority is the sanitary authority; but there when a sanitary authority refuses to license a dairy there is an appeal to the Minister. In this case, what the Minister grants in the case of a revocation he should also grant in the case of a refusal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Why make an attempt, through an amendment of this nature, to compel a Minister to do something that he must do in the ordinary way? If the applicant is refused a licence and is dissatisfied, I cannot prevent him from making such representations to me or to the Department, even if I as Minister desired to do so, nor can I prevent him from availing of the many other sources through which the matter might be brought to my notice.  There is no alternative left to me as Minister but to reply to such representations&mdash; without such an amendment as this&mdash; whether they are made directly by the interested party or by somebody else.</P>
      <P>I am asked here to consider this.  I cannot reply to representations unless I have read them and considered them. An amendment of this kind seems entirely unnecessary.  Even if it were sought by a Minister or his Department to deny to an individual the right, which I contend the individual enjoys already and which is being sought here, I would be unable to deny that right.</P>

Surely, if he gives them in one case he should give them in the other.  This seems illogical.  In the very next section, where he takes power to revoke a licence, he is giving all this power of approach and representation which I am asking for now and he says it is not necessary.  Why should it be necessary later on?  He seems to be stultifying his own argument.</P>

      <P>The hatchery is there already.  The Minister may, on reports, say it is not properly conducted. This point comes on the passing of this measure.  It is not a question of giving power to start a new hatchery.  There is a hatchery there to-day and it has to be licensed in the near future, when the Bill comes into operation.  The Minister's advisers may say it is not a desirable hatchery and the Minister may refuse a licence.  I say that that party whose licence is refused should have the same right to make representations <Col N="1561" /> to the Minister as a party who, in a year's time, finds that his licence is revoked because something has gone wrong.</P>

      <P>I happen to know a little about this and can see why a licence should be revoked.  In my county, there are 14 or 16 certified egg-producing farms of the right type, connected with one hatchery, Kilrush Creamery. Supposing another hatchery is established there and does not get a full supply of the duly certified eggs produced on a certified farm and they start going round about the country and buying all sorts of eggs and hatching them in their hatchery, doing away with the pure breed; in that case it would be right for the Minister or local authority to have power to revoke the licence or refuse to give a licence.  They may already have a licence, having got it on the understanding that they could procure a sufficient supply of certified eggs, but afterwards found they could not and they started to buy every sort of egg.  If that were done around the country, the scheme would go to pieces; so there should be power to revoke a licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Minister's argument.  It seems to me that Senator Keane's analogy is sounder than the Minister's.  Surely people at present working poultry hatcheries will have to get a licence under this Bill.  Therefore, if a man has a business at present and must get a licence, it is reasonable to say that when he has capital invested in it and applies to the Minister, who decides in all the circumstances he will not give him a licence, there should be some way of making representations. <Col N="1562" /> The analogy seems to be exact between the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 and the £1,000 business is something that simply came into the Minister's mind.  It may be that the Minister must always consider representations, but if he does so as a matter of fact that is just as applicable to Section 10 as to Section 9.</P>

That licence, for one cause or another sufficient in the opinion of the Minister, is being revoked.  In that case, notice of intention to revoke is given.  There is no analogy between that case and that of a man or woman who says: &ldquo;I intend to start a hatchery business&rdquo;, knowing he or she must apply for a licence for it before starting.

      <P>I beg to move the following amendment standing in the name of Senator Sweetman:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> Before Section 10 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>10.&mdash;(1)  The Minister may revoke a poultry hatchery licence.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person aggrieved by the revocation of a poultry hatchery licence may appeal against such revocation in the prescribed manner to the district justice assigned to the district in which such hatchery is situate.</P>
    <P>It asks for the insertion of a new section which embodies the principle that where a man's living has been taken away from him by Departmental action he should have the right of appeal to the courts.  That is a matter of principle and it has been asserted from these benches on a variety of Bills.  The Minister has, of course, the power to withdraw licences for bulls but there is a difference with regard to poultry hatcheries.  It may well be that a poultry hatchery owner has a great lot of capital invested in it; possibly his entire capital, but Section 10 gives the Minister power, in his absolute discretion, to revoke a poultry hatchery licence for a hatchery that a person may be running and that person has not the right to resist it.  Senator Sweetman considers, and I think it is fair to say, that such a position entitles the person concerned to the right of appeal to the District Court where the matter should be argued in public.  Presumably there will be a very small number of such appeals but the principle is there, the principle that a man should not be deprived of his livelihood by a process which takes place behind closed doors and he should have recourse to the courts.  I think that the circumstances of this particular case make the amendment more necessary.</P>

      <P>Why then make it necessary to have the officials of local authorities and the officials of my Department hawked all over the country and into court, running around with files trying to educate the justice as to what was meant by a particular decision of my Department?  Why go through all this elaborate business of giving the individual the right to have the matter determined in the District Court when the Minister is in a position to have the technical information and, in fact, all the information at his disposal?  In what way is the District Court as competent as the Minister to take a balanced view of the rights and wrongs in a matter of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been watching, as I say, decisions given every other day in matters relating to my own Department by district justices all over the country, and I can assure this House and the <Col N="1567" /> country, and I can assure the district justices and all concerned, that I have not at all the sort of confidence in their wisdom and their ability to handle these matters that Senator Sweetman seemed to have when he decided to put down this amendment.  I have seen them approaching matters over the last three or four years and giving decisions upon them&mdash;matters that were of vital importance to our whole community&mdash; and treating them as if they were completely and absolutely trivial affairs.  I have seen them in times when it was a question whether we would be able to feed our people&mdash;I have seen district justices coming along and imposing fines of 2/6 and 5/-.  That was behaving as if they were like a lot of children who could not use their eyes and look around to see the sort of world in which we were living, and these are the people that I am invited to get and adjudicate on the balanced judgment that is given by a Minister, having regard to his own experience, and having regard to the technical and other advice at his hand every hour of the day.  I am glad to have been given the opportunity by this amendment of saying these few things, and if I wanted to I could say much more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather glad also that the Minister was given this opportunity because this raises an issue in which the differences between us are absolutely fundamental and deep-seated. The Minister by his speech has made that perfectly clear.  I do not think that anything I could say, or that anybody else could say, could bridge the ground between us because, as I have just said, it is so fundamental. The Minister has no confidence in the courts.  He is quite entitled to that view&mdash;confidence in the District Courts.  I am not sure that he is justified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the interpretation placed by the Senator on my words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most anxious not to place any wrong interpretation on them.  I understand from the Minister that he has been watching the District Courts in relation to his <Col N="1568" /> Department, and that he has not confidence that they would deal with matters raised in this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to certain matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to certain matters of his Department.  That is all I wanted to say, because that is where the fundamental difference between us is.  The Minister believes that he, which, of course, means his staff, should be the prosecutor, the judge and the jury because the district justices&mdash;who, we think, should be the judge, though not the prosecutor&mdash; would not be suitable to deal with particular matters.  I do not want to misrepresent the Minister in any way or to make any extreme statement.  I do want to clarify, as best I can, the issue between us.</P>
      <P>Now, I am absolutely convinced that, with the growth of Government power, which seems to be more or less inevitable&mdash;it has nothing to do with this particular Government or even with this particular country&mdash;but with the growth of Bills of a similar character to this Bill, the Minister asks, more or less, for general powers, and he is not quite sure how exactly, in some respects, he is going to deal with them until he gets them.  I do not blame him, because the very nature of the Bill is to allow him to work out a policy, and he is not going to tell us what the policy is until he works it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in the course of that control of industry it is regarded perhaps as necessary to work a licensing system. I do not suggest for a moment that there will be any intention or any serious likelihood that, as far as the majority of cases are concerned, the licensing system will not be worked perfectly fairly.  What I do say is that if the Minister in his discretion decides to take away a licence from a person who has been operating one, and is, therefore, in certain cases deriving his livelihood from it, then I say that man should have the right of an independent appeal from the prosecutor and there should be a judge who should be able to decide between him and the Minister if he feels aggrieved.  Now, in the majority of cases if a man <Col N="1569" /> accepts the revocation of his licence he will know perfectly well that he has broken the regulations.  If he has, the question of a half-crown or five-shilling fine does not arise.  The only thing to be decided by the justice would be whether the licence should be removed or not.  The case would not come before the justice unless the man felt aggrieved at the decision of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question of haste would not arise either.  In a case where a licence was revoked by a Minister whom he could not convince, the man at any rate would have the ultimate redress of an appeal to the District Court as distinct from the State.  I believe that if we are going to have government by Order, and if that is going to extend under a democratic form of government, we will have, if we are going to safeguard democracy at all, to provide some method by which there will be an independent judgment where a person feels aggrieved against a Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this amendment is bad because the District Court would not be suitable to deal with the matters which would arise on the Bill. I do not think that he is right in that, but even if he is he should provide another court, or some other body, which would be independent of him and of his Department.  If you give the people the right of an independent appeal in cases where they seem to have a grievance they will be satisfied. On the other hand if they feel that behind closed doors, the Department which sends out inspectors to watch them acts as prosecutor and finds them guilty, you will not have confidence and you will not get good government.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the question of trying to educate the district justices&mdash; I took down the word &ldquo;educate&rdquo; when the Minister used it&mdash;really arises.  The question that arises is a question of fact.  If a man appeals against a decision of the Minister because of a breach of the regulations and because he was deprived of his licence, all the Minister would have to do would be to satisfy the justice that, in fact, there had been that breach.  That is a question of fact and should not be a matter for a bureaucratic decision.  It <Col N="1570" /> is a question of fact to be decided by some independent body and until we get some other body, I think the district justice is the proper person to decide it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am generally not opposed to matters being brought into court, but in this case we have to visualise what happens before a licence is revoked.  I am sorry we have gone into all this discussion about district justices. I have a very high opinion of district justices and I am sorry that anything should be said against them.  But they are trained in law and not in poultry rearing, as a general rule.  They know little or nothing about it. On the other hand, there are poultry instructresses in the Department with inspectors over them.  They have to report to their higher inspectors, and they are cross-examined and possibly further inquiries are made before the inspector sends the matter up to the Department.</P>
      <P>I contemplate that it is only in cases in which it is absolutely necessary that the licence should be revoked that it will come before the Minister at all.  It will come before him on the basis of reports which are generally very well founded, but which it may be very hard to prove in court, although results may bear out these reports.  If there is to be an appeal to a district justice, I know that a district justice would be very embarrassed and would find it very difficult to go into a matter as the Minister could go into it, inasmuch as he will not have the knowledge the Minister will have through his officials.  The Department may also find it very hard to produce evidence of what they know perfectly well to be true, but which cannot be established by legal evidence. The particular hatchery may work a great injustice in the country while all that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also cases of appeals being taken for the mere purpose of delay.  In some courts, only matters of a criminal nature are dealt with in certain months, from May or June until October.  No civil business will be dealt with during that period.  This will be a civil matter, and, if an appeal is taken in May or <Col N="1571" /> June, the case would not come on for hearing until October and very serious injury might be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not our amendment but, in principle, we agree with it, and my reading of it is that the Minister has still full power to withdraw, but there will be a right of appeal afterwards.  Whether that is good or not, I am not saying.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no point in an appeal otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If you give an appeal, the decision is not operative until the appeal has been decided, and a person would not have to close.  Months may elapse in that way before the appeal is heard.  Possibly the decision would be confirmed, but a lot of damage would have been done in the meantime.  I suggest that there is no great danger of a revocation, unless there is a very serious necessity for it, and it has to go through all the different stages before it takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear Senator O'Dea making a speech on this <Col N="1572" /> amendment, if the Minister were not a member of his Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say exactly the same as I have said.  I do not think I am very much influenced in that way, and, as a matter of fact, I have often opposed the Minister on different matters in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with this particular question.  The fundamental thing in Senator O'Dea's point is that the Minister is all right.  That is the fundamental thing, and the difference between the Minister's attitude and mine, and our attitude generally&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction, I think I said that the Minister is more certain to be right because of the officials he has, officials who are trained in this particular business and who advise him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the point is that the Minister is going to be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>We can be unanimous on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Always is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the attitude of mind in all this.  The Minister has it in the highest possible degree&mdash;higher than any other Minister, and some are pretty bad.  He began his speech about this amendment by saying it was a solicitor's amendment.  I do not know whether that was a joke or not, but, if it was not, it was a very mean observation, because Senator Sweetman happens to be a solicitor but does not happen to be a solicitor who wants any more business.  I do not think the amendment was put down for the purpose of making business in the courts, but in pursuance of a particular known principle.  The principle is that the man who is the prosecutor should not be the judge and the person who also imposes the penalty.  That is what the Minister is in this case and every other case like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about balance. How could he have balance?  How could he be the most balanced person <Col N="1573" /> to decide all these matters?  First, he represents a political Party.  If we waive that&mdash;and I am prepared to waive it, although he does represent a political Party; I heard the Minister himself in opposition pretty effective and strong on that very point, that Ministers were always politicians&mdash; except the Ministers of his own particular persuasion&mdash;the Minister is also a person who has a particular policy in his mind about poultry, a policy which he wants to put into operation and who is impatient when people do not believe in him.  There is always a possibility that the people who do not believe in the Minister on the particular point may be right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There you are.  How could there be any balance in the mind of a man who has that outlook?  He is a man in a hurry; he is full of efficiency, full of haste and full of that most pernicious of all doctrines, perfectionism. He wants to make everything perfect, but perfect <i>á la</i> Smith, and not perfect <i>á la</i> O'Dea even.  He has Smith's view of how it is to be made perfect, and he feels that district justices, legal procedure, laws of evidence and all these things are nuisances to keep him from getting all the eggs he wants to get in a particular place and by a particular process. That is quite a wrong attitude of mind. The same thing could be applied to the police.  There are police officers who have that point of view.  They have been kept in restraint by the law here and elsewhere, but there are such men who think that the District Court and every other court is a nuisance.  They have the man and the proof, and, like the Minister, they have no confidence in the District Court where it concerns their Department.  That is a common view&mdash;the policeman has no confidence in the District Court in relation to his own department, just as the Minister has no confidence in it, or any other court, in relation to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite wrong.  There is an absolute lack of humanity in it.  It is all for efficiency and brushing away people's rights and depriving them of these <Col N="1574" /> rights summarily.  Every Ministerial goose is a swan&mdash;that is what it amounts to.  The Minister could not possibly be balanced when he is the judge in his own case and on his own policy.  I do not say for a moment that this Minister or any other Minister and his officials are going to be unjust, but they begin the whole investigation with particular prepossessions, with particular prejudices, with particular views and with particular desires and are unable to give a balanced judgment.</P>
    <P>The district justice is not skilled in poultry rearing.  Are civil servants skilled in poultry rearing&mdash;the whole of them, or any of them?  I think it may very well be doubtful.  In any event, we presumably cannot accomplish anything by talking about this kind of amendment.  The Minister made his mind perfectly clear.  He is impatient of the notion of justice being administered according to rules.  It ought to be possible, if not for the district justice, then for some independent person, to go into the question as to whether known rules have been carried out and, if known rules have been broken, then let the penalty be paid but, if it cannot be proved that known rules were broken, then why should a man be deprived of his livelihood?</P>
    <P>This runs through a great many Departments besides this one and I do not want to continue discussion, at this particular hour, and in our present circumstances, but the Minister's view is fundamentally the view of people who want to brush aside law.  The most deadly names of all the names in modern times are &ldquo;progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;.  They want, in the name of progress and efficiency, the two false gods of our period, at whose shrine they are now worshipping, to destroy people's ordinary rights and, incidentally, to destroy their livelihood.  It is a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I add a rider to the suggestion that progress and efficiency are deadly names?  Progress and efficiency as dictated and coerced from above, certainly; inspired from below, certainly not.  There is where the Minister and the point of view I am trying to represent are poles apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> This Bill, if it serves no other purpose, will at least throw a searchlight on the mentality and outlook of the Minister.  I give him every credit for the zeal of a young man in a hurry, of the new broom.  But, as a Parliamentarian, as a person to hold the scales between authority and civic rights, I think it is a most deplorable outlook that he is presenting to us.  I could not believe that I would sit in this House for 25 years and then hear a Minister speak like he did about the courts of justice.  I certainly admire his courage and candour but I certainly cannot admire his discretion and, in years to come, when he talks about his salad days, this will be one of the outstanding features of his salad days&mdash; the day he spoke as he did about the courts of justice.</P>
    <P>We are all impatient in our own spheres if the courts do not give us everything we want at once but those of us who have any proper democratic outlook, who want to proceed in a civilised and orderly manner, who want to avoid the methods that are dominating large parts of Eastern Europe today, are quite glad that the courts should be rather lenient and should be a brake on hasty authority, even though they do sometimes retard dictated progress from above.  We quite realise that may be the fact but I think any citizen who values freedom and anything really worth having in life would prefer that the courts should be lenient rather than merely yes-men to authority in a hurry and impatient. I certainly regard as deplorable the speech the Minister made with regard to the attitude of the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have enjoyed the two speeches to which we have just listened, especially the speech made by Senator Hayes.  What shall I say about it?  He took me back very far.  He took me back to the time when I was learning from the Senator how to hold the balance fairly.  I enjoy, in this House, and sometimes outside it, and in the other House, this cultivation of an atmosphere in which you dare not open your mouth to mention the courts.  We all regard the courts as a very necessary and useful institution.  I have not <Col N="1576" /> any qualms about expressing my views as to the competence of district justices in District Courts to adjudicate on matters of this kind.  Neither have I any hesitation, here or in any other place, in expressing my view when in the District Courts certain matters are handled in a particular way.  I imagine that it is only by expressing such views that, to a reasonable degree, we will get the sort of service in the courts to which the people are entitled and the courts will retain that degree of confidence that they should hold in the minds of all our people.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Dea has pointed out, and as I tried to emphasise, there is no advantage to be derived from this right of appeal unless the decision that is made by the Minister, as in all other cases of appeal, is inoperative until the appeal is determined.  If I were anxious to do so, I could cite thousands of cases of one kind or another in which, as Senator Hayes has rightly pointed out, a Minister must, every day in the week, make decisions revoking licences.  There is no way out of that.  There is nothing being sought here, as I have said on previous sections, that is not already conceded in other Acts.</P>
      <P>I was also pleased to hear the description that Senator Hayes gave of me personally.  It is a good thing to know that there is in the Department of Agriculture somebody who is in a hurry.  We are always accused by the learned professors and all those who can talk down at agriculturists, that we are slow, slow to move, slow to take advantage of this new method, slow to do a hundred and one things. That is a view that is often taken by people like Senator Hayes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in Senator Hayes' contribution that I am most interested now.  Anyhow, he has singled me out and I am charmed with the description, as a young man in a hurry&mdash;I think it was Senator Sir John Keane who said that, as a matter of fact&mdash; and also as a man who, in the past experience of Senator Hayes, could not be safely regarded as a person who could take a balanced judgment.  As <Col N="1577" /> a politician yes, and I hope a good and a successful one.  To the extent that the Senator may have come to a hasty conclusion as to my competence to come to a balanced judgment, perhaps it was because of the display I was accustomed to, and of the impatience that developed in me as a result of the attempts of some people to regard themselves as skilful, by trying to give the impression that they were people capable of taking a balanced view of things.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased indeed to have had the opportunity of saying a few words on my attitude towards those who say that this and similar matters should be referred to the District Courts for investigation.  Senator O'Dea, as all lawyers, has the utmost confidence in them.  Of course we all have, but it is not going to serve the courts or anybody else to say that we are always satisfied with decisions given there.  I have no apology to make to Senator Hayes because of the fact that I made reference to this as being the amendment of a solicitor. Perhaps he thought fit to use that for the purposes of that particular gentleman. It is not the first occasion in this House that the Oireachtas has been used by lawyers for the purpose of making business for themselves.</P>

    <P>This amendment aims in the last resort at making use of the courts before a licence is revoked.  It approaches the matter somewhat differently from the previous amendment. It is really the method used in the Milk Regulation and Supply Act, 1936, which is popularly known as the Clean Milk Act.  In that Act the Milk Board has power over registration of dairies and milk vendors and may at any time cancel registration.  I ask Senators if I am not right in saying that we are rapidly moving down the slippery path of control when we look at the distance we have travelled from the method of registration 11 years ago.  Reasons are set out in the Milk Act for cancelling registration, and include when a person registered ceases to carry on business, when he dies, is adjudicated in bankruptcy or convicted of an offence under the Act.  There were safeguards in the Dairy Acts regarding revocation of a licence.  Bankruptcy, fraud and conviction were essential conditions.  That is the safeguard I am aiming at in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dea and the Minister questioned whether the machinery of the courts was adequate and fair in matters of this kind.  Even if a thing cannot be proved is the attitude here a proper one to adopt?  I agree that the Minister may have reports from officials, and certain evidence of malpractices on the part of a licensee which cannot be proved, but is not that fact a complete reason why they should hold against him?  Yet, on circumstantial evidence, on reports or beliefs as to the reputation of an individual far greater penalties could be inflicted here than those inflicted by the courts. I grant that the courts are given certain powers, and can impose fines up to £100, but £100 fine is insignificant compared with the powers of the Minister, which might drive a man out of business and suffer loss of the capital he invested in it.</P>
    <P>In this case the circumstances really meet the Minister's argument.  The courts may inflict a nominal penalty but they have adjudged the evidence, <Col N="1579" /> while the Minister is leaving it to an outside tribunal to do so.  Is not this instance likely to be one where a licence could be revoked?  Disease might get into a hatchery, and there might be reason to believe that the owner had been buying eggs from an unauthorised source.  That is probably what will happen.  That is another day's work.  I do not see how the Minister could prevent a licensee buying eggs from an outside source.  There may be suspicion, but that should be proved in a court of law, and there is the right of the licensee, whose business is jeopardised, to be represented by counsel to challenge the evidence. That is but elementary justice to a person whose licence may be taken away.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the Minister is bound to take away a licence after a conviction.  He may let it act as a warning.  Before taking a licence there must be an aggravated offence, which the Minister can prove to the justice he has in mind, even though he has little confidence in him.  My amendment secures elementary justice for a person who may have sunk considerable capital in his business.</P>

      <P>I wonder would this sub-section have the effect practically of nullifying the whole Bill?  In order to have a licence revoked, there must be a conviction, according to the Senator, under sub-section (3) of Section 8&mdash;in other words, there must be a breach of some condition of the licence.  I have a good deal of experience of reading licences and I know it is very difficult to provide in a licence for every emergency that could arise and it is only when there is a breach of the conditions of a licence that a conviction can occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A disease may come into a hatchery. Is the licence going to provide for that eventuality and lay down regulations for putting an end to that disease?  If it does not and if the hatchery owner does not take proper steps to put an end to the disease, it would be a very serious matter.  Again, is the licence going to prescribe the kind of hens that must lay the particular eggs to be hatched, or can the owner purchase eggs wherever he likes?  Supposing the <Col N="1580" /> licence does prevent him from doing that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister when he says there is nothing in this Bill he has not had in the Acts passed under his Government in the last five or six years.  It is a pretty consistent policy adopted by the Departments and I think it is fundamentally wrong.  It will not make for a healthy independent type of country, but will make people feel that they are entirely under the State or the Executive and cannot live, as the State is their prosecutor and their judge.  I honestly and sincerely believe that such a policy is a mistake and will have to be checked.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, there is no difference between the Minister and myself, because we are just in the opposite poles, but when it comes to Senator O'Dea, with whom I find myself in agreement on many occasions, I am puzzled by his attitude.  Breaches of the law done in the dark and which one could not easily see are not suitable to be brought before the courts! Those are the very type which the police and the courts have to deal with.  To hand over to a Minister, say the Minister for Justice, the prosecution and punishment of crimes because the breaches of the law are done in the dark and not easily seen is just carrying it to absurdity, and I am astonished to find that advocated by him.</P>
      <P>There will be mistakes, even when you have the best Minister in the world and the best Department.  There are mistakes even if you go to the courts. Is it not better to seek some way out, by which people who have a conviction that there has been a mistake in their case and that it is not fair, may put it to an independent person?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> Whereas we can do nothing at the moment, as those of us who take this view are clearly in a minority, I respectfully suggest to the House and to the Government that in the interest of good government some way should be found, in the near future, by which there could be an appeal against executive actions which affect the individual and which may take away his licence.  It may be that the courts are not the best&mdash;I have an entirely open mind on that&mdash;but this idea has grown and now it is not unusual.  Similar powers are contained in probably 50 per cent. of the administrative Departmental Bills that come before us.  I respectfully urge serious consideration, with a view to finding some way by which the individual will not feel that he is just under the State and the Minister and that, if he cannot get some T.D. to put forward his case, he is the under dog and has no independent person to whom he can go.  That is not good for politics, or for Party politics, and I do not think it will lead to the continued healthy growth of democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that while this clause in its present form is in the Bill it will go a long way to defeat the very object which the Minister and the House have in view.  No one questions his good will and we all admire his energy and efficiency.  To a great extent I have great sympathy with a young man in a hurry.  We are all in a hurry to get there, to increase the prosperity of Irish agriculture, but we differ in our views as to the best way. It is our duty to express our views, when they are not those of the Minister, to try to persuade him that we have the correct point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main objects of this Bill is to encourage the growth of large-scale commercial hatcheries, for the sake of the country.  There are about 24 of them now and it would be well if there were 240 of them.  I am sure the Minister would be delighted if he could give licences to that number within the next year or two.  We all sympathise with his desire to ensure that these commercial hatcheries shall operate in such a way as to increase the number of healthy poultry in the country very much beyond the present very inadequate <Col N="1582" /> total number of poultry.  Now, a large-scale commercial hatchery is not a small affair.  It is going to cost a lot financially, perhaps in borrowed capital, and will need a good deal of enterprise and expert technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>If I were thinking seriously of establishing such a hatchery and read in this Bill the clause which says: &ldquo;The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, revoke a poultry hatchery licence&rdquo;, I would say: &ldquo;If I commit myself to this enterprise I will be absolutely at the mercy of the Minister and his Department; and though I know that Mr. Patrick Smith is a very amiable and proper person himself, I have no guarantee that his successor will not be the last word in political monstrosity.&rdquo; I would not feel happy about the law or about committing my fortunes to the absolute discretion of whoever happens to be Minister and, therefore, I would not sink thousands of pounds in starting a commercial hatchery.  In order to get these things started, we will need to give those with the enterprise and the money some confidence that they will not be deprived of their money except in the process of law.</P>
    <P>If you simply say that the Minister will prescribe the regulations under which commercial hatcheries will be carried on and that any person who fails to conform to those regulations will be liable to be hailed before the courts and deprived of his licence, under those terms a person would know where he stood and would know that, if he kept to a certain definite course, within the four corners of the law, he would be safe and his property would be secure.  As it stands, he can have no certainty that because some queer person may be Minister and, because he did not like the colour of his eyes or of his politics, or because some of the Minister's advisers fell foul of him for some matter unrelated to poultry production, he might find these powers used against him to deprive him of a livelihood.  I do not think it is capable of defence in its present form and I think some amendment on the lines indicated should be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a little common sense brought into this discussion.  It seems to me that on the <Col N="1583" /> Second Reading we accepted the principle of licensing and that our object in doing so was to put the production of eggs on a sound basis.  The Minister knows enough about agriculture to appreciate the important part that women will play in this industry and that the production of better eggs will be largely in the hands of women.  It seems to me that having accepted the principle of licences, the question now arises who is to give the licences and who is to do the job of licensing?  It has been suggested that the District Courts in certain cases should have the final say.  I am closely bound with people in the District Courts and I do not want to disparage them in any way but I must say that I do not think that the district justice could be the proper person to know whether or not a licence should be revoked.  They could only decide on the evidence of the officials of the Department and the word of the person whose licence is in question.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I am afraid that there is a tendency to put an undue burden on the district justices who for themselves would not seek for this.  It would be all right if it was a question of fact but this is not merely a question of fact.  It is a question of the suitability of a person to hold a licence. There is more in the question of licensing than fact and I think we should entrust the Minister with the guardianship of these licences.  If we do so, we are doing it in the interests of the country as a whole and in the interests of egg production and that will be a great advancement in our agricultural development.  It is only a question of the violation of a section.</P>

      <P>On a point of correction, I would like to point out that a conviction under Section 11 would not enable the Minister to revoke a licence if this amendment is carried.  It must be a conviction under sub-section (3) of Section 8.  A conviction for a breach of any of the regulations would not be sufficient unless these regulations were printed on the licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the spirit of the amendment moved by Sir John Keane.  This type <Col N="1584" /> of power given to Ministers permeates practically the whole of our recent legislation and we are rapidly progressing towards a condition that is known as the servile State, where people will have to keep themselves proper and circumspect in their manners or they will find certain occupations are no longer open to them.  I take the case of a licensed house.  If it is right to empower the Minister to revoke a licence for a poultry station, I do not see why we should not give the same power to the Minister for Justice in regard to a licensed house.  That this will lead to the maximum concentration of power in hands other than the courts, seems very clear.  In reference to the remarks made by Senator Mrs. Concannon I take it that before the Minister issues licences, he would have very carefully considered all the reports he receives from his different experts and then decide whether a person concerned was fit to be given a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards revocation, I should imagine that the Minister would be empowered in this Act to make broad regulations and should any of these regulations not be adhered to, he would have cause for revoking the licence.  But in order to protect the liberty of the subject, the spirit and principle of the regulations governing procedure in regard to licensed houses should be adopted.  In that event the Minister's experts would simply go to the courts and say &ldquo;here is a case for revocation&rdquo; and I imagine that if these regulations were properly drawn, the magistrate would have no difficulty in determining whether the licence should be revoked.  In this way the liberty of the people in general is being preserved.  When this House reassembles, I imagine that one of the first things it should discuss is this question of the power given to Ministers in general.  Having said so much I would like to congratulate the Minister on the attempt on his part to do something for the poultry industry. As one who has sad experiences of the matter, I realise that something must be done for the industry or it will collapse.  A person living in the country as I am, knows that all sorts of stratagems are adopted and therefore <Col N="1585" /> any measure tending to strengthen the Minister's hands, should be approved.  If dark practices are being followed, somebody must know of them; why then should not those persons come along and say what they know in open court instead of saying it to the Minister?  It is the principle of this amendment that I really support. I have been consistent in this matter from the first time I spoke in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not think there is anything personal in what I have said, or that because Senator Sir John Keane, Senator Douglas or somebody else spoke that I am speaking.  I am giving him my candid opinion, and I want to assure him that in my opinion he is attempting to do something of value.  I often wonder whether, if there had been some interruption or brake on the work many years ago, our poultry industry would not be in a more flourishing condition than it is now.  The view of the majority of farmers to whom I have spoken is that they will have nothing more to do with this industry because disease is so rampant.  I have had that sad experience myself.  You send up specimens and you get the poultry instructresses to come and see the poultry, but before a report comes back on the specimens more of the poultry are dead.  I wonder if the reason for that is that we have a very highly specialised type of breeding? We find that, with all our modern science, poultry are not able to stand up to disease.  That is the position not merely in this country but in England. If the Minister, enthusiastic and all that he is, occasionally finds somebody inclined to put a little brake on his activities, may I say that it might be good for himself and for the poultry industry itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to save time, perhaps I had better say that on a further examination of my amendment I find that Senator O'Dea was right in what he said about it.  My intention was not to deal with the revocation of licences following on a conviction under Section 11.  I was concerned more with offences against a breach of the terms of the licences and <Col N="1586" /> I wanted to ensure that, not until after a conviction under that head had been secured, should the licence be revoked. Accordingly, I shall try to prepare an amendment for the Report Stage to meet that.</P>
      <P>I think it was in that spirit, too, that Senator O'Reilly supported the amendment. I cannot agree with him that this measure is likely to save the poultry industry or that it will do anything more than perhaps slightly correct the spread of disease within that industry. Any improvement in the industry must come from below&mdash;from the individual poultry people.  They must be given the incentive to keep poultry, and the way to encourage them to do that is to give them freedom to do it in their own way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give general effect to the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Seanad Panel Elections, which was set up by resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 31st January, 1946, and on which seven members of this House were appointed to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> I need not recount the circumstances which led to the setting-up of the committee; for, apart altogether from any particular matter, few people, I think, believed that the existing machinery for elections was in general very satisfactory, so that I am sure I may say that for a long time there has been a general desire on the part of all Parties to improve it, if possible.  Having held 15 meetings, the committee was able to arrive at an agreed report, which in due course was presented to the Oireachtas in May last.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, I may claim, has the weight of a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas behind it, and on that body there were representatives of all Parties and sections in both Houses.  In considering the measure, and the report on which it is based, it is important to bear in mind that the joint committee was not constituted to make recommendations for an amendment of the Constitution.  It could only consider such proposals for the amendment of the existing scheme as were within the terms of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senators, I am sure, will have read the report of the committee and it will not be necessary, therefore, for me to describe in close detail the proposals in the Bill.  At the outset, however, I think it proper to refer specially to certain provisions of it.  These relate to the method of voting and to the special arrangements which are required in order to permit the impending general election to be carried out in accordance with the general principles of the committee's report.</P>
    <P>Firstly, on second thoughts, some doubt has arisen as to whether the method of voting recommended in the report, while calculated to safeguard more effectively than the existing method has been found to do the secrecy of the ballot, might be regarded by the courts as satisfying the provisions of Article 16 (5) in regard to the postal ballot.  Therefore, another procedure, which it is felt will give full effect to the intention of the committee, has been devised and provided for in the Bill.  This new procedure, which is prescribed in Section 51 and set out in <Col N="1589" /> detail in the First Schedule, more particularly in Rules 8, 14 and 23, will, I believe, make the secrecy of the ballot practically inviolable.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as it is now certain that an election will be held before a register of nominating bodies can be prepared in accordance with the procedure recommended by the joint committee, a transitory provision has been included in the Bill, under which it is proposed that the register of nominating bodies which is now in force, under the existing statutes, will continue in force until the new register is prepared.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, until the publication of the new register of nominating bodies, it is proposed that the present Seanad Returning Officer should continue to act in that capacity.  The second and third provisions will enable the Act to be operative to the fullest extent possible at the next election.</P>
    <P>Before going on to describe very briefly the general provisions of the measure, I should also explain that, rather than introduce a Bill confined to making the necessary amendments of the Seanad Electoral Acts of 1937 and 1940, it was felt that it would be more convenient, and more generally acceptable to everybody concerned, to repeal these Acts and to introduce a consolidated measure, in which the desired amendments would be incorporated with such provisions of the existing law as it was not proposed to change; hence the somewhat formidable text with which the Oireachtas has been presented.  I should like to emphasise again that the main bulk of the Bill is occasioned by the fact that it is provisions of the electoral laws which do not have to be amended in accordance with the recommendations of the joint committee.</P>
    <P>Now to the terms of the Bill.  Part I sets out the panels as prescribed by the Constitution, and defines as required by the Constitution the professional interests for the purpose of the cultural and educational panel.  The Clerk of the Seanad will be the returning officer, subject, however, to the transitory provisions, to which I have referred, which are set out in Section 85.  The returning officer's charges will <Col N="1590" /> of course be paid out of the central fund.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill directs that a register of the nominating bodies be prepared and maintained and sets out the conditions to be fulfilled by bodies seeking admission to the register. These conditions, as will be clear, give the returning officer a positive guide in determining the eligibility of any body that applies for registration.  In contrast to the existing provision limiting the size of the register, it is proposed that there should in future be no limit to the number of bodies that may be registered in respect of any panel.</P>
    <P>The decision of the returning officer on an application for registration is subject to appeal to a board, which is to consist of a judge of the Supreme Court or of the High Court as chairman and the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of Dáil Eireann and of Seanad Eireann.  A fee of £20 must be lodged with the appeal, but it will be returned if the appeal succeeds.</P>
    <P>Every precaution that is practicable in present conditions has been taken to secure that the bodies registered will be real bodies serving a definite purpose and representing a true vocational interest.  The standards prescribed by the measure will, it is hoped, prevent any mushroom body getting on the register.  In the course of future developments naturally we may anticipate that the standard may be raised further and the general characteristics of the nominating bodies take a more concrete form, but in this matter we must, as the committee realised, proceed gradually.</P>
    <P>Part III provides for the formation and maintenance of a nomination committee for each panel.  This is a new feature and one of the principal recommendations of the Joint Committee. Each nominating body will have the right and it is presumed, will exercise that right, to nominate five members to the nominating committee for the panel in respect of which it is registered. These members are to be nominated at the anuual meeting of the body and will remain members for a year.</P>
    <P>The particular functions of a nomination committee are set out in detail in Part IV, Chapter II, and Part V, <Col N="1591" /> Chapter II.  At a general election, the appropriate committee for a panel will review the proposals for nominations made by the nominating bodies for the panel and will select therefrom what may be called a short list of candidates who, as representing the several vocational interests, will stand nominated on the panel when it is submitted to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Where there are more than two nominating bodies on a panel, the nomination committee will meet, as provided in Section 32 and in accordance with Section 34 will make their selections by balloting on the candidates proposed to them.  The result of the ballot will be determined according to the principles of proportional representation, using the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that, through the medium of the nomination committee, the nominating bodies will in effect make a collective nomination which will be as truly representative as is at present practicable of the general interests and services to which the panel relates.  This procedure should definitely intensify the vocational character of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>At a by-election, the nomination committee will directly nominate and, subject to the provisions of Chapter III, Part V, elect a candidate to fill the casual vacancy, the voting being according to the principles of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>Part IV sets out the procedure for the holding of a general election.  In this connection, there are four sections of the Bill which may be said to be of vital importance, Sections 26, 28 and 34 in Part IV and Section 52 in Chapter III of the same Part.  It is convenient to refer to these sections in the reverse order to that in which they appear in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 52 which is the fundamental section prescribes how the 43 Senators to be elected under the measure are to be allocated to the several panels. In this respect, we are proposing no change and in accordance with the section the Cultural and Educational Panel will return five members with a <Col N="1592" /> minimum of two and therefore a maximum of three from either sub-panel.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Panel is to give 11 with a minimum of four and a maximum of seven from either sub-panel. The Labour Panel will elect 11, with a minimum of four and a maximum of seven from either sub-panel.</P>
    <P>The Industrial and Commercial Panel&mdash;nine, with a minimum of three and a maximum of six; the Administrative Panel will elect seven members, with a minimum of three and a maximum of four.</P>
    <P>Thus, it will be seen, that there is not, as at present, a fixed number to be elected from a sub-panel, but a minimum and a maximum number, and it will not be possible as at present for a candidate to be elected merely because he cannot be eliminated, whether he has received any votes or even no votes.  The choice of the electors, therefore, will be an effective one, subject to the requirement that a reasonable proportion of the candidates from each of the sub-panels will be elected.  In order that the electors may have a reasonable choice of candidates, Section 28 requires that the number of candidates who will stand nominated after the meeting of the nomination committee will be twice the maximum number that could be elected from the nominating bodies sub-panel. Accordingly there must be nominated to the Cultural and Educational Panel six candidates, since the maximum number that could be elected from that panel is three.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Nomination Committee and the Labour Nomination Committee will place 14 on their respective panels, since the maximum number that could be elected from each of these panels is seven.  To the Industrial and Commercial Panel the appropriate committee will nominate 12, since the maximum number that could be elected is six, and to the Administrative Panel, eight, since the maximum number that could be elected is four.</P>
    <P>If a nomination committee is to make, not only a collective, but a considered and selective nomination from the proposals submitted by the nominating <Col N="1593" /> bodies, the number of the candidates proposed for its consideration must exceed the number of candidates to be nominated.</P>
    <P>With this in mind the Bill, under Section 26 (3) and (4), provides that where more than two nominating bodies are registered in respect of a panel, each will propose for nomination at least two candidates or more, according to the number of bodies entitled to propose.</P>
    <P>It may happen that some proposals may be received late, or that the same candidate may be proposed by more than one body, but the total number of persons to be put before the nomination committee, in the case I am describing, must exceed by at least four the number who are to be finally nominated by it.  If, therefore, the proposals made by the nominating bodies are not sufficient to fulfil this condition, the Taoiseach will propose a number of names to make good the deficiency, and thus enable the nomination committee to exercise its right of selection under the Bill.  It may be assumed, I think, that the occasions on which the Taoiseach would be called upon to discharge this duty will be extremely rare.  I can scarcely believe it will arise but, as there is that possibility, we must make provision against it.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the position as it would be when there were more than two nominating bodies registered in respect of a panel but where there are not more than two bodies registered, special circumstances arise and must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>In that case, for instance, there would be no point in summoning a meeting of the nominating committee; since the committee could only accept all the candidates proposed to it.  It is therefore proposed that where there is only one body or two bodies, no meeting of the nomination committee will be held.  Instead, if there is only one body&mdash;a most unlikely contingency &mdash;it will propose, as provided under Section 26, but, in effect, nominate three less than the number to be finally nominated, which under Section 34 is twice the maximum that can be elected under Section 52, and here we <Col N="1594" /> have to consider the special position of the electorate.  I proceed on the principle that the electorate must have some right of choice and, therefore, in order that the right of the electorate to make a choice may be made effective, an excess of candidates must be provided and, therefore, the Taoiseach, under Section 28, will nominate then three more candidates.  If there are two nominating bodies, the total of their nominations will be two less than the final, that is, &ldquo;the appropriate number&rdquo;, as defined in Section 34 (2), and the Taoiseach will nominate two candidates.  This procedure, dealing with very special cases, which I think are most unlikely to arise in future, solves many problems.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should not deal merely with that narrow aspect of the procedure but I should perhaps put it this way&mdash;that the procedure as I have outlined it for nomination to all panels solves many problems.  It gives, in the case of those panels where there are many nominating bodies entitled to make proposals, a procedure for reducing the plethora of candidates to a compact and rational panel of such convenient size as to allow the electorate to consider it rationally and, at the same time, a panel which will be sufficiently large to be broadly representative of the vocational interests to which representation is to be given.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the general procedure whether for panels with one or two nominated bodies or for panels with many nominating bodies, safeguards the right of the special electorate to have it so elected.  Under the procedure I have outlined it will not be possible for the special electorate to be presented with a list from which a free choice cannot be made.  It will not be possible, by restricting the nominations to a sub-panel, to leave the electorate no choice but to accept <i>in toto</i> the candidates proposed by perhaps only one or maybe two nominating bodies.</P>
    <P>At the same time I should point out that the nomination of candidates, by the Taoiseach, in the special cases I have mentioned, will not preclude the nominating bodies, even if only one or two, from securing all the seats that may be filled from their sub-panel, if <Col N="1595" /> their candidates receive the necessary support from the electorate.</P>
    <P>It may, furthermore, be mentioned in this connection that it would be difficult to comply with the implications of Article 18 (7), 10, (iii), in its relation to unorganised labour, if some such procedure as I have been describing were not devised.</P>
    <P>Chapter III sets out the procedure for taking the poll.  The electorate will be the members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and of every county and county borough council.  The electorate will be over 900.  The advantages of the wider electorate are patent and I need not, I am sure, dilate upon them.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to refer to in some detail is the method of postal voting.  The Constitution, under Article 18 (5), requires that the election to Seanad Éireann shall be made by secret postal ballot, and in order better to safeguard the secrecy of the ballot, the joint committee made certain recommendations.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as I stated earlier, some doubts have been expressed that the recommendations of the joint committee in this particular matter may not be in strict conformity with the requirements of the Constitution and a different procedure to attain the same object has been outlined.  Under this procedure the ballot papers only, accompanied by the necessary outer and covering envelopes, but without forms of declaration of identity, will be sent to the electors by registered post.</P>
    <P>The envelope containing the ballot papers and instructions and the covering envelope for the return of the ballot papers will contain a warning to the person to whom they are addressed that he must preserve the envelope, in which he received the papers and their contents carefully until he has completed the procedure which I am going to outline.  The forms of declaration of identity which, as you may have noticed, will not be enclosed in the first instance to the elector, will be sent to the appropriate superintendent of the Garda Síochána or county registrar or other authorised persons, as specified in Rule 8 of the First Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> The elector when he wishes to vote shall produce to one of these authorised persons the ballot paper and other documents sent to him including the envelope in which they were sent and, having satisfied the authorised person that he is in fact the person entitled to have them, will thereupon complete the declaration of identity which will be given to him, and mark his ballot paper in the sole presence of the authorised person, taking care, of course, not to disclose how he has voted.</P>
    <P>The papers with declaration of identity will then be enclosed in the ballot envelope and then in the covering envelope, which will be closed and presented to the authorised person by the voter, who will then attach his official paper seal to the envelope and sign the certificate printed on the seal that the law has been complied with.</P>
    <P>The elector will then return the packet thus sealed and endorsed to the returning officer.  The packet naturally must be sent in due time and by registered post, and if the covering envelope is tampered with in any way the vote will be bad.</P>
    <P>An elector, I should emphasise, cannot show his paper to anyone once it has been marked.  If any attempt is made by him to disclose how he has voted, by tampering with the envelope which has been sealed by the authorised person, I think the form of seal which has been devised will effectively prevent that.  Thus, while we have given the voter his full right to vote by post for any person he likes inside the area of the State, it will be quite clear he will have no opportunity of disclosing it for an improper purpose once he has marked it.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the next section which is of importance is Section 52. I dealt with Sections 28, 26, 34 and the rules covering postal voting.  Section 52 is the section which allocates representation to the various panels.  No change is made in the representation of the various panels, but instead of prescribing a fixed number to be elected from each panel as heretofore, Section 52 prescribes the minimum for each, and having prescribed a minimum fixes a maximum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Part V makes provision for filling casual vacancies that arise.  Where the vacancy is from the nominating bodies sub-panel, the nomination committee will meet and fill the vacancy direct, and the voting will be by proportional representation.  Heretofore the nomination committee had only a right to select three names and recommend them to the Taoiseach, who made the final choice.  Henceforth the nomination committee will have the right to make a choice in the election.  Where a vacancy arose on the Oireachtas sub-panel the electors will be the members of the Oireachtas.  Under Chapter III of Part V every nomination is subject to the rulings provided for by Section 68.  All questions relating to the qualification or disqualification of a candidate or the description of a candidate or the validity of a nomination may be raised thereat.</P>
    <P>The general provision relating to the ruling will be found under Chapter IV. At the ruling nominations the President of the High Court will sit with the returning officer as judicial referee. A statement of any question to be raised by a candidate or agent must be delivered two days previously to the returning officer.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains miscellaneous provisions.  It provides that a panel member may resign by notice in writing.  It provides that if a person is elected as a panel member and as a university member he must declare in what capacity he will sit, and if he does not do so within one month, he will be deemed to be a university member.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule contains the rules for the issue, receipt and return of ballot papers at a general election. The Second Schedule contains the rules for counting the votes.  These are the existing rules modified by reason of the provision that a minimum and not a fixed member of candidates must be elected from a sub-panel.  The Third Schedule contains the rules for <Col N="1598" /> the conduct of a by-election and are a re-enactment of the rules in the Act of 1940.</P>
    <P>This Bill not only gives effect to the recommendation of the joint committee and consolidates all the law relating to elections of panel members; under it, as I mentioned at the beginning, the Acts of 1937 and 1940 will be repealed.</P>
    <P>Existing casual vacancies will be deemed to have been notified to the Minister for Local Government at the passing of the Act, but there is little possibility of those elections being held with the general election imminent.</P>
    <P>The existing register of nominating bodies on the present register which is made to be the first register under the Bill must nominate five members each to constitute the new nomination committees.</P>
    <P>It is highly desirable that the Bill should become law as early as possible. In order that a general election may be held under it, there is much to be done to give effect to its provisions, much which cannot be done until it becomes law.  The returning officer, for instance, must within ten days after a dissolution send by post to every nominating body a form of proposal for nomination paper and at that time everything, including forms, must have been prescribed and a full supply printed.</P>
    <P>I trust, therefore, that the Seanad will recognise that there is real urgency in the matter and give me the Bill, if they are so inclined, so as to enable the Minister concerned, the Minister for Local Government, to complete all the necessary preliminaries before the general election is declared.</P>

      <P>I propose that, having heard the Minister's statement, we adjourn until 11 a.m. to-morrow.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.30 p.m. to 11 a.m. on Friday, 12th December 1947.</P>
