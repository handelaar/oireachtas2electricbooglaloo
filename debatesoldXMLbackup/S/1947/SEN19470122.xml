      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, sub-section (1), clause (c), paragraph (i), to add after the word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; in line 6, the words &ldquo;Provided, however, that the company shall not itself sell for human consumption as a beverage any spirit distilled by it and shall use its best endeavours to prevent the sale by any other person for human consumption as a beverage of any spirit distilled by it unless the Minister certifies that he is of opinion that such spirit is not distilled by private enterprise in sufficient quantity to meet the reasonable demand for such spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of the discussion on Section 4 during the Committee Stage.  The House will recollect that that is the operative section altering the objects of the company which was set up under the 1938 Act.  I pointed out then to the Minister certain doubts and difficulties which might arise through those alterations, that there was a danger that the distillation by this company of potable industrial spirit might render it possible for that potable spirit to be used to displace existing industry or to be used for the purpose of adulteration or for other unsatisfactory purposes&mdash;not by the State company itself but by those to whom the company might sell the spirit when distilled.  The Minister then made it clear that, in his view, the spirit produced by the alcohol company &mdash;and to be produced in the future by Ceimící Teoranta&mdash;was always potable but that, having been distilled, it was denatured and so rendered unsuitable for potable use.  Having regard to that, I submit an amendment which is completely restricted to the dangers which I visualised then and which, with the <Col N="713" /> permission of the Chair, I will recapitulate for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <P>My amendment merely provides that the company shall not, itself, sell its spirit for human consumption as a beverage, and shall use its best endeavours to prevent such sale by anybody else.  So far as the first part is concerned, I do not think that the Minister intends that this company will so engage in the sale of spirit distilled by it and on that point I do not think the Minister and I are at differences at all.  Where we differ is in regard to the possibility that this spirit, having been produced with State funds, would be utilised by some other person&mdash;with the indirect assistance of the State, therefore&mdash;to displace existing industry or damage it in regard to the quality of the spirit.</P>
    <P>The case on the last occasion seemed mainly to turn around the manufacture of gin.  Prior to the war, the average consumption of gin here was approximately 30,000 gallons per annum.  In present circumstances, there is already here a private enterprise manufacturing gin from raw materials, 99 per cent. of which are produced, from their inception, in Ireland, and manufacturing that gin at the rate, in the last six months, of 28,500 gallons a year.  Therefore there is a margin of only 1,500 gallons between the pre-war demand and the present output by private enterprise. I agree that there is greater demand now than in pre-war days, arising from the shortage at present of wines, rum, brandy and so on, but the fact remains that the reason the output of this particular private enterprise is confined to 28,500 gallons is that, of necessity, Government control has diverted the raw materials to other purposes.  In fact, 28,500 gallons are the maximum output this private enterprise can produce with the materials allowed to it by the State.  If greater quantities of raw materials were allowed, they would be in a position not only to make up the very small difference between the present output and the pre-war consumption but to meet at once all the demands for gin here.</P>
    <P>This particular manufacturer does not import raw industrial spirit.  He makes his own industrial spirit from grain&mdash;<Col N="714" /> not from potatoes, from which Ceimící Teoranta will make theirs&mdash;and uses something less than 1 per cent. of flavouring herbs, which must, in any event, come from foreign countries, as they cannot be produced here by anybody. Since he makes the gin from 99 per cent.  Irish materials and is in a position to supply the total demand of the Irish market, I suggest that it would be grossly unfair to permit a State company &mdash; or anybody else helped, so to speak, by State moneys&mdash; to go into the market and displace the existing enterprise.  The enterprise was started about the end of 1937 in the very greatest difficulties, having to compete with a tremendous barrage from all the established brands of gin, which were advertised not merely here but everywhere else and which, therefore, were very hard to displace.</P>
    <P>The war assisted this particular enterprise, but it was started before the war and was experimenting and had gone into production before the war.  During the war, comparatively speaking, no gin was imported.  In 1945&mdash;the last year for which details are supplied in the Statistical Abstract or the Revenue Commissioners' Report&mdash; this manufacturer supplied the entire Irish market, with the exception of only 3,500 gallons.  Since 1945, he has been able to increase still further and I venture to say that the 1946 figures will show that the gap has been closed even more.</P>
    <P>I admit the Minister has no intention that this company will step in to do that manufacturing, but the Minister has stated that the spirit will be produced cheaper and better for other people to buy it.  If he does not recollect his statement exactly, he will find it in column 482 of the last report.  The gin produced by this private enterprise is considered as good if not better than any of the dry gins imported and it is the cheapest gin on the market to-day.  If the spirit used by Ceimící Teoranta is sold to anyone else for production as gin, all that can happen is that someone else will be displaced. I think it will be agreed that that is not the intention or desire of this State operated company and it would be grossly unfair for such a company <Col N="715" /> to do that with the aid of the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Apart from the market in respect of spirit for gin, there is the danger that, if this spirit is produced in very great quantity, it might be utilised by other persons for the adulteration of Irish whiskey and sold as such.  There is no suggestion whatever that any private individual or privately-owned company cannot get into the manufacture of either pot still or patent still whiskey if they desire to do so.  The patent still whiskey is whiskey produced from industrial alcohol spirit, though that spirit is made from grain and not from potatoes.  I suggest there should be different considerations in respect of the aid of the State being given towards the private individual getting into such manufacture and operation.</P>
    <P>The dangers of that to the national interest are so very obvious that I do not think it is necessary for me to stress it very much.  I want to stress, however, that it is not suggested that this company will engage in such adulteration or in such sale as that of which we are afraid.  But I suggest that it is making available national resources which can be utilised in a manner completely foreign and antagonistic to the national interest.  We know that, as a result of its quality, pot still Irish whiskey has got a name of which we are all justly proud.  It would be very undesirable that the State, as such, should do anything, even indirectly, which, even if it did not damage, would involve the risk of damaging, the reputation of a product for quality which has been maintained and accepted here and abroad consistently down the years.  That danger is, particularly, operative in the case of the export market.  This product would be manufactured in Ireland and could be sold to anybody here.  They would then be entitled to sell it abroad as Irish whiskey though, in fact, it would not be Irish whiskey, as members of the House understand the term. It would be stuff made industrially from potatoes.</P>
    <P>Without going into the matter in any great detail, I may refer to a paragraph in the newspapers during <Col N="716" /> the past few days which described how this industrial spirit was used for drinking purposes in America at a party.  The consequence was that six persons had to be removed to hospital and two died.  The spirit distilled from potatoes and wood is indicated. When denatured and rendered undrinkable, that spirit is used for industrial purposes, such as combastion. That is an aspect of the danger which will arise.  It is an aspect of great importance from the point of view of our export trade.  So far as home consumption is concerned, I suggest that the only difference which increased whiskey distillation can make, taking the long view, is that it will either take from the existing trade or else mean that we shall increase our capacity for spirit-drinking as a nation.  I do not think that anybody&mdash;least of all the Minister&mdash; would be anxious to accept the second alternative.  Therefore, all that can happen is, if this company goes into the production of spirit for somebody else to turn into whiskey, that it will displace an existing industry which is of the greatest value.</P>
    <P>I wanted to be perfectly sure when I was framing an amendment to this Bill that I would not frame it in a way which would restrict what we would all consider the proper and rightful scope of the products of the company. The company is empowered to manufacture chemical products and there is a most specific proviso in the Bill that, before they do that, they must seek a licence from the Minister.  The Minister must, before he grants that licence, go through certain formalities of publicity, of receiving objections and considering the objections made. I did not think that it was desirable that even that long process should be adopted in this case.  All that my amendment asks the company to accept, and all that I now ask the Minister to accept, is the proposition that, before this company distils spirit which might endanger the existence of any private enterprise, the Minister will certify that he is of opinion that such spirit is not distilled by private enterprise in sufficient quantity to meet the reasonable <Col N="717" /> demands for such spirit.  No Minister would give a certificate of that nature without having considered the facts carefully and obtained all the information that was desirable or necessary. If the Minister were of opinion that the company was merely going to displace an imported spirit, he would give a certificate, but if the company by entering into a transaction of this kind enabled somebody else to take from an industry already existing, then I think that no Minister would give a certificate.  It is for that reason I have framed the amendment in this way, leaving it completely to the Minister's Department to take the proper steps to ascertain whether the demand is being reasonably met by existing enterprise and, if not so met, leaving him in the position to direct that the company shall do these things.</P>
    <P>I must stress, before I conclude, that it is not the fear that Ceimící Teoranta will do these things which influences me.  It is the fear that, if they make these spirits freely available, other people will, as an indirect result of such activity, be able severely to damage industries already existing which are of great value to the community and that all that will happen, so far as employment is concerned, will be that employment in one place will be transferred to another.</P>

      <P>I hope Senators listening to Senator Sweetman were not as confused as he succeeded in making me. I think that he has completely failed to grasp the issues involved in his amendment.  Let me make quite clear that this Bill does not alter in any way the existing powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company.  The new company that will emerge when this Bill will have been brought into operation&mdash; Ceimící Teoranta&mdash;will have the same powers as the Industrial Alcohol Company, powers which the Industrial Alcohol Company have had since 1938. Under the legislation of that year, the company was given power to manufacture ethyl alcohol, whether denatured or not, which has been distilled or rectified to a strength of not less than 40 degrees over proof by a process other than the pot still process.  When the Oireachtas passed that Act in 1938, <Col N="718" /> they did so knowing that it was the intention that the Industrial Alcohol Company would, in addition to producing denatured spirit for sale to petrol distributors, engage in the production of industrial alcohol required for commercial purposes.  The point I want to make is that nothing is happening now that need cause any apprehension to any manufacturing distiller in the country.  If the powers of the company appear to threaten their welfare in any way, that threat has existed since 1938. I could not agree, under any circumstances whatsoever, that the provisions of the 1938 Act be amended so as to detract from, or limit, the powers of the company in regard to industrial alcohol.</P>
      <P>In so far as the manufacture of gin is concerned, I am not going to take the responsibility upon myself of deciding what, in normal circumstances, is a reasonable demand for that spirit.  I do not think that there is any case whatever for granting a monopoly for the manufacture of gin to any one distiller.  If there is to be a monopoly for the manufacture of gin to one firm, or any limitation on the number of people who may engage in the production and sale of gin, it should be done by straightforward legislation and not as an indirect consequence of the enactment of this Bill, or by amendment of this Bill.  So far as I was able to follow Senator Sweetman, the claim he put forward was not so much that there should be restriction upon the number of people who engage in the production of gin or limitation upon the quantity of gin they produce as that there should be safeguards against the possibility of Ceimící Teoranta subsidising one producer of gin to the detriment of others. I do not think that any Senator really apprehends that such a situation will arise.  The company will be under an obligation to carry on its activities so as to produce a profit.  If, under any circumstances, they appear to be selling a product at a price below its economic cost, that product at that price will be available to everybody who wants to purchase it and will not be the exclusive privilege of any one person or of a limited number of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> No protective duty is in operation so far as alcoholic liquors are concerned. In the past, distillers and brewers here sold their products in competition with all the products of the world.  It is most unlikely, having regard to the substantial export trade in alcoholic liquors which this country has enjoyed, and hopes to enjoy in the future, that the Government would at any time contemplate affording protection in the home market to home distillers and brewers.  If anybody, therefore, engages in the production and sale of gin here, he will know that he will have to produce and sell it in competition with the products of other countries.  So long as that situation continues, there would, obviously, be no point in imposing restrictions upon new firms entering the business or limiting the extent to which they might engage in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote from the Senator's amendment: &ldquo;Unless the Minister certifies that he is of opinion that such spirit is not distilled by private enterprise in sufficient quantity to meet the reasonable demand for such spirit.&rdquo; Let me turn to the question of the possibility of alcohol, produced by Ceimící Teoranta, being used for the adulteration of pot-still whiskey intended for export.  There is no law against blending alcohol with whiskey at the moment.  There is no restriction on the number of persons who may engage in whiskey distillation or in the business of whiskey blending.  It is necessary, also, to bear in mind that, unfortunately, our jurisdiction does not extend over the whole of our territory. There are distilleries outside our jurisdiction, in Irish territory, which are producing and selling throughout the world whiskey described as Irish whiskey&mdash;whiskey which I found not very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is true to say that to whatever extent the reputation abroad of Irish whiskey was impaired in recent years it was because of the activities of these distillers who are not subject to our control.  If there should arise at any time a case for the supervision of the export of whiskey as regards <Col N="720" /> quality, or age or anything else, it can be done.  I was quite prepared at one period to contemplate that every bottle of whiskey exported should bear a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners or from some other State authority to the effect that it was unblended spirit of a certain minimum age.  If arrangements or regulations or legislation of this character would be beneficial to the distillers in their efforts to develop export business, they can be discussed.</P>
    <P>These things, however, should be discussed as separate matters.  We cannot in this Bill prevent people from using industrial alcohol, either home produced or exported, for blending with Irish whiskey either inside Ireland or outside the country.  Following the end of prohibition in America a certain group got hold of an old Irish company called Jameson and Sons Ltd., which had ceased to produce whiskey but had not been formally wound up.  Having got the right of using that name they marketed a spirit which they described as &ldquo;Irish Type Whiskey&rdquo; but which contained only a small percentage of genuine Irish whiskey the balance being composed of immature rye spirit produced in the United States of America.  There was no means of stopping them.</P>
    <P>It may be that the distillers themselves could prevent substantial quantities of their spirit reaching the wrong people and it may be that there is a case for taking power to exercise some control over the export of spirit from this country but if there is such a case we will have to consider it separately.  We cannot do it as an indirect consequence of this measure. Let me make it quite clear that this company is not going to do anything that will damage either the reputation or the export business of Irish whiskey distillers.  I think the Irish distillers need no assurances on that point.  In so far as there are apprehensions that alcohol which may be sold for other purposes would be used to adulterate whiskey for sale abroad with grave risks to the reputation of pot-still whiskey, there is the assurance that the company will not facilitate business of that nature.  I repeat that if more positive safeguards are needed <Col N="721" /> against the possibility of Irish whiskey being diluted by the addition of industrial alcohol or against the possibility of damage to the reputation of Irish whiskey, they must be provided by some other legislation.  It is not reasonable to impose restrictions on this company that will not rest upon anyone else.  It is, I think, unreasonable to ask this company to restrict themselves in the production of industrial alcohol and to ensure that what they sell will only be used for purposes which they specify.  Persons using industrial alcohol for any other purpose can get it elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>But no one else in this State is getting these facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind Senator Baxter and Senator Sweetman that there has not been and there is not going to be any protective duty in operation.  So far as persons in this country want to get gin, they could get all the gin they wanted from abroad if they wish.  I am speaking, of course, of normal times.  At the present time the production of whiskey and gin is restricted by the intervention of the Government in limiting the allocations of grain and fuel to the firms concerned. Anyone who wants to get industrial alcohol can get it anywhere else in the world where it is available. In the case of products other than industrial alcohol the company cannot engage in any new form of activity unless the procedure laid down is followed, that is, by a notice being issued to the Press and after examination of any objections that may be forthcoming as a result of that notice.  In regard to alcohol, the powers of the new company are neither extended nor restricted.  They are in existence since 1938.  The danger that any ill effects will follow for the Irish distillers as the result of the activities of this company is insignificant.  I do not think it is desirable to restrict the scope of their activities in regard to this commodity merely because of unfounded fears that in some way its activity in the future may have results which it had not in the past, results detrimental to the Irish distillers.  I am aware that there is some apprehension amongst the pot-still distillers as to the possible effect <Col N="722" /> on their business of the activities of the company.</P>
      <P>They have stated that they were not aware that the Industrial Alcohol Company had the powers, which gave rise to these apprehensions, since 1938. I can give them any assurance that they regard as necessary either on the point of utilisation of the products of this company in a manner which may destroy the reputation of their products or on the possibility of the products of this company being sold to new firms engaged in the production of gin or whiskey or any other beverage on terms which would give these new firms advantages over existing concerns.  I do not think it is right to write safeguards of that kind into legislation, which might deprive the company of a free scope of action in a field in which it is legitimately entitled to engage and in which we contemplated it would engage in 1938.  Senator Sweetman applies too much weight to the hopes I expressed that the alcohol produced by this company would be better and cheaper than that made anywhere else. If it is better and cheaper then it will be available to anybody.  I do not want to say anything that might suggest that I think we should limit the production of gin here in regard to the total quantity consumed or in regard to the number of firms engaged in its manufacture.</P>
      <P>It may be that there is a case for limiting the production of gin or the firms engaged in it.  That case has not been made to me, and if such a case is made to me I am quite prepared to consider it, and if the case is sufficiently strong to justify legislation, I will consider introducing that legislation. But it is desirable that that should be done by separate legislation; not by putting obligations on this company of seeing that the production of alcohol is limited in order to ensure that the supply of gin does not exceed the demand for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that most of the Minister's case would be perfectly justified if he was arguing on behalf of a privately-owned company. But in this case we are dealing with a company which is State controlled. I think I am correct in stating <Col N="723" /> that in 1938 it might conceivably become a privately-owned company by the Minister for Finance offering his shares to the public.  We are dealing here with an argument as to whether it is reasonable or proper to restrict a State-owned company so that it may not interfere with privately-owned companies.  The Minister stated that there was no change in the powers given to the company in 1938, that they are the same as given in this Bill.  I think that in the Industrial Alcohol Bill of 1938 the objects of the company were the manufacture and sale of industrial alcohol.  For some reason or other this is changed.  If it is not changed for the purposes of extending the powers I&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase in the original Act was interpreted as having the same significance as in this Bill. The memorandum of association of the company contained the phrase used in this Bill and no change has been made in its powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there has been considerable difficulties with certain cases which came before the courts and where companies found themselves restricted to their principal objects. I have not consulted a lawyer on this matter but I doubt very much if anything stated in the memorandum of association which is not a principal object, gives the company power.  That is a difficult problem but it does not immediately arise.  At any rate the Minister will agree that it is not unreasonable to assume that someone in authority thought it would be better for some reason to make the principal objects of the company include refining, and selling, industrial alcohol, and products and derivatives thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us assume, for the sake of argument, that there is no difference between the two.  I cannot follow the Minister that, because something was done in 1938 and no use was made of it, and it is discovered that use might be made of it in 1947, a Bill is before the Oireachtas to say that it should not be put into it.  There may be excellent reasons why it should not be put in, but the reason is not that it was not in the 1938 Act.  The main <Col N="724" /> object of Parliamentary discussion is to give an opportunity for making further amendment to legislation where that is considered necessary.</P>
    <P>On these grounds alone, I do not think a case has been made against the amendment.  I do not understand the Minister's references to monopoly.  Even if this amendment were accepted, I do not see how it would create a monopoly. There is no monopoly as far as gin is concerned.  There is nothing to prevent people who are not manufacturing gin at the moment from doing so except perhaps that they might have to go to the courts to get the general objects under which they are operating extended.  As far as I can see no question of a monopoly arises, and even if it did it is not, I suggest, the business of a State-owned company to come in to break the monopoly.  That would be very doubtful policy, a thing that could only be done by the Government after very careful consideration.  It certainly would not be a desirable thing, especially where you are dealing with intoxicating liquors.  That is not a matter in which we want to extend Socialist principles to any extent.  We have here a State-controlled company. It is likely to remain so.  The Minister, no doubt, by expressing his wishes could get them carried out by the directors in most cases, but I think he could not enforce them except over a period of time&mdash;the period over which he had failed to elect directors to carry out policy, subject to his wishes.  As well as I remember, this company, which was set up in 1938, is in the position of most other State-controlled companies in the sense that the directors are appointed to carry out the objects laid down, like a private company, except that they must have consultations with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Otherwise, they will not be re-elected.  It is, I think, perfectly reasonable to ask that provision should be made that this company cannot, without further legislation, itself sell for human consumption as a beverage any spirit distilled by it and shall use its best endeavours to prevent the sale by any other person for human consumption as a beverage of any spirit distilled by it unless the Minister certifies that he is of opinion that such spirit <Col N="725" /> is not distilled by private enterprise in sufficient quantity to meet the reasonable demand for such spirit.</P>
    <P>As far as the second part of the amendment is concerned, it is not at all clear how it can operate, but I think that the first part of it might very properly be inserted in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a word or two to say on the issues raised by the amendment and by the Minister himself in his reply to it.  The hardship which Senator Sweetman sees in the Bill and which I can see is this: you have this State enterprise and you have another privately-owned enterprise which, apparently, is producing gin and putting it on the market in adequate quantities for our internal consumption at the moment.  The fear of those engaged in that private enterprise is that powers are being made available to a State company to produce a product which, is the raw material for their private enterprise, and that these powers are going to be used not only for the production but for the sale of this product.  Senator Sweetman's view is that that is going to endanger a private undertaking. The Minister stresses the point that in so far as the company are going to engage in the sale, they are not going to do so in any way that will be unfair either to existing private enterprises or a possible new enterprise: that is to say, all private enterprises are going to be put in the position that they can buy this raw material from Ceimící Teoranta at the same price.  My point is that Ceimící Teoranta is the only State undertaking engaged in this sort of activity. It is getting opportunities in regard to capital facilities which are not being given to anybody else.  It is possible that Ceimící Teoranta will produce this raw material for the production of gin at a price less than the existing companies can do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To illustrate that point may I ask, who can compete, say, with the alcohol factory at Carrickmacross that can buy Cooley potatoes at £4 per ton?  The position is that the Cooley people cannot sell them to anybody else, and are not permitted to send them out of the area unless they are shipped by <Col N="726" /> sea from the country.  Since there is no other enterprise of that kind in the country then, obviously, nobody else can produce this spirit as the people in Carrickmacross ought to be able to do it.  I think I am right in assuming that the people in Cork who are producing the base for their gin from barley are not likely to be able to have the raw material at the same figure as the people in Carrickmacross will be able to provide it.  I have tried to listen impartially both to Senator Sweetman and the Minister, but in view of what I have said there does seem to be every reason for the fears expressed by the Senator. Even though the Minister gives the assurance that no firm or group of people are going to be placed at a disadvantage, I think that, as far as Ceimící Teoranta is concerned, the people in Cork are going to be placed at a disadvantage unless the Minister can convince me that that is not so.  I would like to have enlightenment on this matter.  At any rate, from what Senator Sweetman has said, and from what the Minister has said, the impression left on my mind is that this firm in Cork will be placed at a disadvantage.</P>

      <P>If it should happen&mdash;I do not think it will happen&mdash;that spirit equally good as the Cork firm are producing for themselves is produced by Ceimící Teoranta and is available to them at a lower price, will not that be an advantage to the Cork firm rather than a disadvantage?</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has intervened because that is the very question that struck me. Could we have some information as to what the output of the usable potable spirit from the alcohol factories is?  If a State-subsidised concern is going to be a danger to private enterprise, then I share the doubts and misgivings expressed by other members of the House, because I think we ought to cherish jealously the position of private enterprise which has not all the advantages that a State-subsidised concern would have.  On the other hand, I want to say that I was very much impressed by the Minister's statement and by the assurance that he gave, that certain of the dangers that have been envisaged <Col N="727" /> are more imaginary than real.  At the same time, of course, it has to be borne in mind that what we have to concern ourselves with is not what the Minister intends but what this Bill, when it is enacted, will permit.  If the Minister can reconcile these two conflicting viewpoints, then I think we should have no difficulty in disposing of the doubts that rightly exist.  There can be no doubt whatever that a State-subsidised concern, which has its funds guaranteed, is in a privileged position, as against the privately-owned concern. The latter should not have its position jeopardised by the State-controlled concern.  We have not been given a figure as to the volume of output of usable spirit that will be made available by this company, or whether its output can be readily absorbed by the gin manufacturers which we have at the moment.  I do not think anybody can have a grievance if State-subsidised concerns can provide the raw materials that are needed by other industrial concerns.</P>
      <P>I think this amendment has given rise to a very valuable discussion and has drawn forth from the Minister a very important statement as to what may be envisaged in further legislation.  We have every reason to be proud of the distillers that we have.  If it were true, as Senator Sweetman seems to suggest, that a danger existed for them so far as this Bill is concerned, it would be a very serious matter.  It would be very serious indeed if the high reputation which they have built up for their products were to be jeopardised in any way.  If the Minister envisages legislation whereby the Government can guarantee the quality, the age and all the rest of our future exports of Irish whiskey, then at least one good thing will have emerged from the amendment. If I thought that the Bill jeopardised private enterprise I would be as strongly in favour of the amendment as Senator Sweetman or those who have spoken in support of it.  I would like the Minister to tell me about the volume of output and whether it is not true that the existing gin factories have not to compete to-day against the import of unlimited quantities of raw material.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate with a great deal of interest.  I possess no technical knowledge of this matter myself.  I regard myself as an ordinary individual.  I might perhaps regard myself as a special juryman and nothing more.  As Senators will remember on a previous stage of the Bill I looked at this matter somewhat differently from Senator Sweetman, because I thought that he wanted to prevent the establishment of patent-still methods of distillation in this country.  I see now that he wants no such thing but rather that he wants to prevent the State prejudicing already established distilleries in the country.  The Minister says that there is no danger, and that anybody who wants alcohol as a raw material is free to get it wherever he can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said that the person wanting it can import it.  That, of course, would not apply now.  I take it that what the Minister meant was that it would apply in normal times and that a person could import the raw material in any way he liked and that there is going to be no restriction on such importation.  But when the Minister says if a concern can get it cheaper and better from this new company, why should it not do so, that is where I have some grave doubts.  My doubts are rather accountancy doubts.  This question of price in a Government concern can be twisted any way without, so to speak, cooking the accounts.  When you are making a number of products, it is highly difficult, even with the best intentions, to state the cost of any one of them.  I can see a great temptation on the part of a strong combination, the Government and a Government-controlled company, even with the approval of the auditors, to give a favourable price to any one component. I may develop the accounting aspect of this unduly, but there are capital charges involved in this failure of our industrial alcohol venture. Those capital charges, if allowed to remain, should be carried, at least in some portion, by the new product. Whether that will be so or not is a very dubitable question.  I can see every opportunity for the Government <Col N="729" /> and the company, if they wish to do so, to weight the scales in favour of the cheapest possible price for any product they want to push and get an auditor's certificate to that effect, even involving therein the minutiæ of the technique of costing.</P>
    <P>It is implicit in all Government enterprise that you do not have the factor of free enterprise, where the condition is that, if losses are made, they are felt very soon and before long must culminate in bankruptcy.  A Government concern can be kept going and has a very wide latitude in prices and can see its way to justify its fair prices.  I can see the Government making a very favourable price for alcohol so that everybody can get it at that price and thus prejudicing the position of concerns already established and doing their own distillation.  I would like the Minister to answer that point.</P>
    <P>If this alcohol is produced more cheaply than that of already established distilleries&mdash;I do not mean pot-still distilleries, as I gather that gin is not necessarily a pot-still product, and I assume gin can be the product of a patent still&mdash;is it not very likely that the spirit produced by this new company under a favourable system of Government costing might be cheaper than the gin produced by an established distiller and so prejudice existing interests?</P>

      <P>The arguments used by Senator Summerfield and endorsed to some extent by Senator Sir John Keane force me to intervene to ask, if State enterprise can cheapen the production of a product, whether those Senators, as exponents of private enterprise, are opposed to that cheapening?

      <P>I reckon that anything done by a Government is under much more public control and observation than anything done by a private company. Governments may try to emulate the activities of private enterprise when they hide their accounts, but <Col N="730" /> there is a method of accountancy in public affairs which stands much higher than any system of accountancy in private enterprise.  Therefore, the arguments used by those two Senators should not bear very much weight amongst people who regard the public good as the essential.</P>
      <P>I can quite understand Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Summerfield, and perhaps others, eulogising private enterprise, but it does not seem to me or to a great many of my fellow countrymen that private enterprise has done a great deal for the nation.  As its name suggests, it is something that exists for the private profit of the few, whereas State enterprise stands for the good of the many, of all, not leaving out even the few.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will not agree to this amendment, which lays such emphasis on private enterprise.</P>
      <P>If the public good is guaranteed or improved by State enterprise, then we as public representatives&mdash;no matter what we may think in our private capacity&mdash;have no option but to support State enterprise.  For that reason, I hope this amendment will not receive the blessing of the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter tried to insinuate that some injustice was being done to the people of Cooley by their potatoes being bought by Ceimící Teoranta.  I understand that the type of potato grown there is green and small and useful only for consumption by this company.  Such potatoes could not be sold otherwise, so it is a great advantage to have a company like this purchasing them.  The Senator said they were selling at £4 a ton.  I understand that an acre will grow 20 tons, so they are getting at least £80 per acre.  Therefore, no injustice is being done to the people of Cooley.  On the contrary it is a great advantage to them to have Ceimící Teoranta in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This company has been formed for the manufacture of industrial alcohol. There may be derivatives in the form of gin, poteen or whiskey.  If there are, and if this amendment is carried, what is to be done with them?  Are they to be thrown into the sewers as waste and be an additional expense on the company, as they cannot be sold or <Col N="731" /> consumed?  If it is discovered that good whiskey or gin can be manufactured from this type of potato, why should not the experiments continue?  There is nothing to prevent other manufacturers of whiskey or gin adopting the same idea and buying that class of potato for that purpose.  I dare say that, if the product is not a good one, its sale will not be allowed.  If it is good, why should it not be sold instead of being thrown away?</P>
    <P>The amendment is an extraordinary one and contains an absolute prohibition. It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... the company shall not itself sell for human consumption as a beverage any spirit distilled by it and shall use its best endeavours to prevent the sale by any other person for human consumption as a beverage of any spirit distilled by it unless the Minister certifies ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know how you can put into an Act that the company &ldquo;shall use its best endeavours&rdquo;.  You may say &ldquo;shall prevent and shall have power to prosecute&rdquo;, but &ldquo;best endeavours&rdquo; would be something very difficult to carry out.  Would there have to be a mandamus against the company to use its best endeavours?  Whom would you sue&mdash;the managing director, the secretary or someone else?</P>

      <P>I know, but if we pass this it will be in an Act and would be different from anything I have seen before.  I am opposed to it, as it would be unworkable.  If the Senator had put in an amendment that this spirit could be sold only to a manufacturer, I would have a great deal of sympathy with it. The Minister has spoken as if he intended that the sale would be to the manufacturer only and I think that would be the case.  The company could not sell by retail, as any application <Col N="732" /> they would make for a retail intoxicating liquor licence would get very little sympathy in court.  It may be suggested they would sell to a wholesaler. Before that could be done, I think they would have to put it into bond and pay duty on it, so it would not be of any great advantage to them.</P>
      <P>Apart from the clause which makes it unworkable, the amendment would limit the powers of the company in a way they should not be limited.  There is a lot in what Senator Kyle has said, that if the company can turn out a cheaper product for the good of the citizen, why should the citizen not benefit by that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Kyle into a discussion on State enterprise versus private enterprise.  We can leave that to another occasion.  If any product were produced under State enterprise more cheaply and proved to be a better article, on the same basis of costing, there would be a case for the ideas underlying Senator Kyle's remarks.  I am not at all satisfied that it is going to be a genuinely cheaper basis.  The basis of any costing depends on the amount you take in for your overheads. In a State enterprise, costings in regard to overheads can be dealt with in an entirely different way from those in relation to a private enterprise.  If Senator Kyle went further down that avenue, he would find that the difference between his view and mine would be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took the line that this was an effort in an indirect way to create a monopoly.  It is nothing of the sort.  It is neither a direct nor an indirect effort to create a monopoly. The Minister further suggested that it was an indirect endeavour to provide that there would be legal standards for whiskey.  In the Minister's view, and in my view, that would be much more appropriate to a special enactment for that purpose.  I am in entire agreement with the Minister that to endeavour to provide standards for whiskey, either for export or for home consumption, by means of a side kick on this Bill, would be entirely undesirable. There is a great deal of difference between discussing whether a <Col N="733" /> thing is a monopoly or not and utilising the argument that, where there is an existing enterprise, the State should not step in beside that enterprise.  The Minister cannot contend, at the same time, that this is a State enterprise and that it is a private enterprise.  I do not propose to introduce my favourite hobby-horse of Private State companies on this Bill but this is either a private company or a State company. If it is a State company, then, to suggest that, because you ask it not to enter into competition with an existing enterprise, you ask for a monopoly, is not a valid argument.  Even if Ceimácí Teoranta was not established to carry out this industrial alcohol distillation, anybody could enter into the manufacture of gin at the present time, just as the Cork company has gone into it. I believe that it would be perfectly right that any private individual should be entitled to do in the State what another private individual is entitled to do.  But what we are doing here is providing that what has been done by a private enterprise should be done by the State, through a State company, in competition with that private enterprise. To say that the State should not enter into competition with an individual is very different from saying that a monopoly should be granted.  I do not believe that a monopoly should be granted but I do believe that the State should not complete with private enterprise.  In that I differ from Senator Kyle.  It is well that the difference should be fairly stated, as it has been stated by Senator Kyle.</P>
    <P>I always believed that my view on this matter was the Minister's view until this Bill came before us.  I must have misunderstood the Minister.  Apparently, it is the Minister's view that there should be competition by State enterprise with private enterprise.  I hope I have misunderstood him.  If I have, I shall very willingly withdraw what I have said, because I should be delighted to hear that he holds the same view as I do.  As regards the Minister's view on pot-still distillation, the Minister will understand that it is difficult, without seeing it in writing, to follow the wording of his assurance. It did appear to me to cover some of the dangers I had in mind and, in so <Col N="734" /> far as it did, I should like to express my appreciation of it.  However, I am afraid the Minister has not gone sufficiently far to cover the danger I see of an existing firm being put out of business, at any rate to an extent, by a State company, particulary in regard to the manufacture of gin.  I do not accept, and I did not think that the Minister accepted, that it is unreasonable to ask a State company not to do a thing that a private company could do.  I always understood that the Minister accepted that there were certain limitations on what should be done by State companies.  One of these limitations was in respect of competition with a private enterprise that was producing a good article at a reasonable price.</P>
    <P>I hope&mdash;I appreciate that the Minister cannot very well admit the case here &mdash;that the Minister, in his directions to the directors of the company, will tell them that they are to have regard to the fact that it would be undesirable in the extreme that anything this company would do would jeopardise an existing industry&mdash;an industry which has proved, particularly in recent years, that it was able to satisfy the demand that existed.  I hope that those will be his instructions to the directors because, if they are not, I can foresee very grave difficulties in the future, dangers which, whether or not the Minister or I be here, will be raised in the Oireachtas from time to time as they become facts.  I believe quite candidly that the Minister had not these things in mind when he committed himself publicly.</P>
    <P>The reason they were not in his mind was that the definition of &ldquo;industrial alcohol&rdquo;, which is a statutory definition, to be found in the 1938 Act, is not the definition operative in the trade.  In the trade, potable spirit, in the beverage sense, is not industrial alcohol.  In the statutory definition, it is.  It is difference in definitions which has caused this matter to be presented in the way it was and which prevented the Minister from having before him at the time he committed himself all the information which would enable him to make up his mind.  He has that information now, and I hope it will be incorporated <Col N="735" /> by him in his direction to the directors when laying down the policy he proposes the company should carry out.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment, confronted as I am by the Government Party and having at my back Senator Kyle, I realise that I am merely battering my head against a wall in endeavouring to get the House to accept my proposal.  As a result of the Minister's direction to the company, I hope that this Cork company, which has been producing, within 3 per cent. The total demand in the normal prewar period, will be entitled to carry on its lawful endeavours as it has been doing since 1937, that it will be able to build up the enterprise as it is anxious to do as soon as controls are removed and that it will be able to meet and successfully beat competition from the brands of this product longer established and imported into the country in the quantities and by the methods I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 9, Section 8, to add at the end of sub-section (4) the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;In the exercise of the powers given by this section the Minister shall have regard to the desirability of making available at all times the chemical raw materials of agricultural and industrial production at prices which compare favourably with the prices at which similar chemical raw materials could be imported.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is a very modified version of an amendment which I brought in on the Committee Stage, which received considerable criticism, constructive and otherwise, from various sides of the House.  I was very much impressed by these criticisms and I decided that my amendment, in its original form, went much too far.  Consequently, I introduce it now in this modified form.  The object of this amendment is to secure two things, so far as we can secure them by our own action within our own frontiers&mdash; namely, that chemical materials which <Col N="736" /> are raw materials for agricultural or industrial production shall, so far as possible, be available at all times and, in the second place, that the price at which they will be available shall compare favourably with the price at which such materials can be obtained from external sources.  To &ldquo;compare favourably&rdquo; does not necessarily mean that the price shall be indentical, but it does mean that it should not exceed by a very wide margin the price at which similar materials can be obtained from abroad.  It is left entirely to the discretion of the Minister to decide whether or not the margin is too wide.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister realises as well as I do that, so far as agriculture is concerned, it is necessary that chemical manures be available at a convenient price at all times.  Obviously, there is no use in having chemical raw materials physically available unless the price is such as will enable the farmers generally to use them in adequate amounts.</P>
    <P>If the price were prohibitive, they might to be physically available and yet not used at all.  The two points are: availability and suitability of the price.  It is very important that these chemical raw materials of agriculture should be available and should be used in adequate quantities during the next few years.  To illustrate that importance, I should like to compare quite briefly the history of our agriculture and the history of British agriculture in the past few years.  If Senators will turn to page 37 of our National Income and Expenditure White Paper, they will find that between 1938 and 1944&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely illustrating my point.  I propose to argue that the question is entirely one of the availability of chemical manures.  We did not have them during the war and the British had. Our net agricultural output increased by 5 per cent. during the war years and the British net agricultural output increased by 70 per cent.  Having <Col N="737" /> regard to the difficulties we suffered during that time, the fact that we did maintain the volume of our agricultural output was very creditable to the farmers.  My contention is that if chemical manures had been available in adequate quantities, as they were available to our neighbours, our net output would have increased very much or our present volume could have been obtained at very much lower cost to the consumer than the price the farmer is now receiving and the consumer is now paying.</P>
      <P>So far as manpower was concerned we had six persons to every 100 acres in this country: they had three in Britain.  So far as machinery was concerned they had the machines but the great factor which explains their achievement and our failure to add to the volume of agricultural output was that chemical manures were available to them and we had not got them. We hope that a period like the recent emergency will not occur again but nevertheless we have learned that it is highly desirable that these chemical raw materials should be available and available at the right price, here at home.  We are already producing phosphates from imported rock but if we can produce a substantial amount of sulphate of ammonia from our own resources, all to the good.  I gather that gypsum which is available in considerable quantities in different parts of the country is a raw materials for sulphate of ammonia, but I suspect that other ingredients are necessary.  How is the nitrogen element to be provided and to what extend will it to be necessary to rely on imported fuel for manufacturing purposes?  These are technical points upon which I would like enlightement by the Minister.  In the meanwhile, I prefer to have an open mind on the question.  I would like to emphasise the great importance of laying down as the guiding principle of the Act the points enumerated in the amendment and I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>Certainly; I think it would look foolish.  There is no use discussing this amendment on the issue whether Irish agriculturists should have more fertilisers or cheaper fertilisers.  Senator Johnston is an economist.  If in addition to being an economist he had applied his commonsense to the interpretation of the statistics which he has quoted, he might have come to the conclusion that a much bigger increase in the volume of agricultural production in Britain than here was due to the fact that they were fighting a war in which their food supplies were threatened and in which they had to increase production or surrender.  We were not in the same position.  We always had a sufficiency of food here.  He might have added the fact too, that their production before the war was such an insignificant production of their needs that room for expansion existed.</P>

Rightly or wrongly they have been put in so that the Minister is not on very strong lines in saying that there is any great innovation in this.  I gather that the Minister has taken the line which I expected he would take.  He has more or less given an undertaking that he will do what we ask.  He says: &ldquo;Do not put it in the Bill and I will give the House and undertaking that in exercising the powers given to me I will have regard to the desirability of making available at all times the chemical raw materials of agricultural and industrial production at prices which compare favourably with the prices at which similar chemical raw materials could be imported.&rdquo; If the Minister gives this undertaking it will meet the case.  The agricultural community or at least certain members of it are just a little bit apprehensive lest their interests should be sacrificed to the interests of the manufacturing industry and also perhaps a little apprehensive that their interests might be sacrificed to this company which is State sponsored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend repeating what I stated earlier in connection with the difficulties of State companies.  I refrain from saying that this is merely a case of bolstering an old company which has not been very successful, but it is a case of a State company which has not fulfilled early expectations in certain lines, and it is possible to inject fresh life and financial blood <Col N="740" /> into it by slightly altering its objects. Hence this rather critical apprehension which exists amongst the agricultural community.  If the Minister gives an undertaking that he will have regard to the matters mentioned in the amendment he will probably satisfy those who are apprehensive and also the mover of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I know how embarrassing members of the House are when they propose, like Senator Johnston, to put certain facts before Senators. The position of farmers in regard to this scheme is that we are considerably apprehensive about the consequences of the operation of this measure.  One has only to read what the Minister has said.  I think this has a vital bearing on the case which Senator Johnston has made.  The Minister said on the last day we discussed this here: &ldquo;We must have as our aim the supply of agricultural fertilisers to farmers at prices which will not put them at a competitive disadvantage with farmers elsewhere.  It may not be possible to do that from the first day on which the wheels of the new concern will start to move, or it may not be possible to do that on occasion when fluctuating economic conditions impose difficulties or give advantages elsewhere; but if, over a reasonable period of time, it succeeds in doing that then it passes the test of efficiency which, I think, we should apply to it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is this. It may not be possible to do that from the first day on which the wheels of the new concern start to move but there is not period when it is more important that farmers should have the raw materials cheap than at the particular period when the first supplies will be <Col N="741" /> coming from this industry.  The Minister has not indicated how long in his view it may taken until we have supplies from the new industry here but I suppose we will have them in a couple of years.  There is a possibility of another depression similar to that experienced after the last war.  There are justifiable fears for this again happening but if we are going to be faced with the position where we will have to buy sulphate of ammonia at higher prices than at which the Dances, Australians, or New Zealanders can buy it, we will not be able to complete against them.  We will have reached the stage, we hope, in a few years when certain branches of our industry will have got back to the position of having an exportable surplus of butter and bacon but if the farmers in Denmark and New Zealand can purchase sulphate of ammonia at even £1 a ton less than we can in this country, we will not be able to meet them and if we export, the return to the farmers here will be reduced to the extent that our raw materials are higher than the raw materials of our competitors. Farmers cannot be expected to produce food for export, which is necessary to secure the raw materials for Senator Summerfield, Senator Clerkin and other industrialists, if they cannot compete and those raw materials can only be paid for by the exportable surplus of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I regard it as nationally essential that we should be provided with this industry.  If, however, that is done I do not think the burden of substaining the industry in its early years should be put absolutely on the shoulders of the farmers.  It should be regarded as a national enterprise.  If the burden of carrying it is heavier on our farmers than if they were to secure the equivalent material from outside, then I think the burden should be shared by the rest of the community with them.  I put it to the Minister that he should in the early years, when this industry is trying to find its feet, ensure that the raw material from it will be available to our farmers at the same price as that at which the foreigner can supply it.  If that is not done our farmers are going to be considerably handicapped, and to the <Col N="742" /> extend to which they are the nation will be retarted in its progress.</P>

      <P>This amendment afforded an opportunity of drawing attention to one of the principal factors in high prices and in any hope of bringing about a reduction in prices.  We had an interesting debate here last week on prices.  I did not take part in it because the Minister had so eloquently set out so many facts which I well knew to be facts, and with the interpretation of which I thoroughly agreed.  Because of that I did not see the necessity of making any contribution to the debate.  I thought that the Minister made a very good case when dealing with a very difficult situation.  The root of the matter is that we are suffering from a scarcity of supplies, ultimately due to a lack of domestic output and a lack of imports.  The only hope of reducing prices and of improving the cost-of-living figure in the near future is more production and still more production. The only hope of doing that, so far as the agricultural community is concerned, is by the liberal use of artificial manures of which our agriculture has been starved in the last seven years and, to some extend, during the last 15 years.  May I illustrate that point?  I am aware of a farm of some 20 acres of usable land down in Tipperary.</P>
      <P>The gross output from the 20 acres of this land last year was about £220 in value, including the value of the produce consumed in the household, which represented about half that total. That farm has been starved of phosphates for decades.  I am quite convinced, from my knowledge of it and of all the circumstances, that if we could have got adequate supplies of phosphates for it, it would be easily possible to raise the output on the farm to at least £300.  That farm is typical of thousands of other farms up and down the country, and the reason why our agriculture output is only what it is is precisely because of this deficiency of chemical manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mainly in order to emphasise the frightful importance of that fact, and the importance of getting back again to the use of adequate quantities <Col N="743" /> of chemical manures in all of our agricultural operations, that I introduced this amendment.  When speaking on another occasion, I calculated that our phosphate starvation has amounted to as much as 2,000,000 tons over the last 15 years as compared with the standard application of phosphates during the period of 1929 and 1930.  Therefore I suggest it should be public policy to endeavour, as rapidly as possible, to secure at a favourable price the application of adequate amounts of chemical manures of the right kinds&mdash;there are three kinds involved&mdash;nitrogenous, potassic, and phosphatic.  I am quite prepared to believe that the Minister realised the importance of these matters, and realises them still more than he did ten or 15 years ago when he restricted the import of phosphates from Belgium in 1932 and 1933.  At that time he had undoubtedly regard to the desirability of preserving the availability of the supplies of phosphates from our own factories, but he had not perhaps adequate regard to the desirability of doing so at a price which would induce our farmers to apply an adequate amount of those phosphates to the land.</P>
    <P>The application of phosphates certainly suffered very considerably in the subsequently years.  I am quite willing to believe that the Minister now fully realises the importance of these matters, and that he has learnt something in the last 15 years just as all of us have learnt something.  On that understanding, I am quite prepared to accept his assurance that he will, as a matter of course, act in the spirit of the amendment, even though he has certain sentimental objections to writing it into the terms of the Bill.</P>

On reflection, I realise that these were words which should not have been used by me or by any responsible Senator.  The interpretation which the Senator put on them was quite in accordance with the words used, but not the meaning that I had when I used them.  I hope that the Senator and the House will accept my explanation.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill passes I should like to say a few words arising out of Senator Sweetman's statements so as to avoid misunderstanding. I want to say that there is no intention that this company will manufacture whiskey or gin.  With regard to liquers, like Benedictine and Chartreuse and other similar products which are based on industrial alcohol, I hope that if they are manufactured in this country they will be manufactured by private concerns.  I would regard it as desirable that this company would not engage in their production if private firms can be interested, and I certainly would contemplate approving of their doing so only if it were clear that private enterprise was not likely to engage in that business in any reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to give an assurance that the company will not knowingly sell industrial alcohol for the purpose of allowing it to be used in the adulteration of Irish whiskey.  It is clear that the law at present permits any person, by way of trade, mixing alcohol with whiskey.  The mere fact that industrial alcohol will be produced within the country will not add to the opportunities of doing so.  If there is a case for exercising control over the production of whiskey to prevent such adulteration, or over the export of whiskey so as to prevent the <Col N="745" /> sale of inferior products abroad interfearing with the main prospects of our distilleries developing an export trade, then it can be considered.</P>
    <P>I would also like to say that, so far as the company in Cork producing gin is concerned, I am an admirere of that concern.  I have publicly and privately expressed my appreciation of their enterprise both in that branch of their business and in others, and I sincerely hope that their trade in gin will proposer, and that they will earn from it profits high enough to cause perturbation to those who are constantly critical of the capacity of Irish industrialists in that respect, so long as those profits are earned in a free market and on the quality of their products. The board of Ceimácí Teoranta will be concerned to see that nothing which that company may do will in any way prejudice the success of that firm's gin manufacturing enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter which I may mention for the purpose of clarity.  In connection with sulphate of ammonia, even if the legislation were passed and the debates which such legislation would give rise to had concluded and the company may do will in authority and the financial resources to engage in the production of sulphate of ammonia to-day, it would, I think, be several years before the plant could be constructed and certainly before it could be supplied with the electricity and other materials it would require. Therefore, there is little prospect that the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here will be begun in the very near future, or that our present deficiency of sulphate of ammonia will be made good by our own production in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read as Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is another attempt to obtain common justice for farmers whose land may be compulsorily acquired by the Land Commission. The Bill requires very little explanation. <Col N="746" /> It sets out in plain language what it purposes to do and it contains so bone for the lawyers&mdash; which must be pleasing to Senator Ó Buachalla.  It does not in any way restrict the activities of the Land Commission.  It does not propose that allottees or congests should pay more for the new holdings they may get.  On the other hand, it very definitely implies that any land compulsorily acquired by the Land Commission should be paid for at the market value and it sets out a simple formula to show how the market value can be ascertained.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the Land Commission going into competition to bid for land.  If this Bill is adopted, the procedure will be that the Land Commission, on deciding to acquire a holding, will furnish to the inspector all particulars relating to that holding, such as annuities, valuation and other relevant details.  The inspector would then examine the land and, like any prospective buyer, decide what the farm was worth.  He would also take into consideration what it would make if sold at a public auction in a free sale and would also consider if there had been any land sold at that particular time in the same locality.  Of course, this implies that the difference between the price paid to the owner and the price charged to the congest or allottee would be made up out of public funds. I want to lay particular emphasis on that, to show the Minister that there is no game to be given away.  He seemed to think we were hiding something in the discussion on Senator Sweetman's Bill.  The difference is to be made up out of public funds.  All other responsibilities will still rest with the Land Commission.  I am confident that, if this Bill becomes an Act, the Land Commission will carry out its provisions justly and impartially, as they are at present carrying out the provisions of the 1939 Act, which gives the market value to the owners of resumed holdings.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman very clearly explained the difference between resumed and acquired holdings, but there seems to be still some confusion about the terms, and I would like to give my <Col N="747" /> explanation of them.  A resumed holding is one that was never vested in the owner under any of the Land Acts.  It is a holding which was vested in the Land Commission under the 1923 Act and was not revested in the tenant, who still pays interest in lieu of rent to the Land Commission but who has got all or practically all the reductions just the same as a vested owner.  It is a holding definitely retained by the Land Commission for the purpose of distribution.</P>
    <P>As the owners of resumed holdings are guaranteed the market value under the 1939 Act, we need not be much concerned about them.  What this Bill deals with are acquired holdings.  That means, almost exclusively, holdings of tenant farmers who, themselves or their predecessors, paid rent to landlords and are now paying annuities to the Land Commission and whose land is vested in them.  I should like to hear from the Minister the reason why the owners of resumed holdings are paid market value and the owners of acquired holdings must take a price fair to the Land Commission.  Of course, I have no objection to the owners of resumed holdings being paid market value.  It is only just and right they should be so paid.  I may say that it was under an amendment of mine to the 1939 Act that that was done. That amendment was very vigorously supported by Senators Quirke, O'Callaghan, McCabe and O'Dwyer of the Government Party when the Land Act of 1933 was passing through Committee Stage.  The Minister's predecessor, Mr. Boland, accepted the principle of that amendment and asked me to withdraw it on a promise to bring in an amendment on Report Stage to meet the position.  His amendment was very much better than mine, as it gave greater security.  Not only did it guarantee market value but it gave compensation for disturbance and it provided that a resumed holding could not be taken except for the relief of congestion in the immediate neighbourhood. I believed, and I am sure the majority of Senators at that time believed, that we were getting market value for any land acquired or resumed or taken in any way by the Land Commission. <Col N="748" /> That was not so.  It is difficult to understand why the difference was made.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, when discussing the 1944 Land Bill, introduced by Senator Sweetman, that if Senator Baxter could define for him how the Land Commission could obtain land at what was really market value, he would do business.  This Bill explains how the market value can be ascertained and, though the formula is not completely satisfactory, to the owners of land, it should, certainly, be satisfactory to the Minister, as it leaves the Land Commission judge, jury and executioner in the case.  If it is accepted, I believe it will create more confidence and give more security to the owners of land which may be compulsorily acquired and to the 300,000 farmers&mdash;the people who, Senator Ó Buachalla says, have the monopoly of the land&mdash;who have been deprived of fixity of tenure and of the right of free sale by the 1923 Land Act and subsequent Acts.  I believe it, also by implication, repeals the clause of the 1923 Land Act which says that the price of land payable by the Land Commission shall be a price fair to the owner and fair to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel sure that no injustice will be deliberately done to any citizen of this State by the activities of the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Injustices have been done and the Land Commission will admit that they cannot do anything else.  They are a judicial body and are bound to carry out the provisions of the Land Acts. Until some of the clauses of the 1923 Act and subsequent Land Acts are repealed, they must obey the law as it stands.  I am sure that Seanad will agree that it is bad enough to have a man's land compulsorily acquired but it is against all natural justice and Christian ethics to take his property, deprive him of his means of livelihood and not pay him full compensation. That is also the belief of the Minister, according to his statement in the Seanad:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I take the view that, when a man <Col N="749" /> owns property, he should not be deprived of it without due payment and compensation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that statement represents the honest opinion of the Minister, let him put his views into the Bill.  Otherwise, they will not count with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister pay a just and well-deserved tribute to his predecessor, the late Mr. Paddy Hogan.  He praised him for his commonsense, his wisdom and the justice which he displayed when introducing the 1923 Land Act.  He based his justification on that.  I should much regret to say anything which would sully the name of the late Mr. Hogan, but he was not infalliable and he never pretended that he was.  Though I could point out the justification he had for inserting that clause, I then believed, and still believe, it was a mistake to have the words inserted, &ldquo;fair to the owner and fair to the Land Commission&rdquo;. I often discussed that point with the late Mr. Hogan.  The Minister said that he was a great psychologist, and I agree.  It was because he understood the farmers, particularly the farmers of the West, he put in that phrase.  But he never meant that that provision should apply except in the congested districts.  He often said to me that he did not want the farmers in the West from whom he was going to acquire land to go out of farming. He wanted them to continue, as they were the most suitable people for migration to Leinster and other parts of the country.  It was because he wanted then to accept farms and not go out of business, he put in that provision. I thought he was wrong and I opposed it.  I oppose it now and I ask the Minister to rectify that portion of the 1923 Act.  I feel, as the Minister does, that any man who owns property should not be deprived of it without adequate compensation.  I do not care who the owner is.  Let him be a descendant of one of Cromwell's soldiers, a descendant of Conn of the Hundred Battles, like Senator Sir John Keane, or somebody like myself, who is lineally descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages&mdash;let him be a descendant of one of these, or let him be <Col N="750" /> a descendant of Padraic OÁ Murchadha, pedigree unknown, if he has a legal title to property, he should be paid full compensation, if it is compulsorily taken from him by Government Order. I have purposely refrained from indulging in recrimination about the actions of the Land Commission.  I do not blame the Land Commission.  I blame the Government.  The Land Commission do not want to do injustice to anybody, but they can do nothing else while the Land Acts remain as they are.  They must obey thelaw.  It is for the Minister, if he believes what he says, and for him alone, to rectify the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Counihan suggested to me that I should second his motion and I am deeply grateful for the honour he has done me.  In a passing remark at the same times, he advised me not to say too much.  It was kind of him to warn me but, when I heard him going into questions of ethics and realised the high atmosphere in which he was moving when dealing with Niall of the Nine Hostages and other famous persons, I thought he was getting rather far from the subject matter of the lecture to which he treated me&mdash;to stick to the land, to keep to mother earth.  I am perfectly prepared to support this or any other measure which equalised the position and restores confidence and security, which have disappeared under a system by which two citizens who are owners of the land are liable to be dealt with in different ways.  Confidence and security will be restored when the State decrees that lands being acquired will be dealt with as those resumed.  If I were speaking for a month, I could not clarify the position more.  That is all I want&mdash;that lands being acquired be dealt with as lands that are resumed.  The land agitations of the past 60 years or more, initiated by Parnell, were, generally speaking, looked upon with a certain amount of pride.  Not long ago, Irish leaders were assembled in the West&mdash; the Taoiseach amongst others&mdash;to pay tribute to Parnell.  In the wildest days of land agitation, nothing that could be termed confiscation was advocated. The farmers of Ireland, backed by the Labourers, paid 20/- in the £every time. <Col N="751" /> That brought confidence and security. I was very much encouraged not long ago when I saw a Departmental scheme to multiply the number of veterinary surgeons in the country with a view to avoiding the loss&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;of 10 per cent. of our live stock.  And earlier on I saw a report by a member of the Agricultural Commission appointed by this Government which stated, I think the name of the individual concerned is Kennedy, that something like £300,000,000 is required to be invested in Irish land in order to equip it for the full production of which it is capable.  Again I speak subject to correction, but I believe that is what I read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land of Ireland is not being half worked, it is not giving 50 per cent. of the employment that it should and could and would give.  Can anyone expect a farmer and his labourers and his family to put into Irish land their whole souls and whole resources if it is possible to acquire land without paying the full market value for it?  What encouragement is there to cement the drains and the gateways and the lanes?  You have the cement, you have the sand, you have the workers.  I have never seen a farm that was perfect. I have never seen a farm that more money could not be invested in.  I have never seen a farm that could not give more employment, and I want to see so far as it lies in my power that every available shilling is put into agriculture.  Some people blame the Irish farmers and say that they are a lazy lot.  In most exalted company recently I heard it said that the output of the agricultural labourer was low, poor and small.  It is for the State to promote conditions so that the output will compare with the best. It is said that workers in factories can produce £100 worth of goods as against £10 or £12 worth produced by the agricultural labourer.  That is quite true, but the State can do much to uplift agriculture and give a firm footing to agriculture so long as it is within the province of the State to acquire land and pay the market value for it.  I remember once listening to an Irish Minister for Finance introducing his Budget and saying that there were no <Col N="752" /> vast fortunes to be got out of Irish land.  Well, no one wants a vast fortune. I am not in favour of the millionaires to come in here and pay £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000 for a house with 30 or 40 acres of land.  I am in favour of these men in the lanes and by-roads of the country who have ambitions for their children, ambitions to buy 20 or 30 acres of land for their children, but what encouragement do they get when the State will acquire that land possibly and pay a price for it that is below its market value?  I think it is deplorable that after 25 or 26 years of an Irish Christian State we have not the common justice of paying the market value for what the State acquires as well as resumes.</P>

      <P>When I read this not very voluminous Bill my mind went back to November, 1944, when this House was engaged in a debate on a Bill which was larger, so far as text is concerned, but which involved the identical point that is in this Bill.  I recalled that the Minister replied to me in a singularly attractive and delightful speech.  Going back over the Official Reports, I discovered a very unusual thing, that his speech was even more attractive and delightful than it appeared when I was listening to him.  It was not only full of wit but it had more than a fair share of humour and it was stuffed with literary allusions which were more attractive because they were partially concealed. But I discovered that the Minister never came within an ass's bray of meeting the one point at issue in the Bill.  It talked of shoes and shops and ships and sealing-wax and cabbages and kings, but never met the point that when a man is having his property taken from him he should get the market value.  The Minister is like a dog being taken out to set a badger and, having been shown the badger's den, goes into the bush and emerges a minute afterwards smiling and wagging his tail with a rabbit in his mouth.  It was a beautiful rabbit with great big ears and great long legs, a wonderful rabbit, in fact more like a hare.  And then again he goes into the bush on the other side and comes out with another rabbit, a more beautiful rabbit still, but he will not go near the <Col N="753" /> badger's den.  I want to ensure to-day, so far as I can, that the Minister will go into the den, and I want to take the Minister, metaphorically, so to speak, by the back of the neck and put him into the badger's den.  I want to make quite certain that the Minister will answer in this debate the point that I made on the occasion to which I refer. I am going to read, with the permission of the House, portions of what I said on that occasion.  I am quoting from column 582 of the Official Reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated then that there were three principles which were involved in the Bill before the House.  The first principle is this, that if a man owns property it should not be taken from him except for some very good reason.  The second is this, that State necessity or the requirements of social justice may in some circumstances produce a state of affairs in which it is necessary to take from a man his own property.  And I stated also that these principles were principles on which the whole of the House was agreed and were enshrined in a provision of the Constitution and that there was no reason for my wasting time on matters on which everyone in the House was in violent agreement.  Then I went on to deal with the third principle, that is, if you take from a man that which is his own in order to meet State necessity or to meet social justice, you must pay him a fair market price for it.  That is the only question on which there was a difference in the House and it is being brought more neatly before the House in this Bill. The Minister had spent his time dealing with points on which everyone was agreed and I hope he will deal now with this one point on which I think there can be no other opinion except that held by me.  That is a healthy atmosphere.  Dealing with the question of price on the last occasion, I quoted a number of decisions in England and Ireland and I quoted the following statement: &ldquo;Neither public safety nor defence of the realm requires that the Crown be relieved of its legal liability to pay for the property it takes from one of its subjects.&rdquo;  Another great judge said that &ldquo;The feeling that it is equitable that burdens borne for the good of the nation should be distributed <Col N="754" /> over the whole of the nation has grown to be a national sentiment.&rdquo;  It is more than a national sentiment: it is an elementary principle of social justice. I then quoted from our own Court of Appeal where it was said that &ldquo;In all legislation dealing with compulsory acquisition of land, the basis of compensation is the value of the property to the owner and not to the person acquiring it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is happening is this.  Leaving aside the question of resuming holdings, a technical point which need not worry the House because it is not in this Bill, land is acquired from the people for the interests of the State. We are agreed that it should be acquired if it is the social policy.  Now it may be necessary to acquire it but if the State wants to have it for the carrying out of its social policy it should pay for it and pay the price that the owner would be able to get for it if he were selling it in the open market.  This may be placing a blister on the inhabitants of the State, upon Deputies and Senators.  The money has got to be found and it has got to come from the public funds, that is, from you and me and everyone else. That is ordinary State policy.  You have got to raise money which is necessary for social objects from the people as a whole.  What is happening now?  The unfortunate individual or individuals who happen to be selected as persons from whom land is to be taken are given sums from a quarter to a half of its market value.  That is to say that this work is not being paid for by the State as a whole but by the individuals on whom the die has fallen and from whom the land is being taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on the last occasion, rather hesitated to accept literally the statement that I made, that in the case of the acquisition of land the experience of practitioners who appeared most often in the courts and who had been consulted by me was that the value that was given was from one quarter to a half of the market value, and that in certain cases, if you took into consideration the fact that the annuity was capitalised and <Col N="755" /> deducted from the purchase price, the position was actually this: that the money given to the man was less than what would have been the capitalised value of the annuity before the annuities were lowered.</P>
    <P>His position, if the annuities had not been lowered, would be this, that you took land from that man, and that instead of giving him money for it you had a charge against him, so that he would have to pay money as well as give the land.  That would be the position, because if you deducted the capitalised value of the unreduced annuity from the sum paid by the Land Commission it was really more than the sum paid.  That, of course, would be an extreme case, but it would certainly be no exaggeration to say that, taken by and large, the man who has land acquired from him other than in the case of a resumed holding will get less than half of what he could have got if he sold it in the market the day before.</P>
    <P>That is an affront to common justice. I say, take his land and give it to landless men, but compensate him on the market value and let the money paid be spread over the whole community, and not put it on the shoulders of those luckless people who happen to be selected to have their land taken from them.  That is the only point in this Bill.  Why should not the man from whom you are taking property get the market value for it that he could get the day before you acquire it, and why should not the money be made up by the community as a whole instead of mulcting that unfortunate man?  I hope the Minister will be able to develop some philosophic or economic theory to explain why you take a man's property and do not give him what it is worth, and why the people as a whole should not bear the burden of a policy which is for the people as a whole.</P>

      <P>Senator McGee, in the early part of his speech, exculpated himself lest he should make a long one, yet he spoke long enough.  Speaking from recollection, I think it was Gladstone who said that the Land Acts of Ireland would never have been passed &ldquo;but for the intensity of Fenianism&rdquo;. <Col N="756" /> One recalls the sufferings and self-sacrifice made by the Irish people for the winning of the three &ldquo;F's&rdquo;&mdash;fixity of tenure, free sale and a fair price. Since the advent of national government in this country one realises the terrible injustices that have been perpetrated against the tenant farmers by the arbitrary and excruciating action of the Land Commission.  Senator Kingsmill Moore, in his well-thoughtout and legally framed phrases, dealt with the injustice that is being committed against farmers by the compulsory acquisition of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before my mind a case that is the very antithesis of justice.  As a people we hold our heads very high as being the exemplars of a high standard of Christian justice and ethics. This particular case that I have in mind occurred in 1927 or 1929.  The farmer involved lived not far from me.  He was a progressive farmer and was an industrious man.  He gave very extensive employment, and was most helpful by giving the use of his machinery to neighbours.  To my knowledge he even went so far as to advance money to help to relieve the needy and the necessitous.  He was a big cattle dealer.  He had a couple of hundred acres of land, 75 per cent. of which was mountainy land, peaty and boggy.  He had adjoining him about 120 acres of a mountain, not 5 per cent. of which could be described as fertile or arable land.  This was a very highly intelligent farmer who appreciated his responsibilities to the State.  Before acquiring this adjoining land he wrote to the Land Comsion pointing out that it was in the market, and asked if the Land Commission had any interest in it by way of acquisition for subdivision amongst uneconomic holders or landless men.  The reply was that they had no interest in it and that he was free to buy or not buy it.  He ultimately bought it and worked it for a number of years.  He had a number of workmen employed on it.  He drained it and tried to make it reproductive, but if he were to be working on it until Doomsday neither he nor the people who subsequently got it from the Land Commission could ever <Col N="757" /> make it profitable.  As I have said, he employed a lot of labour on it.  He drained it, he tilled it and put up the necessary fences.  Five or six years later he got a notice from the Land Commission telling him that he was to surrender the land as they had decided to acquire it for subdivision amongst uneconomic holders.  He went into court and fought the case at great expense to himself.  He won the first round of the contest on the equities of his case but, as we know, individuals cannot fight a Government indefinitely. Subsequently the Land Commission beat him and compulsorily acquired the land.</P>
    <P>A case of that sort is disgusting; it is tragic and unjust.  The money that he received from the Land Commission was not at all comparable to the price that he had paid for the land.  Since cases of that sort have occurred in the country, it is surely a matter of grave and pressing urgency that a Bill such as this should be introduced by Senator Counihan so as to save tenant farmers from an unjust invasion of their rights on the part of the Land Commission.  If it is thought necessary, I can give the name of the man in the particular case I have referred to.  Senator McGee and I operate as auctioneers, and I am quite certain that he can bear testimony to this: that farmers with a vested interest in their holdings and anxious to make provision for their children come to us to get their places sold privately&mdash;at prices which are much under the market value.  When asked why they want to do that, they say that if their farms are offered publicly for sale the Land Commission will do what they did in the case of the West Limerick farmer &mdash;compulsorily acquire them and give a price that does not at all compare with the price which land is making in their localities.</P>
    <P>I had one case quite recently.  That is a bad atmosphere and there is a justifiable reason for it.  When there is a bad case of a dangerous disease, the whole community has a certain amount of fear.  On account of this one case, the whole atmosphere there was charged with the invading tyranny <Col N="758" /> of the Land Commission.  The man was unbeaten in two courts and finally beaten by the Land Commission, then his place was seized on an authoritative document from the Land Commission, although they did not want his place at all.  I have cited this case, as it is better than talking fantastically here for hours.  It justifies the Bill introduced by Senator Counihan.  I trust my words may have some influence on the Minister, for whom I have the highest regard, whose honesty and capacity have been in evidence for so long.  I am happy always when I see him&mdash;and that is not said in order to create any personal contact for any purpose.  He is a Minister who has a strong mind and who carries out his purpose.</P>

      <P>It is rather difficult to speak after Senator Madden as a rule.  From the present discussion and from that on various other occasions, we find approval of the Government policy and of that of the previous Government, in acquiring land for land division to relieve congestion.  That has been accepted by all the speakers this evening.  We in the West are particularly interested, as in our part of the country there are too many people on the land of the type they have.  It is our wish that the Land Commission should move more swiftly in acquiring and dividing land.  While we desire that to continue and while it is accepted as the policy of all Parties, it is not our wish that it should cause injustice to any person or any section of the people.  I feel that that is not the wish of the Government or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan has referred to concessions he received from the Minister in relation to the amendments he proposed on the last occasion we had a Land Bill before the House.  The main purpose of this Bill is to secure a market value for the land acquired. We have had many discussions as to how that market value can be brought about.  I do not believe that Senator Counihan's suggestion to-night is a practicable one.  If this Bill were accepted as it stands, it would entail many amendments to the Principal Act, so its acceptance by the House <Col N="759" /> now would be impracticable.  Knowing we are all sympathetic with the point of view that no injustice should be inflicted on any section of the community in any matter, I appeal to the Senator to withdraw his Bill, so that the Minister might have the matter considered with a view to having the Principal Act amended to meet the wishes of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems from the speech of the last speaker that we are getting on, though we are not quite clear as to the pace, which has been a snail's pace up to this.  Senator Counihan does not move like a whirlwind himself, but at least he has caused a stir in the dovecotes, judging by the approach made by Senator Hawkins, who can be intriguing and diplomatic when he wishes and who can adopt another attitude when it suits the occasion.  I do not know how far the Senator is representing the mind of the Minister and if we could have it more definitely and explicitly&mdash;I hope we will have it from the Minister &mdash;than it has been put by Senator Hawkins, that what has been embodied in the Bill will be policy henceforth, we would know where we stand.</P>
      <P>While we have been battling for these rights for tenant farmers for a long time, we have not been running our heads against a stone wall.  On the last occasion we had Swinburne's poems quoted so effectively against us that we made no inroads on the Minister as regards bringing him to do what we wanted done.  It is gratifying to hear Senator Hawkins' statement from the Government front bench, apparently agreeing with Senator Counihan that it is not the wish of the Government to inflict an injustice on anyone in possession of land.  Let this fact be remembered by Senator Hawkins and everyone else including the Minister, that grave injustices have been inflicted already and that they call for rectification. Cases were quoted on the last occasion to demonstrate clearly that the Land Commission&mdash;in accordance with law, no doubt&mdash;treated some tenant farmers in a fashion that was positively disgraceful and highly immoral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> In the world of to-day, when human rights and private property are being regarded as no longer a matter of any account, we as a people must be particularly careful.  If private property is to be taken over for State purposes, the State must be very careful to pay its value to the last farthing.  Cases have been cited here and have been brought to the Minister's notice outside, where grave injustices were inflicted. Senator Kingsmill Moore put the case admirably to-night.  There are no differences on any side of the House as to the social necessity for a wider distribution of land.  It is the social necessity and not the economic one that is important.  It has hardly ever been quoted in support of the policy of land distribution that it would increase production.  Looking back now, we realise that all the hedges, ditches and dykes on fine farms have reduced the area and in a variety of ways have made it impossible to carry out as economic production as was possible when the fields were larger.  It was not believed there would be increased yields.  If it be a social necessity to redistribute property, no one can justify an individual being made pay the price of that social readjustment. That is what we have been doing.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make it quite clear that this Bill is acceptable to him in principle.  If he does so, we will be getting on.  The total cost will be comparatively small.  I do not know the number of holdings that might be acquired or the total amount that would be needed to pay a market price to the owners, but I am convinced that the total sum involved would be only a bagatelle in our total annual expenditure. The policy of discrimination on the part of the State has had a very unsettling effect in agricultural circles, amongst those people with an area of land about the size that would be attractive to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is no need to argue on the equities of the case, but it is not clear when we will have recognised by the Government the point of view so frequently and so vigorously expressed, namely, that the Land Commission have not been dealing fairly with some of the tenant farmers.  How much <Col N="761" /> longer must we wait before the law will be amended to ensure that, when land is taken by the State for a social purpose, its true value will be given to the owner and that the State will set the example and show that, when they want property for the benefit of the community, they will pay its true price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Sweetman's Bill on the same lines as this was before us on the 22nd and 23rd November, 1944, there was a very full debate.  I spoke then and supported the Bill.  I read my speech this evening in the Official Reports and I am satisfied that I made a good speech then&mdash;though I am saying it myself.  I put forward all the arguments in support of this proposal.  I said I was not a representative of agricultural interests but a lawyer and believed in social justice.  It was from that point of view that I collected my arguments in support of the Bill, from the Constitution and from the provision made by the Lands Clauses Act, 1845, in connection with the granting of compensation for lands compulsorily acquired. I referred to the rights of the individual to hold property.  I believed then and I believe now that persons whose property is acquired compulsorily by the State should not be damnified or put at a loss in any way.  I said that the rights of persons to hold property, in other words, to the ownership of property, must be delimited by reason of the exigiencies of the State and for purposes of the common good.  I also stated that the persons from whom the land was acquired should not be made pay for the common good, that that was a liability of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our present position was created by Section 25 (2) of the Land Act of 1923, which provided that, in fixing the price, the Land Commission&mdash;and, on appeal, the judicial commissioner&mdash;should have regard to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and to the owner respectively.  At that time, what was called untenanted land was subject to the provisions of that section, but since then the definition of untenanted land has been extended and, as far as I know, land which has been in the <Col N="762" /> occupation of a family for hundreds of years and subject to a land-purchase annuity was deemed to be untenanted and to come within that Section 25 (2). That is a great hardship on a tenant farmer who may be a large holder of land.  He is paying an annuity to the Land Commission.  He may have a bank charge in addition or other burdens on the land but the price which is offered to him is so attenuated that, after he has discharged the redemption value of the land-purchase annuity in full and, perhaps, some small charge by the bank or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, he has practically nothing for himself.  He has lost his land and his living and he has received from the Land Commission far less than he would have received in the open market.  Out of the money awarded by the Land Commission, the land-purchase annuity and other charges must be redeemed.  It is extraordinary that the State, while paying to the tenant farmer perhaps half the market value of his land, takes good care to take to itself the full redemption value of the land-purchase annuity.  In making an allowance for the redemption value of the land-purchase annuity, it does not consider what is fair to the owner of the land whose land is being acquired and what is fair to the State.  It pays itself in full and the farmer has to take whatever is left, which may be very little. In Section 39 (5a) of the Land Act of 1939, it is provided that, in resumption cases, compensation shall be on a market value basis.  Comparisons are odious but it is very hard for the ordinary person to understand why land subject to a land-purchase annuity, which may have been in the occupation of a farmer and his family for hundreds of years, should be dealt with for the purpose of compensation under Section 25 (2) of the Land Act of 1923, while land which is being resumed is paid for on a market value basis.  The provisions in the 1939 Act, that lands resumed should be paid for on market value, have raised this whole question in an acute form.  The ordinary person cannot see why one type of holding should be paid for at market value and another at less than market value.  We all know that, no <Col N="763" /> matter how philanthropic people may be, if they supply milk for the poor, they get paid by the State; if they supply medicines to local authorities for the use of persons in hospital, they are paid on a contract basis.  Everybody in this country who contributes to the common good is paid except the farmer, whose lands are acquired at less than the market value.  That is not in accord with social justice.  I think that everybody in this House is agreed that the farmer should not be compelled to contribute to the common good out of his own pocket.  Unfortunately, this section has been in force for almost 24 years.  While a number of people have suffered injustice under its operation, it is never too late to mend.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan is most pertinacious where the interests of agriculturists are concerned.  He is a most excellent representative and, if I may say so, he is never asleep.  He is always vigilant in the interest of the farmers and, while his bringing this matter forward again, after it had been decided two years ago, might make some people jealous because of his activity on behalf of the farmers, it might irritate others who thought that the matter had been disposed of in November, 1944.  Senator Counihan is keeping this a live issue and I think he has made progress since 1944.  I am sure that greater progress will be made when the Government consider this question in connection with the forthcoming Land Bill.  I do not know when that will be, but I think that a Land Bill in the future is almost as certain as anything can be.  Since 1923 we have had a series of Land Bills and nobody can say that the 1939 Act is the last that will be passed.  We had Land Acts in 1923, 1927, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1936 and 1939 and I believe that another Land Act is now due.  I think that this question will be brought forward by the Government in its next Land Bill.  There is no use in running the head of the Seanad against the Government wall.  Unless the Government is prepared to support Senator Counihan's Bill it will never get beyond the stage of talk.  I suggest to <Col N="764" /> Senator Counihan that, having heard the discussion, including the contribution from Senator Hawkins, he should withdraw the Bill.  I supported him in 1944 and I should be prepared to support him still, but I think that his purpose in bringing forward this matter in the form of a Bill was to give it greater importance than it would achieve as a mere motion.  Motions are, evidently, forgotten, while Bills are landmarks.</P>

I think that it is a matter of social justice that no person should be deprived of his property for the benefit of the community except at the price which he would obtain for it if he disposed of it freely in the open market.  In other words, the farmer should be entitled to get market value for his land, as other people are entitled to get market value for their commodities, whatever they may be.</P>

      <P>I must confess that I approach this matter in a certain spirit of irony.  If I were a vindictive person, I should be inclined to say to those who are supporting this measure, &ldquo;Serve you right&rdquo;.  Twenty-three years ago, in the early days of the Seanad, this very issue was argued. Although there are only four Senators who were then members of the Chamber, this House should know, to the shame of its predecessor, that only two members voted for what there now appears to be general agreement about. Those two members were Senator Counihan and your humble servant.  Of course, it was different then.  The tenant farmers did not see the red light.  It was only the landlord who was concerned then and taking his land on unfair terms did not matter.  The microbe of dishonesty is very hard to eradicate from the body politic and that microbe is there to-day.  It will <Col N="765" /> be difficult for any Government, who adheres to the policy, to live down the acts of their predecessors with regard to taking land compulsorily below its market value for political reasons.  I have read, word for word, the speech I made on that occasion 23 years ago.  I shall not worry the House by reading it but I am able to stand by the same speech and get the support of Senator Madden, Senator McGee, Senator Ryan and others.  I cannot help asking myself if I would have had their support 23 years ago.</P>

      <P>All members are agreed on the point that land acquired should be paid for according to full market value.  That is only right and fair.  But I feel that it is very hard to determine the market value of land at the moment especially in view of the fact that a farmer whose land was being acquired could not very well test the value of it in the open market because prospective purchasers might feel that it would be acquired from them by the Government and that they would suffer the same fate too.  That is a difficulty.  No one would buy a farm of land or a big property that was liable to be acquired.  They would be running a risk.  Such a person of course would be prepared to give the full market value if there was a guarantee from the Government that he would get the same terms as for a resumed holding.  There is another point.  I agree with what has been said here earlier this evening that there is no encouragement for a man to carry out improvement work when there is the fear that he would not be compensated for it in the event of the Land Commission acquiring his property.  That is a grievance that will exist so long as the present position remains.  I hope the Minister and the Government as a whole will give full consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>When this matter was last before the House in the form of a notice of motion, I supported Senator Counihan and I have great pleasure in supporting this Bill to-day.  I feel that it only proposes to give to the owners of land the same rights as the owners of other property have at the present time&mdash;rights which no Government has attempted to take from them.  There has been a question raised as to the difficulty of assessing market value.  I think that Senator Counihan has been perfectly fair in his suggestion as to how this might be done.  He brings in an inspector of the Land Commission to assist in the valuation.  At the present time there is a housing shortage, and luckily some people have houses to rent and sell.  Some time <Col N="767" /> ago when dealing with the Rent Restrictions Bill the Minister would not consider putting restrictions in the matter of rents lest it might retard the building of new houses.  Quite a number of people are living in congested holdings from which they are not getting a living.  They exported their families when they grew up, and with the earnings of these families in distant lands they were able to keep the homestead together.  If the Government would not do anything to discourage building in order to relieve the housing shortage, I do not see how it can stand over anything that would prevent land from being used to relieve congestion or how they defend compensation for acquired land at less than the market value.  Some time ago I was made aware of a case in my own country of a widow whose family moved into the town, and because she was not able to work the small holding, she desired to sell it, but she was refused permission on the plea that the land was needed to relieve congestion in the district.  I was subsequently informed that there was only one person wanting the land and, of course, he wanted it at less than market value.  There would be no objection to his purchasing it in the open market, but he was anxious that the Land Commission would acquire it and he hoped to get it at the Land Commission price.  Senator McGee mentioned a statement by Dr. Kennedy that it would be necessary to invest £300,000,000 in agriculture to make it productive.  I see no better way of investing at least a share of this money than to utilise it in bridging the difference between the market value of holdings being acquired by the Land Commission and the price at which the commission at present fixes.  The State has subsidised other social services, and it should be prepared to subsidise the acquisition of land needed to relieve congestion, because it is a social service of the utmost importance.</P>

But I have changed my mind and I think that it is only right to give my reasons for this change of opinion. You will remember that in 1944 land was selling at a very reasonable price.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a tremendous influx of foreigners and visitors in the last year or two who are giving prices for land which are out of all proportion to its value.  It is not the price that any farmer would give with the intention of making dividends out of his investment, but it is the price that very wealthy men can afford to give in order to get a home and a residence in this country.  Therefore, at the moment, the price of land is out of all proportion to its value.  That is the reason why, after reading the Bill again, I changed my mind, particularly the last few words&mdash;&ldquo;prevailing at the time&rdquo;.  If this Bill is passed the Land Commission cannot acquire any land for the relief of congestion.  The work of the Land Commission will have to come to a standstill for two or three years until the price of land falls again and it is believed it will fall again. When land goes down it usually goes down with a slump and if land is left over by the Land Commission until that slump comes the people from whom it will be acquired will only get the price &ldquo;prevailing at the time&rdquo;. That would be a great injustice to them.  That is the difficulty about passing a Bill of this nature.  Supposing that the Land Commission ceases to acquire land until the value falls by about a quarter then the persons from whom it would be eventually acquired would get the reduced price.  I consider that the price of land at the moment is fictitious and that the value of it should be based on its price over a number of years.  My recollection of Section 39, sub-section 5, of the 1939 Act is that when a holding is resumed <Col N="769" /> the market value is given and that the market value over a period is taken in fixing the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The market value at the time.  I have seen several cases of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it very much. If land is at a fictitious price, it is because of buying, not by farmers, but by people who have money to throw away.  Surely that is not the market value of it.  I have heard of holdings making £18,000, £19,000 and £20,000 that an ordinary person would not give £5,000 or £6,000 for.  Supposing the Land Commission goes to acquire adjoining holdings, is it suggested that it should give that price proportionate to the size?  If it is, the relief of congestion has gone for the time being and that would be a bad thing.  It would also be a bad thing if land fell with a rush.  That is why the value over a period should be taken.  I was very glad to hear the Minister saying here, I think it was on the Forestry Bill, that in his opinion a man should get a fair value for his land.  I hope that the Minister will bring in a Bill making this provision and bringing the price of land acquired into consonance with the price of land to be resumed.  Senator Ryan said that he thought the land purchased and vested in a tenant would now come under the definition of untenanted land.  I am not sure if that is correct.  The 1933 Act provides that if the Land Commission intend to resume, or acquire possession of, a holding that has been vested they can make an order revesting the land in themselves.  Under the 1939 Act, land which is vested in the Land Commission comes under the definition of a resumed holding.  In that case they must get the market value.  I think that when land that is vested is resumed&mdash;I do not know whether I am correct in this or not&mdash;it does not come within the definition of &ldquo;untenanted land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan also said that the Land Commission took the full redemption value of the annuity.  It must be remembered that in the year 1933 all annuities were halved.  The annuity on any land acquired since then and <Col N="770" /> vested in a tenant is halved.  That applies to land purchased since 1933 as well as to land purchased before 1933.  That is a Grant-in-Aid by the State.  Some people may contend that the occupier gets the entire benefit.  I doubt if he does.  In any event, if a vested holding is resumed the redemption value will be only halved to what it would have been if that reduction had not been given.  If a man sells his holding to an outsider he will get a bigger price probably for it because the annuity has been halved.</P>
    <P>On the question of vesting, I would suggest to the Minister who seems anxious that a person parting with land would get a fair price for it, that perhaps a greater portion of the halved annuities would be given to the vendor and that the occupier would not get the entire benefit from it.  While I think that the principle of the Bill is right, I do not agree with the wording of it.  I would like to see Senator Counihan follow the advice given by Senator Ryan and withdraw the Bill until a more opportune time arises for its introduction.  I think this is about the most inopportune time that could be selected for the introduction of such a Bill.  Possibly, the Minister may intend to bring in a new Bill.  If that be so it is all the more reason why Senator Counihan should withdraw his Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to say that perhaps the equities of this case had been very adequately dealt with by some earlier speakers, but Senator O'Dea introduced some new considerations which I managed to hear.  Unfortunately, I do not always hear Senators' remarks, and that is a great loss to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Dea's point was that, at the present moment, land values are abnormally and artificially high owing to the influx of new money from various sources that we all know about, but is it not quite possible to argue that, until quite recently, land values were abnormally low and that they are now only recovering the value that they should <Col N="771" /> have and that they might quite well retain for a considerable length of time?  It is true, of course, that even if land is now selling at £40 an acre, land which formerly fetched £10 an acre, the £40 has only got the purchasing power that the £10 had some years ago.  I think there is something in Senator O'Dea's point, that if we adopt the principle in this Bill that the farmer should get the market value of his land when compulsorily acquired by the Land Commission&mdash;and if that principle is applied through thick and thin&mdash;it would legally justify the Land Commission, in the event of a slump, in paying a slump value for land compulsorily acquired.  It certainly would be deplored by many people who now own land if, in a few years' time from now, land worth £40 an acre to-day should become worth only £10 an acre, and if the Land Commission exercised its legal power to acquire that land for various social purposes at the price of £10 an acre.  Yet that might well be the value of the land then.</P>
      <P>It is foolish to prophesy in a matter of this kind.  Nobody knows what the value of land will be in ten or 20 years' time.  Nevertheless, I think there is an important ethical principle, and an important economic principle, embodied in the Bill and I should like the House to give full consideration to it.  If the market value of land is to be held at a reasonable level, from the point of view of the land owner as well as from the point of view of the community, and if you are to maintain that level, with minor fluctuations only, over a period of years, something more than the present forces that operate to determine the market value of land will have to be brought into operation. The forces that now determine the value of land are essentially mercurial and unpredictable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are so many factors which may change from time to time.  Land at one time and in one place may be worth only £40 an acre, but in a different situation it may be worth £60 or £80 an acre.  There are so many factors which determine the value of land that it is hard to get an objective definition of it.  I think it is in the national <Col N="772" /> interest that some effort should be made to influence the market value of land in an objective way, and in the interests of permanent, social, and national economic policy.  I would suggest, therefore, that it would be public policy that, when land values fell to what everyone would regard as a ridiculously low level, the State should come into the market and deliberately acquire the ownership of farms with public money, and by doing so bid them up to some higher level of value than they would otherwise show.  It should keep those farms in State ownership.  It should employ labour on them, develop them and recondition them, and if necessary let them on a five or ten years' lease to persons having agricultural knowledge who would farm them as tenants of the State.  In that case the State might well have in its ownership perhaps a few thousand farms up and down the country which would be available for continual exploitation by tenants of the State, or in certain events they might be used in other ways.  If a situation should then arise in which land values were to shoot up to what people would regard as abnormally high levels, I think it should then be the policy of the State to control this excessive increase in the value of farms by offering these particular farms for sale in suitable numbers and in suitable places.  It could let them go at whatever they would fetch.  That would help to influence the market value of land in a downward direction.</P>
    <P>I think that by adopting a policy of that kind it would be possible to maintain the curve, illustrating changes in the value of land, with a more even tenor than the one we have been familiar with over the last decade.  If that could be done it would be entirely in the public interest and in the interest of owners of land.  I should point out that this is a matter that has other ramifications besides those which I have been talking about.  One is the credit of the farmer.  The credit of small farmers depends primarily on personal character.  The credit of the larger farmer, the man with 100 acres, also includes the personal element but it can also be based on the mortgage <Col N="773" /> value of his property for any large scale loan from a bank or credit corporation. If the large farmer wants money from such institutions he pledges his credit by mortgaging his holding.  That credit would be looked on with askance by a bank or similar institution if this confiscatory Land Commission legislation were hanging over the head of that farmer.  It is a factor that would operate to reduce the credit of numerous farmers up and down the country, and would make it physically and financially impossible for many of them to develop the use of their land in the way that would be in the national interest.  In this matter, the interests of the larger farmers are on all fours with the interests of the 120,000 people who live by working for wages as farm labourers.  There are only 50,000 farmers in the country who have wage-paid labour.  The average number of persons they employ is only little over two per farm.  It is in the highest degree desirable that the average number of persons working for farmers at a wage should be increased, and that the present wage should, if possible, be maintained and even increased.  If that result is to be achieved, those farmers must develop qualities of enterprise.  They must have other conditions which are necessary before the enterprise can develop itself.  One is to be able to get credit from a bank.  While this confiscatory legislation hangs over them, like the sword of Damocles, they will be handicapped as regards this desirable element of credit.</P>
    <P>I think that we should recognise that we need in this country what, in fact, we have, all sorts and sizes of farms. We need mixed farms of various sizes. The national economy will be on a sound basis only if we recognise that economic as well as social necessity work together on a policy which aims at the production of the maximum amount of wealth from the soil of the nation.  As part of that policy it is highly desirable that the owners of the larger farms should, of their own free will, maintain the practice of tillage and mixed farming which they had to adopt compulsorily under war-time conditions.</P>

That sums up my attitude.  I urge the House to keep in mind the desirability of so modifying the land legislation as to give the owners of larger farms real security of tenure, to make the three F's a reality for them as for their grandfathers and to bear in mind the effect that has on the economic tempo of the whole industry.</P>

      <P>I support wholeheartedly the principle of the Bill, and I disagree with Senator O'Dea in regard to the reduction in the price of land.  I live on the border of three counties&mdash;Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon&mdash;and I know that land sold there for the past year is not standing up to the price given even three years ago. An auctioneer told me about a fortnight ago that when someone wanted to sell a farm he said he would rather undertake the sale of a public house than that of ten farms.  It is unfair for any Government to acquire land under its market value.  So much has been said on that point that I wish to say only that I endorse the principle of the Bill.</P>

The desire that it should be incorporated in an Act of the Oireachtas I consider objectionable because of the absence of precision.

      <P>Of course not.  I quite understand that Senator Baxter does not know the meaning of normal price.  That is my difficulty in dealing with him.  On many of these things, he does not know the meaning of the terms used.  Senator O'Dea referred to the luxury prices that obtain in many areas where wealthy people, for safety or other reasons, are anxious to purchase property.  Then there are panic prices and monopoly prices. Senator Counihan referred to my remarks on the last occasion.  I am sure whatever I say now will not differ one iota from what I said then, as my objection then, as now, is one of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land differs from every other commodity, in that it is a monopoly.  Two types of monopoly may exist in regard to it, a seller's monopoly and a buyer's monopoly.  If a seller's monopoly exists, is it not obvious that it will be very difficult to assess a fair price?  I would like whoever speaks after me to address himself to that problem.  The whole theory of land values and of rent is one in which I have been interested <Col N="776" /> in an academic way for most of my life. Living in the West of Ireland, land purchase and land division is a burning one for me as for the other Senators from the West.  I am genuinely interested and genuinely seeking enlightenment in regard to this matter.  Does that monopoly exist? Can those who have more land than they need hold out, unless there is some brake applied, and get whatever they want in the way of price?</P>
    <P>I referred to buyers' monopolies.  It may give some Senators a jerk that one should say that such a monopoly might exist.  Surely, very recent experience must have convinced Senators that it is possible for buyers to form a monopoly and so force the price of land in another direction?  One monopoly may force it up and another may force it down.  Does recent experience justify that assertion?  I raised the difficulty of fixing prices under these monopolies as a valid objection on the last occasion and I raise it again now. If the purpose of the Bill were to invite us to declare in favour of a fair price, I would welcome it and would declare my support of the principle that the seller should get a fair price.  I referred to market price, normal price, luxury price, seller's monopoly price, and buyer's monopoly price.</P>

      <P>There is no point in arguing with Senator Baxter. Experience has taught us that. Recently, I was making inquiries regarding a certain parcel of land which was offered to the Land Commission, who refused to take it.  The owner instructed his solicitor to dispose of it.  An auctioneer was called in and the land was sold to three different people.  Later on, the Land Commission decided it required the land.  To one of the people concerned it offered £200 more than he paid for it.  In the other two cases, it offered something less than they had paid.</P>

      <P>It illustrates my point in regard to panic price.  After objection and after further negotiations, these people eventually got a price which satisfied them, but when we inquired why two people had been offered less than they had paid, the only conclusion we could come to was that those people were very anxious to get hold of that land, that the land itself was not the dominating principle with them at the time.  Under no circumstances were they prepared to wait or let the chance go.  As a result, they obtained the land and paid more for it than it was really worth&mdash;as they discovered in due course.</P>

      <P>That price I can only describe as a panic price.  The question is as to which of these prices is to be paid to the seller.  This Bill is no help whatever, on that point, to those anxious to sell and who believe they will not get a square deal from the Land Commission.  In the last analysis, it seems that there must be some authority to intervene and decide, as between all these prices, what is the fair price.  Some Senators may say that the Land Commission is not to be trusted.  Perhaps they can suggest some way whereby a fair price may be fixed.  That is not done in this Bill, nor has it been done in the course of the debate.  Consequently, we may be in a difficulty for want of a formula.  Whatever doubts I may have had about the Land Commission, I am glad of the assurance recently given by the Minister in the Dáil that, as far as the Land Commission is concerned, there will be free sale of land.  That satisfies me that sellers of land will get as fair a deal as it is possible for them to get.</P>

Whenever I have the temerity to read any of my speeches, I find them pretty bad.  I am afraid my speech <Col N="778" /> to-night will be very bad.  I have been trying to get hold of a concrete statement by some Senator which would give me occasion for a sensible reply. I tore up my notes, finally, in despair. I should be completely in disagreement with Senator O'Dea's doctrine regarding &ldquo;market price&rdquo; and changes in that price.  I disagree entirely with Senator Johnston that you can apply the quantity theory of money to the stabilisation of land values.  I think that Senator Kingsmill Moore mixed his metaphors.  Instead of getting me to produce rabbits out of a hat, he was trying to induce me to draw the badger.  Miracle of miracles, I find myself in agreement with Senator Sir John Keane.  I am very glad to find myself in agreement with him after many years.</P>
      <P>When I spoke in the Seanad 18 months ago on the Land Bill introduced by Senator Sweetman&mdash;a Bill which was more elaborate in form than the present Bill but directed to the same objective&mdash;I was accused of levity, of not treating with due seriousness the matter at issue.  I think it was Senator Douglas who suggested that I had great capacity for irrelevance, that I had almost reached Senatorial heights in that respect.  I regret that my attitude did not impress the Seanad and that I gave members a wrong idea of my position in regard to the Bill.  I shall try to make amends now.  I shall simply refuse to follow the trails raised by various Senators on this Bill and stick to the point at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully accept, in this country, the principle of private ownership&mdash;that a man has the right to security in the property he holds.  We fully accept the idea that, when the State proposes to acquire property from a private individual for a public purpose, he should be paid the full value of that property. I wonder if that is progress.  I have made that statement time and again and those are my strong, personal views.  But I do not admit, and I do not think the State can admit, that there is a right to uncontrolled or irresponsible control of property.  No matter how we frame laws of private ownership, we must recognise that <Col N="779" /> land is so basic and fundamental a factor in the life of the community that the community has an overriding right which may, morally and legally, be put into operation if the need arises.  It is only because that right must be admitted, we can acquire land from private individuals.  The only justification, I think, for the attitude taken 23 years ago is that the community had a certain right which was being abused. The land was not being utilised for the benefit of the community and, on this question of acquisition, the State directs its attention to land which has been vested in the tenant.  In general, we may say that it is by way of State aid the tenant of that land has been made owner in fee-simple.  The State has spent an immense amount of money in bringing that condition about.  In spite of many accusations made, in the Dáil, particularly, against the Land Commission and various Ministers of all denominations, that work was done in pursuit of a social purpose.  Because it was, the beneficiary has a very definite commitment to the community and his acceptance of the work done by the State on his behalf implies a certain duty to the State.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Land Commission, as I have often stated, has been to create farms and place farmers securely upon them.  It has not been the re-creation, in new hands, of an old, outmoded system of non-residential holdings and uncared for acres.  Those are my views on that matter.  A very definite security has been given to the owner of land.  If the owner resides in or near his lands and works his holding in a reasonable way, he cannot be disturbed unless he is given a suitable, alternative holding and one of no less value.  He has been given an armour and defence against acquisition or confiscation or whatever you choose to call it and the only chink in that armour creates itself when he does not carry out his duty to the community.  As I have said, no democratic State can recognise irresponsible ownership. Sometimes, when speaking here, a Senator will say, in one breath, that the Land Commission is a very valuable organisation, exceptionally <Col N="780" /> just, and that it is only because of the Government it will be unjust.  In another breath, he will say that the blame is on the Land Commission.  In the Dáil, the Land Commission is very often depicted as harrying, harassing and persecuting farmers.  I want to repeat that it was created for a great social purpose and that it dealt with both rapacity and revolution.  I think it has done a very valuable work.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to argue that land is a basic factor in the life of the community. Anybody studying conditions here calmly and reflectively during the past seven years will realise that the very safety of the people is bound up with the land.  If a man is to work his land properly, he must be secured in his holding.  He can only be secured in his holding when he does his duty to the community, which has an overriding ownership.</P>
    <P>I made a few notes, suspecting what would happen at to-day's meeting of the House.  I have been hauled over the coals for congratulating Senator Sweetman on the speech he made on his Bill some time since.  Nothing new has been said to-night.  Senator Sweetman, on the last occasion, put the case for his Bill admirably and concisely. He said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These larger holdings were what was known as &lsquo;retained holdings.&rsquo; When the Land Commission considered it necessary in the national interest to take over any of these larger holdings, they did so by process of resumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a misconception there. &ldquo;Retained holdings&rdquo; may be small or large.  They were retained for the purpose of improvement.  They were not holdings of the better class as a rule.  They were, generally, held on the rundale system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were generally holdings under the rundale system. The Senator further stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Resumed holdings are, by and large&mdash;I made this assertion when opening this debate and it was not challenged by the Minister; if I was <Col N="781" /> incorrect I am quite certain he would have challenged it&mdash;larger and more valuable holdings than acquired holdings....  Acquired holdings may be comparatively small.  Yet, for the large holdings, you are giving a price higher than that which you are giving for the smaller holdings. I referred in my opening remarks to the manner in which the Land Commission might have to spend money on roads, fences, drains and such things.  Under the Act, and not because of any desire on the part of the officials of the Land Commission, those expenses must be taken into account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not quite correct.  The true position is that, during the years 1923-46, 532 holdings were resumed and the average area per holding was 135 acres.  During the same year, 1,772 estates were compulsorily acquired and the average area per estate was 301 acres.  In other words, the average resumed holding is less than half the size of the average acquired holding. The Senator stated again:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister told us that the result of Section 2, if the Bill were enacted, would be the cessation of land division.  That is not so.  It cannot be so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When you consider the acreage of resumed holdings as against the acreage of acquired holdings and when you are aware of the fact that the price of resumed holdings was 60 per cent. greater that those estates even voluntarily given to the Land Commission you will see that it is going to make a tremendous difference in regard to the division of land.  I must oppose the idea of being tied down to market value because I believe that if we admit the principle of market value, having regard to the price to which land has gone to-day, it is going to mean the complete cessation of land division and the relief of congestion in the western areas which we all want to abolish. Well I do not wish the Land Commission to be tied down to a particular form of words.  I would be most anxious to see that full compensation should be paid but when resumption takes place, and we are bound to pay <Col N="782" /> the market value, we have always the difficulty of a certain amount of collusion and a certain amount of bogus offers.  I am convinced that under the existing law the Land Commission and the appeal commissioners will give all owners a price that is fair to them and will do so by a method which is as good and as true as can be determined by any human agency.  I do believe that the acceptance of this Bill would increase the difficulties of the already difficult matter of land division and I ask the Seanad to reject the Bill, not because I do not want to pay a fair price, not because I do not recognise the right of private property but because it would restrict the Land Commission in the relief of congestion which we all desire to proceed.</P>

      <P>In listening to the Minister I have been having a great deal of sympathy with him the whole evening.  He has been here now for two and a half hours and it is obvious from his last remarks that he came in to oppose a Bill that he knew in his heart should not be opposed.  In the second place, I am sorry for him, because he had to listen to a very great number of irrelevancies which, if I may be forgiven for saying so, came in greater numbers from the other side of the House.  I found that in spite of all that, when the Minister got up to speak he impressed me.  I thought from his opening remarks that he was going to take this problem to pieces and give us a solution, but he completely dodged the issue.  He had come a little bit nearer when giving his view on the question of compensation, but just as he was arriving at what I was hoping was going to be a satisfactory point, when I could appeal to Senator Counihan to withdraw his Bill, the Minister sheered away again.  I only hope that before he introduces this new Bill, which we are told about, that he will consider the matter afresh.  For the purpose of enabling him to have certain points of view before him when he is considering the matter afresh, I would like to delay the House for a few minutes even at this late hour for the sake of getting them on record.  I was going to address myself to the necessity of convincing the Minister that <Col N="783" /> Senator O'Dea's viewpoint was entirely wrong from beginning to end, but I am delighted to find that the Minister was at one with me and that it is not necessary for me to deal with the matter.  I was going to address myself, too, to the points raised by Senator Johnston, and again I find there is no necessity for me to discuss this.</P>
      <P>I find myself completely unable to advance very much assistance in regard to the views expressed by Senator Ó Buachalla because they are so involved that I do not think anyone can follow them, although when I take the opportunity of reading his speech in the Official Report I may be able to interpret from it what was in his mind.  He admitted in his speech that so far as land was concerned his knowledge of it was, as he said himself purely academical.  So far as his strictures of Senator Baxter are concerned I do not think that he was aware of the provisions of the Land Act or the meaning of the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo; or else he must believe that the Land Commission were extremely dense in inserting meaningless words in the Act. I do not think the Minister believes when we take up the cudgels here to give a good battering to the Land Commission, that we think they are quite so dense as to insert in a Bill words as meaningless as Senator Ó Buachalla would have us believe.  The value, I suggest, is perfectly plain.  It is accepted that land is such a basic commodity that the utilisation of it by private individuals must be subject to overriding national interest and that its utilisation for social purposes is apart from its utilisation for the purposes of a particular individual.  But this does not get away from the fact that if the property of a particular individual is going to be acquired for the benefit of the State that it is the duty of the State to see that fair compensation is paid to the man whose property is being confiscated.  I am not using the word &ldquo;confiscated&rdquo; in the sense of it being taken for nothing. I mean it in the sense of it being taken at anything except the full value of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister himself subscribed to this principle. <Col N="784" /> As I understand him, the Minister and I are entirely at one in the conviction that it is right and proper, meet and just, that when land is being taken by the Land Commission, full compensation should be paid to the owner.  When he had got to this stage, I seemed to see him looking behind him to see if by any chance there was an official of the Department of Finance who would prevent him from giving this fair and just price.  I suggest to the Minister that in the future he should use his powers to ensure that the consent of the Minister for Finance will be forthcoming to pay the full value for land that is being acquired.  I would ask him also to remember this point before introducing his new Bill and to remember that the amount that is now being paid by a tenant vested or unvested is not the redemption value of the annuities. The redemption value is fixed not on the amount that has been paid off the particular advance made to enable him to purchase his holding but by a fictional procedure in which there is relation to the existing value of the land stock in respect of the holding. Under the 1938 agreement, responsibility for the payment of this land stock has ceased.  The redemption money does not go towards the redemption of the land stock but goes into the central Exchequer.  Nevertheless, the amount which a tenant is asked to pay is not the money that is outstanding but the money that would be necessary at the present time to redeem the particular amount of land stock outstanding on the holding.  There has been an advance in price of all gilt-edged securities and in 1947 the redemption value of an annuity is considerably more than in 1934 though since 1934 the tenant has paid 13 years' annuities. I am speaking in respect of only pre-1923 Act cases; of loans under the Ashbourne and Wyndham Acts.  A tenant who redeemed his annuity in 1934 paid less than if he waited until 1947 even though he would have paid 13 years' annuities in the meantime. It is an entirely fictional and notional procedure, now that the agreement of 1938 was made, to relate the redemption value of the annuity to the price of a land stock that is no longer related <Col N="785" /> to the annuity in question, so that when redemption value of the annuity is to be deducted out of the price which the Land Commission are going to pay the owner of an acquired holding it becomes a very relevant matter, one which is going to still further depress the price which the Land Commission are going to pay for these acquired holdings.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the Minister to a particular aspect of sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Land Act of 1923, the sub-section which fixes the price of untenanted land.  At the end of that section, having given a direction to the judicial commissioner and to the Land Commission to fix the price, it says that, in fixing same, &ldquo;regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively&rdquo;.  That phrase has always been construed to mean that regard shall be had to the future fair value to the Land Commission.  It has always been understood that it was the value in the future to the Land Commission that was implied therein.  During the course of the debate this evening I wondered whether it was intended that that particular sub-section would be construed in that way.  I wondered was it not merely intended in 1923 that the same fair value to the Land Commission and to the owner meant a particular fair value at a particular time, and not a fair value <i>in futuro.</i>  If it meant a fair value at a particular time, then there would be a great deal to be said for this&mdash;that it was the true value that was being considered, the value of the holding to the owner, unpuffed so to speak, because the Land Commission was going into the market to acquire it.</P>
    <P>I confess that, often as I have read that sub-section, I had not considered it from that particular angle.  It was a phrase that was used by one of the speakers to-night that set me thinking along these lines.  I am wondering whether the Minister would be able to get some sort of formula&mdash;after he had arrived at what he has in his mind in respect to true value&mdash;on the lines of making certain that the value to the Land Commission was not to be the <Col N="786" /> value <i>in futuro</i>, but the value immediately at the time the land was being acquired.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the day comes for the Minister to introduce his Bill he will hearken to the words spoken to-night by Senator Counihan, and to the views put forward that he should repeal what is, in fact, an injustice.  I hope he will give ear to the words spoken on his left when Senator Hawkins appealed to have the matter considered by the Minister.  I hope also that he will also listen to the words of another supporter of his, Senator McCabe, who agrees entirely that the case for this Bill is a just one.  I trust that he will listen to the views expressed in support of the Bill by Senators in all parts of the House, with few exceptions.  The case for this Bill is a strong one because it is unjust to deprive a man of his property without giving him full, fair and adequate compensation.  That is a principle to which the Minister subscribed in the earlier part of his statement, a principle which cannot be denied, and a principle which, in spite of the fact that the Minister has asked us to reject the Bill, he intends to implement.  I have a shrewd idea that he intends to do that, and I hope that he will do so sometime in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I have very little to say in conclusion.  The Minister's attitude has disappointed me greatly.  I am not sorry that I brought forward the Bill.  The speeches made in the course of the discussion showed that we have in this House reasonable men, men of common sense and fair play.  I do not want to comment on those who spoke against the Bill.  We know, of course, there are people who will try to find out what the attitude of the Government is to a particular measure, and will then try to bolster up the case put forward by the Government. That, of course, is their own business.  The Minister laid a great deal of stress on the price of land at the moment.  He said that it would stop action on the part of the Land Commission at the present time.  I do not think that the price of land to-day is anything extraordinary if we compare it with what the price of land was <Col N="787" /> ten or 15 years ago, with the value that money had in those days.  There is very little difference in my opinion between the price of land to-day and what it was from 1923 to 1930&mdash;that is when you take into account what the value of money is to-day.  I do not think that those of us who support the Bill can do anything more than, by our <Col N="788" /> votes, register a protest against the injustice which is being perpetrated on the holders of resumed holdings, a policy which, according to the Minister's statement to-night, is to be continued.</P>

      <P>I understand that the enactment of the Flax Act, 1936 (Suspension) Bill, 1947, which will be received from the Dáil tomorrow, is a matter of urgency and that it is necessary that the Bill be law by the 31st of January.  In these circumstances, the Cathaoirleach will have to ask the House to meet next week, although there will not probably be a full day's work.  He asks me to say also that in view of the restricted travelling facilities he has consulted both sides of the House as to the most suitable day of meeting next week, and he understands that Wednesday is most convenient.  I presume there is agreement on that.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 29th January, 1947.</P>
