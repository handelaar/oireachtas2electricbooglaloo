      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in sub-section (1), line 35, the word &ldquo;January&rdquo; be deleted and the word &ldquo;March&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister, when a Finance Bill is being discussed, is impervious to reason or to the hardships that may be imposed on many poor people as a result of this Bill.  I cannot speak with authority on the kind of fare our cinemas serve up, but quite clearly, whether the Minister anticipated it or not, this section will close down many of the small cinemas in the <Col N="1214" /> rural areas.  I have had some opportunity of discussing the results of this tax since it was put into the measure and that is the information which has been given to me.</P>
    <P>If I had the choice, I would prefer what Senator the Earl of Longford would call the legitimate theatre, but in our rural districts, in the small towns that are classified as rural, we have many small cinemas.  I do not know whether the Minister thinks they ought to be there or not, whether he wants them there or likes them there, but my information is that they will not be there when this Bill is passed. Is that the desire of the Minister in the imposition of this duty?  If he is aiming at shutting down cinemas or creating a position where they can open only on a limited number of days in the week, it would be much better to say so.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about the brightening of country life.  I am not advocating that cinemas do a great deal in that way, but they are a factor in rural life now and they are better than nothing. I am not passing judgment on the sort of cinema fare that is served up, but people are prepared to enjoy it; and this section means that the cinemas will no longer be there.  If the Minister finds we can no longer pay for foreign films, it would be better for him to fix a quota and let those who have found their living by serving up this fare over a considerable period be told so.  This is a strange oblique way to attack capital.  A considerable amount of capital has been put into the small cinemas up and down the country and by a stroke of the pen it is going to be wiped out and be no longer of any value.</P>
    <P>This is an inequitable imposition by the Minister for Finance.  While he has made the case, or given us the impression, that he is doing this in order to take some of the cream of the spending capacity of the people, my argument is that he is doing it because we cannot buy the films.  If that is so, let these people who are running cinemas be told that and told that they must abandon the capital they have invested and look for some other means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out earlier that many <Col N="1215" /> poor people in cities and towns are accustomed to go from rather cheerless cold homes into the comparative comfort of the picture-house and spend a couple of hours there.  This extra tax will deny them that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister thinks it is foolish for them to spend their money in that way.  I might agree that it could be spent more wisely, but that is their choice and if there is that enjoyment and comfort for them it may be some stimulant to work.  That will be denied to them from January next.  It is a small pleasure for those people who are engaged in manual labour in the country and they should get at least some degree of comfort and pleasure out of their small earnings if they choose to spend it in this way, it is just as legitimate for them to do so as for better-off people to have the enjoyment of motor cars and of dining in large hotels.  I believe this is a stimulant to better work and my recommendation asks that instead of January as in the section the date should be March.</P>
    <P>My view of cinemas generally is that, from the point of view of the health of the people of city and country, they are something understandable and ought to be enjoyed and be available during the winter months but in the summer, fresh air would be much better for the people.  The Minister's section will close the cinema doors and also impose a hardship on small cinema owners.  To those on small incomes it will, just like the other taxes on cigarettes and stout, impose self-denial on many people who get very few of the pleasures of life and who are entitled to a little more.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would give consideration to the recommendation. I do not know what loss in revenue that would entail.  I do not know what information the Minister had at his disposal before he took the decision that is embodied in this section, but I think he would probably be surprised at the conseqeunces. Perhaps these are the consequences that he is after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal made by Senator Baxter <Col N="1216" /> would reduce the amount of money that we hope to get in this financial year under this particular tax from £143,000 to £23,000.  I think the Senator made a very weak case for his recommendation.  I do not think this tax is going to have any great effect on the attendances at cinemas, whether in the cities, the large towns or small towns.  The actual tax collected on the lower-priced seats is very small.  There is no tax on the 4d. seats under this Budget.  The seat selling prior to the introduction of the Budget for 10d. is to be increased by 2d., so that it will now be 1/-.  It is only in the higher ranges that the tax is rather heavy.  The 3/6 seat will bear an extra tax of 1/6.</P>
      <P>Listening to Senator Baxter one would think that there was a cinema in every farmer's yard and that neither the farmer nor his workmen could do a day's work unless they were at the cinema at night.  As I say, I doubt very much that this particular tax is going to have very much effect on cinema attendances.  If it does we will not get the money.  We calculate that the cinema attendances will be such, after the middle of January, that we will get this extra £143,000 in this financial year.  Very good use is to be made of that money.  I do not expect that Senator Baxter would help me to get money from anybody.  I am sure he could make a case that there should not be any taxation on any of these particular items, but he is the very gentleman who would demand at the same time that the Government should spend about twice as much as it is spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I have to make on the Minister's last statement is that I would expect the Government to spend to better advantage what they are getting.  I think that if anybody else had the spending of it they would get twice as good value for their money.  I would like to have from the Minister whether, in the case of this taxation, he is seeking extra money or whether he wants the cinema owners to buy fewer pictures from the dollar area?  If we could have something clear on that, then we would know what we were heading <Col N="1217" /> for.  That is the trouble about this. I think that, in the other House, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that was the purpose of some of the taxes which are being imposed. It is because we do not know what the position is that these issues have to be raised in this way.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, when listening to me, one would think there was a cinema in every farmer's yard.  I do not know if I gave that impression to the members of the House.  If I did I did not mean to.  Perhaps the Minister's intelligence is of an order that is different from that of the members of the House.  It is true that there are cinemas in practically every small town in my county.  They are in the small towns.  We have three urban areas in which there are cinemas, and there are at least nine or ten small towns in each of which there is a small cinema.  That is the information that I have, and I have given that to the House.  Perhaps we shall have to wait and see whether the Minister gets his taxation in this way.  I suppose it means that fewer films will be bought, and by reason of that the cinemas will be closed.  If that is what the Minister is after we should be told that frankly. He should tell us that he wants to put them all out of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I should like to draw attention to the fact that we are dealing here with a commodity which has a special significance for the ordinary working man with a small income, the man in the rural area, the man in the city or the town.  At the end of the day's work he goes into the &ldquo;local&rdquo; and buys his pint.  It is about the only relaxation which large sections of workingmen have.  It is their practice at the end of their day's work to meet their friends in the only hotel they know&mdash;the local public house. There they are accustomed to buy their pint and consume it as part of the evening's entertainment.  The taxation which a farm labourer will now pay every time he consumes a pint of stout is 8.79 d.  Assuming that he drinks two pints per night, the man with a wage of 45/- or 50/- a week will be paying 10/3 a week in taxation on this commodity alone.  I do not think that is wise legislation or that it can be defended on any ground that I know of. Admittedly, it is causing discontent. In fact, nothing has been done in the legislative field for a long time which has created more discontent in the community than the taxation imposed under this Bill on the workingman's pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a case for collecting more taxation on whiskey which, after all, has been for a long time more or less a luxury.  There is a case for collecting taxation, if we need more revenue, from wines, but I am not convinced that there is any case whatever, or that any case has been made anywhere by the Minister or anybody else, for this impost on the popular drink of the people with the lowest income in the country.  The reactions of this section are already apparent, apart from the discontent to which I have referred, amongst the consumers. <Col N="1219" /> There has been considerable diminution in consumption.  I am told that, in fact, 80 barmen in Dublin have lost their jobs since the imposition of the additional duty on stout and beer.</P>
    <P>We are dealing in this section with home-brewed beer.  We are not talking about imported beers but about a product made in this country by the workers and produced from a commodity grown on Irish farms.  I have grave doubts as to the wisdom, from any point whether social or economic, of this imposition.  No doubt the Minister will tell us that there is a considerable amount of revenue to be derived from this tax, but at the same time the Minister is throwing away £4,500,000 which he obtained hitherto from excess profits made in trade by corporations.  It is difficult to argue that this impost has been levied because of any pressing need for taxation in order to reduce the price of tea and sugar.  I reject that theory at once.  I do not think any sensible person believes that this is the method by which the Minister ought to get the money which he requires for the purpose of reducing taxation on tea and sugar.  I was told that the Minister, speaking to his constituents in the County Louth recently, intimated that this duty is coming off.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you will ask the Minister to control himself.  I repeat that that statement was made to me by a person who assured me it was true and who, I am sure, told what he believed to be true.  I do not put it any higher.  If the Minister says he gave no such assurance, I am prepared to accept that without equivocation whatever. But that, of course, makes no difference to the case I am making.  The case I am making is that this taxation is quite infinitesimal in relation to the needs of the Minister, that it is not a reasonable taxation and that there are other sources of revenue which were available to him and which he has thrown away&mdash;sources which produced £4,500,000 a year from people who could afford to pay that taxation.  He is now levying taxation of 10/3 per week on people with low incomes who amuse themselves to the extent of spending an hour or two in a publichouse at night and consuming two pints of porter.  That section of the community are taxed out of all proportion to their income.  I do not want to refer to other provisions of the Bill, but they are also taxed in relation to tobacco, cinema seats and everything else dealt with in this Bill.</P>
      <P>On the Finance Bill earlier in the year, I referred to a matter of very serious importance&mdash;that large numbers of people are going to lose their jobs because of this taxation&mdash;and while this House can do nothing more than make recommendations or suggestions, or urge the Minister to revise his system of taxation, the House ought at least to be afforded an opportunity of expressing its view in relation to a tax of this kind and of urging on the Minister that it is an unfair tax and, in the long run, an unwise tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make a point of order to you, Sir?  I have nothing to do with this argument between the Minister and Senator Duffy, but Senator Duffy alleged that he heard the story from somebody and the Minister stated&mdash;I do not know why the Minister was vexed&mdash;that he did not <Col N="1222" /> believe the Senator heard the story at all.  That is the same thing as calling Senator Duffy a liar.  We are not allowed to do that to one another and the Minister, on consideration, would not like to do it either.  I think it is quite a disorderly remark and I suggest from the point of view of our debates that it should not have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit to you, Sir, that Senator Duffy made an allegation against me.  I have stated in this House, in the other House and in public as reported in the papers, that the Government was standing over this Budget, and every tax in it.  Senator Duffy comes along here and makes an allegation which he says he heard from somebody whom he will not name that he was present at a private meeting which I attended and at which I said that I was going to take off these taxes.  Surely that is a charge against my honour and if Senators are going to make such charges they should be prepared to substantiate them at least to the extent of saying from whom they heard it.</P>
      <P>I say again that I do not believe that Senator Duffy heard it from anybody at my meeting, because they were honourable men who were at my meeting.  Is Senator Duffy to come in here and use the privileges of this House to make a dishonourable charge against the people who attended the meeting, accusing them of telling lies about what I said?</P>
      <P>If Senator Duffy were in England and made the type of speech he made here, he would be called a Tory of a sort of pinkish hue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Duffy were in England and were called a liar, the person calling him a liar would have to withdraw it.  Of that there can be no doubt whatever.  I merely want to get the point clear.  The Minister may have legitimate cause for being vexed&mdash;I do not know why he is vexed, but let us assume that he has&mdash;but even if he has, he has no right to call Senator Duffy a liar.  Senator Duffy may be entirely misguided; he may be wrong; he may be misinformed; he may have misunderstood what was said to him&mdash;I do not care what you say about it&mdash;but if <Col N="1223" /> we have reached a point at which we can call one another liars, or at which the Minister, who, under the Constitution, has a right of audience here, can call one of us a liar, we have fallen very low indeed.  I do not mind the argument between Senator Duffy and the Minister.  I do not begrudge the Minister any strong language he may want to use in rebutting a charge made against him, but if you can be told that you have made a statement which you do not believe, then you are a liar.</P>

I do not care who used the phrase, but if, when a Senator makes a statement, the reply is: &ldquo;You never heard it and I do not believe you heard it&rdquo;, it is the same thing as calling a man a liar.

      <P>As I was saying when I was interrupted, if Senator Duffy were in England and made the type of speech he has just made, he would be called a Tory of perhaps a pinkish hue.  He accused the Government of throwing away £4,500,000 of excess profits tax.  The British Government threw away about £300,000,000 of excess profits tax, if annulling the excess corporation profits tax is throwing away money.  The reason we withdrew the excess corporation profits tax was that we thought it would have the effect of increasing output in this country and a similar explanation was given by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer for taking the line which was taken there of annulling the excess corporation profits tax, which, so far as I remember, brought in about £300,000,000 a year.  When we had the excess corporation profits tax in operation here, Senator Duffy's friends said that the reason prices were so high was that the Government encouraged them to go up so that they might rake in some of the money through excess corporation profits tax.  They have not got that excuse about prices at the moment.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy said we were charging 8d. a pint duty on every pint of stout the workman took.  His figure is not exactly correct because it is only about 6½d.</P>

There is the question that if he could get a glass of whiskey of the same strength he would have to pay 4/4 as against 2/6 here.  There is the question that he has to pay income-tax there.

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a remark or two in connection with the matter under discussion.  We are all pretty familiar with the aim of the taxation that is involved in the Bill.  It has been precisely stated by the Minister when he was dealing with Senator Baxter's questions on Section 8.  The aim is to make available to the community certain commodities which are considered to be absolutely essential and to make them available at reasonable prices.  So far, so good. The next thing is that money is required in order to achieve this aim. The only way, it is clear, that we can get the money is by taxation.  It follows then that in levying the taxation we ought to levy it in such places and in such a way as will cause least hardship. It is clear that a tax on beer will impose a certain amount of hardship. How much, I cannot say.  But, it is clear that it must cause a certain amount of hardship, not only to consumers, but to traders.  We will all admit that.  But, does the taxation involved in this cause the hardship that Senator Duffy claims it will cause?</P>
      <P>I referred the last evening I was here to the amount that is spent in the country on beer, spirits and tobacco and I referred to the White Paper on the National Income published some time ago.  It emerges from that White Paper that we spend somewhere about £52,000,000 or £53,000,000 per annum on these commodities as against approximately £92,000,000 that is spent on food.  Now, is it reasonable to assert that to take £800,000 from that amount that is being spent on beer imposes the hardship that Senator Duffy says it does impose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether, when the Minister was calculating the amount he should levy and the amount he <Col N="1228" /> would get from the tax, adverted to the elasticity or inelasticity of the demand for this particular commodity.  I do not know whether or not he fully expects that the amount that is being consumed ordinarily will continue to be consumed and that he will get the tax he requires.</P>
    <P>For myself, I believe that it must and I hope it does, result in some reduction of consumption of that particular commodity in question.  If it does, what will be its effect?  The Minister has stated the aim of the taxation is that the wives and children of men who take beer will get certain essential commodities at a reasonable price.  If men reduce their consumption of this commodity it means some extra money remains available to be spent on commodities, not included in the list given by the Minister, but which are absolutely essential if the people are to have a reasonable standard of living. In other words, if, as I hope will happen, consumption is reduced, it follows that not alone will the commodities listed by the Minister be made available at reasonable prices but the standard of living of the women and children must be raised in consequence also, because it will make available a greater volume of purchasing power for other essentials for the household.  I think that is the only way that we ought to look on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is true, and I am sure that Senator Duffy is quite sincere in saying, that this will impose a hardship but the question is, what will be the extent of the hardship?  I do not think that Senator Duffy has been quite fair in the way he has treated this matter.  For the remainder of the discussion, in the interests of the dignity of the House and the conduct generally of Senators, the less said about it the better, and I hope the like of it will never occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the two speeches which have been made in support of the section and I can only say that I never heard such a weak defence of a proposal.  The Minister made no case whatever and did not even pretend he had a case for the section.  He told us he wanted £850,000 from the duty under Section <Col N="1229" /> 10&mdash;the duty on home-made beer. Obviously, that duty will be collected off the ordinary working-class people of this country, the people to whom Senator Ó Buachalla would deny the pleasure of a pint of porter or stout.</P>

There is no defence for this taxation.  It is utterly unreasonable, utterly unjust.  What is the defence the Minister makes for the section?  Here he holds himself out to the House as a Socialist Minister for Finance.  He denounces me as a Tory because I dislike to see the farm labourer and the docker taxed in order to provide cheap wine for the wealthy classes.  This is the Socialism that we are being treated to by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not know, but it seems to me that things are becoming topsy-turvey when the Minister for Finance defends his abolition of the tax on excess profits on the ground that he is a Socialist.  It is a most amazing defence.  I think we ought to get somebody to revise the Socialist text books, the capitalist text books, and the economic text books generally, if there is anyone capable of revising them, in conformity with the Minister's theory here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1230" /> It is true that beer and stout cost more in Great Britain than in Ireland. I made no comparisons with Great Britain.  I did not know that the Minister was interested in following British examples.  Had I thought he was I would have made some advertence to the distinction between the conditions of the two countries.  A farm labourer in Great Britain has £4 10s. a week.  A farm labourer in Ireland gets £2 10s.  A farm labourer in Britain is paying 1/- for a bottle of stout.  He pays 8½d. here.  I want to put this to the House&mdash;all of us here are associated with the ordinary people of the country.  We live in the country. We know the country and the people. Is not it a reasonable proposition to suggest that a farm labourer would be willing to pay 1/- for a bottle of stout instead of 8½d. if he could get £4 10s. a week in wages instead of £2 10s.?  I have a feeling that he would.  The truth of the matter is that although the prices of these commodities, tobacco, beer, spirits, are higher in Great Britain and Northern Ireland than they are here, they are imposing a less burden on the community in relation to incomes than the prices charged here are imposing on our community in relation to incomes.  The Minister knows that quite well.  He has gone through the country.  He has met the people. He knows their views.  He knows the view of the people that these prices are excessive in relation to the income of the mass of the people and the prices of dutiable goods are excessive almost entirely because of the level of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another alarming statement when he suggested that some friends of mine&mdash;I do not know who they are&mdash;some people masquerading as friends, probably&mdash;complained that prices were high because of the excess profits duty.  I did not hear that allegation made.  As I understand it, the duty levied on excess profits was a device invented by the State to collect for the community part of the excess profits which traders were permitted to make at the expense of the community.  Had there been regulation and control of prices to the extent that there would not have been excess profits, there would be no excess <Col N="1231" /> profits tax, or at least, there would be no revenue from a tax on excess profits.  The fact that there was a revenue from the tax shows that excess profits were being made and they were being made under the authority and with the connivance of the Government.  I was not dealing with that.  I kept strictly to the section which imposes a duty on home-made beer.  I was not concerning myself with the other taxes, on spirits, on tobacco or entertainment.  I do not know how Senators feel about this generally, but having been through the country a good deal I feel that there is mounting discontent amongst people with small incomes because of the addition of 3d. on the pint imposed in this Budget.  I know nothing that has created so much discontent as has this imposition.  The Minister may defend it and say we cannot help it; and if he can show the community that this tax is essential and can submit a reasonable ground for his action, the discontent would be removed though the injustice would remain.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla says this is a method of preventing people spending money on beer and enables them to save it for other purposes, but everyone knows that that is not what happens.  The farm labourer who goes into the village after his day's work and consumes two pints at night is still consuming the two pints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator is hard pushed, I will tell him.  I am informed that the consumption is going down in Dublin a good deal and I am informed &mdash;I say &ldquo;informed&rdquo;&mdash;that 80 barmen have become unemployed in the City of Dublin.  In the country I understand that the ordinary workman still goes around to the local at night and drinks his couple of pints, and the only <Col N="1232" /> difference it makes to the home is that he is spending an additional 6d. a night or 3/6 a week on refreshments or entertainment. Therefore, Senator Ó Buachalla's theory falls to the ground. The money supposed to be saved for other purposes is not saved at all, but there is a further dipping into the weekly income to satisfy the demands of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I suppose there is nothing we can do about it in this House except to draw attention to these facts, in the hope that some day the Minister will take into account the effect of this measure on the community and when he is introducing his next Budget&mdash;if he is introducing the next Budget&mdash;some regard may be had to the points to which I have drawn attention.</P>

It has been solemnly stated here that the new tax amounts to 8.78d. on the total cost of the pint, while the Minister says it will cost only 6½d. a pint.  As I may be taking part in the election, I would like to tell the people what is right or reasonably right.  I would like to know which is the correct statement, so that I will not be brought up before a tribunal in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When listening to Senator Duffy on a speech of this kind, one comes to one or other conclusion, that he is very innocent in his rambling through the country or that he meets some very peculiar people who put these mysterious ideas into his head. Senator Hearne interjected to ask Senator Duffy where an agricultural labourer could procure two pints.  I take it Senator Hearne was referring to the time before the present Budget was introduced.  As one who does some travelling up and down the country, I can safely say that the effect of the increase in the price of the pint that is so essential now to the very existence of every worker is to reduce the cost of the pint to the worker rather than increase it.  The workers will agree with me that in almost every public house throughout the country the one commodity that could not be procured was a pint of stout and that a definite <Col N="1233" /> attempt was made by the publicans to extract the very last ounce of profit out of the sale of stout to the poor working men for whom it was so essential.  Since the Budget was introduced, these workers, instead of having to pay an increased price, can now go in and have a pint in the comfort and leisure that Senator Duffy would like them to have.  To illustrate the point&mdash; a man anxious to have a point of stout before the Budget was introduced was told by the publican that he had no draught stout but could supply him with two bottles at 7d. each, totalling ½; whereas the pint is now only 1/1.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy also questioned the Minister about the excess profits tax. During the time the excess profits tax was in operation, the Government were accused of thereby encouraging profiteering and increasing the cost of living.  That point was made up and down the country and in this House. Senator Duffy made reference to the decrease in consumption and to a number of employees being laid off. That is not true.  Only last night I had a conversation with a publican in this city who does a good working-class business and he informed me that his takings are the same now as they always were.  For Senator Duffy's information and enlightenment&mdash;he may not be as familiar with that particular business as others&mdash;he also told me that there is a seasonal decrease in the number of sales of stout and spirits in preparation for Christmas, as the working men are saving now in order to have something extra at that time.</P>

      <P>That is stronger than the ordinary pint of stout.  On standard barrels here, the excise duty now is £10 11s. 0d. and in England the equivalent is £16 5s. 5d.  Translated into pints of stout, it is 6½d. here per pint of the strength of Guinness actually sold and it is 9¾d. in England&mdash;about 50 per cent. more in England.  Senator Duffy made a very interesting point, if it were true, that we here were taking very much more off the working man's beer, in relation to the amount we were taking of the wine-drinker, than they were in England.</P>

      <P>Well, let me answer that point.  The Deputy complained very bitterly that we were taking this £830,000 off the working man for beer and only taking £200,000 off the wine drinker.  In England, what do they take?  They take £5,000,000 off the wine drinkers and £306,000,000 off the working man's beer.  He complains that we are taking £830,000 off the beer drinker as against £200,000 off the wine drinker&mdash;one quarter the amount.  We take one-quarter as much off the wine drinker, but in England they take 1½ per cent. off the wine drinker in relation to what they take off the working man&mdash;as the Senator, if he were in his proper place, in the Tory Party in England, would very quickly point out. The Senator also made the allegation that we are taking more off the individual pint of stout as against the gallon of whiskey or the bottle of champagne. What are the facts in regard to that? We take 6½d. off the pint of stout and in England they take 9¾d.; but here we take 10/- off the pint of champagne and they only take 7/4 in England.</P>

      <P>In case it should be thought that nobody had any views on this question except Senator Duffy, I should like to make a comment or two before the section is put.  I confess that I cannot understand why the Minister should be so terribly annoyed because he is challenged with regard to his section.  Listening to Senator Hawkins, one would feel inclined to believe that the Minister was actually granting a concession to the working classes in this country because he is providing them with a pint of stout which as far as he was concerned was prohibited before.  If Senator Hawkins is right, then the Minister should be delighted and should be acclaimed by all the people whom Senator Duffy speaks for.  If they are not acclaiming him, they why are they so ungrateful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is, but one never knows.  Perhaps the Government will yet change its mind. Whether there is an election in the offing or not, I suppose it is true to say that Senator Hawkins knows more about it than I do.  If the Minister is <Col N="1236" /> annoyed at the consequences of his decision, he should not show his annoyance here in the manner in which he did to-day.  He seemed to be annoyed that members of the House were challenging him about something as if they had not the right to challenge him.  According to the Minister, and to those supporting him in this House this increase in taxation is going to reduce the cost of living.  It has to be remembered, however, that the commodities which the working man and the poor man will be enabled to buy at a cheaper price as a result of this Budget are all rationed and are to be obtained only on coupons. Therefore, the position will be that he cannot buy any more of them than he can at present, even supposing he gets more money.</P>

      <P>It would be very exciting and perhaps a little interesting if I were to follow Senator Duffy and deal with his remarks with regard to excess profits, and if I were to make comparisons between the duty on wines and on the poor man's pint and all the rest.  I do hope that all of us, whether we are affected by the increased taxes on porter, wines, tobacco and motor cars or anything else, will be able to establish in the mind of a Minister that this Bill is a temporary expedient to meet a temporary difficulty and should be definitely regarded in that light. The Minister, in reply to what I had to say last week, said that all he could say was that he trusted it would be temporary.  We know, however, from experience that new taxes, as they grow old, become permanent in our legislation.  I think it would be catastrophic if these new taxes, which we are prepared to accept because of the exceptional needs at the moment, were to become part and parcel of our permanent legislation.  I hope that not only the tax which we are dealing with in this section but all the other taxes which have been referred to&mdash;the tax on the poor man's pint or, as someone said, the poor man's champagne&mdash;will all vanish as soon as the Minister finds himself in a position to revise the legislation which he is putting before us to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair, I think to remind the House of one section of the community which is affected by this Budget&mdash;a section that has to bear all the taxes that are levied&mdash;and that is the section comprised of private motorists. But there is practically no such thing to-day as the private motorist.  Most of those private motor cars are as much commercial vehicles as the lorries which bring the turf into Dublin.  What we find in this Bill is a greatly increased scale of taxation for the use of an article which, in fact, we are not permitted to use.  I am not making the <Col N="1238" /> case now that the Minister should waive this particular new tax, but I am urging on him the reasonableness of the claim that he should provide those people with petrol to use the vehicles in respect of which they are being taxed.</P>
    <P>I know of no reason&mdash;and my sources of information are pretty good&mdash;why there should be any rationing of petrol in this country at all.  I know of no reason why we should have to accept the austerity conditions that prevail in England except political pressure from England.  One of the leading newspapers in England has already published articles to the effect that there is available, from sterling sources, more than enough petrol to satisfy not merely the rationing needs but the normal needs of Great Britain, and the needs of Ireland more than twice over.  That statement appeared in March of last year in one of the leading English daily papers.  We have every sympathy with our neighbours at the other side.  We sympathise with them by reason of the fact that they have to put up with various measures of austerity.  We should feel grateful that we ourselves have been spared many of these austerity measures so far as our own economy is concerned.  It is well known that we have colossal sterling credits in London.  I believe it to be true that this country, if it were not affected by political reasons from the other side, could in fact, buy with sterling more than enough petrol that would enable us to remove rationing in the use of petrol for motor vehicles.  I submit that we are entitled to look to the Minister to ease that position.  The new tax is not so much a tax on the use of motor vehicles as a tax on ownership.  The moment a vehicle is registered the tax has to be paid.</P>
    <P>We know that the average vehicle to-day has a limited mileage, and while that is so it has already been hinted that there may be further restrictions on that mileage.  I think it would be unreasonable to impose further restrictions, because I do not believe there is any necessity for them.  I do not want to obtrude trade matters in this debate, but I do know from my friends who are connected with petrol distribution not <Col N="1239" /> merely in England but in Europe that there are many wells in sterling areas capped down, and that supplies of petrol from these wells cannot be made use of.  I know, of course, that there are difficulties with regard to tankers&mdash; that there are many tankers with their bottoms out in American harbours.  I think that many of these difficulties could be surmounted.  The motor section of the community, so far as I know it, does not particularly like this new tax, but it would be prepared cheerfully to put up with it in the light of the arguments which the Minister used if he would permit them to have a more free use of their vehicles instead of the more restricted use that is envisaged for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Summerfield started off with the optimistic statement that he hoped these new taxes would not become a permanent feature of our legislation.  I am afraid that, in view of what we heard here to-day&mdash; that Senator Duffy has, apparently, a great admiration for the Tory Party, and that the Minister is enormously enamoured of the present British Government&mdash;Senator Summerfield is not going to get very far in regard to what he said about the motor taxes.  The tax of £34 or £36 on a 20 h.p. car may, in present circumstances, be a reasonable tax if the car is of a reasonable age, but I think it is far too much in the case of an old car.  The fundamental point is how much petrol you can get at the present time.</P>
      <P>A person with a 20 horsepower car can easily calculate what the new tax is going to cost him for petrol.  If one is to judge by what one reads in the newspapers the basic ration is to go. In that event, the Minister will not get anything like what he estimates from his new taxation proposals.  I think it is essential, if any important change is going to be made, that it should be announced at the earliest date.  Certainly, it should be announced long before people set about registering their cars on the 1st January.  A good many people do that before that date in order to avoid the rush at the registration offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> There are a large number of people who will not pay the tax at that rate, if there is not to be a basic ration, or if there is to be only a very small quantity.  I have only a limited experience of the position in England, but I know that a very large proportion of people here who use their cars on a basic ration would, if they were in England, have a supplementary ration, because it is comparatively easy to get a supplementary ration in England if your car is used at all for the purpose of business.  Here, certainly so far as the country is concerned, with the limited amount of transport and long distances from the railways, the question of getting about is a very important matter, having regard to the total production, and I hope that we will not, unless for reasons of sheer necessity, allow ourselves to be unduly influenced by considerations in another country, which, in spite of all that has been said by the Minister and Senator Duffy, are not necessarily comparable at all.</P>
    <P>The more comparisons with England that I hear, whether from high sources like the Minister or from other sources, the more I realise how extremely inapt they are, because the circumstances, particularly in the case of the working class generally, have become so different that to take one item, a particular wage, a tax or a price into consideration, without taking a lot of other things into consideration, gives an altogether false impression.  It does appear, however, that we are going to have a much more interesting general election than I had anticipated. When Senator Foran has explained to the electors generally how the difference between the 6½d. and the 8d. calculated by Senator Duffy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry for the inaccuracy.  When the Senator has explained that it is due to the strength of the stout, I think that things will be much more interesting than they are normally.  I hope that that desire for complete accuracy which is expressed by him will spread to all Parties and will be a feature of the general election, but I am not <Col N="1241" /> nearly as optimistic even as Senator Summerfield is with regard to this taxation.</P>
      <P>There is a very small point I want to raise on this section.  I do not think it will be of much value as an election point, though I am a little nervous about raising it for fear the Minister might again be hurt.  I was asked this morning if I could find out whether the tax on auto-cycles was affected.  I have since been informed authoritatively that the tax has been doubled, raised from 30/- to £3.  I do not think an awful lot of votes will be affected, but it has been put to me that the auto-cycle is used very largely by insurance collectors and others who use it entirely for purposes of business, and that, as the van and other motor vehicles used and registered for business purposes have not to bear any increase, it is not altogether fair that the auto-cycle should be taxed.  I am raising the point because I was asked to do so, but, in doing so, I am afraid I am very much in the position in which I was with regard to picture houses, in which I have not been for 18 months, and with regard to beer, which I very seldom drink, because I have never ridden an auto-cycle and cannot therefore make a very good case.</P>

I am, however, a road user and I am appalled at the increase in congestion created by the modern chromium-plated abomination, not only on our roads but in our parking spaces and generally its effect on our traffic. I am not entirely frivolous when I ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be possible to combine horsepower and size in the taxation of cars &mdash;something in the nature of a tax on floor space, because these cars are occupying an enormous amount of public floor space and I do not see why they should not pay for it.  So far as I see, there is no limit on width or beam and no limit on size, and this is <Col N="1242" /> having quite an effect on traffic difficulties.</P>

      <P>Would it be unreasonable to ask the Minister if he could help us out of a difficulty in relation to the exact position of the petrol ration?  It seems to me that, until that is settled, we are arguing in the most complete condition of perplexity about the taxation of cars which is bound to affect the revenue also.  If we do not know, before the 1st. January, whether the ration is to remain or to be seriously axed, a great many people will not register their cars.  If things quietly drift on as they are drifting, people may tax cars with the unhappy, feeling that, having committed themselves to the entire year, they may find the petrol ration very badly cut down.  It is a little unfair on us to leave us in this obscurity and I believe it is in the interest of the Minister, as it is in the interest of all car owners, car users and of the people knocked down by them, that we should find out something about the programme with regard to the petrol supplies to be available next year.  It is certainly going to influence the extent to which we tax cars, which, in turn, will affect the revenue, which, in turn, will affect the Minister's Budget.</P>

      <P>I must ask your indulgence, Sir, to reply to the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane.  He is like a lot of people who are not motorists at all.  He is full of criticism of the types of cars people use, but the chromium-plated monsters to which he refers happen to be the type of cars which have by about 50 to 1 the biggest sales in the entire world.  These monsters are just ordinary cars in other countries, and particularly in the country of origin, but, because of our proximity to Great Britain, the smaller type of car has become fairly well-known here.  That should not be made an excuse for an attack on the big type of car out of which hundreds of men in this country are getting a living, assembling, distributing and selling, and in which thousands of people are getting comfort and good use in the business purposes for which they use them.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas asked <Col N="1243" /> a very simple question with a very peculiar introductory phrase.  I will answer his simple question first.  He wanted to know what was the tax on the auto-cycle.  It is to be £3&mdash;double what it was before.  Senator Douglas, however, asked me that very simple straightforward question, a question which it was quite easy to answer, after saying that he feared that I might again be hurt.  Is that to equate his simple question with what Senator Duffy said?  Have Ministers no right to be hurt if they are accused of dishonourable conduct?  Senator Douglas and the other Senators who row in that boat will have to take a pull at themselves. So far as I am concerned, if any Senator here in this chamber makes an attack upon my honour and the honour of the greatest Party that ever stood in this country, I will resent it and as quickly as I can.  At the same time, if any Senators want to ask any reasonable, any straightforward questions about the business for which I am responsible to the Oireachtas and to the people, I will try to answer them, but please do not let Senator Douglas equate the asking of a simple question with Senator Duffy's particular line of action.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggested that we should have a tax according to size as well as according to horsepower. I doubt whether it would be possible to get a yardstick for size in relation to a car and I do not know that there is very much in that particular idea.</P>
      <P>Senator Fearon and Senator Summerfield spoke about the petrol ration. I am not, as Senators know, responsible for the control of supplies.  I take it that, before the next rationing period commences, an announcement, will be made as to what the scheme will be for that period.  It is wrong, however, to say, as Senator Summerfield said, that we could get all the petrol we like from the sterling area.  As a matter of fact, all our petrol comes from dollar areas. It is not my business, but the fact is that the British Government can sell petrol for dollars and they are denying a lot of things to their people in order to sell products for dollars.  They can sell sterling petrol for dollars.</P>

      <P>That in subsection (5), line 29, the word &ldquo;twenty-five&rdquo; be deleted and the word &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; be substituted therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is essentially a lawyer's section, and I might say, from the comments I have heard on the section, that it will be a lawyers' paradise.  Like every other section in the Bill, it contains a most distasteful imposition.  This levy on capital in this particular form is very objectionable.  In the other House, the Minister is believed to have made some concession with regard to certain types of conveyances, but my information, for what it is worth, is that the insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in this section means that in fact there is no concession at all, because in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred conveyances that go through, there will be some financial consideration. If a man decides to pass his place to his wife, to a son or to a daughter&mdash;so far as land transfers are concerned and Senator O'Dea will be able to enlighten us on this point&mdash;in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, there is a consideration.  There is a payment of £100 or £50, or it may be only £5 to the old person.  Insertion of the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; means that <Col N="1245" /> some duty will have to be imposed in accordance with the level inserted in the section.  If the Minister really meant to do what he purported he should look into the matter again.  As it is, any consideration whatever eliminates a voluntary disposition, so that in the other House they got nothing from the Minister.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to argue this at length, I think it will have implications, seeing that there are all sorts of reasons for transferring property.  For instance, there is the consideration that the old people may get the old age pension, or that a son might get married.  Whatever the purpose of the transfer, the tax which is going to be imposed to make it legitimate is of such a nature that, in the opinion of people with experience in this respect, it is going to affect a great many families. It is a really serious matter.  I have no experience of drafting such a recommendation, but I raised this question because it is of serious import as far as the transfer of land is concerned. I am informed that the concession is of no value in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave this matter a good deal of consideration.  In the Financial Resolution passed in the other House in the first instance voluntary conveyances were subject to increased duties of 5 per cent.  I was rather frightened about that.  The Incorporated Law Society took up the matter and made certain recommendations to the authorities, pointing out that they were afraid it would interfere with transfers and family settlements from father to son or from uncle to nephew.  In consequence of these recommendations, this concession was given and is, I must say, a valuable one.</P>
      <P>When I saw the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in the Bill, for the reasons mentioned by Senator Baxter, I was rather disturbed. In most family settlements, there is a consideration that the assignor would be supported and maintained, and very often that sums of money would be given to the daughters. For that reason, the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in regard to a settlement is not a good one.  The words &ldquo;family arrangement&rdquo; would be better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> Having made inquiries, I gathered that the authorities are going to construe all such deeds as voluntary deeds, even though there has to be a voluntary payment made as well as provision for the assignor.  I am afraid that would not be a voluntary deed.  Even a convenant put in for support, maintenance and payment is, as they say, feeding the dog with a bit of his own tail, as all comes from the land.  It is really an assignment of land subject to certain conditions.  Having got an undertaking, I am satisfied that it will be construed in that way.  Otherwise, I would be a very strong supporter of the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I have got neither the advice that the Minister got nor the advice of a lawyer.  Surely if the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; is to be construed in that sense, that should be set out in the paragraph.  Senator O'Dea knows enough about it to realise that no undertaking, Ministerial or otherwise, on the records of this House is of any avail in a court.  With all respect to Senator O'Dea and the Incorporated Law Society concerning the undertaking given them, I consider that without some such indication of such a construction being inserted in the sub-section, it is not worth a row of pins.</P>

      <P>What Senator Baxter says is correct, if the matter goes to court later.  According to the section this does not go to court.  Officials put one stamp on and once they put on the second stamp, showing that it is properly settled, then the court is bound to accept it.</P>

      <Col N="1247" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express the view that I do not believe the 5 per cent. tax on conveyances should be continued for any length of time. There might be something to be said for it in somewhat abnormal conditions, but if it is to be regarded as the normal tax on conveyances of property, land or houses, it is far too high. It should definitely be accepted as a temporary measure.  I cannot make up my mind as to the exact effect of it at a particular time.  I am perfectly certain, however, that under normal conditions of exchange it would simply have the effect of adding to the price of houses, a result that nobody wants.</P>
      <P>The point I want the Minister to make clear is this.  I am informed that in the case of transfers, in which the deeds were completed and the necessary notice given before December 1st, they will not be affected, even though the actual sale may not have been completed until after December 1st.  I was asked by a solicitor to raise this question so that the position would be cleared up.  There has been a rush recently to have deeds completed.  It seemed to me, reading the section as it stands, that it makes it quite clear that the actual transaction has to be completed, and that stamp duty has nothing to do with it.  I should like to be sure that that is the correct view. There is some misgiving on the point outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important question.  I think if the deed is not stamped before December 1st, the full stamp duty will have to be paid, unless the agreement was entered into before October 29th and notification of it given to the Revenue Commissioners. If that was not done, I understand the full stamp duty will have to be paid.</P>

      <P>I think I am right in saying that the Minister did not answer a point I made on the Second Reading, asking for some mitigation of this duty, in a case of charity.  After all, provident societies are exempt.  I think charitable transactions should be <Col N="1248" /> exempt.  In the case of one particular body of people, the Church of Ireland, many glebes were too large for the incumbents and a number has been sold and smaller houses purchased. In a case of that kind it is very hard to have such heavy stamp duty imposed.  I imagine the Minister will say, in answer by implication, that this tax does not fall on purchasers, but that when there is a 5 per cent. tax the price of the property is reduced <i>pro tanto.</i></P>
      <P>I have spoken to auctioneers since the Second Reading and I understood that they were not in agreement with the Minister's view.  It is a question that is hard to determine.  Possibly, the high price of property and a big tax like 5 per cent. would take the form of an abatement in the price paid, but in the case of cheaper properties it is doubtful if that would be the case. There is a pretty good parallel in the case of two properties, one plot being freehold and the other carrying a moderately small ground rent of, say, £15.  In practice, there is undoubtedly going to be no difference in the price paid.  Purchasers do not have regard to the price in the case of a small ground rent.  After all, the interest value of the tax is equivalent to a small ground rent.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister to do anything now, but I hope he will consider the matter before the next Finance Act, by extending a concession to <i>bona fide</i> charities, perhaps limited in amount.  I would not ask that a charity such as a convent or a monastery that paid a big amount should be exempt from the tax, but I ask that small purchasers or in the case of buildings like church parochial halls, should be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to do something which the Orders of the House would not permit regarding this section.  I have raised this point on the section as I want to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  In sub-section (5) he takes power to impose a tax by way of stamp duty at the rate of 25 per cent. on the value of the consideration where any non-national comes in and buys property.  I must concede that <Col N="1249" /> the object of the section as a whole is to find more money for Budget purposes. I got the impression, while listening to the debate, that the value of property had gone too high, and that this proposal was to keep control by preventing a tendency towards inflation. But when purchasers as a whole do not mind paying the extra duty in stamps it means that having gone so far they will keep on going giving the extra £10 to get the profit.  You have had here over a period, not a very long period undoubtedly, but for some time past, two types of people bidding for property.  You had the native and you had the foreigner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is proposing to deal with this in a different fashion under this section.  The foreigner is to pay £25 where the native has to pay £5, but the Minister, apparently, is still satisfied to permit the foreigner to come in here and purchase.  If he does come he is going to put such a levy on him that will be a considerable contribution to the Exchequer.  If the Minister, in the first instance, is against this inflationary spiral so far as property is concerned, surely he must observe that the presence of foreigners here in the market competing for farms or houses or factories is, in the main, responsible for whatever inflationary tendency there is in the market.  There is hardly any doubt whatever that if foreigners have become owners of property here it is because they have had more money to spend on it than the natives had and were prepared to go on and on to get it.  If the Minister wants to control this tendency the proper line for him to pursue is to make it more difficult for foreign money to come in here and become the possessor of capital resources.  There is no doubt at all that for some considerable time past the prices paid in the property market have been extravagant, the prices of particular properties especially.  We saw a remarkable statement by the ex-Chancellor of the British Exchequer that £10,000,000 of British capital, so to speak, had been shipped over here to be used in this country.  It is rather a strange application for or use of the <Col N="1250" /> word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; for Mr. Dalton when he says that some people can get £10,000,000 into a bank in England and come over here and get £10,000,000 against it which they put into capital goods and that England has lost to that extent.  The truth, of course, is that English citizens for paper notes are becoming the owners of Irish capital goods to an extent that is rather disturbing.</P>

      <P>It is all part of the same problem.  I think myself it is a subject that is causing grave concern to a great many thoughtful people all over the country, the thought that all those people are coming here with paper money and getting control of Irish lands and Irish houses.  I think that is undesirable and in so far as it is taking place we have two opinions about it.  Our Minister on the one hand has said, I think, that it is a rather trifling matter.  The British Chancellor on the other hand seems to be alarmed at this amount of money being shipped across here to get control of our lands and of course our houses.  Could there be anything more undesirable in these days of inflationary tendency that money that is almost being burned in Britain is being used or can be used by people to buy Irish bricks and mortar or Irish farms.  These people are not coming here as producers.  Possibly the people who are selling property here to them may not have been making a great contribution in the production of physical goods for the community, but <Col N="1251" /> I am sure that those people coming in are going to make a much smaller contribution. I feel that the Minister should take more control.  There is not a part of the country in which this is not happening.  I saw a report in our local paper recently of a small hotel in what is probably the most remote part of Ireland, in Dowra, County Cavan, away up in the mountains, being purchased by an English lady.  I do not know whether the Minister was ever there or not, or whether any member of the Seanad was.</P>

      <P>It was the last outpost of the Irish when they were being driven out.  In fact it is problematical if it had ever been invaded.  The O'Rourke held out there.  There is not a local paper in the country that is not telling the same story week after week. Business houses in every town are passing into the hands of people who are not natives of the Twenty-Six Counties or the Thirty-Two Counties.  I am not going to dilate further on that.  I feel that the Minister is still acquiescing in the coming of these people. He is making it somewhat more difficult no doubt and has indicated that there is necessity for standing against this strong current that is flowing against us but in my judgment he should have gone much further than he has.  As a matter of fact this section, in part, is unintelligible to me.  If I read it correctly some one from the Minister's own county, Armagh, one of his own colleagues who fought with him there, cannot come in here and buy a farm.  As I interpret it I do not think any man from the Six Counties can come in and buy a farm in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I would like that point cleared up.  My main concern is this infiltration that is taking place.  I am not in the least influenced by the fact that these people are going to pay taxes.  They are not bringing us any physical goods, any greater experience or competence than we possess, any equipment or any spiritual advancement or enlightment.  I think the Minister would be doing the nation a <Col N="1252" /> great service by standing out definitely against this infiltration and stopping this inflationary spiral that all of us consider so dangerous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do hope the Minister will hesitate before he accepts the very reactionary suggestions made by Senator Baxter.  Senator Baxter knows the country a good deal better than I do and he knows that many of these properties bought by newcomers had been on offer for years and years and that nobody wanted them. Further, he says that all these newcomers contribute nothing to our national capital, to our national benefit. That is ridiculous.  A lot of those people coming here are what are called rich people.  If rich people come here surely their capital comes with them is spent here.  I do not know whether the Minister has got any figures yet regarding this matter.  Probably if he had it would not be appropriate for him to give them but certainly the movement must be adding considerably to the revenue.  I have no objection to this heavy stamp duty on people who can afford to pay it.  Indeed, so far as I can see, if the Minister's contention is true, the stamp duty is not being borne by the purchaser but by the Irish vendor.  It is deplorable at this stage of our civilisation that we should advocate putting up the shutters and placing barriers in the way of people of substance who are willing to come here and be good citizens and observe the laws of our country and contribute very considerably to the national economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that I regard this matter as being of considerable difficulty but I do not share the views expressed by Senator Baxter.  I can see reasons why we in the national interest should want to prevent people from outside the country from speculating or drawing money profits from here but I do not believe there is any reason at the present time why we should not welcome people prepared to come here and to spend their money and to live here and take part in the development of the country.  If it is to be the policy <Col N="1253" /> of the Government, this or any other Government, that land is not to be bought by persons who are not citizens then the matter should be dealt with by law and not by means of taxation. If you deal with it by taxation even to the extent of a 50 per cent. duty which Senator Baxter would agree with, it will lead to injustices and inequalities.  Only the very rich will be able to pay.</P>
      <P>We all know that certain people have come here who are not desirable but we do not hear anything about the desirable people.  We should not yield to a lot of wild talk.  Are we going to say we will not welcome anyone inside our borders who will pay taxes and obey our laws?  I do not think our population is so large that we can afford to take that stand.  It may be necessary, no doubt, to prevent undesirable people coming here, but the way to do that is by legislation.  It would be very difficult but I hope that, because a certain number of people, who are generally thought to be undesirable, may have come here, we will not get into a panic and imagine that the whole of our country is being sold to undesirable outsiders, which we know perfectly well is not the fact, and that we will not allow ourselves to do anything hasty or unwise.</P>
      <P>If it is desirable and if it is Government policy to make restrictions then bring in a Bill similar to the Control of Manufactures Act, or something of that kind, so that we will know what the law is and so that people can comply or not with the law.  Simply to deal with it by taxation would never be a success.  I am assuming that the Minister in imposing this tax is doing it for the purpose of revenue, not for the purpose of adopting a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to accept the 50 per cent.  I would be satisfied but there are different ways of looking at the problem.  In Galway there is a great number of big houses. They were left derelict for some years and they were bought by people whose one object was to dismantle them and to take the slates and materials away. That creates a very serious problem. I would like to see some law brought <Col N="1254" /> in that would prevent that happening. The only case that I personally was concerned in was the case of a castle that was sold with some land attached. The husband of the owner of the house told me that he could have got £1,000 more for that house if he would sell it to a man who would demolish it.  He refused to take the extra £1,000 and he sold it to an Englishman who is now living there.  This Englishman keeps a very big staff of servants and a great number of employees on the land.  He has brought over, and intends to bring over, the best thoroughbred sires and mares and the very best breed of cattle and he appears to be very respectable. He and his wife are living there and they are keen on racing and hunting. The question is, is the purchase of that place by those people, who will run it in such a way as will improve the breed of horses and cattle in the locality, better than allowing the house to be demolished?  I would like to see a law passed that would prevent the demolition of those houses.  That is a matter that ought to be taken up by the Government and considered very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the case which ought to be considered.  It probably would prevent foreigners buying land here if they knew that they are liable to have that land taken from them by the Land Commission at any time.  There is nothing to prevent the Land Commission taking that land from them and dividing it amongst the tenants, and I do believe that that will happen in a great number of cases.  I think they ought to be told that that could happen.  I am sure they are told because, whenever an application is made to the Land Commission for consent to a sale, they give a conditional consent.  They always say that it is subject to the right of the Land Commission to acquire that land at any time and the purchaser's solicitors, probably, are always told that and they know that they are running a risk in coming to this country and buying at a big price land that may be taken from them by the Land Commission, who will not give them anything like the price they have paid, if that price is exorbitant.  Twenty-five per cent. would seem to be reasonable.  In a particular sale of £5,000, if it were not <Col N="1255" /> stamped before the 1st December, it would cost a foreigner £1,250, as against £250 if it is bought by an Irishman. That is an extra £1,000 on a sale of £5,000, or 20 per cent.  It is a big sum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very big consideration. The Minister thinks it is the vendor who will lose.  I do not mind that much if he has land that he is willing to sell to strangers, but it seems it would be giving a great advantage to the Irishman as against the foreigner.  If the Minister thinks he ought to take the 50 per cent.  I would be just as pleased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in reply to Senator Douglas's question, that subsection (8) of Section 13 is quite clear, that if the sale is executed before the 1st December and the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied on that, that it comes under the old stamp duty.  I think it is quite clear and, if the lawyer in question thinks there are any snags he can assure him that it is quite plain and straightforward and does not mean anything other than what an ordinary individual would read from it.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked that we should give special consideration to charities.  The more exceptions you make to any particular tax, the dearer it is to administer.  I would rather abolish a tax altogether, if the purpose for which it was imposed was to collect money, rather than spend half of it in administration.  If we were to give special exemption from the 5 per cent. for all sorts of charities and charitable institutions, it would take a very great deal of time on the part of the Revenue officials to decide in each case whether the applicant was in fact a charitable institution and entitled to the exemption, or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that you already have the information in regard to the institutions that are exempted from income-tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to go through those and see whether they would <Col N="1256" /> cover even the people that Senator Sir John Keane wants exempted from the stamp duty.  There is no doubt about it that if a Church body is selling one house and buying another they are adversely affected by the 5 per cent. stamp duty.  I hold that they are adversely affected when they sell, that they get 5 per cent. less than they would ordinarily get.  I do not think that a purchaser would take the same view of this stamp duty as he would of a head rent.  A purchaser may ignore a small head rent because he only has to face paying it in the years to come and he will say, perhaps, &ldquo;I may have the money to pay it at a few pounds a year&rdquo; but in regard to the stamp duty, he has to pay it right away before he gets legal ownership.  I have no doubt that the ordinary normal purchaser who has his head screwed on will take account of the stamp duty when making his bid at the auction.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter referred to people coming here from England and from the Six Counties and buying property. I know exactly, because I have seen the lists which I have had prepared ever since I became Minister for Finance, the numbers of properties changing hands&mdash;farms and houses&mdash; and the places of residence of the purchasers. I can tell the Senator how the averages have been running for this last couple of years.  About 2 per cent. of the properties changing hands are being bought by residents outside the State, or on behalf of people outside the State.  That includes people coming from the Six Counties, England, America and elsewhere.  Of that 2 per cent. of the properties changing hands bought by those people outside the territory over which we have jurisdiction, the fact is that 75 per cent. are obviously ordinary Irish people&mdash;Murphys, O'Connors and O'Sullivans, and so on&mdash;who are either sending back the money from America or coming over from England or coming down from Belfast or County Armagh to buy a bit of property here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say what capital that represents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Let us take it in percentages first.  I <Col N="1257" /> say that 2 per cent. of the properties changing hands are not bought by residents within the Twenty-Six Counties but by others, by the people who come in from outside the Twenty-Six Counties.  Seventy-five per cent. are obviously people bearing straightforward Irish names and, if one went a little closer, one would probably find that of the ½ per cent. that is left, numbers of them could claim Irish blood.  They may be people with normal Irish names, married to Englishmen, Americans, or something of that kind, and the husbands' names might not have been very Irish.  So much for percentages.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter does not yet know what money is.  That is his misfortune. It is many people's misfortune.  When it was said in England that £10,000,000 worth of capital had been transferred here, Senator Baxter did not realise exactly the significance of that statement. The only way that one can make a final transfer of capital is in the form of goods or services rendered. If an individual wants to transfer his own personal capital between, say, England and Ireland, for the £1,000 he brings over here he leaves to the credit of some institution here £1,000.  So that, between the two countries the balance has not been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Englishman may own a deposit in a bank here.  If he does, the bank into which he puts the deposit has received a corresponding deposit in an English bank and the only way effectively that capital can be transferred between nation and nation is by the physical transfer of goods or services. At least £10,000,000 worth of capital was transferred in that fashion during this last year because the external assets of our banks dropped by more than that amount and it meant that we imported into the country £10,000,000 worth of goods and services more than we exported in return and that, as Senator Baxter will see, is the only transfer of capital.  This particular phrase, that an Englishman or a man from the Six Counties buys property here with a bit of paper, is either a very stupid phrase or said <Col N="1258" /> with the intention of deceiving.  The bit of paper that an Englishman can buy property with here represents a claim on British goods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We got £10,000,000 more than we sent out.  A lot of the people here were very glad to see them coming in, whether it was British manufactured goods or maize from the Argentine or American wheat or something else that we imported.  It is true to say that the competition helped to inflate the price of houses and, as that competition was added to by people coming from outside the Twenty-Six Counties to compete with those resident here, the advent of those people had tended to drive upwards the properties changing hands.  I am sure the 25 per cent. stamp duty will put the resident here and the Irish citizen in a better position to compete with others for Irish property.  It is not true to say that an old colleague of mine, one of the men who fought with me, coming in here from Armagh, would pay 25 per cent. He is an Irish citizen and as such is subject to the lower rate of stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas asked whether this is a temporary measure.  This particular section, covering the alteration of the stamp duty up to 5 per cent. and in some cases up to 25 per cent., was designed to put a brake on the upward movement of property values and to scoop some of the increased value which would otherwise accrue to the vendor into the pockets of the Exchequer, to be spent for very desirable purposes.  Everyone knows that properties changing hands in this city, over the last two or three years particularly, have been increasing in value from month to month.  Houses that sold for £1,500 in one month go on the market for £1,800 in six months' time and for £2,500 in another six months. As long as this stamp duty lasts, the State will sweep in portion of the profits of the vendor&mdash;5 per cent. instead of the normal 1 per cent. they paid heretofore.  I do not know how long this particular stamp duty will last.  Every Minister for Finance from <Col N="1259" /> time to time&mdash;even if it be the same one&mdash;will have to study the surrounding circumstances before he proposes either an increase or a decrease in tax. I am stating what the tax is designed to do and possibly when circumstances change it may be abolished, but I cannot be a prophet in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that only 2 per cent. of the purchasers were non-nationals.  I want to know what percentage of the investments involved in the purchases here was represented by this 2 per cent.  How much did this 2 per cent. of purchasers represent in the amounts spent in purchases? That is the vital figure and not so much the percentage of the sales which fell to foreign buyers.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the trouble is that I do not yet understand what money or capital means.  I suggest that he himself has a great deal to learn, judging by the interpretation he puts upon the facts.  He tells us that people coming in here with what is styled paper money put us in the position that somebody has a corresponding deposit in an English bank and goes on to indicate that this money taken in here which enables the foreigner to get control of Irish land or houses is available for us for purchases abroad.  He went on to say how glad we were to be able to purchase American wheat and Argentine maize.  Have we now reached the stage when we are depending on people coming in from abroad to purchase Irish land and houses in order to purchase wheat from America and maize from the Argentine,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, he pointed out that the interpretation to be put on this statement of Mr. Dalton's was that £10,000,000 of our capital assets had been drawn upon for current expenses.  Where is the Minister trying to lead us?  If it be true that it is possible for us to draw upon our investments abroad for our current living costs, surely it is no argument to make that the purchase of Irish land or houses by foreigners is a desirable way for us to obtain money so that we may buy Argentinian maize or American wheat?  I hope we have <Col N="1260" /> not been reduced to that state yet. Surely those assets which we have abroad, which are a legitimate claim on the goods and services in England, should be drawn upon to a much greater extent first, before we find it necessary to transfer our property to the foreigners, so that we may have available in this commodity which will be taken in exchange for American wheat or Argentine maize?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said nothing to justify what is taking place.  He has not clarified the position, as far as I am concerned, with regard to how much control these people are getting.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dea pointed to one particular case where, if the story follows the line which Senator O'Dea believes it will follow, a foreigner comes in with thoroughbred horses or thoroughbred cattle.  He is bringing something, but many of the others are not.  Senator Sir John Keane talks about the capital they are bringing in.  What in the name of goodness is that?  They are bringing their bare hands and an English cheque book, and they are going to an Irish bank and writing out cheques and getting Irish pound notes with which to live here and which they are going to utilise because their ancestors earned money in England in some generations before.  I see no sense whatever in it. While this section in the Bill has put some hindrance in their way, I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude. It is quite clear that, whatever lecturing he does to me, he himself has a great deal to learn.</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter said I had indicated that we had to sell our property in order to buy or to meet the bill for £10,000,000 extra in imports over exports in a certain period.  I said no such thing.  The lesson I wanted to convey to Senator Baxter was not to sneer at British pounds as bits of paper. The same sneer could be made against American dollars.  They are only bits of paper too, but on that bit of paper is written a promise to pay.  To the extent of £10,000,000, in a certain period in this year, the British honoured those promises to pay.  They met £10,000,000 more than were earned currently. It was in such circumstances that the bit of paper, which Senator <Col N="1261" /> Baxter sneered at, was turned into some petrol, into British goods of one sort or another or into goods from the ends of the earth.  I do not want to sell Irish property here for bits of paper, as Senator Baxter would call them, from England, America or elsewhere. As regards the selling of our property in order to obtain foreign exchange, I wish to goodness we had some means of earning more of it than we are earning at the moment.  That is going to be one of our big difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that I would like to make on that question. I would like to reply to what Senator Duffy and others said on nearly every section of the Bill.  They referred to the fact that there was not any excess profits tax.  That statement was made several times by Senator Duffy.  I was surprised the Minister only dealt with it in a somewhat half-hearted way.  The statement was that the Government was handing back some £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in excess profits tax.  It is simply not true.  Any one with experience or knowledge of business, particularly the manufacturing business, knows perfectly well that the annual profits permitted are controlled by the <Col N="1263" /> Department of Industry and Commerce. When the excess profits tax was removed, the profits were reduced to the extent of that tax.  The tax is not handed back, but there has been a reduction in prices.  If additional profits are made they have to be made by increased turnover.  It is important that that fact should not be ignored in a discussion on a Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>The system is that the prices branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce makes arrangements with every manufacturer as to the total amount of profit which is to be permitted. When there was an excess profits tax on they had to make arrangements which allowed for the payment, in certain cases, of excess profits tax and so as to leave enough to the company to carry on.  When that tax was removed, then in every case that I have knowledge of, the amount which was allowed was consequently reduced, so that the tax is not handed back to the trade.  It possibly may be true in the case of a few businesses or trades which are not controlled.  The number would be extremely small.  I think it is important that I should draw attention to that because I think there is a good deal of misapprehension about it.  I am not now discussing the merits or otherwise of price control, but it is simply not true to assume that this money is now being handed back to individuals in the way of profits. That is not a fact as long as there is price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that we had got to the end of the excess profits controversy.  I am afraid that in the absence of Senator Duffy I will have to reply to what the last Senator has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Senator based his total of £4,000,000 on the last published returns of excess corporation profits tax yield.  It may be that the excess corporation profits tax&mdash;a horrible mouthful&mdash;not being in operation now, the yield would be substantially less&mdash; Senator Douglas says so, at any rate&mdash; than the yield during the war years, when it was in operation.  All I can say is that the persons to blame, the villains of the piece, for high war <Col N="1264" /> profits were the price control department officials, because they were in operation all the time.  Why are they effective now in reducing profits when they were ineffective in the war years? They cannot have it both ways and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I did not really expect the Minister to deal in his reply on Second Reading with the betting tax and I do not intend to say very much further about it now.  I can understand that it is somewhat embarrassing, under the shadow of forthcoming events, to deal in any detail with the principle of increased taxation on betting, but I do postulate this as a general principle: You look to tobacco, a luxury, for revenue; you look to drink, a luxury, for revenue, largely perhaps on account of its ease of administration and the large amounts involved&mdash;I venture to say that they are very large, although I do not know how large they are in comparison with the amounts involved in betting.  Possibly it is not quite so easy to administer a betting tax, but on moral grounds I feel it should be done, and I hope the Minister's Department will examine and get to close quarters with the imposition of a betting tax which will fall on all classes of betters.  That is as far as I go at present.  I feel that it would not only be a very valuable addition to our revenue but would have a good moral purpose.</P>
    <P>It has become a formula in relation to many Government-sponsored companies to have a provision whereby moneys borrowed or advances made are borrowed or made with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I wonder to what extent that is really more than a formula.  Perhaps the Minister does put an active brake&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Harbours Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make a number of changes in the provisions of the Harbours Act that we passed last year.  These changes have resulted from experience of the operation of certain provisions of that Act, or from representations made concerning these provisions by certain harbour authorities.  As each section deals with a separate point I shall have to refer to them singly.  It will be recollected that when introducing the Bill last year I informed the Houses of the Oireachtas that the Government proposed to give financial assistance, where necessary, for the development and restoration of harbour works.</P>
      <P>Arising out of Government policy in that regard, an application was made by Tralee and Fenit Harbour Authority for a grant to cover the full cost of works which involved the construction of a new viaduct, and the widening of the pier, at an estimated expenditure of £100,000.  The Government agreed to give a grant covering the full cost of the work, if the county council remitted entirely an old debt due by the harbour authority to the county council.  The latter body agreed to do so but, on examination of the position, found that it had no legal power to remit it.  One of the provisions of this Bill is to give the county council power to remit that debt, and to allow the agreement regarding Tralee and Fenit Harbours to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point concerns a difficulty that arose in connection with the <Col N="1267" /> election of harbour boards last year. As Senators are aware at these elections owners of ships are entitled to vote.  We thought we had covered all possible combinations which might own ships, in providing for individuals, partnerships and companies, but it appears that at the Arklow Harbour elections, votes were claimed on behalf of certain schooners owned by individuals in partnership with a limited company.  The secretary of the harbour authority as returning officer decided that there was no provision in the Act by which votes might be allowed in respect of these schooners. This is to put that matter right, and to provide for that rather unusual type of ownership in future harbour elections.</P>
    <P>The third point concerns the tender service at Cork Harbour.  Before the war that service was provided by a private firm.  That firm went out of business and Cork Harbour Commissioners decided to restore the tender service when the Atlantic liners began to use the harbour again.  They were fully empowered to do so under the Harbours Act, but they found that the operation of the tender service was involving them in certain losses.  The private company which provided a tender service helped to balance their budget by the process of running excursions down the river from Cork to Cobh on Sundays and holidays during the summer months.  The harbour authorities wish to provide the same facilities and power is given by the provisions of this Bill, enabling them to carry passengers for reward in vessels provided by them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill deals with travelling and subsistence allowances of members of harbour authorities and is designed to bring provisions in this regard into line with corresponding provisions in local government legislation. Senators will remember that in all those matters of detail we tried to keep the provisions of the Harbours Act in line with local government legislation but the local government practice in this regard was changed since this Act was passed.  Under a section of the Principal Act all officers <Col N="1268" /> of harbour authorities are appointed on the recommendations of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  There are, however, a number of small harbours where secretaries and technical officers are part-time persons paid very small salaries, and it is considered impracticable to apply the provisions of the Local Appointments Act to these posts.  It is proposed, therefore, that in the case of certain designated minor harbours the Local Appointments Commission's machinery will not apply, unless the Minister for Industry and Commerce so decides.  When the Harbours Act of 1946 was before the Seanad the question arose as to the possibility of making the service of an individual with a local authority count for pension purposes in harbour authorities' superannuation schemes in the event of that person being transferred from the services of a local authority to a harbour authority.  I undertook to discuss this matter with the Minister for Local Government and, as a result, appropriate provision is made here. Under the Local Government Superannuation Bill now before the Oireachtas the Minister for Local Government is making a corresponding provision in the other direction, that is, to make harbour authority service count for pension purposes in the case of a person transferred to a local authority.</P>
    <P>Under the Cork Harbour Act of 1826 the Cork Harbour Commissioners made an annual payment of £369 4s. 8d. to the Cork Corporation under an agreement in which the Cork Corporation abandoned certain rights that they had to levy dues on certain types of vessels entering the harbour.  There has been some disputation in Cork as to whether this payment should cease. The two bodies have not yet reached agreement but a proposal in this Bill is that the payment shall cease subject to the payment of compensation by the commissioners to the corporation to be fixed, in the absence of agreement, by arbitration.  I am informed that the congestion that is at present noticeable in some of the large ports is attributable, in some degree, to the failure of importing agents to remove goods from the quays and transit sheds within a reasonable time after their importation. Harbour authorities have power <Col N="1269" /> to charge rents for the space occupied by such goods for an excessive period of time which is specified in their bylaws but experience has shown that, in present conditions at all events, some importers prefer to pay the rent than to remove the goods.  To deal with this position the Bill proposes to give harbour authorities power to move goods left on the quays or in the transit sheds, after a reasonable time, and to store them at the expense of the owner after giving him seven days' notice and if they are not removed after a further period to sell the goods after giving 14 days' notice.  These are the only changes in the Harbours Act which have appeared to be necessary following its operation during the past year. Having regard to the length and complex nature of the Act and to its many novel features I think that it can be regarded as satisfactory that the bringing of it into operation, in the varied circumstances of the different ports, did not involve any larger number of changes than this Bill provides for.  None of them are of any great importance and all of them are regarded as desirable and necessary by the harbour authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister if there has been any change?  In my experience of congestion at the North Wall in the old days, the Port and Docks Board could transport the goods to their own warehouses and to the Custom House docks, at the expense of the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board had more powers than <Col N="1270" /> other harbour authorities and, in fact, while they are getting some new powers here, the main consequence of that section is in relation to other harbours, particularly, I think, Cork Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard great complaints about congestion at North Wall and I was wondering if the Port and Docks Board here were ignoring the regulation whereby they can transport the goods to their own warehouses and the Custom House docks.  We know there is a big private warehousing company doing very good and profitable business and I would like to be sure that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are using the powers they have already.  In the old days I have seen great quantities of goods carted from the transit sheds at North Wall to the Custom House docks.  I want to ensure that the Port and Docks authorities are using that power and not allowing congestion to continue there.  For that matter, they could certainly limit the congestion down there.</P>
      <P>While I am on that, I would like to ask the Minister, although it has no direct relationship to this Bill, is he satisfied about the grain handling at present at North Wall, Dublin?  The facilities and machinery there are in the hands of a private company, while all other facilities in the port are maintained by the Port and Docks Board&mdash;I may say the less profitable ones.  While the most profitable machinery in the port for discharging grain is still in the hands of a private company, the Port and Docks Board are not doing anything about it, so far as I know, and there is no provision in the Bill in regard to it.  This private company have practically a monopoly of handling the grain coming in to the Port of Dublin, which is a very profitable trade and it gives them the right to discriminate as to when and how they will discharge ships.  I do not think that is a position that ought to be allowed to continue much longer when we could, on a Port and Docks Bill, take over the grain-handling machinery and facilitate the port and the people of the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the House generally will welcome this Bill.  As <Col N="1271" /> the Minister has pointed out, it deals with a large number of points on which there will be general agreement, and I do not propose to take any part in the debate, except, as Senator Foran has raised it, I would like to emphasise that there is very great dissatisfaction with regard to the position at the Dublin Port.  I am not quite clear from reading the Bill as to exactly how it will operate with regard to the right to remove goods.  At the present moment a charge can be made. According to my information, that charge is less than what would normally be paid for storing the goods almost anywhere else, with the result that certain people have taken advantage of their having an old right to leave the goods there, very much to the detriment of the majority of traders who want to get their goods away.  I may be wrong in this, but I strongly suspect that this is a contributory cause of the very large amount of pilferage which appears to take place, at any rate in transit, or somewhere, at the present moment, and which is an unpleasant feature of trying to carry on business.</P>

    <P>I took it from the Minister&mdash;it was not perfectly clear in the Bill&mdash;that after a time the goods could be transferred to somewhere else but I am not sure that that is going to be very much good because I do not know where else they are going to be transferred to and I do not know where else the port authority is going to find for them, unless they leave them in the open and that, I presume, they would have no particular power to do.  I would not object, after adequate notice, that they should have the power to sell them but I do not think a fortnight would be quite sufficient.  I have no sympathy at all with the people who are not collecting their goods but I have a great deal of sympathy with the people who have been trying to clear their goods and who just cannot manage to do it because of the other people who leave them for a long time, with the result that there is a chaotic position.  A fortnight is not quite sufficient and there would have to be safeguards.  I imagine that the port authority would <Col N="1272" /> not do anything that was unreasonable and I imagine they would make these safeguards but I am not sure, in the case of Dublin, whether it would not be much better to say that if goods were left for a period over two months they could be sold unless the owner could show that he had made reasonable effort to take them away and showed willingness by sending down to take them away but I do not think a fortnight would be satisfactory.  I take it that the Bill does not intend it to be a fortnight.  It is intended that there will be a period of time after which they may be moved to somewhere else and after that to give a certain amount of notice that the goods will be sold. The question is, is there somewhere else to move them to?  To be frank, I do not think there is.</P>

      <P>I happen to be a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board and I would like to assure the House, and particularly Senator Foran, since he raised the point, that this matter of congestion is dealt with at practically every meeting of the board but, as Senator Douglas has stated, no matter what powers the board has to move goods to other sheds, the fact is that we are dealing with an abnormal volume of traffic and have been for some time past and people are trying to criticise the board for being unable to deal with an abnormal degree of traffic in a normal fashion.  The board has recently had before it the scale of charges which, when they come to operate them, are almost penal charges on that type of trader who is consciously misusing the port storage facilities.  When that scale comes in, the manager of the port will have a certain amount of discretionary power but to the ordinary person misusing the port the penalty for his doing so will be so great that he will move them somewhere, if he has to go miles.</P>

      <P>It is a new charge but, since the point has been raised by Senator Foran, it is well to know that the Dublin Port and Docks Board is very much alive to this very pressing problem, because it is actually affecting the trade of the city and country generally.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator O'Dea, I should remind him that most of the ships coming to this country are ships of deeper draught than normally and, in fact, they have to come to Dubline because they have not got berthage depths in other ports to take them. These are some of the things I would like to point out.  I do not wish to anticipate the Minister, who is fully conversant with all the facts and difficulties but as a member of the board, I wanted to let the House know that there is nothing that the board itself can do that is not being done to alleviate a condition of affairs which the board itself is very sorry to see but which it cannot do more than it is doing at present to alleviate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board have, as Senator Foran said, the power to remove goods to the Custom House Docks.  They have, I believe, exercised that power but the extent to which they can deal with the present problem through that power is limited owing to the limited space at the Custom House Docks.  The proposal in the Bill is that the harbour authority may remove goods which have been left unduly long on the quays or in the transit sheds, after seven days notice to the owner, to any place where the goods can be removed to and subject to the cost of removal and the cost of storage being recoverable from the owners of the goods.  If there is a further delay in removing the goods then, after 14 days' notice, the harbour authority may sell the goods and recover its outgoings from the proceeds.  These powers may not be completely effective in solving this problem of congestion, which is acute at the present time, but they are the best that have been suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not comment on the matter of the grain plant at the North Wall. <Col N="1274" /> I have received no representations from anybody, either the harbour authority or the importers of grain, concerning the arrangement there, so on a general principle I assume it is working satisfactorily and prefer to leave it alone.</P>
    <P>The congestion at the Port of Dublin is due to a number of causes and it could not be relieved by the exercise of any powers which I have to direct traffic to other ports.  I have no power to direct shipping anywhere.  Where a ship unloads goods is solely a matter for the owner of the goods and follows on the arrangements he makes with shippers.  I do not know whether there would be any desire that I should take power to direct the port of importation of goods.  I think it would be an undesirable power to have and would involve a degree of interference with commerce which would be quite considerable. I am aware that many harbour authorities are dissatisfied with the fact that trade which formerly came to them in smaller ships is now going to larger ports in larger ships. Apparently, they have the impression that I have something to do with it. I want to make it as clear as I can that I have nothing to do with it, that I have no power to interfere in these matters.</P>
    <P>Part of the congestion at Dublin&mdash; not the congestion on the quays or in transit sheds&mdash;is due to the fact that the bulk of the American coal which has been imported came through Dublin.  It all came through Dublin and Cork.  That is also a matter of grievance with the harbour authorities at Waterford, Limerick and several smaller ports.  The explanation is that the American authorities licensed that coal for export in circumstances which make it possible to ship it only in vessels of 10,000 tons.  I investigated fully the possibility of getting the parcels of coal, separately licensed by the United States authorities, divided up so that half of each consignment would be carried in smaller ships that could enter the ports of Waterford, Limerick and so on; and I found that to attempt it would not merely involve friction with the American authorities and difficulty at the American port of <Col N="1275" /> shipment but also considerable risk that part of the cargo of coal would not be obtained at all.  That problem will ease next year.  The expectation that the importation of coal from Great Britain will develop on a much larger scale than this year means that all these smaller ports of the country, for which the coal trade was their main bread and butter line, can now hope for a revival of that trade.</P>
    <P>The coal coming from Great Britain will, of course, come in smaller ships which could be discharged at the smaller ports.  Up to the present, the bulk of our coal was American coal and, because of arrangements made with the American authorities, could not be shipped in smaller boats than the large vessels which could unload only in Dublin and Cork.  In fact, even to get them unloaded in Cork, they had to be lightened down the river.  The other causes of congestion are the fact that a larger proportion of our total imports is coming direct from countries of origin and not through British merchant houses as previously and that there is, of course, a general tendency towards larger ships which have been found more economical of operation.</P>
    <P>The Government is particularly anxious to develop the secondary harbours of the country.  It is proposing to spend a great deal of money in assisting those harbour authorities to develop their harbours and equip them with modern machinery for rapid unloading and enable them to handle larger vessels and turn them round with greater speed.  Unfortunately, a lot of the work that we were prepared to finance cannot be expeditiously done because of difficulty about procuring material and equipment and also because of a scarcity of marine engineers, engineers who are specially skilled in harbour works.  Those who are in the service of the Board of Works are so fully employed that they cannot take on any further duties for a considerable time ahead and we are at present considering the possibility of obtaining the services of private consulting engineers, so as to enable the harbour development projects to go ahead with greater speed than at present seems possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> However, my sole purpose in referring to these matters is to endeavour again to make it clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no power to direct traffic in ships to any port and thinks it, on the whole, undesirable that he should have that power.</P>

    <Title>Minerals Company Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended to make certain provisions in regard to our minerals company, Mianraí Teoranta, to provide for the winding up of certain activities in which it was engaged heretofore arising out of the emergency and to define its future functions.  Senators are probably familiar with the circumstances which led to the intervention of the State in the working of the mineral resources of the country and are aware that the main Act, the Minerals Development Act, 1940, is based on the assumption that the working of our mineral resources is primarily a matter for private enterprise.  That is still Government policy.  The State has taken action to secure the working of some mineral resources only where the propositions were of a character not likely to appeal to private enterprise, because they might not prove to be profitable, or to ensure the maximum production of certain essential materials which could not be imported during the war years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, the company was two companies, one the Slievardagh Coalfield Company set up to develop the Slievardagh coalfields, and the other the Minerals Company which had a wider authority in mineral exploration and development work.  Later, for the purpose of economy and better working, the two companies were amalgamated and the Minerals Company has carried on the Slievardagh coalfield workings since then.  We endeavoured <Col N="1277" /> to dispose of the Slievardagh coalfield to private enterprise but no offer was received.  It was then decided to authorise the Minerals Company to continue working there.  The anthracite coal produced there is still very scarce, and all the circumstances which justified State intervention for the working of that coalfield still exist.  If, however, there is to be a continuation of the working at Slievardagh, then more capital will have to be put in in order to get the best results there, and to bring the enterprise to the stage of profitable working.  If it is brought to the stage of profitable working, then I should hope that another effort to dispose of the property might be more successful.  If it cannot be brought to the stage of profitable working it will be closed down.  One of the provisions in the Bill is to empower the company to carry on the Slievardagh coalfield working and to enable the Minister for Finance to make further advances for capital purposes to a limit of £50,000 for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The main activity of this company during the war years was in the production of phosphate rock in the County Clare and pyrites in the County Wicklow, both commodities required in the production of an artificial fertiliser. During the war there was considerable difficulty in obtaining these materials, and when obtained they were at a very high cost, and in the case of pyrites, particularly, a very heavy subsidy had to be paid in order to make the artificial fertiliser available at a price at which it could be used.  So far as the rock and the pyrites produced at home were concerned, the company were instructed to produce regardless of cost.  We were concerned only with the tonnage they turned out and not with the methods they adopted to secure tonnage.  These methods were often very makeshift because they were unable to procure proper equipment, particularly for the working of the Avoca mines where the pyrites were, and the company involved itself in a substantial loss.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed that these commercial workings of the company should cease entirely.  A programme for mineral exploration and development <Col N="1278" /> work has been prepared by the company in consultation with a number of international experts.  That programme envisages a thorough examination of all mineral deposits where there are any possibilities of commercial working at all, and their development to the stage at which private enterprise might be interested in taking them to the further stage of commercial working.  It is proposed to finance these activities of the company by means of non-repayable advances to a limit of £85,000 a year for seven years. That is the estimated cost of the full programme.  It is clear, therefore, that the company will have no undertaking, apart from the Slievardagh coalfield, which would enable it to earn any money, and, consequently, there is no means by which the loss incurred on the war-time working and which was met by advances from the Exchequer, can be recouped, or the advances from the Exchequer repaid. There is little point in leaving the loss outstanding when the company has no means of meeting it.  The proposal in the Bill is that an estimate will be made of all the assets of the company. When the value of the assets is determined in that way they will be deducted from the outstanding sums due by the company which amount to £414,000.  When the amounts representing the actual assets of the company are ascertained they will be regarded as advances to the company from the Department of Finance and the balance will be wiped out.</P>
    <P>The seven year development programme will, it is estimated, cost £595,000 in all.  It is a detailed programme involving geological and geophysical surveys, diamond core drilling, sinking of shafts and, where minerals of commercial value are found, the development of these minerals to the point at which commercial working could begin.  It is not intended that the company itself will engage in commercial working.  If they locate and develop commercial minerals it will be their concern to induce other operators to do the commercial working.  It is, of course, possible that they may not find any deposits at all which would yield commercial possibilities.  There <Col N="1279" /> are many indications that such deposits exist.  The reports received from the various consultants suggest that useful results are likely to follow from this exploration work.  If exploration results in the discovery of a commercially workable deposit, then in disposing of the company's interest in that deposit to whatever firm proposes to work it commercially the amount expended in the exploration and development work will be recovered.</P>
    <P>If there is no such satisfactory result from its work, the only thing we can say is that we will have as a consequence of this seven years' exploration programme a complete picture of our mineral resources.  It may be that decisions will have to be taken that certain of these mineral resources, like the phosphate rock in the County Clare, should not be worked commercially at times when supplies from other countries are available.  In the case of that phosphate rock, for example, it is the only known deposit of that mineral there is in the country, and the feeling is that it should be left there as a sort of iron ration against another international situation in which imported rock could not be obtained.  Similarly, the same thing might happen in relation to other minerals.  There are prospects of some metallurgical ores being found here. The mere existence of the ores is of no value unless there are commercial firms which could process them and bring the metals to the stage where they would be of commercial use.</P>
    <P>It may be asked where the line of demarcation would be drawn between the activities of the geological survey and the Mineral Development Company. The geological survey is concerned mainly with the preparation of reports on the mineral resources of the country, from the study of surface indications and of records of old workings. It endeavours from data of that kind to give an opinion of the commercial possibilities of known minerals, but there is no effective method of actually determining the value of any mineral deposit except by boring in the <Col N="1280" /> first instance, and, if that boring suggested it to be desirable, by the sinking of shafts.  All that work must be done, in any event, before commercial working becomes possible, and it will be the function of the Minerals Company to do that development work which will follow on the preliminary survey carried out by the Geological Survey Department.  The indications are that, when this seven year programme has been completed, unless some new functions are given to this company in the meantime, the need for the company's existence will terminate, on the assumption of course, that, by that stage, the Slievardagh property will have been disposed of to someone else or written off as a bad venture.</P>
    <P>The general principle is that mineral working on a commercial scale, if undertaken here at all, should be done by private enterprise.  I think it is by far the best method.  On our present system, private enterprise comes in on the profitable undertakings and the State takes the leavings and always loses on the leavings; but it is undesirable that we should have State enterprise and private enterprise working together in the same field, and it was with a considerable amount of relief that I secured the Government decision that this company should withdraw from the particular activities in which it engaged during the war and should concentrate upon what was intended to be its task, mineral exploration and development.  We have still to leave it with the Slievardagh undertaking on its hands because we still need the coal which is being produced in Slievardagh and cannot get anyone else to produce it.  They are, however, quite optimistic that, subject to certain further developments, which will involve some capital expenditure, the Slievardagh colliery can be brought to a stage of profitable working and there is evidence given that it can continue on that basis, so that there may be better prospects in the future of being able to dispose of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Bill, I think we have to look at it from the point of view of the moral or lesson it teaches us in respect of Government <Col N="1281" /> promotion of commercial enterprise or activities.  Senator Sweetman moved a motion last April which attempted to define what was the proper sphere of Government interference in commercial enterprise and when I attempted to outline certain principles which should govern such action, in view of the undoubtedly increasing tendency, though not always mistaken, for the Government to take an increasing part in such work, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know of any useful purpose to be served by discussing an abstract issue like this.  Let me say at the outset, so that the Government's position will be understood, that when we decided upon the establishment of statutory corporations, of semi-State companies, to conduct commercial enterprises we were concerned only with the best way of getting a particular job well done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Here we have a concrete issue and I think we have a right to go back on the past history of this entire mineral development in order to understand if it has been a job well done and to see whether we cannot possibly learn lessons for future State enterprise.  We do not get many opportunities of doing this and here is one which I think should be examined.</P>
      <P>The origin of this enterprise goes back to 1941, to two Bills which were passed in that year.  The first was a Bill to develop the Slievardagh collieries and the then Minister, who is now Minister for Local Government, in dealing with the prospects of the enterprise, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These facts in themselves do not, of course, make certain that large returns in the way of dividends may be expected for any money invested in the establishment of the colliery at Slievardagh.  All they do is provide sufficient justification for saying that there is a very good chance that the undertaking can be made self-supporting in a reasonably short time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six years have elapsed and we are writing off quite a substantial sum in respect of that and its conjoint or sister enterprise, the Minerals Bill of the same year.  At this stage I think we might pause and look at the last <Col N="1282" /> accounts of the Slievardagh company. These show a liability of £92,471 in respect of State advances and accrued interest.  I do not know whether the Minister at present regards that as a good asset or not, but I think we are justified in concluding that it is not a good asset when we come to relate it to the total sum now proposed to be written off.</P>
    <P>At that stage I may pause and examine the capital structure of the Slievardagh company.  Here again is a point of principle&mdash;the proper method of financing these enterprises. This was an enterprise which had to incur very considerable capital expenditure and yet there was only a nominal capital of £100 created.  I do not say that there is not justification in certain instances for promoting companies with a nominal capital, companies which hold little or few assets where existing companies do the work&mdash;companies for handling commodities, such as Tea Importers, Limited, or Fuel Importers, Limited, who have practically no fixed assets, but I say it is wrong in principle for a company which is going to incur considerable expenditure in development, which owns assets of greater or lesser value like a coal-mine, to be financed in that way.  Yet now, having failed to sell this company&mdash;and unfortunately we have failed&mdash;to any private bidder &mdash;I do not know if any bid at all was made&mdash;we are going to continue its working with the same bad and objectionable capital structure.  We are going to put more loan money into it and leave the capital at a sum of £100. At this stage I do not suppose it matters what we do, but it will serve as a lesson as to the wrong method of financing companies which are to carry on commercial enterprise. That or some other company was created and it had an Irish name that I am afraid I will not attempt to pronounce. It was the Minerals Exploration Company. As the Minister says, that company was going to work independently at Slievardagh and going to do both mining and developing.  I rather gathered that the Minister suggested this company was only going to <Col N="1283" /> do mining.  In practice, it did mining almost entirely, but it had power to do developing as is now proposed in this Bill.  I shall read an extract from a speech that I made six years ago in reference to the Bill that was then before the House.  I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whatever the objections may be to the method of providing fixed capital adopted in the Industrial Alcohol Act, in the case of an enterprise which was intended to give us a substitute for imported petrol, and which I now understand is not being operated at all, it seems rather roundabout and rather misleading to apply loans which are going to bear a rate of interest and be repaid.  As far as I can see, there is no conceivable prospect of a company like this earning anything and being in a position to repay loans and interest.  It is rather a pretence that we should put it in that form.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this case my prophecy has come true, and it is now proposed to write off advances that have been made. When we come to examine the sums written off, I am puzzled.  When I take the accounts of the two companies, I find that the total repayable advances without making any set off for assets amount with interest to £92,201 plus £201,000 or about £300,000.  Now, after making allowance for assets, the amount has risen to £440,000.  The only conclusion I can come to about these two companies' affairs is that they have been leading a pretty gay life in the last two years with the £100,000 advanced with interest, making no allowance for assets.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to explain how the amount is so rapidly out of proportion to its earlier growth.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which might only indirectly affect the Minister. Now that he is going to increase the number of these enterprises we should know where we stand.  I raised this matter on the Finance Act.  When I examined the assets of the State in the Finance Accounts I found that most of the advances made under this Act are not included in the tables in the accounts which show State assets. <Col N="1284" /> Other advances of a comparable kind are shown.  I think that is a matter that can be explained and that the House would like to have.  We have now reached the stage when Slievardagh is to be continued and a further £50,000 is going to do what £92,000 failed to do.  It is hard to measure the extent of success or failure of Slievardagh, because I can find no satisfactory commercial figures dealing with it.  There are annual reports of which I got one.  There are reports of its activities, but there is merely a total figure of the coal mined, but no costs or costings.</P>
    <P>I feel that if the State is going to enter on commercial enterprises it should adopt commercial methods.  No businessman and no company would dare to give such flagrant information as is given.  I think the whole method of financing and controlling these State enterprises is not satisfactory, the worst of all being in connection with steel, which we will have before us some day for the third time, possibly to wipe off the losses.  What I say is that Government methods in these matters are not business methods, as there is no method of accounting, and the shareholders, having no information, are in the dark.  It will be said, of course, that we must get coal anywhere we can get it and at any price. In a short time we may be able to export coal, but in the meantime we are going to put another £50,000 on top of £90,000 in Slievardagh and we can only hope for better results.  I hope we will be told what the results are fairly soon after the event.</P>
    <P>I cannot offer any valid objection now, but I think it is right with regard to mineral development to let it be done by Government enterprise.  There it is not so dangerous.  No great assets are created and the work is merely exploratory. If we find something with the £500,000 we are sanctioning, well and good.  It is a legitimate risk, but it is most unfortunate that we should wake up now to find that we have put £414,000 into this enterprise when prices were very high, with practically no limit to what could be charged for commodities during the war.  In spite of that, we were made <Col N="1285" /> pay the full price for the anthracite that the company got for Fuel Importers and I think the fertiliser companies paid through the nose for what they got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Sir John Keane's point, but I think this Bill will be regarded by the community as a good Bill.  It clearly explains to the ordinary citizen the alluring picture that the Tánaiste painted.  As I understood him, it is proposed to have a complete and exhaustive report on mineral resources as regards procedure, drilling and sinking shafts.  If there is one thing more than another on which confusion exists, it concerns the lack of knowledge of our mineral resources.  If the extent of these resources could be discovered within seven years, I think time and money would be thoroughly well spent in doing so.</P>
      <P>We have to remember that exploratory work of this kind is work that can be done only by a Government. Obviously no private enterprise or concern can be let loose over the Twenty-Six Counties to discover for themselves what mineral resources we have.  Private enterprise at this stage would be confronted with difficulties that could not be surmounted.  The Government can, under the power it possesses, do certain things on privately owned land by way of discovering what minerals are under the surface of the land.  I welcome this Bill because we will be in a much better position to know just what mineral resources we have in this country but I wonder does the community realise what the Bill actually is.  It is going to set in motion a complete and exhaustive exploration of the mineral resources of the country and having ascertained exactly what they are it is going to submit these resources to industrially-minded and business-minded sections of the community who will do their share not merely in the development of something that is to their own good but to the good of the nation as a whole.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister has reached a very satisfactory stage in relation to industrial development when <Col N="1286" /> he and Senator Sir John Keane are much at the same level.  Senator Sir John Keane was very critical of the attitude of the Government's industrial development plans five or six years ago.  Now he is beginning to change: the Government is coming around to his way of thinking and he does not mind paying out £50,000 to see an end of at least more State enterprise. Senator Summerfield is somewhat different.  He is willing to vote money for research and exploration but then, I hope I am not misrepresenting him, when all the work is done, when dividends are in sight, it will be handed over to private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I am satisfied. As I see it, the aim of the Government, represented here by the Minister, is to use public money for the purposes of exploration, surveys, boring and general development and having got the facts up to a point where the investors with capital can calculate a rate of dividends, to hand over the whole show to the people who want to make dividends.  The people for whom Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Summerfield speak are not concerned with producing coal; they are concerned with making profits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>You can produce coal without making profits, but I grant you that you cannot make profits without the coal.  This is the attitude of the Government at a time when one of the great coal producing countries of the world has abandoned private ownership in the production of coal and has assumed for the State the right to explore and develop its coal mining industry from the pithead to the transport ship.  It is admitted by everybody, by papers like the <i>Sunday Times</i>, the <i>Observer</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i>, that there was an unanswerable case in Britain for the nationalisation of the coalfields because private enterprise is concerned with getting coal in the cheapest possible manner so as to make the largest amount of profit.</P>

      <P>But look at the heritage they left to the present people.  Five hundred years of reckless misuse and waste of the nation's assets is the heritage they have left.  That is what is being pleaded for in this House and I hope there are people on both sides of the House who are prepared to stand against it and prepared to insist that the industrial resources of our country are not going to get into the hands of people who are not concerned with the production of goods or the production of food or the building of houses but merely with making profits. The Minister's attitude is inexplicable in view of the fact that only a couple of hours ago another Minister and colleague of his proclaimed himself as a socialist Minister for Finance and denounced us as Tories.  Another Minister will describe us as Communists but this does not matter. Actually a few hours ago a Minister described us as Tories because we protested against taxing the working man's pint of stout instead of the rich man's bottle of champagne.  Now the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a different story.  He told us that his interest in industrial development is to prepare the ground so that when the industrial field is developed it can be handed over to private enterprise.</P>

I remember reading, some years ago, the report of the debate that took place in this House or its predecessor when the proposal was first made to establish the Electricity Supply Board and to develop the Shannon as a source of electrical energy.

The answer is, it could.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane will agree now that that scheme has been a gigantic success.  It has measured up to our greatest expectations.  It has generated more electrical plant than we believed possible 20 years ago and it has sold the current as cheaply as any undertaking of its kind in the world sold current.</P>

      <P>I will not trespass on the time of the House by going into this matter further.  I do, however, suggest that where our State has undertaken to do a job, got the right people to do it, undertaken the job on a big scale, put enthusiasm and energy into it, it has been a success and nobody has alleged otherwise.  But I doubt if all the undertakings of the State measure up to that standard.  I am very much afraid that where there is limited success, where there is in fact a measure of failure, it is because the Government were remiss, not because State enterprise is a failure.  I consider that the State can get for its services the best equipped men and women in the country.  They can get as engineers, doctors, advisers in any technical capacity, the best brains we have if they are prepared to pay them and to give them the facilities to do the job that is entrusted to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do suggest, however, that in this country there is a tendency on the part of the Government to seek cheapness rather than competence. Evidence of that is to be found in <Col N="1290" /> many cases.  In fact, there was some evidence of it in the case of the Shannon scheme.  The Government of the day introduced an exceptionally low standard of wages for workmen and an exceptionally low standard of salary for professional people on the scheme. That practice exists to-day.  Where there is failure in relation to a State enterprise it is due entirely to the fact that the State has not sought the services of those most competent and best skilled to do the job required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point I would like to submit to the House. Whenever we are in difficulties, if there is a war, or famine, or some exceptional circumstances, we all look to the State to come to our aid.  We are willing to tolerate the State during war or emergency to get us fuel of any kind, to keep the trains running, to keep the Post Office delivering our letters and telegrams, but the moment the emergency is past, private enterprise is glorified.  Now, why is it that this great institution, that has been defended so eloquently by Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Summerfield, obviously and admittedly breaks down the moment a crisis comes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>

      <P>Somebody said the sun never sets on the British Empire because God could not trust her in the dark.  The sun never sets on private enterprise because God cannot trust it in the dark.  Certainly, we do not trust it in crisis.  When there is a war, famine or emergency, we give the State unlimited powers&mdash;emergency powers <Col N="1291" /> Acts, emergency powers Orders galore &mdash;in order to ensure that we are provided with food, clothing, fuel, transport&mdash;the things we need&mdash;all the things which private enterprise will willingly provide for us in times of peace and security for anything from 5 to 25 per cent. profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with a considerable amount of surprise, to find that on the Minerals Company Bill, of all Bills, Senator Duffy finds a suitable occasion to show the benefit of State enterprise.  I wish him luck with the Bill and I hope he publishes the Bill and the results, together with his speech.  It seems to me that, as far as this is concerned, it is largely a matter of tweedle-dum, tweedle-dee.  It is like, to some extent, some of our other institutions which are private enterprises and controlled by the State. There is a certain type of enterprise in this country which, whether it is in the hands of private people or in the hands of the State, the State is jolly well going to control it, at any rate, under present circumstances, and it makes extremely little difference whether the money is found by the State by borrowing from the people by a loan at 2½, 3 and 3½ per cent., or whether the money is found in the form of capital, as in the case of Córas Iompair Éireann, which is supposed to be a private enterprise, but the State guarantees a dividend of so much per cent.  I may be weak in intellect, but I cannot see any fundamental difference and I cannot see that one is particularly capitalist any more than the other is particularly Socialist.  I am inclined, personally, to think that they are both symptoms of the tendency towards Socialism, which has been going on for a considerable time in this country, but, apparently, Senator Duffy does not think so.  That is because he is very proud of having been called a Conservative by the Minister for Finance. He has repeated it twice in the House to-day and his pride in it surprises me.  But is not this a case <Col N="1292" /> where you could not have got private enterprise to have operated it without some guarantee from the State? Either you would have had a guarantee of so much repayment of capital or a guarantee of so much interest or a guarantee of special facilities in some other form.  If you had not that, there would be too much risk involved.  It is easily arguable that you should not touch these things with the State and should do without them; and it might quite well prove in the case of Slievardagh that it would be better if left alone.  Although I am as ready as any one else to criticise the Government, I am not satisfied, when it comes to attempting to try and mine our mineral resources, that we should indulge in wild and indiscriminate criticism. I think any Party in power, whether now or in the future, will have to be prepared in certain cases to take some risks.  Whether that is done by means of private enterprise, so called, with Government guarantees, Government control and Government interference, the fact remains that it will be a risk until some particular point is reached.  The Minister is hopeful and I hope he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I do not see that it matters very much, after the seven years' plan which he has indicated, if it is not a paying proposition, whether the State gets the money, provided it gets adequate payment, whether in the form of interest on the money or because it saves paying a State loan.  I do not think there is much difference.  There is no possibility of the production of coal, electricity or gas, or any other commodity of that kind being entirely free from State control in regard to price, in any time that I or my children are likely to see.  It is quite obvious that there is no very fundamental principle concerned as to exactly how it is to be worked.  It is obvious that if there is coal there we should try to get it and be prepared to take some risks.  You could go mad and go on spending and spending with a vague hope of success.  I understand the Minister's idea is to try for seven years and then see what the position is.  In every debate in this House here <Col N="1293" /> to-day that we have had to deal with, we have had reference to the election. I am not going to say what Government may have to deal with this in seven years, and all we can do is deal with the facts and accept a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>In an old cookery book, there was once a famous recipe for making hare soup&mdash;the first direction being &ldquo;Catch your hare.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the object of this Bill is to catch the hare, and after you have caught it, that is to say, after you have discovered what mineral resources we have, that is, after the seven years' survey, the question might remain to be debated as to who is best fitted to cook the hare or in what method we can get the best soup out of the hare. We might leave to that time the discussion as to whether our mineral development is to be by private enterprise or under state control.  I do not think we commit ourselves to either in this Bill. We do certainly recognise the fact that private enterprise could not do what this Bill proposes to do.  The discussion in other respects is not relevant.  By the end of seven years, if Senator Duffy has not adhered more closely to the Tory Party, he will find out the results of the nationalisation of coal-mines and other things in neighbouring countries, and by that time we will be able to come to a more reasoned conclusion as to the best means of facing our particular problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be no harm to get certain facts right.  As regards the Slievardagh collieries, the first action taken by the Government was to employ a very eminent firm of consulting engineers to give a report on the coal deposits there.  We had acquired the mineral rights over the area, from a number of private owners, before arranging for the expert report. That expert report indicated that there was a substantial quantity of good quality coal capable of successful commercial development.  The report was placed in the Geological Survey, its existence was publicised and any person interested in getting a licence to work the coalfield was invited to inspect the report, to get the information <Col N="1294" /> which the Government had procured at some expense and utilise it in making a proposal for the leasing of the coal areas.  Nothing happened; nobody proposed to work the coal deposits; and the report lay in the office of the Geological Survey, the coal lay at Slievardagh, and nothing was done about it.</P>
      <P>Then came the war, and with the war a shortage of coal.  When the shortage became acute, it was natural enough for us to remember that there was a report from an eminent firm of coal mining engineers that there existed at Slievardagh a substantial quantity of workable coal.  We decided that, in the circumstances, an effort should be made to get that coal worked and, as no private concern was willing to do it, we set up a State company for the purpose, telling them to go in and work the coal.</P>
      <P>That company made losses, but I want to tell the House how that arose. At an early stage, when I was in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce, some time after the company had been formed and commenced work, the directors of that company said to me: &ldquo;If this were our property, because of the difficulties we have encountered in obtaining equipment, recruiting skilled miners and other causes, we would close down until the war is over, as it would be the sensible thing to do to shut down until normal conditions are restored and work the deposit of coal then with the best equipment we can procure.&rdquo;  Remember that in any mining proposition there is only a limited life.  A boot factory or a flour mill can keep on turning out boots or flour as long as the raw materials are coming in at the other end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Question.  Machinery must be replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The machinery may have to be renewed, but so long as the machinery is renewed they can continue the work&mdash;and there are flour mills which have gone on here for a thousand years.  On the other hand, when there is a deposit of coal, it may be a deposit of 2,000,000 or 10,000,000 tons of coal, and no more.  It took 2,000,000 years of <Col N="1295" /> chemical action to produce that quantity of coal, and when you have mined it all you have nothing left and the enterprise folds up.  Therefore, any private commercial concern owning a mineral deposit will, if necessary, postpone the exploitation of that deposit until it can be done in the most economical way, with the most modern equipment and the most skilful advice and assistance to enable it to work at a profit.  The directors of the company said to me: &ldquo;If this were a private company, we would shut down until the war is over.&rdquo;  They also said: &ldquo;If we can procure the equipment we need and recruit a corps of skilled miners, we would develop the property in a particular way, which, however, would mean that we would not be producing coal in any quantity for about two years.&rdquo;  I said to them: &ldquo;We are concerned with getting that coal now and getting it in the greatest quantity and in the quickest time possible; and you are to ignore the ordinary rules of commercial operation to which you have referred; you are to develop the deposit, not in the way that the experts advise would be the best way, but in whatever way will get us the most coal in the least possible period of time.&rdquo; That is why the colliery was developed in the particular way in which it was developed.</P>
      <P>It is true that some of the information contained in the Johnston Report which was published in the Geological Survey did not prove to be accurate, when the actual development work had occurred.  The company's own technical staff have now advised us that they can make the deposit commercially workable at a profit, subject to development in a more scientific way.  That is what the new capital is for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear here and now that I contemplate that that mine will be worked at a profit&mdash;a profit calculated on the soundest calculating principles&mdash;and that if it does not work at a profit we will close it down. I want that to be clear, not merely here but to all those who may be in any way interested in, or associated with, the working of the undertaking. The State does not intend to keep putting <Col N="1296" /> in more and more money to enable it to be carried on at a loss, particularly as it is an enterprise of a kind which, in normal circumstances, would be in no competition with other privately owned enterprises in the same locality.</P>
    <P>The minerals company, to which Senator Sir John Keane referred, was, however, of a different kind.  It was set up by the State to carry out mineral exploration work.  It was primarily intended to do the type of exploration work that we propose it should do now. Again, however, there emerged these war-time difficulties, and we had to get somebody to undertake the production of the phosphate rock and pyrites required for the production of artificial fertilisers.  This company was told to do it, and told to do it with whatever equipment they could get and in whatever manner would yield the largest tonnage of both.  Again, the actual cost of mining was a secondary consideration. Private enterprise might have gone in to work the pyrites but only on the payment of heavy subsidies. We bought pyrites in Spain and sold them at a subsidised price to superphosphate manufacturers because the Government was concerned not merely in keeping up the supply of superphosphates but in making them available to farmers at a price which would have relation to the current level of agricultural prices.  There was no point in going through the formality of making this company charge an economic price which would enable it to recover its total outgoings, and then paying it a subsidy.  The method of letting it carry on on advances from the Government had the same result in the long run, and was much more simple in operation.</P>
    <P>The company, of course, had all the difficulties in working the pyrites deposit and the phosphate rock that the Slievardagh company had in working the Slievardagh coalfield, including particularly the difficulty of getting modern, up-to-date equipment. During the war it had to work on makeshift plant, and some part of the loss which has to be written off now represents the purchase price of <Col N="1297" /> that plant.  It is not suitable if more modern equipment can be procured.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane referred to the method of financing these companies by repayable advances.  From the point of view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to enterprises of this kind, it is much more suitable to have companies formed with share capital and with legislation empowering the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares on that basis than if the State, through the Minister for Finance, was investing money permanently in business.  The Minister for Finance thinks that is a bad system on which to manage the State's finances.  He much prefers that the amounts advanced should be regarded as repayable and not as a permanent investment in these undertakings. He thinks that they should be repayable so that if profits are earned the total capital investment of the State will, eventually, be recovered. I think, from the viewpoint of good financial principles, that is a better system, although if the State is to enter on any scale into commercial working it will clearly have to do so in many cases upon the basis of a permanent investment.  I should have thought that Senator Sir John Keane would have preferred the system of financing these activities by means of repayable advances rather than by a permanent investment.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield did not fully appreciate the fact that this Bill is merely an addendum to the legislation already passed, and that this company, Mianraí Teoranta, is there ready to undertake this development programme, with the necessary plans made, and with some part of the staff needed and requiring only the money for which this Bill makes provision. Senator Duffy has the reputation of being the brains of the Labour Party. He is, obviously, not the keeper of its conscience.  When he quotes me as saying that the proposal is that when all the preparatory work on mineral exploration has been done, and when dividends are in sight the business will be handed over to private enterprise, he is guilty of gross misrepresentation. I did not say that.</P>
    <Col N="1298" />
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that when this company has proved the existence of a mineral deposit and has developed it to the stage at which commercial working can begin, it will then endeavour to dispose of its interest in it to private enterprise on the basis that it will recover for itself the whole of the cost which it has already incurred.  But that is not the stage at which dividends are in sight. It is the stage at which any company coming in to work minerals has to make big investments and take great risks.  There are international mining combines.  One came in here and did a great deal of exploration work in Waterford with our consent and approval.  They explained to me their method of working.  They spent large sums of money investigating mineral deposits in various parts of the world, losing heavily on exploration work.  In the first, second, third, fourth, fifth or eighth attempt they may find nothing, but in the next attempt they may strike some valuable deposit.  In the ninth or tenth attempt they will get back out of the working of that deposit all that they had lost in their previous exploration work.  That is the way they work. That method of working is not possible here.  Even where private enterprise undertakes small scale mining operations the position is that the State comes in at the present time and assists in the clearing of overburdens, the construction of roads and in all the unproductive expenditure which private people are naturally reluctant to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case we are anxious to obtain information concerning the mineral resources of the country not primarily with a view to ensuring their commercial development, but primarily with a view to having knowledge so that we will know what the resources of the country are. As I said before, we may, even in relation to some classes of minerals, decide that it is preferable that they should be left there as a reserve against some future emergency, and that their <Col N="1299" /> present development should not be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy also said that there was an unanswerable case in Great Britain for the nationalisation of the coal-mines.  I am not going to dispute that with him, but it is typical of the logic of his Party that he assumes that, because there is an unanswerable case for the nationalisation of the coal-mines in England, there is also an unanswerable case for the nationalisation of the coal-mines here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At the time Britain was nationalising the coal-mines we were selling out the only nationally owned concern that we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, there is substantial difference between our circumstances and those in Great Britain.  In Great Britain all the coal used there is produced in Great Britain.  In normal times they produce a substantial surplus for export.  There is no problem there of bringing a nationalised, or State-owned concern, into conflict with other private producers or private traders.  Here, at the most, 10 per cent. of our total supplies of coal will be produced by all our coal-mines and that coal is sold and must be sold in times of normal supply in competition with far larger quantities imported from abroad and imported by private commercial trading concerns.</P>

    <P>There is another difference.  In Great Britain, the mining rights were owned by private individuals, and a large part of the case for nationalisation of the coal-mines was based on the objection to the payment of what were known as royalties to private individuals. Here practically all the mineral rights are owned by the State, and if there is any royalty payment resulting from the exploration of minerals, they are paid to the State. If we transfer the Slievardagh coal-mines or give a mining lease to any company to work in that coalfield or elsewhere, they will have to pay to the State whatever royalty is fixed on the <Col N="1300" /> lease, because the mining rights are State property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no; only in relation to unworked minerals, but these coal-mines were not unworked minerals. There is no need in this case to discuss these theoretical considerations.  I have said here, and I repeat, that, when the Government adopts a particular method of securing some commercial result, it does so on the simple principle of finding the best way to do it and not because of any theoretical idea in favour of State enterprise or any particular form of nationalised operation.  In this case, we think the best method of getting mineral development done is by private enterprise.  I do not think it is desirable that the State should go into mineral development work and I will give the Seanad one good reason.  I have discovered, from my years as Minister for Industry and Commerce, dealing with matters of this kind, that if there is one thing which will absorb money without limit it is a mining enterprise, because always the technicians will tell you, when you have gone underground, dug your tunnels, sunk your shafts and located perhaps only an unsatisfactory deposit of ore: &ldquo;Go on a bit further.  Go another 100 yards and you will find it&rdquo;, and, of course, the State, with theoretically unlimited resources and unwilling to admit that it has run into a failure, will keep going on.  I would lay down as a golden rule that mining works should be done by people with a limited amount of money who must stop when their money has gone, because in that way they will not merely be forced to ensure every possible economy but will be prevented from being tempted into this continuous repetition of expenditure upon exploration and development work. That is one very practical reason why, if there is to be mining development here, it should be done by private individuals rather than by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have mineral resources of some value.  We have, as the House knows, <Col N="1301" /> proved as a result of exploration work done through the Geological Survey, a very valuable deposit of gypsum in County Monaghan.  That exploration was done by a British firm of mining engineers and their report was published. Since it was published, there were indications that the exploration work done by them did not go far enough, that we had not spent enough money in deep drilling in the area, and a programme of deep drilling is now in progress which is already producing satisfactory results and showing that the gypsum deposit there is far more extensive and far more valuable than was at first thought.  That area alone will, I think, in due course, repay, in manufacturing industry and export trade, all the money we are ever likely to spend upon mineral development work of any kind.  It is already the centre of quite a significant industrial development, and what has been done there is, I think, unimportant in relation to what that area will in fact reveal after a systematic plan for the development of these gypsum deposits has been worked out.</P>
    <P>It may be that, in other areas known to be mineralised, we will find some other deposit of equal importance which can be the basis of industrial development.  But if we do come to that stage, we will encourage, as in the case of the gypsum deposit, the taking of the further steps by private companies.  Mineralised ore of any kind, if mined, can be sold as such, or can be processed here for the production of various metals.  That work is work upon which the State should not engage.  It is far too speculative and far too technical and private concerns are far more likely to do it better.  I am quite prepared to discuss with a great deal of sympathy the principle of State activity in certain old-established industries which are engaged in the production of commodities which are essential to the community, where it is desirable perhaps to eliminate the profit motive, if it can be done without increasing the cost of the commodity, or where there are security reasons why the enterprise should be under public control; but that does not apply and is never <Col N="1302" /> likely to apply to the highly speculative industries which result from mining activities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to give certain figures concerning this enterprise which will perhaps remove some of Senator Sir John Keane's difficulties.  The trading losses incurred by this company were as follows: At Avoca, £61,000&mdash;that represented a loss in the production of pyrites and would have been almost equivalent to the amount which would have been paid to the company if they were authorised to charge higher prices and subsidised on the same basis as imported Spanish pyrites were subsidised; at Slievardagh, £28,000&mdash;and for the whole period there were head office expenses chargeable against all the undertakings of the company of £32,000, making a total of £121,000.  On the working of the phosphate rock deposits in Clare, there was a profit of £25,000, so that the net trading losses amounted to £96,000.</P>
    <P>A large part of the expenditure which has been written off represented development expenditure, that is, money spent on the building of roads, the sinking of shafts, and all the type of development work which was not directly related to the winning of minerals.  At Avoca, development expenditure incurred amounted to £100,000; on the phosphate rock deposits, £12,000; and at Slievardagh, £41,000&mdash;a total of £163,000.  The value of the plant in Avoca, in County Clare and Slievardagh was £97,000 and that is being written down in the company's balance sheet so that the loss upon the purchase of that plant which, as I have said, was purchased during the emergency and was of a makeshift character and the only equipment procurable for this work, was £60,000.  There was an accumulation of interest charges on the advances of £50,000, making a total of £359,000, as on 31st March, 1947.  An additional £50,000 being the difference between that figure and the one I gave earlier, represents further expenditure incurred by the company since March of this year, both on the maintenance of its properties in the different areas and on head office expenses, and to some extent to the writing-off from <Col N="1303" /> their accounts of a higher proportion of their development expenditure.</P>
    <P>There will be deducted from that figure of £410,000 or £411,000 approximately&mdash;whatever it may prove to be&mdash; the ascertained value of the plant and other assets of the company.  The difference will be the amount to be written off and the company will then start off with a new balance sheet in which capital liability will represent the actual value of its assets.  It will have no trading activities, except the Slievardagh mine, and will be financed by means of non-repayable advances which will go into this business of exploration and development which cannot yield any continuing income to the company, but which may be recovered to the company, if they are successful in locating mineral resources which are capable of commercial exploitation.</P>

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect in permanent legislation to the provisions of a number of Emergency Powers Orders. These Orders were made during the war in connection with the establishment of Irish Shipping Limited, and to meet various difficulties that arose from time to time in its operations.  These Orders were continued in the Supplies and Services Act, but at some stage that Act will cease to operate and it is desirable that the Orders should be placed in permanent legislation in accordance with the general policy of the Government.  The only important new provision in the Bill is that it enables an increase to be made in the company's capital.  The capital at present is out of all relation to the company's assets.  It has an authorised capital of £200,000, all of which is held by the Minister for Finance except the qualifying shares held by directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The assets of the company now run into several million pounds, and it is proposed to increase the capital to £5,000,000.  It is not contemplated that the company will require new capital at present.  They have very substantial reserves and it is from these reserves that they are financing the provision of new tonnage.  They were built up during the war largely out of their marine insurance operations. These tonnage replacement reserves are now being expended in the purchase of seven new ships, on order, three of 9,000 tons dead weight, two of 7,500 tons dead weight and two of 2,000 tons dead weight.  There are further assets available to the company from which they can get new tonnage if required.  It is contemplated not merely as being desirable to relate the capital of the company more closely to the assets, but it is contemplated that a stage may come when the development of the activities of the company will require it to obtain new capital.</P>
    <P>It is possible that it will be regarded as desirable that the company should consider the possibilities of the cross-Channel trade.  At present it is engaged entirely on deep-sea operations, but if it should be regarded as desirable that the company should enter the cross-Channel trade, or if it should propose to extend its deep-sea operations considerably beyond present plans, then further capital would be needed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment of subsidies to the company.  At present it is operating at competitive rates, and doing so profitably, and there is no prospect that subsidies will be required.  There is power to pay subsidies under the Emergency Powers Order, although it was never utilised. I think it is desirable to maintain that provision in the Bill as an intimation that the Government intends to support this company to the limit.  It may be that circumstances which existed before the war will reappear, and that other companies engaged in the same trades as this company, will be inclined to cut freights or adopt other unfair tactics for the purpose of driving it out of business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> I think it is desirable to have notice given here, that they are up not merely against this company but the Government of the State, that we regard it as of essential national interest that we should develop the merchant shipping service and keep it in existence.  We hope that all countries will agree to maintain competition in shipping on a basis of fair trading, but if other Governments resort to subsidising, or if other companies adopt methods which are capable of being described as unfair, then we will have to consider what support this company may require in order to ensure its continued existence and to maintain its operations.</P>
    <P>At the present time all countries which are operating shipping on the routes upon which this company is engaged are subscribing to the general principle of fair competition without subsidies, without price cutting, without any national regulations designed to favour ships of a particular flag in preference to others.  How long these good resolutions will last it is difficult to say, if a touch of depression comes.</P>
    <P>I want to explain the reference to subsidies as indicating merely a declaration of the intention to support the company if necessary, and not as representing any present intention of doing so.  Of course no money exists to pay subsidies and would not be available unless voted by the Dáil. There is also power to guarantee borrowing. It is clear from the financial position of the company that it will not have recourse to borrowing for any purpose in the near future.  The proposal is to give power to guarantee borrowings by the company to enable it to get credit more readily and on more reasonable terms than might otherwise be possible.  The company is a very interesting illustration of successful State enterprise which will gladden the heart of Senator Duffy.  It was of course formed during the war, and for a time it charged high freights.  These freights which were fixed provisionally in the early stages, were progressively reduced until very shortly after the company beginning operations they were fully competitive with freights charged by other companies on the <Col N="1306" /> same routes.  Their freights are still fully competitive and any business which the company gets is in competition.</P>
    <P>There is no preferential system or any obligation on Irish merchants to use these ships.  We hope they will have the good sense to do so, even if they can get an occasional cut freight from other competitive lines because it is as much in their interest as anyone else's to keep the company in operation.  I want it to be quite clear that it is operating on the basis of free competition with all comers, charging competitive freights, and getting whatever business it gets from the suitability of the service it renders.</P>
    <P>At a stage during the war the company went into the marine insurance business very largely to meet a difficulty which could not be otherwise overcome.  Senators will remember that during the war we imported goods from South America via Lisbon. Neutral ships were running from South America to Lisbon, but they would not come beyond Lisbon, or to any port in this country.  We arranged there a sort of supply channel by which goods were brought to Lisbon and stored there until shipped into Irish ports in small ships, a very large number of which we lost in this operation. Because of the fact that the flow of goods into Lisbon was often much stronger than the flow out to this country, supplies began to accumulate there during the war and at one period traders could not get the necessary war risk cover for those goods.  Insurance companies in Great Britain and elsewhere feared that the German forces might enter the Iberian peninsula and consequently it became impossible to effect insurance against the risk of storing the goods in Lisbon.  There was a danger that this would cut that supply line to this country because traders naturally would not incur the risk of having goods at Lisbon that were uninsured.  Consequently, Irish shipping, having an interest in the matter, went into the business itself and said: &ldquo;We will insure you against storing those goods in Lisbon.&rdquo;  As you know, the Iberian peninsula was never invaded and the premium income <Col N="1307" /> to the company from this business was all profit.  The risk never materialised. Having tasted success in this matter, the company began to realise that it was paying in war risk insurance on its own ships a fantastic rate to Lloyds and other marine insuring organisations. They decided to take the risk themselves on their own ships and on other ships too.  Not merely did they offer this insurance at competitive rates, but at substantially reduced rates and they forced all other marine insurance corporations to bring down their rates.</P>
    <P>Although nobody was compelled to insure with Irish Shipping, it can be claimed that the company saved Irish merchants millions of pounds by expanding its business into war risks. It built up a very profitable trade at competitive rates, but a stage was reached, however, when it was considered undesirable that the company should remain in the marine insurance business and so it disposed of that section of its business to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and now holds a substantial block of shares in that company.  As a result of its pioneer work, a substantial marine underwriting business has been developed in this country which has now a substantial and rapidly growing premium income from abroad.  It was very largely through its insurance business that the company was able to build up the reserve funds which it is now using to purchase tonnage.  The company had a fortunate experience, although two ships sailing under its flag were lost, but they were under contract which provided that they must be insured in the United States of America.  It was necessary for the working of the company that there should be sufficient repair facilities available.  The Dublin ship repairing facilities were fully employed and it was found desirable in view of the increased tonnage to extend the ship repairing facilities in the country.  It promoted, therefore, a subsidiary company which operated Cork dockyard and it is still in operation.  It was necessary that there should be adequate facilities at all stages to <Col N="1308" /> ensure that the company's ships would be kept afloat and that repairs would be done with the least possible delay, for delay at that period might have been very critical for us.  In addition, therefore, to its major interest of operating shipping, the company has investments.  It has investments in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland in consideration of the transfer of its marine insurance business.  It also has investments in the Cork Dockyard Company, of which it owns all the capital. As I explained already, there is nothing very new in the Bill.  All the powers it confers and the provisions it makes are covered by existing emergency powers Orders, with the one exception &mdash;the section dealing with increasing the capital of the company.  I doubt if there is any other matter to which it is necessary for me to refer at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>A measure has come before us which is very creditable to the Minister and I want to take this opportunity of extending a welcome to the Bill and of saying how very pleased I am at the provisions it contains.  I think that the results of Irish shipping operations during the war have been magnificent and I think it is desirable that this House should avail of this opportunity to express its appreciation of the services rendered by the officers and men of the Irish merchant service who risked their lives, several of them lost their lives, in keeping the channels of trade open to this country.  It is probably not sufficiently appreciated that but for the work done by those men during the war and the risks that they took we would be dealing with a different story to-day.  I think the Minister is acting courageously and very wisely in relation to this enterprise. Some of its success, I gather from his own recital now, has been a matter of accident rather than design. Large sums of money, through its insurance business, happened to be got by stealth.  Some of these people would not insure with the company if the risks would be taken elsewhere and by being forced to place their business with the company they had been landed in a gold mine.  It is a pity <Col N="1309" /> that Senator Summerfield is not here to lay back his ears and enjoy the glad tidings.  There is one point about which I feel many members of the House would like to know a little more. I would like to know whether all the capital of the company is owned by the Government and, if not, whether non-nationals own any of it.  I do not suggest that that is the case but I just want to ask the question so that we can have it definitely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That satisfies me.  In Section 7 I notice that there is provision made for the sale by the Minister of shares.  That causes me to wonder.  Is it contemplated that the Minister will dispose of the shares held by him?  and, if so, in what circumstances that sale will be effected and whether the sale in fact would be restricted to nationals.  I want to make myself perfectly clear.  I am making no assertion, and I have no knowledge, that anything to the contrary is being done.  I merely advert to the provisions of Section 7 to get assurance, if I can, that the share capital of this concern will be retained by the State and that there will be no sale, and that Section 7 is an unnecessary provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in joining with Senator Duffy in paying tribute to this successful State enterprise.  I am not a purist on this question of how enterprise should be developed and I hope at a later date the Senator may be in a position to congratulate me on some successful commercial enterprise.  I think this has been a very successful enterprise. I think there has been a considerable element of good luck about it but that is all to the good.  There is only one matter that I wish the Minister would reconsider, that is, his attitude towards the ownership of capital.  He said in the Dáil that he did not approve&mdash;I think that is the word he used&mdash;of the public owning any of the capital.  I think that is a mistaken point of view <Col N="1310" /> generally.  Is it only with regard to shipping that he holds that point of view, or does he hold it with regard to other enterprises?  I do feel it is healthy that private capital should be associated with every possible opportunity in our economic life.  I do not suggest that the private shareholders should have control but I hope the Minister would consider allowing a minority holding to be issued to private investors.  It gives them an interest and it makes the whole thing much more homogeneous.  It is a satisfactory form of finance and it gives the ordinary investor an interest in a concern of this kind and to a certain extent it helps the stock exchange.  I hope the Minister is not adamant in his refusal to allow a certain proportion of the capital to be held privately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to throw any bouquets at the Minister.  I think the project was too long delayed.  It took a lot of urging to invest in Irish shipping and it took a war and an acute scarcity of shipping all over the world to make the Government undertake this enterprise.  Many of us urged on every possible occasion&mdash;at least, I urged on every possible occasion&mdash;the absolute necessity of providing our own shipping.  Hitherto, we depended on foreign ships that partially discharged in ports outside the country and sent the goods over here in cross-Channel ships, so that we had double-handling to meet in freights.  We pointed all this out. Eventually, the Government took notice and invested in Irish ships, which got us through a very trying emergency.  It is doubtful if we could have got enough ships if we had not our own.  At any rate, they carried on during a very difficult period and they were able to make substantial profits in cargoes, but the provision of those cargoes was much more valuable to the country than the amount of profit represented by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we were able to gamble on the possibility of the Iberian Peninsula being free from invasion would rather imply that we had inside information.  At any rate the company went into insurance and made a lot of <Col N="1311" /> money out of it.  However, that is by the way.  I am very glad to hear the Minister say that we are going to invest in cross-Channel shipping.  Most of the shipping plying cross-Channel is in the hands of non-nationals and it is about time that we took a big interest in that because it is very important.  Small ships in future will be very important for trade with parts of the Continent. I certainly am very pleased to hear that this venture is the success which the Minister outlined, notwithstanding the fact that it took him and the Government a long time to make up their minds to go into the enterprise.  Now that they have done so, they have proved that Government enterprise can be a great success, as this one has been.  We are all very pleased about it, even though they took a long time to make up their minds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Duffy, particularly in the remarks he made with regard to the work done by merchant seamen in our own ships during the war.  That has not always been realised here.  I do not think anything we can say here would make the public realise the extent of what we owe to them and the risks they were taking.  We must not forget that a number of them lost their lives.  Probably Senator Foran is right when he said the Government were too late.  I certainly think they could have done better if they had started at least a year earlier, but it is very easy, after the event, to make remarks of that kind.  There was at first the feeling amongst a great many people that the rates were too high and that, perhaps, to some extent may have resulted in profits.  There again, I know that if I had been on the board I would have found it extremely difficult to know under the then circumstances what rates would be practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not in the least agree with Senator Sir John Keane on the desirability of companies being half State and half private.  I do not think it works.  I think you get dissatisfaction on one side or the other.  You do not get the benefits of private enterprise, if there be any&mdash;if Senator Duffy would admit there are any&mdash;and you do not get the <Col N="1312" /> full benefits of State enterprise either. I think it is a mistake to mix the two and I think it would only cause a certain amount of dissatisfaction.  However, that is only a personal point of view.  I hope Senator Foran's little joke about inside information will not get too much publicity or there may be a broadcast from Moscow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to join in paying tribute to our Merchant Navy for the splendid work they did during the years of the emergency.  I welcome this Bill particularly for the provision made in it for a subsidy to maintain the Merchant Navy should occasion demand.  When so many people refer now to what our shipping has done and say that it should have been established many years prior to the war they forget that there were Irish ships on the seas, that there were Irish shipping companies, and that they were driven out of business by what the Minister has referred to as cutthroat competition, and various other means.  Therefore, the best guarantee that our shipping company will be maintained is the provision in the Bill that, if necessary, the State would subsidise the company to keep it going.  Of course, our Irish importers, in particular, should have sufficient foresight to support that company, apart from any immediate advantage they might have by supporting any foreign company because, if the position is created, as it was created in the past, that our Irish ships would be driven off the seas, those who accomplish that will be able to reap their reward.  Therefore, the provision in respect to a subsidy is one of the most welcome provisions in the Bill, as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say, except to clear up one or two points.  In regard to Section 7, the Government does not contemplate, as long as the capital structure of the undertaking remains as it is at present, disposing of any shares now held by the Minister for Finance. Section 7 is a provision designed to facilitate Senator Sir John Keane, should he ever become Minister for Finance or Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It may be that, at some <Col N="1313" /> stage, the capital of the company might be extended and that some arrangement might be entered into.  I cannot at present contemplate in what circumstances it might arise which would involve a transfer of some of the shares held by the Minister for Finance into some other undertaking. We have a similar provision in legislation relating to the air companies and, as in this case, I doubt if it is likely to be used in any foreseeable circumstances.</P>
      <P>I should be inclined to agree with the general view expressed by Senator Douglas, that it is difficult to mix private investment with State ownership. There are some undertakings of that kind at the present time and I must say that no particular friction has arisen, but, of course, it so happens that they are profitable and in such cases they raised no problems for the Minister for Finance.  I am thinking of the Industrial Credit Company, where the private ownership is comparatively small.  It is the only one that occurs to me at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is correct to say that the successful financial results from the company's marine insurance business were due to the fact that it had a fortunate experience, but it would be unfair to the directors and officers of that company merely to describe it as good fortune. The decision to enter into the marine insurance business was a tremendous decision.  When it appeared to be necessary and discussions took place with those who were engaged in the insurance business in this country and had some experience of marine insurance business, they certainly advised us that it was so complicated and risky a business that only experts could handle it.  It was not possible to get in this country the expert advice needed, so the chairman of the company and certain of the directors and officers got down to a real study of the marine insurance business and mastered it in an extraordinarily short space of time, so that when they entered into the business they were able to conduct it with the same smoothness and efficiency as firms which had been in the trade for <Col N="1314" /> hundreds of years.  When ultimately they made reinsurance contracts with Lloyd's underwriters and other international marine insurance agents, they were able to meet as equals with equals and eventually to establish this position in which there exists in Dublin a marine insurance business which is, as I have said, already receiving a very substantial and a rapidly growing income from abroad.  Good fortune was there, but behind the good fortune, as in every other case, there was a great deal of hard work and a great deal of competence shown by the directors and officers of the company who took over that particular job.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator Foran said, that we went into the shipping business as a State enterprise belatedly.  I do not think we would have gone in at all if we could have kept out of it.  Before the war, it was a most speculative business and competition was very keen and most shipping concerns were losing money.  While we were very anxious to promote the growth of a merchant marine, we preferred to have it done through the private shipping companies and were looking forward to the stage when more normal conditions in international trade would permit them to expand their activities.  During the first years of the war, it was, of course, Government policy to keep out of shipping and to utilise for our shipping needs, so far as it could be done, vessels of other neutral countries.  It is, perhaps, easy to forget now that in those days of the war, because the German Government had declared these waters around our island to be belligerent waters, even United States ships were prohibited by the United States Government from coming in here, and there was a considerable risk to the policy of neutrality we had decided to pursue in having to operate ships under our own flag.</P>
    <P>We conceived it as the best policy in those days to utilise Greek, Portuguese and other neutral ships, as long as they were available; but when, in the beginning of 1940, it was becoming clear that these ships would no longer continue to be available, there was no other course open to us except to get our own ships and sail under our own <Col N="1315" /> flag, taking whatever risks were involved in the business.  So, while we would all like to have seen this successful enterprise started earlier, there were good reasons why it was not.</P>

To my recollection, I have never known a Bill which attempts to deal with a fundamental matter affecting agriculture with no indication whatever as to what the intentions of the Government are.  It merely says: &ldquo;We can tell you nothing; we just want power to make regulations,&rdquo; and they hope it will pass into that unsatisfactory phase of delegated legislation. In principle, it is the same as giving the Minister for Health power to make regulations to deal with the health of the country; it is only a question of degree.  I do not believe we have ever had a Bill which&mdash;without telling us anything about the foundations, referring to dangers and not telling us what they are&mdash;deals with a new approach of science to a very important industry and simply says: &ldquo;Give us <i>carte blanche,</i> a blank cheque to make regulations.&rdquo;  We know how utterly inadequate the control of the Oireachtas is over such legislation.  Therefore, I make my protest.</P>

      <P>As I raised this on the last occasion, I would like to ask the Minister a question.  I know the regulations are to be laid on the Table of the House and can be annulled by the Oireachtas, so we will know what they are going to be.  However, this <Col N="1316" /> is all in the experimental stage in this country.  My concern is as to what action the Minister will take in regard to the making of regulations.  I would presume that, before regulations are made, he would have a discussion and obtain information and give practical indication of what the experience of people has been in any of these stations.</P>
      <P>Obviously, whatever regulations are going to be made can only be made on the basis of experience.  They have a certain amount of experience across the Channel, but some of it will contradict other experience.  We have not that experience here.  The Minister is taking power to exercise control.  It is important that there should be a certain amount of liberty as to the manner in which these restrictions are going to be imposed.  That, in my view, ought to be influenced by the experience that will be gained from the people who have practical experience of operating one of these stations.  I am concerned to know what contact the Minister is going to have with those people before regulations are made.  Will there be discussions with them?  So far the Minister has given no indication.</P>

      <P>I do not know what I am asked to give an indication on.  There is a veterinary officer in my Department who has been in England, who has worked in the stations there and who is as fully trained as it is possible for a man to be.  We have all the information that is available from the sources that have been mentioned.  If a farmer or a group of farmers approach my Department to-morrow with a view to the establishment of a station, I am going to prescribe regulations as to whether or not these are desirable people to have a station and whether their premises are suitable.  I am going to stipulate that, if the premises are suitable, there must be a veterinary surgeon in charge of it.  I can stipulate other conditions that I, on the advice of my officials and in consultation with the people who are interested, regard as desirable.  I am not going to enter into a discussion as to the advisability or otherwise of <Col N="1317" /> encouraging this practice.  I am simply asking in these proposals for the authority that is enjoyed by every Minister for Agriculture in the Government of every modern country to-day. I do not see why, when I am seeking these powers, we should get down to a debate as to the wisdom or otherwise of encouraging this practice at all.</P>

      <P>In support of what Senator Baxter has said, I want to say that all kinds of questions arise in regard to the distribution of semen. There will, for example, be the question of in-breeding.  When questions such as these arise is it not reasonable to ask that the Minister should consult, say, the Shorthorn Breeders' Association and other interests representing different classes of stock?  That is all that is asked, and the Minister will not give even an indication of his attitude on the matter.  There is much more in this than the question of insemination. The question of in-breeding alone raises very big issues which are altogether outside the purview of the technical people.  Surely, the Minister should give some indication that he is going to consult the interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not seeking to create difficulties or ask awkward questions.  We have one station in the country, but it may be that we shall have a dozen or more.  It is under this Bill that all the powers are being granted which will enable, say, 20 stations to be established.  This movement is under test already.  A certain amount of valuable experience has been gained.  But, as the movement develops, there will be the question of taking decisions and making regulations.  The Minister has indicated that an officer in his Department has practical experience of this, and that he has worked at some of the English stations.  There is a growing literature on the subject, but while all that is true, some of those countries know very little about it.  The science of genetics, so far as the people in these islands are concerned, is only in its infancy.  All that has to be considered in conjunction with the subject matter of this Bill and the regulations to be made under it.  What I want to <Col N="1318" /> know from the Minister is whether he contemplates, in the making of regulations, having discussions with people of practical experience in these stations wherever they are.  That is a practice which, I think, ought to be cultivated and developed.  The people who interest themselves in any branch of scientific development such as this ought to be brought into whatever discussions there are.  I think that, from the Departmental point of view, it would be invaluable to have that sort of co-operation and collaboration.  No matter what experience an officer in the Department may have, it is the practical man on the spot who will make discoveries that nobody but himself can make.  Such people ought to be brought into consultation when regulations are made.</P>

      <P>It is being put to me in a different way now.  No Minister, with any commonsense, would fail to consult those engaged in the business. Nobody could have demonstrated the wisdom of that course more than I have during my short term in office as Minister.  I am at it every day in the week.  There is no dispute on that issue.  What I have been saying is that attempts have been made to widen the discussion on a simple sort of measure such as this.  The Bill does not permit of a discussion of that scope at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>12.  This Act shall expire on or before 31st December, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that this Bill, when it becomes an Act, shall expire before the 31st December, 1950.  I take it that, by that time, a considerable amount of experience will have been embodied in regulations, and no doubt the public will then be much better educated as to <Col N="1319" /> the working of this new development. Therefore, I think it is only right and proper that the whole of this acquired experience should be embodied in a new measure.  That seems to me to be commonsense.  It is the democratic way for Parliament to keep in touch with these developments.  It was in this way that it was intended Parliament should be used.</P>

      <P>If there is need for this measure now, surely it is a type of measure which is needed in permanent form.  That is the only purpose of introducing a measure of this kind. Applications will not just roll in immediately on the passage of this measure for the establishment of artificial insemination centres all over the country.  We might not have one for two years and we might not have one for ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of my view; it is possible.  I do not find farmers, whether through co-operative societies or otherwise, pestering my Department about this and full of enthusiasm for it.  As a matter of fact, in relation to the one centre from which we have gained some knowledge as a result of the efforts there, the experience is that the farmers in the area are not a bit enthused about it. Why then should this limitation as to the duration of the measure be imposed?  If an application came in 1950, it would be just as necessary for the Minister to have the right to say: &ldquo;These are suitable people and they have suitable premises.  Here are the conditions they must observe&rdquo; as it is now.  If there is any question in 1950 of the importation of semen it would be necessary for the Minister to be <Col N="1320" /> able to say whether it should come in or go out.  What will happen in 1950 that would make it less important that the Minister should have that power than now?  I cannot understand that reasoning at all.  This is intended to be a permanent measure giving to the Minister and his Department a certain right and authority, and the power to say yes or no, and, if they say yes, to prescribe certain conditions which, in the opinion of the Department, after all the consultations referred to, are desirable.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that mentally the Minister and I are poles apart.  He is a very good Minister, but he has not, to my mind, got the faintest idea of the Parliamentary point of view.  He is what is called a thoroughly bad&mdash;it is merely a phrase &mdash;House of Commons man.  I think he regards Parliament as rather a nuisance and that is the very point on which we join issue.  I say: have three years' experience and let him then come to Parliament and get his powers into proper form, into statutory form. Does the Minister think it is the intention of Parliament in 1950 to deprive him of his powers?  I do not imagine that for a moment.  Experience will show what powers are necessary and they can be embodied in statutory form.  That is the way a democracy should work.  However, I did not intend to press the amendment.  We do not see eye to eye at all.  We are living in different worlds and I shall leave it at that.</P>
