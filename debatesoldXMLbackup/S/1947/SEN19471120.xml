      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the First Schedule, Part I, page 4, for the name &ldquo;Dublin North (East)&rdquo; in the first column to substitute the name &ldquo;Clontarf&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment raises the point we discussed last evening on the Second Stage.  The amendments in my name on the Order Paper down to and including amendment No. 6 refer to the constituencies in the City of Dublin and the proposal is to substitute for the geographical title other titles as set out in the amendments.  Whatever decision is reached on amendment No. 1, I am prepared to agree, would cover all the others, except that perhaps there are special circumstances in some cases which ought to be referred to.  At the moment, however, I am concerned with the constituency described in the Schedule as Dublin North (East).  That I consider a most unsuitable description.  The outstanding portion of that constituency includes Clontarf.  Clontarf has very historic associations, which, in my opinion, ought to be recalled in the title of the constituency which includes that historic spot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in reply to the debate last night referred to the geographical convenience of these constituencies, but that, of course, means nothing. One could say that had he gone further and adopted the American system of referring to 56th Street or 42nd Street, it would have been better still, but he has not done that.  Even under the <Col N="1128" /> British régime, some attention was given to the historical associations of certain places in Dublin and these assocations were carried into the titles of the Parliamentary constituencies which existed here prior to 1923.  You had for instance, St. Patrick's Division, College Green Division, St. Michan's Division, and St. Stephen's Green Division.  All these old historic associations were recalled in British legislation when giving titles to the Parliamentary constituencies of Dublin.  It appears to me that we ought not to be less mindful of these historic traditions than were the people responsible for designating the constituencies in British Acts of Parliament, and I urge the Minister that he should accept this amendment, or insert something better, if he prefers it, in the Bill.</P>
    <P>He referred to Drumcondra as an equally appropriate title, but I am not speaking of appropriate titles.  I am making the suggestion that there are certain historical landmarks in Dublin which might reasonably give the titles to our Parliamentary divisions.  The question whether they are appropriate in relation to places is another matter. Take what happens in Northern Ireland. There is a division there which covers the South County of Down, but it is known not as South Down, but as Mourne.  In Britain, there is a constituency, which geographically may mean nothing, known as the Forest of Dean.  There is a constituency in Birmingham called the Park Division.  There is a division convenient to London called Woodstock, which returns a very well-known gentleman to the British House of Commons, but Woodstock is purely and simply the name, as I understand it, of a little village in the midst of a constituency with 40,000 voters.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane is much better informed about British history than I, but I want to record the fact that, in Britain and in Northern Ireland, no inconvenience is experienced in getting titles, some of them appropriate and many of them historic traditional titles, for constituencies. Why must we follow the example of America by denoting everything by <Col N="1129" /> numbers or something abstract which means nothing?  I urge the Minister favourably to consider the suggestions made in these six amendments and to adopt them, or to suggest more appropriate amendments for these Dublin constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find Senator Duffy's main thesis very attractive and I am sorry it did not get consideration earlier.  I entirely agree with him that we would be much better off with historic titles which would have some colour, some roots, some traditions rather than with bald, newly-framed, colourless appellations, such as Dublin North-East, Dublin Central and so on. Whether the particular names he suggests are the best is another question, but his first suggestion, Clontarf, would seem to be quite satisfactory. I do not think that the actual voters in the areas are any more enlightened by a phrase like Dublin North-East than they would be by the word &ldquo;Clontarf&rdquo; because every voter in the area has to look up the list to see what constituency he is in.  I know people on a certain road on the north side who are now going into their fourth constituency and they moved into the house about 18 years ago, so that the Minister's point that the title Dublin North-East or Dublin West-Central is so satisfactory that the individuals concerned who have votes know where they are has no basis in fact.  While I do not know if all these names are quite satisfactory, I agree entirely with Senator Duffy's thesis that we would be much better off if this matter had been considered and if these names with associations were put in rather than bald, meaningless geographical appellations which, in fact, are not a bit more helpful than names such as those suggested by Senator Duffy.</P>

      <P>I do not like to interfere in a matter concerning the City of Dublin, but it appears to me that the names in the Bill are very practical names.  Senator Duffy suggests the name St. Laurence in one case.  St. Laurence O'Toole is the patron saint of the whole of Dublin and why should his name be attached to only a very small section of the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it applies to the whole of Dublin.  It would be very hard to identify the divisions by these names.  The names Dublin North and Dublin Central, I think, are more appropriate and ought to be left as they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, equally great sins have been committed, let us not forget, in the name of sentiment, particularly misapplied sentiment.  Like Senator Hayes, I have a good deal of sympathy with the attitude of mind which dictated Senator Duffy's amendment but, unfortunately, I have a practical task of trying to reconcile sentiment with practicality, and when we began to consider the idea of affixing historical or dedicatory appellations to these constituencies we were up against a great number of practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>Take the case of Clontarf.  It is true that the district happens to be situated within the area comprised in the Dublin North-East constituency, but the greater part of the constituency lies far west of Clontarf, and I am perfectly certain that, if we had suggested Clontarf, Senator Duffy, with that fertility of device which characterises him, would start another hare, would be quite critical of the idea that we should call that particular division Clontarf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And no doubt he would produce, say, &ldquo;Croke Park&rdquo;, which is much more central, or &ldquo;Archbishop Croke&rdquo;, or some other name, which he would contend was much more suitable than anything that would be found in the Bill.  It is when we begin to consider, not merely Clontarf, but all the other divisions that, at once, we see the sentimental objections to applying names to wide areas <Col N="1131" /> with which in fact they are only remotely associated.  For instance, the suggestion has been made here that we should call a certain constituency Saint Michan's.  There are other saints associated with that constituency and the admirers of those saints and those who are devoted to them might argue that we were slighting them when passing them over in order to adopt the particular saint to which Senator Duffy is devoted.  There is in that constituency a church dedicated to Saint Peter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Much more recent, but though we may all be proud of the sanctity of the early Irish, nevertheless, in the Annals of the Church I suppose Saint Peter would hold a higher place than St. Michan, and those who would be ultramontane in these matters might contend that, as we were dedicating it to a saint, why not dedicate it to the first Pope.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If we go down through the whole calendar, in relation to every saint who had any association with Dublin would not we find people who would contend that the particular saint whom we were chosing as the patron of the constituency was not in fact nearly so appropriate as some other that would occur to them?  I say, therefore, that, even from the point of view of the Senator, there would be strong objections to adopting offhand here, without a great deal of consideration, the names which he has suggested. Senator Hayes himself has uttered a warning in that regard.  He said that while he agrees with the spirit of Senator Duffy's amendment, nevertheless, he is not prepared to say offhand that the names which the Senator has suggested are the best that could be devised.  Senator Douglas yesterday expressed exactly the same attitude and here we have two Senators who might be taken as being normally very sympathetic to any viewpoint expressed by Senator Duffy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to suggest that the Seanad at least should look at this from a practical point of view because, after all, we are here to conduct the affairs of the nation and to deal with public business in a practical way.  We can, of course, wherever possible, reconcile the practical requirements of the position with historical sentiment, and so on, but the position in relation to this Bill is this: as I told the Seanad yesterday, a great many things have been done on the assumption that this Bill, in view of the manner in which it had been received, would go through the Oireachtas practically unchanged. Arrangements have been made for splitting up and identifying the existing registers in accordance with the names given to these constituencies. If this amendment were to be accepted now I would have no option but to go back to the Dáil and ask them to reject it, on this ground if on no other&mdash;that these arrangements would all be thrown into the melting-pot, that a great deal of work which has been done over the past month would have to be done over again and the election would be inevitably deferred.  I know that all those who are looking to share the lion's skin are very anxious <Col N="1133" /> to have this election at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are off again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At least, that is the impression they are trying to create in the public mind, that they are all very anxious that we should go to the country at the earliest possible moment and that this Government should submit itself to the judgment of the people, in the hope that the judgment will be in their favour.  But it begins to dawn on me that this eagerness may be only simulated and that in fact what Senator Duffy has in mind is to bring in an amendment here which will cause the election to be deferred because they are not quite so eager to face the people as they pretend to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government that are in a hurry to face the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>After these practical remarks, can we go on to the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I would suggest that it would be, from the Senator's point of view, very unwise. If he is sincerely and genuinely desirous of having the election at the earliest possible moment, he should not bring in an amendment which is not, after all, a matter of great principle, which does not touch the fundamentals of the Bill in any way, but the inevitable effect of which would be, as I have said, to defer the election and to cause to be scrapped a great deal of what has been done during the past month to prepare for the election.  That is the very strong objection which I have to accepting these amendments and I think that objection is sufficiently weighty to permit me to ask the Seanad, notwithstanding any views they may have as to the desirability of adopting a system of nomenclature based upon historical or personal associations, not to accept the amendments in the form in which they appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's conclusion but not with the Minister's reasons.  I think it is a perfectly proper thing to bring forward and a perfectly proper thing to debate but, under the present circumstances, it <Col N="1134" /> would, I think, be foolish and I imagine Senator Duffy would not press it in any case, to make hasty decisions with regard to change of names and I do not think anyone would particularly wish it.  The Minister made alternative suggestions himself.  It seems to me it is really only a Belfast man who would suggest the Pope instead of St. Patrick.  Be that as it may, it is an illustration of the fact that we could spend from now until the next general election before we would be quite satisfied with regard to the names.  I think it is quite likely that, if a carefully prepared and thought out and argued list of names had come, they would have been accepted with perhaps one or two changes.  In general, I do not think you would get a name that you could prove was perfectly satisfactory for any of the constituencies but you might get a name of historic interest and value which in time would be attached to that particular constituency and by which the constituency would be known, such as has happened elsewhere.  That is what I would have rather liked to see.  I do not think now it is practiable.</P>
      <P>I was very much intrigued by the Minister's reference to the lion's skin. I do not know what he meant.  I think he was probably reading Aesop, but as for the lion's skin, I do not think that the desire to share it is as great as he thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that if the Minister had told us at any stage in his speech where he stood, we could come to a reasonable conclusion as to what should be done about this amendment. He commenced by telling us how inappropriate these titles were. He ignored the fact that yesterday I invited him to suggest his own titles and I emphasised that I would have much preferred that the proposals should come from him as the Minister in charge of the Bill than that it should be thought that they were imposed upon him by members of the House with whom he may be in disagreement. The Minister did nothing like that but he comes along and tells us that these titles are inappropriate&mdash;I would suggest that of all the speeches I have ever heard made by the Minister the one <Col N="1135" /> with which he has resisted this amendment is probably the worst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a big word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that this is the worst speech he has ever made. Take the example of St. Laurence.  The Minister goes on to say that you cannot apply the designation St. Laurence to a division of Dublin because St. Laurence is the patron of all Dublin. I notice that in the wards of Dublin you have, for instance, St. Kevin's ward.  What is the difficulty?  I should add that the Minister or his predecessor introduced a Bill to establish a hospital which he calls St. Laurence's Hospital.  All the hospitals in Dublin, on the Minister's thesis, should be St. Laurence's.  I would not like to describe it as ballyhoo but it is difficult to describe it as anything else.  Then there was a question about St. Michan's.  The advantage about the use of &ldquo;St. Michan's&rdquo; is that it was an old name for the constituency.  That very area, which is now Dublin North (Central), I think, was for years and years known as St. Michan's division, just as the area which I am proposing to call St. Patrick's was for generations known&mdash; or the greater part of it was&mdash;as St. Patrick's division.</P>
      <P>Is it not more appropriate to refer to this area in which we are now standing as St. Enda's, rather than Dublin South?  Is there any suggestion that there is anything wrong about that, or that there is a difficulty about the adoption of that name?  I think there is none and the type of speech made by the Minister in which he had no heart and no belief is evidence that there is no opposition in the Minister's own mind to the proposal on the Order Paper.  I accept that it may create problems if we are now to change the titles of these constituencies.  If the Minister confined himself to that and said: &ldquo;This is a problem; I have done work under this Bill, I have taken certain steps; you are going to upset all that and delay this election, for which the whole country is bursting,&rdquo; we would understand the opposition to the amendment?  The Minister does not make that point, except as a taunt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago, I had occasion to discuss <Col N="1136" /> with a Minister&mdash;not the present Minister&mdash;certain things that ought to be done under a Bill which was then going through the Oireachtas.  It was in private conversation, but the Minister concerned told me that it was not permissible to spend one farthing under a Bill before it had passed through the Oireachtas.  I understand one cannot buy a sheet of blotting paper for the purpose of an Act until it becomes an Act.  Civil servants, of course, are paid to cover a certain amount of work in a certain period of time and I am sure that the Department of Finance sees to that. It appears, therefore, that the Minister can have had nothing whatever done to implement this Bill.  However, if he does say that the real objection to this amendment is that it is not practicable to spend the time required in amending the Bill, going back again to the Dáil to get this amendment accepted and carrying out the work that falls to be done, I am not anxious to press it; but I want it on record that, in my opinion, the present titles are an insult to the people of Dublin.  My further view is that, at the earliest opportunity, whatever Government is in office after the general election should take steps immediately to change the titles of the constituencies.</P>

      <P>As one of the Dublin-born men in the House, might I join in the debate as to how the various parts of my native city should be distinguished.  I think Senator Duffy anticipated me in saying things I would have said myself, but I would appeal to him to withdraw his amendment for the time being, in the hope that at some future date not merely Dublin but the whole area under the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas might be surveyed and historical names that we can all agree on might be applied to the various constituencies.  I am very much in favour of the suggestion of Senator Duffy.  There is a picturesqueness about the old names apart from the sentimental and historical reasons advanced by him; but he should give way to the Minister's suggestion and, because of the urgent need to get the Bill through, nothing should be done at this late stage to impede its progress. I want to go on record as expressing <Col N="1137" /> the hope that, as early as possible in the life of the new Parliament, something will be done to review the names placed on the constituencies, not merely in the cities and towns but throughout the whole area of the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas.</P>

Is dócha nach féidir an ceartú nó an tathrú sin a dhéanamh anois.  Ach is é rud atá ag cur imní ar chuid againn, an rud adúirt an tAire gur ar son &ldquo;practical reasons&rdquo; a chaithfear gach aon ní a bhaineann le stair a scriosadh amach as na rialacháin a deintear i nithe den tsórt so.

Bhéidís díreach chomh praiticiúil agus i bhfad níos ionéilithe agus ionbheirthe ná &ldquo;Soir&rdquo;, &ldquo;Siar&rdquo; nó &ldquo;Thuaidh&rdquo; mar ainmneacha ar an geathair.</P>

Níor bhféidir aon rud níos náisiúnta a dhéanamh nó aon ainm níos tréithiúla do thabhairt orthu ná an &ldquo;Irish Yew&rdquo;, &ldquo;Irish Ash&rdquo;, agus &ldquo;Irish Spruce&rdquo;.

      <P>If Senator Duffy looks at the record, he will find that I did not make any extended reference to St. Laurence O'Toole.  He quite misunderstood the position in relation to this Bill and the things that have to be done under it, when he told the Seanad that a Minister had informed him that until a Bill became law no money could be expended under it. That is true, where the expenditure has to be borne by the Exchequer, but in this case quite a lot of things that will have to be done will ultimately have to be borne by the returning officer and it is the returning officers in the various constituencies and the registration officers who now are taking preliminary steps to ensure that, when this Bill becomes law, it will be possible to operate it almost immediately.</P>
      <P>Regarding some of the other remarks made, let us see what the real issue is. As Senator Duffy put it, it is as to whether we should follow the British or the American practice.  In that regard, the Senator seems to be almost as anti-American as Mr. Viyshinsky himself&mdash; everything which America does is wrong and everything the British do is right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, what instances did the Senator produce in order to convert the Seanad to his point of view?  He would stick to the historic British names, because the British have adopted the system of naming a constituency after a village or after a long-vanished forest.  Senator Duffy <Col N="1139" /> told us that Woodstock division was named after a comparatively small village and another constituency was called after the Forest of Dean.  Because they do that and because Americans adopt a practical way of looking at things and name their streets and districts in a way which can be readily recognised and easily remembered by the ordinary citizen, he says they are all wrong and the British are all right.</P>
      <P>It is not merely a matter of historical tradition in relation to these things. Who is going to decide what particular view of history is going to be right? If we were all agreed that there were territorial names which could be appropriately applied to all of our electoral constituencies, I would not oppose them.  If the territorial names to be given to any one of these divisions were incontrovertible, I would say that we should by all means have them and I would be one of those prepared to take the point of view that we should give them these names. Remember, however, in this regard, that these constituencies are not fixed and lasting for all time and that under the Constitution they are to be revised every 12 years at least.  We do not know whether there will be a change in the Constitution enabling the Oireachtas to proceed on the basis of another system of proportional representation, or whether there will be such a change in the Constitution where, instead of there being a lower limit of three, there might be a lower limit of five, seven or nine members for a constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would give rise to all sorts of trouble.  People will say that the constituency used to be called &ldquo;St. Patrick's&rdquo; or &ldquo;Clontarf&rdquo;.  In fact, by reason of the extension of the city boundary, Clontarf might be entirely separated and cut off from the constituency known by that name. There is a great deal of misunderstanding of the real problem.  If the case were that any of these constituencies had been known for a sensible period of time, for generations, by one particular name and if it were possible to take that name instead of another one which most people <Col N="1140" /> regarded as unsuitable, I could see some force in the arguments being made here.  But when it is a simple choice between following, to some extent if you like, the American principle and giving a constituency a name by which it can be easily identified, and on the other hand following the British principle and giving a constituency a name which is remotely or slightly associated with that constituency merely for the sake of giving it a territorial designation, then I think all the argument is in favour of the American principle.</P>

      <P>It is very much like saying that we should ride in asses' carts because our grandfathers rode in asses' carts before motor-cars were invented. It is very much like that. After all, we have got to remember that, when the British devised their system, the science of nomenclature had not progressed so far that they had anything more rational to apply to it than these territorial designanations. Again, in general the British constituencies embraced comparatively small areas.  The Woodstock constituency was built round a small village, and the village was probably the centre of the countryside when the Woodstock division was originally mapped out. We cannot say that Clontarf, for all its historical associations, is the centre of Dublin North (East) constituency any more than we can say that Croke Park is, though Croke Park, from the point of view of geographical situation would perhaps be a more appropriate title to apply to Dublin North (East) than Clontarf.  If one were to go down the list of names one could say, in relation to every one of them, that one could produce a dozen objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, before we decide to fix these names to constituencies, we ought to be certain that they are names which will meet with general acceptance.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Douglas.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the suggestion to call these, constituencies by territorial names or by historical names, but before we can proceed to <Col N="1141" /> give effect to that principle we must be certain that the names which we propose to apply to them will be generally acceptable, and from that point of view I think there is very little to be said for the amendment.</P>

I have heard Deputy MacEntee try his hand at obstruction.  He was not very competent, but as Minister for Local Government he is the most competent obstructionist in regard to legislation that I have ever heard. Nobody wants to stop the Minister getting the Bill, and least of all Senator Duffy.  Nobody is keeping him from getting it except the Minister for Local Government who brings in international considerations.  We are asked by him, in regard to a simple name for a constituency, to consider Russia, America and England. The Minister never before, until this evening, had any idea in his mind that this was an American system.  Is not that right?

      <P>The simple truth is that the Minister, in spite of all his talk, did not consider at all that there should be names of this kind rather than geographical names for the constituencies. It never came into his head.  If the Minister had begun his speech this evening after Senator Duffy had spoken with the last statement that he made, namely, that he had considerable sympathy with this kind of proposal, this debate need not <Col N="1142" /> have gone on at all.  The truth is that there is no comparison at all between us and America.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that this is a very old nation and that it has certain historical roots and associations, and that we ought to make the most of them.  Even when naming constituencies in the City of Dublin, we ought to take that into consideration.  The simple truth is that the Minister never took it into consideration at all, good, bad or indifferent but rode away on a foolish and extremely incompetent line that this was impractical.  The most incompetent people in this country are the people who are always talking that way, and if there is anyone impractical it is the Minister for Local Government in getting this Bill through.</P>

Actually, it is the Russian totalitarian system that he is defending in this House and he thinks it is the American system.  I am not responsible for that, but I am responsible for having put down the amendment.  I want to say that if the Minister had said at any stage that he was resisting the amendment solely on the grounds that he had made preparations through the returning officers and others to implement this Bill the moment it becomes law and that money had been spent by the returning officers under that head, I would not have pressed the amendment at all.

    <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  This amendment affects <Col N="1144" /> South Mayo in so far as it reduces the number of Deputies for that constituency. I think I explained the position pretty well last evening.  When the Bill was introduced it had five Deputies, and now the number is four. I am seeking to have the original number restored.  The constituency is a very large one, and is composed, to a large extent of poor people who, for various reasons, find it necessary to keep in touch with their Parliamentary representatives.  All that involves a very heavy amount of work for the Deputies representing the constituency. I am sorry that there should be any clash in the matter of extra representation as between South Mayo and Wexford.  I do not see why it should be mixed up with Wexford, because I have no desire to take a seat from any other area.  I strongly recommend the amendment to the House, and ask that the original figure of five be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  South Mayo is a very unwieldy constituency, much more so than Wexford.  Quite a number of the roads there are almost impassable, and Deputies find it very hard to get around the constituency to do their work.  Deputy Corish, when speaking on the Bill in the Dáil, said that from the population point of view there is a difference of 3,000 people as between Wexford and South Mayo.  I think the very large floating population there is in Mayo counteracts the effects of that difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A professional man told me recently that he was called to a small village outside of Swinford not long ago to draw up a will for an old man.  I think he said that there were 57 or 47 houses in the village.  When he went to look for a witness he could not find in that village anyone to act in that capacity between the age of 18 and 70, with the exception of one cripple. That gives an idea of what the floating population in that area is.  Some figures which have been supplied to me indicate that the total electorate in Wexford is 55,282, and in South Mayo 55,555, or 273 more than Wexford.  If these figures are right, then I think a good case can be made <Col N="1145" /> for this amendment, and I hope that on an open vote it will be accepted. I have not done any canvassing in connection with it.  I hope that Senators will freely express their opinions on it, and I confidently appeal to them to give their verdict conscientiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this amendment and I want to put the fact on record, because I think an injustice is being done and was done when one seat was taken from South Mayo.  The Minister so seldom allows free votes in the Dáil that the fact that he chose this particular matter as a matter on which there should be a free vote is a poor example of non-Party politics.  I claim that South Mayo is definitely entitled to this seat, and if the Minister were aware of the difference as between County Mayo and County Wexford, I do not think that, in justice, he would have allowed that free vote.  We must have regard to the fact that the land in Mayo is much poorer, that the area is much greater and that the difference in voting population is very small.  We must also have regard to the fact that the people in Mayo make greater demands on their public representatives than the people in Wexford. The people in Wexford are a much richer community because their land is much better and they have better transport facilities.  All these arguments indicate that the seat should have been left to South Mayo and I hope the Seanad will realise that the people of Mayo have to make greater demands on their public representatives than those in a county like Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the fact that we have the tragedy of people in Mayo leaving that county because there is no economic opportunity for them there, but many of these people are coming back. Many people who left Mayo as migratory workers, who normally would return from Scotland and England, did not return during the war, due to difficulties of travel, securing of visas and <Col N="1146" /> so on, but when conditions are easier in that regard, these people will come back.  Having regard to all these arguments in favour of the adoption of the amendment, I appeal to the House to support it, so that an area which has suffered because of economic conditions will be given this extra measure of relief, because, as I say, people in an area like Mayo must make greater demands on their public representatives than those in a county like Wexford.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my position pretty clear yesterday on this matter and I support this amendment on the grounds I gave yesterday, that it is entirely unfair that, at a time when a Bill is brought in to increase the representation in the Dáil, a constituency which has had five representatives for a considerable time should be reduced by one because of a decision taken in the Dáil&mdash;a hasty decision, as I call it&mdash;a decision which the representatives of County Mayo, North and South, were not aware would be taken at the particular time.  There is quite a big volume of opinion in Mayo, as in other countries, in favour of the idea that, instead of increasing the membership of the Dáil, there should be a much reduced membership, which could discharge its very important duties as efficiently as the present Dáil does.  If a Bill were introduced to reduce that representation, I do not say that I would not support it, and support it strongly, but when a Bill is brought in to increase the Dáil membership by nine, I do not agree that, because of a fluctuation in population in South Mayo, that constituency should lose a seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other speakers have pointed out, conditions in Mayo are entirely different from those in Wexford. There is in Mayo a migratory population&mdash;people over 21 years of age go annually to England early in the year and invariably return for the Christmas holidays.  They may stay there for five or six months until they secure other employment in England, if they are not satisfied with the employment they have left.  Conditions in County Mayo for a considerable time past have necessitated that annual migration, <Col N="1147" /> and, as a matter of fact, the attractions offered by way of wages there are attractions which any Government will have very great difficulty in counteracting. I should like to know what form of legislation could be brought in that would meet such a situation.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, until such time as a Bill is introduced to reduce the Dáil representation, I regard it as not altogether fair that a Bill originally drafted to give South Mayo the five seats it had since the electoral areas were revised, should now be reversed, and I feel that the Dáil should have an opportunity of reconsidering the situation before Mayo is denied the seat it has held since the constituencies were last revised.  I trust the House will enable us to have the matter reconsidered&mdash;that is the most we can hope for&mdash;in the Dáil before this injustice becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I am concerned with is not whether Mayo should have five, four or 24 Deputies. A good case has been made for 50 Deputies, if it is to be based on poverty, but what I am concerned with is this: I understood it was the feeling of the House that this Bill should be passed into law immediately and that we should not make any alteration in it.  That was what I gathered was the feeling of the House when I withdrew nine amendments that I had on the Order Paper.  If, however, the House has some other view on the matter, I do not want to interfere, beyond claiming my right to re-introduce my amendments on Report Stage, if there is to be an alteration at all.  I think there is a good case for the House altering the Bill in relation to the title of constituencies; I think there is a doubtful case as to whether the House should interfere with the right of Dáil Eireann to decide the manner in which its own constituencies are to be framed and the number of Deputies to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care whether there should be five or 25 Deputies in either South Mayo or Wexford.  I am prepared to defend Dáil Éireann's right to decide <Col N="1148" /> the matter for itself, and I think it is unwise for the Seanad to interfere in a matter in which they have not got the most remote interest.  Not merely was Dáil Éireann not dictated to, in relation to the representation in Mayo, but the position is that the matter was left to a free vote and the members of Dáil Éireann were free to decide for themselves.  Now we are being asked to tell Dáil Éireann that it made a mistake because the Deputies were not shepherded by Whips into the different lobbies and that it must review its decision.  It is a very bad day for this House when it starts interfering in that way.  It was done on a few occasions before, foolishly, and one of these foolish errors led to the suppression of Seanad Éireann.  Members of the Seanad should decide whether they want this House to do its own business and to mind its own business and not start interfering where it has no right to interfere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he is not; but there is a great deal of force in the proposition the Senator has put forward, that it is very largely a matter for Dáil Éireann itself, with due advertence, of course, to the requirements of the Constitution, to determine in what way the representation of the people in Dáil Éireann shall be allocated. This, as Senator O'Reilly has reminded the House, was left to a free vote of the Dáil, and it was left to a free vote because there was very little to choose between Wexford and Mayo as to which of them should lose a member. We had, as I pointed out on Second Reading, allowed the maximum representation in the Dáil that the Constitution permitted.  We had 147 seats to allocate and there were three constituencies, two of which might have either four or five.  One was the proposed constituency of Longford-Westmeath; another, the constituency of Wexford County, and the third, South Mayo.  One of these had to <Col N="1149" /> lose, and I, weighing all the pros and cons, decided that Wexford was the one that should lose a member.  The reasons in favour of Wexford and against the other constituencies and against Wexford in favour of the other constituencies were very evenly balanced, and I decided, since it was merely a question of personal judgment as to which was the better entitled, that I should leave it to a free vote of the House.</P>
      <P>The matter was not sprung on the House.  Senator Ruane has suggested it was, that the Deputies from Mayo did not get sufficient notice.  That is far from being the case.  The matter was raised, in the first instance, on the Second Stage by Deputy Corish, and, I think, supported by some other Deputies. It was raised again on the Committee Stage, and, because of the facts I have given as to the difficulty I had found in determining the matter, I indicated on the Committee Stage that, if an amendment were brought in, I would leave the matter to a free vote of the House.  I even went so far as to say that, in order that the matter might be brought before the House in a formal way, and decided by the House, I would, if necessary, bring in an amendment myself, but that I should not vote for the amendment, that, if anything, I might vote against it.  On the Report Stage, the amendment was moved by Deputy Corish.  It was spoken to, for and against, by a number of Deputies.  I intervened and I put all the facts so far as I knew them in relation to both these constituencies before the House, including the fact to which Senator Meighan has adverted here this evening, that so far as the Parliamentary electorate is concerned there is a slight balance in favour of South Mayo.  The figures which he gave are 55,555 in favour of South Mayo as against 55,282 in favour of Wexford. Notwithstanding all this, the House came to a decision, by what I think is an overwhelming majority, in favour of Wexford.  The actual figures for the division were 54 votes for Deputy Corish's amendment and 26 votes against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that in the light of those figures there is no probability whatever that the Dáil will reverse the decision <Col N="1150" /> which it has already given and I do think, as I have said, in view of the arguments which Senator Duffy has put before the Seanad, that it would be unwise, from the point of view of the Seanad, and that the House would be only courting a rebuff, for the House to accept this amendment and to send the matter back to the Dáil for reconsideration. It would involve us in a great deal of time.  It would not involve us&mdash;I would like to say this&mdash;in the sort of upset which the acceptance of any one of Senator Duffy's amendments would cause.  This does not relate to the actual definition of constituencies. It merely relates to the allocation of the representation to be accorded to each and in that regard it does not matter to the returning officer, from the point of view of preparing his polling scheme and his register, whether the constituency is going to have four members or five.  It would matter very seriously if all the work which he has done in relation to the preparations, arrangements for printing, stamping, and so on, were to be thrown into the melting pot again.  But, notwithstanding the fact that it would not cause the same confusion as the acceptance of Senator Duffy's amendments would cause, I do think it would be undesirable, in view of the fact that we are all anxious to see this Bill out of the way and to have the position definitely settled.</P>
    <P>In view also of the very emphatic decision which the Dáil gave in this matter, it would, I suggest, not be wise for the Seanad to accept the amendment which has been proposed by Senator McEllin and supported by the other Senators who happen to have associations with Mayo.  I should remind you that this House is supposed not to be constituted upon a territorial basis but upon a vocational one.</P>

That is not the Minister's fault.  That would be the Deputies' fault, I am sure, if that is the fact.  That has been stated. There is one part of the Minister's reply with which I disagree.  He has used the statement of Senator Duffy to justify his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can gather from Senator Duffy, his reason for advocating that the amendment should not be accepted was that it was by way of a threat to this House.  He indicated, if I understood him correctly, that this House should have some regard to what happened another established institution here because they took a certain line on a certain matter.  That, to me at any rate, was a sort of intimidation. Probably I took the wrong view from Senator Duffy.  But, having regard to the fact that the voting power in Mayo at the moment is, as Senator O'Dea correctly stated, five fives, I think they should be given the sixth five.  They <Col N="1152" /> have a slight majority of voting power and, having regard to all the other considerations that I have already outlined, the topography of the constituency, the relatively poorer community, the fact that it has worse roads and not as good transport, this House would be quite justified in passing this amendment.</P>

      <P>The last tough football match we had here was between Galway and Mayo, in regard to the cost of a bridge on the Corrib. It was a Connacht championship. Galway won on that occasion.  It is not fair to bring us into this match between Leinster and Connacht because I do not think any of us would be in a position to decide.  The Dáil has decided on a free vote on this matter and I think it is unfair to ask us to do what we are being asked to do, that is, to disagree with what the Dáil, in its wisdom or ignorance, has already done.  I would ask those in favour of the Mayo constituency not to put it to a division because, between Munster, Leinster and Ulster, we cannot very well decide whether Mayo or Wexford should have the odd seat.  I do not think the members of this House should be asked to rescind what the Dáil has done.</P>

      <P>As this would seem to be a wasteful division, I join in appealing to those who are responsible for this amendment to withdraw it.  Most of us have no hand, act or part in this little difference as to which constituency is entitled to the extra seat but I am convinced that it would be highly imprudent, to say the least of it, if we were now to send back to the Dáil what would be a reversal of the decision they so easily arrived at on a free vote.  We have heard a lot of talk about practicalities and all the rest of it in debates yesterday and to-day.  We must look at this in a practical way.  There has been a free vote in the Dáil and by a very substantial majority the Dáil has decided what they want done in this matter.  I would strongly appeal to those of my friends who are, naturally, speaking in support of this amendment because of the area from which they come, that it would be unwise, to say the least of it, to <Col N="1153" /> persist in the amendment and, frankly, they lose nothing if at this stage they withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I am in a rather invidious position.  I had been approached by a great number of people in my constituency to move an amendment in regard to Limerick and, in deference to the Minister, because he wanted the Bill to become law as expeditiously as possible, I surrendered the right I thought I had, not anticipating this unexpected development. This has put me in rather the same position as Senator Duffy is in. Therefore I would appeal to the mover and seconder of this amendment that they should have some consideration for us, who may have to face the argument as to why we did not do as they had done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I reached practically the same conclusion as Senator Duffy though I would not be quite as vigorous about it as he is.  Constitutionally, we have a certain amount of responsibility for the electoral system, at any rate, to the extent of expressing a point of view.  If there had been a matter which had been overlooked in the other House or which was raised afresh and which might require a good deal of discussion, there would be a good deal to be said for our sending that matter back for rediscussion.  I cannot see that this is a matter in which we could exercise even the very small amount of power of delay or that we should in any way fight with the other House about it.  The practical position at the moment&mdash;and I do not want to over-emphasise the practical side of it&mdash;is, that for good or evil, this matter is urgent in a way in which it would not normally be urgent and probably was not intended to be when the Bill was drafted and now to go back, simply for the purpose of having another free vote in the Dáil and another whipping up of the two sides, and delaying that length of time, with almost certainly the same result, does not seem to me to achieve public advantage. If I could see any advantage in it I would be as ready as anyone to stand up for what would seem to be our right to make suggestions but, having <Col N="1154" /> regard to all the circumstances, I am inclined to think that we would be wise, having mentioned it again, to leave well alone as a matter of wisdom.</P>
      <P>Personally, when I read the debate in the Dáil I could not help wondering why it arose at all; why Wexford and Mayo did not both have 4; why 146 would not be just as good as 147, but you cannot raise that now, obviously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacEllin" hpid="Mr. McEllin Mr. McEllin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the considerable support which I got in the House for this amendment.  In view of that support, I do not think I would be justified in withdrawing my amendment. Apart from that aspect of it, I have other points of view on it. When this amendment was moved in the Dáil, there was a certain amount of hurry in connection with it.  I notice that at the time the division was taken, practically all the Deputies, with the exception of one or two, representing South Mayo, were absent, including the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party and he thought it desirable the following week to get up and say that notice was too short and he was not aware that such a division was likely to take place.  I do not know whether that is a genuine excuse or not.  I suppose he had as much notice as anybody else.  But at least there is evidence there of a certain amount of hurry in connection with the challenge that was put to the Deputies.  That being so, I think it would be only right that they should get another opportunity of considering this on a free vote of the House again.  I hope I am not misjudging the Minister.  In sponsoring the Bill here, particularly with regard to resisting this amendment, he was very fair indeed but I gathered from him that there is no serious impediment or delay involved by the alteration of one figure in one constituency and another figure in another constituency. It is a simple issue and does not in any way delay the Bill.  For that reason, I think we should not allow ourselves to be stampeded into the belief that we cannot challenge a division because it would hold up the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter. This House has always boasted of the fact that it can express different <Col N="1155" /> points of view and can delay legislation to a reasonable extent.  I think we would be justifying ourselves and the independence of the House by giving more time to the discussion of this amendment and, having passed it here, by giving the Dáil an opportunity of reconsidering the position. There will not be the excuse then for saying that people were absent from the House and were neglecting their duty.  It will give a full opportunity to the Deputies of seeing justice done in their constituencies.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold the House up but I think that Senator McEllin is under a misapprehension as to what the position may be in the Dáil if this Bill is sent back. Having given a whole morning of the Dáil's time to the discussion of this matter already we cannot permit a further opportunity for a prolonged debate.  We have not merely this Bill to get through but several others as well.  There is the Seanad Bill, the Housing Bill, Expiring Laws Bills and a number of other measures all of which are urgent and which make the Parliamentary timetable very crowded. No assurance has been given that if this amendment is accepted here and the Bill sent back to the Dáil that there will be a free vote on it.  I should like Senators to understand that by voting on this amendment and passing it they are not going to give a further opportunity for considering this question <i>de novo.</i>  The Government is responsible for ordering Parliamentary time.  There are a great many other matters pressing for attention, matters which must be passed and in the light of all this I think it would be wrong if the Government gave any more time for discussion of this matter.</P>

Polling schemes have to be prepared on the basis of this Bill and must be ready for submission to the local authorities, and whatever significant changes are being <Col N="1156" /> made must be ready for the approval of the local authorities by December 1st.  I would not want to unduly fetter the judgment of the House or the Government in relation to this matter by anticipating what would happen if it should come before the Dáil again, but I would like to say that from a practical point of view it would be most unwise and imprudent to send the Bill back with this amendment.</P>

I have definite requests from a number of parties to put the points clearly and strongly here that I have already put. The viewpoint is contained in the amendment, that is, that it is the opinion of Seanad Éireann that South Mayo is entitled to a fifth seat on the figures.  Earlier in the debate the Minister told us that the sending of the Bill back with this amendment would not involve the same complications as sending it back with Senator Duffy's amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, but the position I am in is that my hands are tied.  If this was a personal matter I could decide myself.  There is another very strong point in favour of sending it back and that is that the voting in the Dáil was 55 to 26.  The combined votes did not represent more <Col N="1157" /> than half the entire representation of the House.  If the voting had been different and if there was a clear overall majority nobody would question it. I am not asking the House to dictate to the Dáil, I am asking that a decision of the Seanad be taken on this matter and conveyed to the Dáil and I will have no bones to make about what the decision is.  I regret to say my hands are tied in this matter, as I have said before.  If it was a personal matter I would be inclined to facilitate the House.  At the same time I cannot see that it would impede progress to any great extent.</P>

If I were discussing this question <i>de novo</i> I would object to the number of Deputies being 147, but that is a matter for Dáil Éireann.  They have to provide for the payment of those Deputies and they have to carve out their own constituencies.  I refrained both yesterday and to-day from interfering in this matter and if the Seanad is wise it will not interfere, either. We devoted far too much time discussing this question on which Senator Meighan has confessed that he has an open mind.  It seems to me the most absurd proposition I have heard in this House for the last three years and the least justifiable.</P>

      <P>A man with an open mind has no opinion.  Once you make up your mind on a matter you have a closed mind on it: you have fixed your mind and my mind is fixed on this matter.  It is unwise for this House to <Col N="1158" /> interfere with Dáil Éireann and to interfere in a business that is the exclusive concern of Dáil Éireann and if the members of this House are wise they will not interfere with it.  It is doubly so when a decision has been reached on the matter by a free vote of Dáil Éireann in which Ministers voted against each other and members of the same Party voted against each other. I could understand a case being made here for the amendment if the decision taken by the Dáil had been forced by the Party Whips.  I could understand that proposition but I cannot understand our being asked to reverse a decision freely taken by the members of the Dáil without any pressure by any one.  I am not objecting to the House accepting the proposition before it.  All I ask is that if it is accepted I will be given time to repeat my amendments on the Report Stage.  If it is to go back to the Dáil I will endeavour to ensure, as far as I can, that it carries my amendments also.  We promised yesterday to let the Minister have the Bill to-night and we cannot give it to him to-night if we are going to insert amendments to it.  The Dáil, I suppose, will not meet to-morrow and that would mean a hold-up for a week.  The Minister told us that these were the sort of amendments moved by people who were afraid of a general election but the proposer of this amendment is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I do not know whether there is any significance to be attached to that or not but Senator McEllin is still in the hierarchy of the Party of which the Minister is such a distinguished representative in this House.</P>

Why are we sitting here discussing this Bill at all if we have not the right to discuss an amendment? Not an amendment of the type moved <Col N="1159" /> by Senator Duffy for the purposes of creating complications.  Senator Duffy tells us that this is purely a matter for Dáil Éireann, that it is their business and that we must not intervene.  If that is so, the matter should not come before us at all and we are wasting our time discussing it.

I am <Col N="1161" /> adhering to the view that it is unwise for the House to accept a proposal of this kind.  I assure the House that I am not influenced in that decision by any Party considerations.  If I were influenced by Party considerations, as some other people are, I would have taken the line that only four Deputies are wanted in Wexford.  That is quite obvious to anyone who knows the circumstances in Wexford.  I want to bring the House back to reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made here is a case for five Deputies for South Mayo in the belief that certain Parties require five seats there in order to maintain certain numerical strength in the other House. There is no other case for it.  Actually the position in Mayo is that between 1926 and 1936 the population fell by 10,000, and between 1936 and 1946 it fell by another 10,000, or a decline of 20,000 in 20 years.  Still the case is being made that there should be as many representatives there in 1947 as <Col N="1162" /> there were in 1926, despite a decline of 20,000 in the population.  I was arguing mainly as to the wisdom of this House reversing a decision already come to.  I have never alleged, as Senator McEllin suggested that we cannot do so.  Of course we can. There is nothing in the Standing Orders or in the Constitution to prevent this House passing the amendment, but it is often wise on occasions to refrain from doing things which normally would be done.  It would be unwise to do them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Budget has been accorded a wholehearted welcome by the Opposition, for the rather paradoxical reason that it is supposed to be a rather unpopular Budget, losing votes for the Government <Col N="1163" /> candidates in the by-elections from which we have just emerged and causing a further reduction of Government support in the general election coming shortly.  It may be that the added tax on the pint, on the cinema and on tobacco did influence voters who did not stop to think that their pennies and sixpences were going to relieve the harassed bean a' tighe in balancing her weekly budget.  I hope women will recognise that this is a woman's Budget, a homemaker's Budget, and that they will come out in their thousands in the general election to give support to the Government responsible for it.  As a woman, I take the opportunity of thanking the Minister for what he has done.</P>
      <P>For my own part, I welcome the Budget for other reasons.  When certain Bills were going through this House, increasing the remuneration of judges, civil servants, Deputies and Senators, I and many others felt that it was like a counsel of despair, that the Government had given up in despair any hope of controlling the cost of living and had set a sort of riderless horses' race between rising costs and rising salaries that could end only in disaster.  Therefore, I welcome the Budget as the beginning of an honest and realistic effort to face up to the problem of the cost of living.  It does not go very far, but the Minister has entered in spirit into the homes of the poorest of the people, to whom tea, sugar and bread are fundamental necessaries.  Because he did that and asked the cinema-goers and the smokers and those who enjoy their pint &mdash;I am not saying a word about that&mdash; to help to pay the cost of reducing the cost of living, and because he has done it in such a realistic spirit, I heartily welcome the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why I welcome it is that it seems to me to be an attempt to get a balanced economy.  I do not speak here as an economist.  We have had very interesting speeches in this House from professional economists, but it seems to me that a balanced national economy is not merely a matter of imports and exports.  We <Col N="1164" /> have heard of the disastrous gap in our economy in these respects, but there is something worse.  An unbalanced economy comes when a nation prefers luxuries to necessaries and that is the position into which we were rapidly getting.  If we are to put this nation on its feet, we will have to go back to the old rather Spartan conception of life&mdash;hard work, saving, sparing, feeling that luxuries are not necessaries but are earned only after we have provided for the necessaries.  That is the whole outlook I see in this Budget and for that reason I welcome it and congratulate the Minister on having introduced it.</P>
    <P>To my mind, however, the Budget does not go far enough.  In addition to these fundamentals&mdash;bread, tea and sugar&mdash;there are a great many other things that press very hard on the ordinary family and increase the cost of living.  There is the cost of clothes. During the emergency, the British met that cost by subsidising clothing and making utility clothing available.  I do not know whether that could be done in our case or not, but certainly something must be done, as the cost of clothing is so high that people who need new clothes cannot afford to get them and so cannot pass clothes on to the people who have no money to buy clothing at all.  Therefore, the high cost of clothing hits the poor very hard and is one of the things which should be looked into.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the 5 per cent. on the purchase of houses. There is, however, a bigger tax, that is, the auctioneer's fees.  I think that in Northern Ireland it is only after a certain figure that you get 5 per cent. Here it seems to apply at any figure, whatever figure the property reaches. If that is so, it would be a very good idea to tax auctioneers after a certain amount or else reduce this tax after the auctioneer's fee had reached a certain figure.  I feel that this is a homemakers' Budget and a woman's Budget and that a woman should express her views on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not take part in the debate yesterday and do not propose to do so at any great length <Col N="1165" /> to-day.  I have a good deal of sympathy with the remarks made by Senator Johnston, though I am not sure I agree entirely with him.  I also have a great deal of sympathy for the views of Lord Longford regarding the relative value of the cinema and the theatre, though I am not sure that I would be as enthusiastic as he is for any kind of theatre or music hall anywhere in the country.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned personally, the Budget suits me all right.  I do not smoke very much and the Minister will not get a lot out of me as far as liquor is concerned.  I have not been in a picture house for at least 12 months, perhaps longer.  So far as what some Senators call necessaries and what Senator Mrs. Concannon regards as luxuries, the Budget does not hit me. But if the Minister had taxed books to a prohibitive figure, he would have taken away something which some people call a luxury but which to me is almost a necessary.  It is, perhaps, an exaggeration to say that life would not be worth living if one could only eat bread and drink tea, the things on which there is a reduction, and if I could get no books, the things which interest me in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I make these remarks is because I recognise that any kind of subsidy, if it is not to be inflationary in its character, will have to be met by taxation.  I am not quite sure that the objects which the Government apparently had in view, judging by the other speeches in connection with the Budget, are going to be extended in exactly the manner in which they have adopted them.  I think it was the Minister for Finance, if not it was one of his colleagues, who said some time ago that the cost of existence was cheaper in England than it was here, but that the cost of living was cheaper here.  I was astonished that his Department did not change the name of the figure to the &ldquo;cost-of-existence figure&rdquo; because, of course, that is all it is.  It is not a cost-of-living figure in the distinction between living and existence.  If we are going to get the people, especially the people who are called the working classes&mdash;I do not like that term because I think it is misleading&mdash;to <Col N="1166" /> give maximum production in this country, we are not going to get it simply by saying to them &ldquo;we are adjusting the cost-of-living figure so that you cannot get any increase, but we are going to tax the things that you think are necessary to make life comfortable, interesting and easy.&rdquo;  As I have said, the form of taxation chosen by the Minister is, for my part, very satisfactory.  We have, however, got to recognise the fundamental fact that you will not make people satisfied on the bare logic of a cost-of-living figure based as it is at the moment.  The problem is not an easy one.  It will not be easy for this Government or for any other Government, and it will always be a matter for a difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>I certainly am not going to argue, as some Senators did, that the pint is a necessity of life.  I have often been surprised and puzzled to find that it seems to mean an awful lot to certain classes of people.  I am still more puzzled at the pleasure which many people seem to get from going to the pictures.  That is even more surprising to me than that the pint should be a necessity of life.  I think there is a very grave danger that if you simply go on what Senator Mrs. Concannon regards as hard work, austerity etc., you may fail to achieve what, after all, is the first essential step towards the ending of inflation, and that is the maximum amount of work and of production in the country.  We have to strike a middle line, and I think that, in wisdom, it is the line which should be taken.  I am giving that personal point of view which is, perhaps, a little different from that given by any other Senator who has spoken on the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which, perhaps, is not immediately concerned with the Budget, but it arises, to some extent, out of the British agreement and out of present conditions.  I believe that a great real of time would be saved in the Department of Finance and in the Department of Industry and Commerce, and I am perfectly certain that a great deal of expensive time would be saved by persons engaged in business&mdash;I am equally certain that a great deal of time wasted by the banks would also be saved&mdash;if the Minister <Col N="1167" /> could, at an early date, issue a general list giving an indication of the articles for which foreign currency would not be obtainable.  It might be difficult to say that dollars are obtainable, and then give a list, because the total amount of dollars available would, of necessity, be limited.  It might be the same with other currencies.  I think it should be possible, however, to indicate in the case of dollars, that there was no use applying for them, at the same time giving a general list which could be fairly well understood, as well as a list indicating that there was no use in applying for French or Belgian francs.</P>
    <P>The position in business for a considerable time past has been that very good firms in the United States and in European countries have been offering goods here, but the position is that the buyers in the various firms have no way of knowing whether they can get currency or not.  The buyer in a firm fills in a form and sends it to the bank. He says to himself that he probably will not get the currency but that he might as well apply.  He is afraid that if he does not do so a competitor may get the currency for that particular article.  A great many of these applications have to be rejected.  If I understood the speeches made in the Dáil a much larger number still will have to be rejected.  Not only does that waste a lot of time in the banks but it causes a good deal of aggravation in business.  What is far more serious, it aggravates important people who want to trade with us.  They can understand that we cannot buy because we cannot get dollars, but what they cannot understand is why they should get orders and then be told six or eight weeks later: &ldquo;We are sorry we have to cancel the order&rdquo;.  It may be said that firms should not place orders tentatively, but, as a matter of practical politics, that is the only way it can be done.  If you do not place an order tentatively and you then happen to get the currency, it means that you have to make a second application and that causes far more trouble, so far as banks are concerned.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he could <Col N="1168" /> save a lot of unnecessary time if, at the earliest possible date, he could make an authoritative statement on this matter.  I recognise there may be exceptional circumstances, but as far as general trade is concerned there should be no exceptional circumstances. I would urge on the Minister to consider this.  If I were looking at this from the political point of view I would tell him not to do it.  It aggravates an enormous number of people who then blame the Government for it. I am looking at it from the practical point of view, and I think there is a lot in what I say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Mrs. Concannon that a great deal of demoralisation has set in in this country.  People can see evidence of that in the different towns.  Drinking, particularly amongst young people, has assumed desperate proportions, even in places near towns.  I know places where, in the old days, the farmers used to rise at dawn and go to bed at dark.  They were very hard workers and produced a tremendous lot of food for the country.  Now, those men complain that their sons spend most of their time in the evenings in the public houses: that they remain in them until all hours with the result that they are not able to get up in the mornings to do their work.  These are the kind of people that must be taxed and that are being taxed under this Budget.</P>
      <P>I do not think that much money will be realised from the tax on whiskey or porter.  I think the opposite will happen because the consumption of those drinks has been practically given up by the poorer people in some parts of the country.  They have reduced their consumption to a minimum, so that they will pay less in the future because they are drinking much less than they did.  Apart from the tax on drink, we have increased Customs and Excise duties, an increase in the stamp duties and in the entertainment tax.  The extra road taxes are expected to bring in £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not clear that when all the sums budgeted for are added together they will enable the Government to reduce the price of flour by 1/- per stone, and <Col N="1169" /> also the price of tea and sugar which are essential commodities for the people?  It is the essentials that we must look to.  If they can be obtained, then the country can be said to be prosperous.  It will be all the better if people have to give up luxuries, and for that reason I welcome the Budget.</P>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Concannon rightly said that it was the <i>bean a tighe</i> who has to provide the goods needed in the home.  It surely will be a great pleasure to her, especially if she has a big family, when she finds that the sack of flour will cost her 19/3 less than it used to, and that the price of tea and sugar has also been reduced.  It will also give pleasure to her if she finds that her husband is spending less on drink and is working harder on his farm.  This is a temporary measure and it proposes to give the reliefs indicated.  I think it will be admitted that most people were drinking too much and were spending too much of their time in the public houses.</P>
    <P>I noticed that, during the by-elections, it was the consumer who got all the sympathy from the Fine Gael Party, but we see from to-day's newspapers that its sympathy has now gone to the publicans, and that it is meeting a number of them to-morrow to sympathise with them on their losses.  At the elections the Fine Gael Party sympathised with the poor man who had to pay an extra 3d. for his pint, but its sympathy is now with the publican because less drink is being consumed.</P>
    <P>As regards the essentials of life, this Budget will bring relief to the poor people.  The extra charge for beer will make very little difference to the man who goes to the public house say once a week and drinks two or three pints as against the great relief the Budget gives him if he has a big family.  The Budget, I think, is a very good one. There are some things in it which, I think, are unnecessary, and that perhaps go a little bit too far in the line of taxation.  Senator Baxter shed tears for the poor man who cannot afford to go to the cinema at night, but he forgot to mention that the 4d. seat in the cinema is not liable to any increase in tax.  That is the seat which <Col N="1170" /> the poor man and his family will occupy.  If the scale of charges is examined it will be found that the theatre owner would be almost as well off if he were to charge 8d. instead of 1/-.  In order to get in the greater number, he will reduce the price from 1/- to 8d., and so on down the list. For the extra penny he gets, he will find it much better to get the greater number into his theatre by reducing the price of the seats.  Senator Baxter need have no uneasiness on that score because the poor man is left where he is, so far as the theatre is concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has spoken a lot about the recent agreement, but that has as much to do with the present Bill as the flowers that bloom in the spring and it is very difficult to see how he can get these matters into a debate on a Finance Bill.  I do not intend to try to follow him on that irrelevant matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the taxation imposed, I dislike the increase in the stamp duties.  I do not object to the increase in respect of foreigners who purchase estates in this country.  The tax is big &mdash;25 per cent&mdash;but I approve rather than disapprove of it.  I would say, however, that the stamp duty on conveyances will have a bad effect in preventing the purchase of houses and lands.  The £500 limit is left as it is, but it should be borne in mind that what was worth £500 in 1910 would now sell for at least £1,500, and I am sorry the Minister did not leave the stamp duty as it was, in respect of sums up to £1,500.  Senator Sir John Keane mentioned that it would also affect civil servants and others of limited means who had agreed to purchase houses.  These people would have arranged the purchase of a house for £1,500, having gone to the Civil Service Permanent Building Society for a loan or to a bank, but when they find there is an additional £75 in respect of stamp duty on the deed, it will become a very big consideration and, possibly, will be the last straw which will prevent the completion of the purchase.</P>
    <P>I am thankful that a certain relief has been given in the matter of family settlements.  I did imagine that the <Col N="1171" /> words &ldquo;voluntary dispositions&rdquo; were not sufficiently wide and that they would exclude cases where a son, on getting a transfer, would have to support and maintain the assignor, or perhaps pay sums of money over to his sisters.  I understand, however, that the words are to be contrued as including these amounts and I therefore make no objection to it.  On the whole, apart from these objections I have mentioned, I think the Budget a very good Budget in the circumstances of the times through which we are passing, and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of ground has been covered in the debate on these finance proposals, but to me&mdash;and it is a feeling shared by the community generally&mdash;its outstanding disadvantages is its terrible permanency. Obviously, when subsidies had to be provided to reduce the cost of living, the money had to be got somewhere, and on the whole the Minister is to be congratulated on the wide spread of his net, because he has brought home, by these new taxes, to the man in the street the seriousness of the position which, I think, the average man did not at all appreciate.  It would be very easy, and it has already been done, to make a case on behalf of the interested parties concerned with wines, picture houses and so on, and I should be pardoned if I made a case against the very much increased taxation on motor-cars; but I do not think we should look at it in that way.  I think we should rather hope that the Minister in his wisdom might indicate that he regards these things as what we all hope they are&mdash;temporary expedients to meet a temporary difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who are connected with industry on a large scale know better than the average man how serious a problem was confronting the country because of the ever-increasing demand for increased wages to meet the ever-increasing rise in prices and something had to be done to curb that vicious spiral.  This is a well-thought-out scheme to reduce the cost of living to the person most concerned, the average housewife.  We have heard arguments <Col N="1172" /> and discussions as to whether the husband of that housewife is not even worse off now than before because of the increased price of his drink and because, when he seeks entertainment in his leisure moments, he has to pay more for that entertainment.  These, however, are not the necessaries of life, and it was the cost of the necessaries of life that was pressing hard on the average man's wife.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would say&mdash;various people have already explained their own cases with regard to their own special interests&mdash;it seems unfair, and I leave it at that, that motorists should be called on to bear a substantially increased road taxation at a time when, because of the circumstances of the age, they are restricted in the use of vehicles for which they will have to pay this increased taxation.  That, I think, is a reasonable statement to make, and if, as has been hinted in the other House, further restrictions on motoring are envisaged, I earnestly urge on the Minister to prevent, so far as he can do so, that further cut being anything like a substantial cut.  I am convinced that it is only for some political reason that there is any rationing of petrol at all.  There are plenty petrol supplies available, but the economy of England at present has dictated that the Government there, for reasons best known to themselves, should pretty well abolish what is wrongly termed private motoring.  We should not of necessity take a leaf out of their book.  I do not intend to dilate on that point at this stage, because I may have something to say about it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I feel that the Minister is to be congratulated on the businesslike way in which he has tackled a very awkward problem and I believe that, if the nature of his new taxes has done nothing more than to bring home to the masses of the people the seriousness of the position, which I do not think they really appreciated before, that fact alone would justify a Budget which, in detail, can be criticised.  I intend at a later stage to indulge in some of that criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the introduction of the Budget and the proposals contained <Col N="1173" /> therein were explained by the Taoiseach and myself in the Dáil. Senator Baxter, however, made the allegation that the Budget was &ldquo;due to reasons of which the Minister had not spoken.&rdquo;  I once read a book on the political economy of a Polynesian island and there the people were governed, not by reason, but by hoodoo.  If the people did not do the right thing, according to the opinion of the chieftain, the &ldquo;bogey man would get them.&rdquo;  We have tried always, and we are still trying&mdash;and we hope to be successful&mdash;to explain the reasons for any particular line of action that the Government takes and I think it is very foolish for Senator Baxter to think that he or any group or combination of groups can govern an intelligent people by hoodoo.  Senator Baxter says that this Budget is &ldquo;politically unpopular&rdquo;. What does he think the Government's duty is?&mdash;To produce popular budgets even though they may affect adversely the public interest?</P>
      <P>It is the Government's duty to make financial and other proposals from time to time, which are in the best interests of the people, even though they are difficult to explain.  But, at least we have this assurance, that, having honestly arrived at a policy in the best interests of the people, we can hope to convince all the intelligent people of the country that it is a proper policy. To date, and for some number of years, the people who are intelligent enough to support our policy have been in the majority and I do not think that their intelligence has decreased.  Even though no individual likes to pay more for articles, or likes to pay more in taxation, I think they will accept a general policy when it is shown to them and discussed with them and when they become convinced, as I think they will become convinced, that the Government in producing this, what Senator Baxter calls &ldquo;unpopular Budget&rdquo;, was doing its duty and that it would not have been doing its duty had it produced what he would call a popular Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action which the Government has taken in this Budget has been followed since by a number of governments in other countries.  It is a type of action <Col N="1174" /> that any honest economist, knowing his job, would propose, but it is a type of action that governments that are not prepared to face up to their responsibilities, or that are not secure in their parliamentary majorities, would not take.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest difficulties in the world to-day, one of the things that is bedevilling the whole situation, is that in certain countries governments have not run their affairs upon sound economic and financial lines.  And when I say sound economic and financial lines I mean exactly what I say and I would not accept as sound economic or financial lines policies that would have been dictated by certain economists ten or 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>A man can live at the standard of his own earnings.  He can live at a higher standard for a time if he sells his capital assets or if he gets somebody to give him a loan.  But, over a long period of time, an individual can only live at the standard of his own earnings and so it is with a community or a nation.  To enable us to keep any given standard of life, we have certain resources.  We have our annual output of goods and services, capital assets situated in this country, external assets and, potentially, we have foreign loans.  If it can be avoided, the normal individual who has some thought for his family will live within his means.  He will not sell his capital; neither will he get into debt. He will endeavour out of his annual income to meet his annual outgoings and perhaps put by a few pounds, if he can.  If our community are wise, they will endeavour to act on those very same principles.  We would not, even if we could, dissipate either our internal capital assets or our external capital assets for the purpose of current consumption, nor would we enter into borrowing externally for the purpose of increasing our current standard of living unless our current standard of living was something that was altogether too low from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>In the years during the war, circumstances compelled this country to add to its capital assets abroad.  We were <Col N="1175" /> not able to import all the goods that we desired to import to give our people their normal 1938 standard of life.  We were not able to import the raw materials for farm and factory and the machinery for farm and factory that would have enabled us to provide remunerative employment for all our people.  As a consequence certain numbers of our people went abroad and their earnings, in so far as they were not spent, accumulated to the credit of the community in the form of bank holdings and other holdings of, largely, sterling assets.  We were not able to get during the war, currently, full payment for the goods we exported.  We built up, as other countries built up during the war, foreign, external assets.  Since the war has ended we have been doing all in our power to get in the capital assets, the raw materials that will enable us to increase output of farm and factory and give remunerative employment to our people at home.</P>
    <P>Recently we entered into negotiations with the British to see how best they could co-operate with us and how best we could co-operate with them to increase our production and that we might give them further supplies of the goods of which they were in short supply.  One conclusion that the government came to was that if we could get certain raw materials and machinery from Britain we would save on our dollar expenditure.  Senator Baxter, in the course of the debate, said that we were going to cut our dollar expenditure to the bone.  It is no harm to have a look at the exact amount of United States dollars that the Government proposes to spend during the nine months ending next June.  In order that Senators may realise what exactly is meant by the number of millions of dollars we propose to spend, I will give them figures of our dollar expenditure in past years. In 1936 we spent 3.3 million pounds' worth of United States dollars.  In 1937, we spent 3.1 million pounds' worth; in 1938, 4.8 million pounds' worth.  That was pre-war.  Now in 1945, we spent £5,000,000 worth and in 1946, 11.3 million pounds' worth, and for the first nine months of 1947, £25,000,000 worth.  For the next nine <Col N="1176" /> months we propose to spend about £12,000,000 worth of dollars plus £6,000,000 worth that we earn by our visible and invisible trade with the United States.  That is a total amount of about £18,000,000 worth of dollars and if we cannot get about £2,000,000 worth of sterling wheat we may have to spend up to £20,000,000 worth of dollars in this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>United States dollars only.  I have been referring all the time to United States dollars.  During the last nine months we had to spend a very large amount of American dollars on wheat and coal and on other commodities, a large amount of which we used to purchase in England for sterling.  We hope as a result of the agreements that were reached in London to get the coal we require in England rather than in America and to save dollars and also to get certain other raw materials and equipment from them that will also save dollars. We also hope with the coal we get from England and the machinery and raw materials to step up our output from farm and from factory.  Apart from the raw materials and equipment we can get with the United States dollars and with British sterling we hope also to get, wherever they can be bought, the raw materials and equipment that will increase our output.  I think that if the goods are available at a reasonable price the £18,000,000 or £20,000,000 worth of United States dollars that we propose to expend in the next nine months, that is, the nine months ending 30th June, will enable our people to import the essentials of life and at the same time import a fair amount of capital machinery and raw materials. No country in the world to-day, with the terrific hardships that large numbers of peoples are suffering, wants to live at a millionaire's standard even if they could do so.  I think that in the present circumstances of the world, if we are in a position to import the basic essentials of life and the basic essentials for increasing our production our people should be satisfied.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment for tea, I dealt with the question of our United States dollar expenditure for the nine months ending June 30 next year, and I stated that, having regard to the state of most countries in the world, I felt that we would be able to have in comparison with them a reasonable standard of life.  Even if we could at the moment translate our external assets of all kinds towards the purchase of machinery, raw materials and finished goods, I think we would be doing a disservice to mankind if we used our power of purchase and took from the world pool more than a reasonable share of consumable goods which are in such short supply.  I think also, if we were to buy, or to attempt to buy, more than our reasonable share of raw materials and equipment we would simply help by our competition to drive up to a still higher level the small supplies of these things.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties in the world to-day is that prices of all kinds are tending to rise.  We have taken certain steps in order to offset the 10 per cent., or thereabouts, rise in the cost of living over the last 12 months.  Other countries are faced with still more difficult problems.  Anybody attempting to buy out of past savings, from current earnings or out of the proceeds of loans everything that is still available for sale, would bring about as a result an intensification of the competition, which is driving up not only prices of consumable goods all over the world but also of capital equipment and raw material.  It may look to our people, who take a general view of the world situation, and who do not examine the details, as if the Government here, in the proposals they made in the Budget, were cutting down in a ruthless fashion, the people's expenditure, or threatening to cut down, on essentials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last couple of weeks, since our Budget was introduced, other Governments have been examining their situation, examining rises in prices, and inflationary price pressures, and those of them that are stable, that know their own minds, and that are in a reasonable political situation to do what is right by their people in their <Col N="1178" /> long-term interest have taken, or are about to take, steps somewhat along the lines that the Government here proposed on October 15.  About October 15, or a week or two before that, having the cost-of-living index figure, which was calculated from figures collected on August 15, we saw that commodities here and the cost of living had risen by 10.8 per cent. in the previous year, that is, from August, 1946, to August, 1947.  We made proposals to collect a certain amount of money by taxation, £4,750,000, and to add to that another £1,000,000 which would have been surplus in the year's Budget and apply the total amount to the reduction of the price of certain essential articles of food.  By those means, we were attempting to forestall a demand for increases in salaries and wages which would have resulted in a further increase in prices and a consequent demand again for a further increase in wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>We attempted to break the circle, by collecting £4,750,000 and adding it to the £1,000,000 out of an expected Exchequer surplus, to reduce the cost of living by about 13 points and ensure in that way that the people in the wage and salary-earning class could, if their family conditions so necessitated, buy the essentials of life cheaper and avoid paying the cost.  Take a wage earner who has been accustomed to giving his wife a couple of pounds weekly to run the house.  If there is a family of four or five children, they will save by the subsidies on flour, bread, sugar and tea, somewhere between 3/- and 4/- a week; and if the father wants to leave that saving with his wife to take care of his family, he can, by avoiding paying anything more for his drink and tobacco, ensure that his family will be no worse off than they were on the wages they received last May.</P>
    <P>In other countries, during the same period that our cost of living rose by 10.8 per cent., the cost of living rose very much more.  The President of the United States indicated that he was making certain proposals to Congress to deal with the situation over there in which the wholesale index had risen by 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>In a year.  In order to show that our situation here is not just standing alone in the world, I propose to quote President Truman's words, as reported in the London <i>Times</i> of November 18th:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To-day inflation stands as an ominous threat to the prosperity we have achieved.  We can no longer treat inflation with spiralling prices and living costs as some vague condition we may encounter in the future.  We already have an alarming degree of inflation.  And, even more alarming, it is getting worse.</P>
      <P>Since the middle of 1946, fuel has gone up 13 per cent., clothing prices 19 per cent., retail food prices 40 per cent.; and the average cost-of-living items has risen by 23 per cent.  The cost of living is still climbing.  In the past four months it has risen at the rate of 16 per cent. a year.</P>
      <P>Wholesale prices are rising, too. They affect every industry and trade and they are soon translated into retail prices.  Since the middle of 1946, wholesale textile prices have gone up by 32 per cent., metals by 36 per cent. and building materials 42 per cent.  Wholesale prices, on the average, have gone up 40 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the President of the United States indicated that he was going to put before Congress a programme for dealing with the inflationary situation there.  His first proposal, as he indicated in the speech from which I have quoted, is the restoration of controls on hire purchase and the restraining of inflationary bank credit.  The second is the regulation of speculative trading on grain and other commodity exchanges.  The third is extension and strengthening of export controls which under present legislation are due to expire next March.  The fourth is extension of the Government's present authority to allocate transport facilities and equipment to ensure delivery of goods for export.  The fifth is the passing of measures to induce the marketing of live stock and poultry at weights which would mean conservation of grain.  The sixth is empowering of the Department of Agriculture to expand its programme of encouraging conservation practices and the authorising <Col N="1180" /> of measures &ldquo;designed to increase production of foods in foreign countries&rdquo;. The seventh is authorisation of allocation and inventory controls of scarce commodities basically affecting the cost of living and industrial production. The eighth is the extension and strengthening of rent control.  The ninth is authorising of consumer rationing on products in short supply basically affecting the cost of living. The tenth is the reimposition of price ceilings on critical products, as well as the reimposition on wage &ldquo;ceilings&rdquo;, although Mr. Truman said &ldquo;I believe there will be few occasions&rdquo; when the imposition of wage ceilings would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Now, in that particular country you have a situation in which production, in terms of dollars at any rate, has more than doubled since 1939.  Out of over two hundred billion pounds worth of national income there is a net export of about eight billion pounds worth of goods, and yet in that country, which is so fabulously wealthy, which has such a strong tradition of industrial enterprise, and which has all sorts of skills, knowledge and trained population they find themselves to-day in the position when the President proposes that these drastic measures should be taken in order to cure the situation existing there.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows how our people here react against Government control and how the Government has, on all occasions, to prove beyond the possibility of doubt that the control is necessary before it is accepted with any sort of goodwill.  But the American people are, if anything, even more individualistic, and for a President to propose measures such as these to Congress within a year of a presidential election, indicates, at least, that he believes he can prove to the people that it is in their own interest that such measures should be adopted.</P>
    <P>Another country which, like ourselves during the war, accumulated a large volume of external assets was Sweden.  Sweden's stock of gold and foreign exchange at the end of 1945 amounted to 650,000,000 dollars worth. At the end of this year of 1947, her gold reserves had fallen to 92,000,000 dollars <Col N="1181" /> worth and her holdings of United States' dollars, Swiss francs and other hard currency had practically disappeared, so that her liquid balances had decreased from around 650,000,000 dollars worth to 92,000,000 dollars worth.  As Senators are aware, at the end of the war Sweden was in such a strong position in regard to her production and was earning such large amounts for her timber and other essential commodities which she exported, that she considered it right at that time to appreciate her currency.  In July, 1946, she appreciated her currency to the extent of 16.6 per cent.  As I pointed out to Senators before, an appreciation of a country's currency is, from one point of view, a subsidy on imports, and a tax on exports.  However, in recent weeks Sweden has taken stock of her situation and has not only viewed the deficit in international trade which caused that big decrease in her external assets, but viewed the trend of the cost of living which increased very greatly during this last year.  In order to cure the situation, she has taken the following steps: imports since early September have been limited to essentials&mdash;food, fuel and raw materials; the buying power of the people is being reduced and higher taxes are being put into effect this year.</P>
    <P>Excise taxes on tobacco, liquor and other luxuries may be increased again. The Government is aiming for a big Budget surplus to drain off money.  A determined effort will be made to prevent further wage increases.  New building and plant expansion are being deferred by Government edict.  Paper use is being cut.  Assets of Swedes in hard currency areas, including the United States, have just been requisitioned by the Swedish Government. Private holdings of currencies as well as securities are to be taken over by the Government.  Tourist expenditures abroad are severely restricted and Stockholm sources report, according to the paper in which this appears, that measures even more severe may be expected and these may include much heavier income-taxes and complete control of investment.  That is a second example of a country which was <Col N="1182" /> neutral during the war, which, like ourselves, extended its external assets during the war, which has a reasonably stable Government and which was forced by the situation to take the steps I have outlined, steps which are more or less along the lines of those the Government propose for dealing with our situation.</P>
    <P>Another country, a short account of which I should like to give, is Canada. Canada during the war changed from being, so far as I remember, a debtor nation to being a rather large creditor nation, and at the end of the war her United States dollar reserve stood at £311,000,000 worth of dollars.  That figure is related to January, 1947.  By the 13th of this month, the £311,000,000 had decreased to £11,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say that Canada was a debtor nation before the war&mdash;to Britain or to the United States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection of the figure for British investments was about £500,000,000, but the Senator should not tie me to that figure because I have not read for a long time.  The United States investments in Canada were very much more.  There are some very big organisations which have plants there, like Ford, General Motors, the General Electric Company, many of the oil companies and so on. At any rate, Canada's external assets have fallen from £311,000,000 to £11,000,000 in the past nine months. Prices there, too, have risen very steeply.  Between December 1946, and January, 1947, they rose by 14.4 per cent., which is 4.4 per cent more than our prices rose in a year.  Canada, by the way, as Senators will remember, just before the Breton Woods Agreement came into operation, the last date by which a nation could unilaterally appreciate or depreciate its currency, appreciated its currency by 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Canada has been taking stock of the situation, and, according to an evening paper report of November 18th, sweeping emergency proposals to correct Canada's foreign exchange position, including a total ban on imports of many luxury and nonessential <Col N="1183" /> products, were announced by Mr. Douglas Abbott, Canadian Minister of Finance.  He announced these major steps as follows: (1) an immediate total ban on imports of motor cars, jewellery, radio sets, refrigerators, washing machines, furniture, sweets, novelties, and typewriters; (2) the completion of negotiations for a 300,000,000 dollar loan from the United States Export-Import Bank; (3) a limit of 150 dollars on the amount of money Canadians may take in U.S. currency for pleasure travel; (4) special provision will be introduced at the next session of Parliament for a subsidy of seven dollars per fine ounce on gold production&mdash;I think the official price of gold in Canada is 35 dollars per fine ounce; (5) quota restrictions on imports of fruits, vegetables, leather goods, clocks and watches, games, toys, sporting goods and smokers' supplies; (6) an excise tax of 25 per cent. on sporting goods, outboard motors, pleasure launches, firearms, oil burners, motor cycles, musical instruments, cameras, radio sets and most types of electrical appliances. The Minister said that these restrictions were unavoidable and temporary. The new measures became effective at midnight, November 17th.</P>
    <P>I have given these examples of countries which have stable Governments and which would be regarded by the normal country in Europe as fabulously wealthy, in order to show the steps that they have been forced to take in order to deal with what is a general world problem of inflationary price pressures, and I did it in order to emphasise what I said at the outset, that Senator Baxter need not be looking for some hoodoo on the Government, some sinister secret force that compelled them to act in the unpopular way in which he says they acted, but that if he opens his eyes, and if any sensible and intelligent citizen of this country opens his eyes, he will see that the action that the Government propose here has been taken by other stable Governments to right a somewhat similar situation in their own countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> Senator Lord Longford said one very true thing.  Talking about the increased price of goods, he said: &ldquo;more goods is the way to cheap goods,&rdquo; and if we want to get cheaper goods than we have at the moment without this cumbersome way of collecting taxes in order to reduce their price, the only way to get them is to produce more.  That is our problem here and it is the problem in other countries.  The problem here is somewhat more difficult owing to our history than in long developed countries like the United States of America or Canada or some of the industrial countries of Europe that have a fair proportion of land.</P>
    <P>I hope that our people will realise that the steps the Government have taken were the only sensible steps that could be taken by a Government which realised its responsibilities and was prepared to act up to them.  We could, of course, have got this money by an increase in the national debt, by an increase in bank credit or Government debt rather than have taken what Senator Baxter declares to be the unpopular steps of raising it by taxation, but that would not have been fair to the people.  That is a type of step that is taken by Governments who either do not know or who knowing are not prepared to face the political consequences of doing the right thing. In some countries it is impossible for the Government that is in power for a few weeks to take these rather drastic steps that have been taken by us in this Budget.  I do not like mentioning individual countries but it is no harm to point out, and I do not think any person would resent it, that the political situation was so unstable that the various Governments that have been responsible for the government of France in this last couple of years have endeavoured to get out of their economic difficulties by an increase in the volume of money rather than by an increase in the rates of taxation.  The result has been that prices have risen catastrophically in France.  In one week about a month ago the Government added a few billions of francs to the volume of money and the next week or so prices rose 25 per cent. <Col N="1185" /> Prices are still rising in that country and the economic situation has reached such a stage that I must say that I am glad I have not either to think out or to apply the correct remedies.  All we can do is to hope that France, with whatever assistance she can get from outside will be able to weather the storm.</P>
    <P>A proposition has been made recently by a number of speakers&mdash;one speaker in the Seanad made it yesterday or to-day and it has been made by speakers in the other House and by speakers outside&mdash;that the only way to cure this situation and to make our people happy is to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. right away. Senator Johnston dealt with that yesterday and I, before he spoke about it, was making my own calculations.  From the calculations I have been able to make, to carry the recommendation to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. into effect, would require somewhere between £54,000,000 and £60,000,000.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated by some speakers that that money should be found, not by taxation, but by an increase in credit, an increase in currency. If this country wants to go the same way as France, that is the right way to kick off but, if it wants to keep on its feet and to keep the volume of money somewhat in relation to the volume of goods, the 30 per cent. decrease in the cost of living will have to be met by an increase in taxation to the tune of somewhere between £54,000,000 and £60,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now, there is no use in telling me that we can meet that amount of money by dropping the purchase of a Constellation or even by abolishing the Army.  Drop the Constellation and abolish the Army and you still have £50,000,000 to meet.  I think that the people who make that proposition should tell the country by what methods they propose to meet that amount of money.  Some people may suggest that we should leave the Army alone and even buy that Constellation, but that we should get the £54,000,000 or £60,000,000 by soaking the rich.  Let us see what we could get by soaking the rich.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say <Col N="1186" /> that that statement was made in this House?</P>

      <P>In 1943 the rich with over £1,000 per year had £21,000,000.  If you come down and take the rich with between £500 and £600 a year, they had £15.4 millions and the rich with between £250 and £500 a year had £23,000,000.  So far as I can see, in order to get money by soaking the rich you would have to regard a man as being rich with £5 a week and take it all from him.  That is, you would have to take into the Exchequer the total income of everyone with £5 a week or over and when the rich were soaked thus they would be all on the dole and you would have to tax the poor in order to keep them alive.  Again, I think that Senator Lord Longford and the other Senators who said that the proper way out of our difficulties is to produce more goods are correct.  The proper way to get cheap goods, an abundant supply of cheap goods, is to produce more goods.  Senator Sir John Keane had one suggestion to make in order to make the Budget balance.  It was an old favourite of his, to reimpose the excess corporation profits tax.  I have discussed this matter here and in the other House on many occasions and I do not want to go over all the ground again but I think that Senators should suspect that the excess corporation profits tax was abolished for a good motive, for the motive which was stated, that was, as an incentive to increased production.  I think that Senators should be convinced that this was the real motive when they see other countries similarly circumstanced to ours doing the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Labour Government in England that has not a great love for capitalism announced the abolition of the excess corporation profits tax in England before we came to that conclusion here. I remember that one of the excuses that was made for blaming my predecessor in regard to the excess corporation profits tax, and for blaming the Government as a whole, was that they connived at greatly excessive prices being charged because they were getting back three-quarters of it in excess profits tax.  I believe that it <Col N="1187" /> would be a bad system of taxation to reintroduce on its own merits and it certainly would be a disastrous system of taxation to introduce it here when it is not in operation in our neighbouring country and in the portion of our own country which they still have under their control.  In regard to stamp duties, Senator Sir John Keane and Senator O'Dea said that the increase to 5 per cent. was hard on people who were looking for a house. Now I hold strongly that it is not the purchaser who will pay the 5 per cent. The increase in stamp duty will have the effect of decreasing the amount of money which the vendor will get.  If we can think of an auction in progress when this new duty came into effect and can imagine that in the auction room there were several people who were there to compete for a house or a piece of land, the price at which the house would change hands would be determined by how far the man with the most money would be prepared to go.  When the tax was 1 per cent. and one man had £2,020 and another £1,900 and another £1,800, the man with the £2,000 would have another £20 to keep in view to pay in stamp duty and the price he would pay would be £2,000.  The man with the £1,900 would be out of it.  If we imagine the new tax coming into operation, the 5 per cent., the man with only £2,020 would have to find another £80 to cover his stamp duty on the house he was buying for £2,000, so that he could not give the £2,000 and his last bid would be about £1,920.  Again the man with the £1,900 and the man with the £1,800 are out of it.  Their last bid would be £1,900 and £1,800 respectively, less 5 per cent. tax in each case. The competition is not altered as between purchasers but what the duty will do is to ensure that the vendor will get 5 per cent. less than he otherwise would get.  That is not to say that the price of houses may not go higher.</P>
    <P>I did not make the proposal in the Finance Bill of a 5 per cent. tax on our own citizens and 25 per cent. on foreigners in the hope that it would have the effect of reducing the price of houses.  I made the 5 per cent. <Col N="1188" /> proposition in order to sweep in for Exchequer purposes 5 per cent. of the very much inflated prices that houses are fetching at the present time. Everybody knows that houses are making three or four times their prewar value.  Where they are bought by citizens resident here the Exchequer gets 5 per cent. of the inflated value, while the 25 per cent. on non-nationals will have the effect of putting our own people in a better competitive position when they go to auctions which foreign buyers attend.  Just as the proper way to get cheaper goods is to get more goods produced, so the only way to get cheaper houses is to get more houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government made a proposal to me a couple of months ago, to increase the subsidies for houses built by owners for their own occupation and, after the usual tussle about the amount, the Government approved of the amount that the Minister for Local Government announced in his new Housing Subsidy Bill.  I believe that the Bill will have the effect, if building materials are available, and if a sufficient number of workmen are available to use them, of reducing the price of houses.  The prices at which houses are going now, new and old, are ridiculously high.  Old houses are making almost twice and sometimes three times their replacement value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to small farms too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  Let us take one thing at a time.  New houses are changing hands at present in some cases at nearly 100 per cent. more than actual building costs.  I am a believer in the profit motive.  I cannot see how anybody could control the price that builders will get for new houses without stopping that particular activity.  I know that the position is very hard for a man who undertakes to build a house, and that he has to be up early and late trying to get bits of materials and equipment in order to build.  However, he is getting very well recompensed, and the fact that there is a profit in that particular line of business is attracting more people. <Col N="1189" /> I hope that competition will help to reduce the margin of profit to a reasonable level.</P>
      <P>Suggestions that have been made from time to time, that the Government should take direct control over the price of new building seems to me not to be workable.  Supposing the Government fixed the price per cubic or square feet, say £2,000 for 1,200 square feet of flour space, if 100 or 1,000 or 50,000 came forward to buy at £2,000 how could the Government determine who should get the house? I think it is better to let competition go on between purchasers and between speculative builders, rather than to take the extraordinary steps that would have to be taken in such a situation.  Meanwhile, the Minister for Finance will sweep in 5 per cent. of the builders' profits in stamp duties. In addition, he will get a bit from income-tax and if it goes too far, from supertax.</P>
      <P>A complaint was made about the price of beer.  The Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil complained about the price of beer.  He also strongly complained of how unfair it was to licensed vintners not to give them the same gross percentage on the increased cost of stout and porter.  I pointed out that to give the licensed vintners the same gross percentage would mean another extra penny on the pint of stout.  I stated in the Dáil, and I state here again, notwithstanding some letters that have appeared in the newspapers that, according to calculations made by my officials, and checked by me, from statistics furnished by representatives of the licensed vintners, the profit on the pint of stout stands at slightly over 3d.  The profit of the man who bottles stout is also 3d.  Of course, that is the gross profit, and, as I emphasised in the Dáil, out of the 3d. on a bottle of stout or 3d. on a pint gross profit, publicans have to meet overhead expenses, staff, licence fees, rents, heating, broken bottles and all the rest.  I think that is a reasonable profit.  Any Minister would be foolish to accept the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition to allow another penny profit on the pint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Senator Johnston spoke of the increased taxation on cars and suggested exemption for cars owned by clergymen.  The normal clergyman that I know uses an eight to ten h.p. car on which the extra tax would be from 1/6 to 2/6 a week.  If we accepted the suggestion that clergymen's cars should be exempt from the extra couple of shillings a week, we would undoubtedly have a suggestion that doctors, nurses and other deserving people should have their cars at lower taxation than the rest of the community.  It would be very difficult to operate and I do not think the benefit to any individual who might get it would be worth the cost to the State in adminstering such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston made a diagnosis of our particular financial and economic troubles here and pointed out that they were not due to internal inflation, rather that we have been in the past few years importing inflation from other countries.  That statement is true.  The Government debt over this last six or seven years here has increased by not more than about £17,000,000.  Against that increase in Government debt, we have to offset the increased assets which the State owns or against which it has a claim.  We have all the capital development of the Electricity Supply Board, the telephones, the very large and useful capital invested in Bórd na Mona, in the air companies, in improvements in our airfields, and so on.  During that period, not only did the Government debt not increase except when covered by an increase in State capital assets, but we had no fiduciary issue here.  Every pound note issued by the Central Bank was covered by a £1 of external assets or gold.</P>
    <P>The third source of an increase in the volume of money is the commercial banks.  Their accounts do not, or did not, show up to a year ago that there was any increase in their advances or investments within the State.  Rather they showed the contrary.  During the last year or so, the commercial banks' advances have gone up to a certain degree, but to a large extent in any event the increase in advances is offset <Col N="1191" /> by increases in stocks held by traders and others.</P>
    <P>That survey of the possible sources of inflation here shows that domestic inflation has been nil&mdash;that is, if we are to define inflation as an increase in the manufacture of money.  There has been a slight decrease in our capital assets, particularly during the last year or so, and our external balance has shown a deficit.  In normal circumstances, if our supplies of goods had not been so short, if our shelves had not been so bare, a deficit in the balance of international trade might be regarded as an inflationary trend and would, if it existed for any length of time, prove an inflationary trend.  However, I think that, on all grounds, we can say that there has been in this country little or no inflation.</P>
    <P>There has been, however, as President Truman pointed out, an inflationary trend in America.  Indeed, I was looking at some figures of the increase in bank credit that occurred there during the last 12 months and if one takes into account the balance of goods that were exported and adds to it the increase in bank credit that was advanced for hire purchase, for the purchase of real estate and for advances for personal expenditure, it is no wonder that wholesale prices have risen there by about 40 per cent. in these last 12 months.  But we were very badly affected here by that increase.  The 40 per cent. increase has meant that we have had to pay more for our wheat, for whatever raw materials we imported from that country and for whatever finished goods we imported.  I trust that the steps taken by the American Government will have the effect of reducing prices in America, not only for the good of the American people but for the benefit of our people as well.</P>
    <P>In regard to U.S. Government financing, as far as I can see there was no increase in the volume of money due to Government action, because the Government debt did not increase. Rather the Government had a Budget surplus and paid off a certain amount of State debt in the United States during this last year.  In the neighbouring isle during this last couple <Col N="1192" /> of years, the Government debt increased by £2,200,000,000.  As far as I can see, about £810,000,000 of that came from the banks and the rest came from the general public, or is represented by the expenditure of dollar loans or the increase in sterling balances held in London by other countries.  That particular inflationary trend, as everybody can see from the papers, has been worrying the British Government.  They took steps in their May Budget and in their recent Supplementary Budget to correct the situation.  In addition to that, they have drastically decreased their rations and very drastically increased their exports.  They took away the goods they were making for their own people, in order to export them to redress their deficit on their international payments.  We trust, too, that the British people and the British Government will be able to correct the balance of international payments not only again, for the good of the British people, but for the good of our people here, too.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to Senators that the amount of money which this State is spending on subsidies is very large indeed.  At the rate at which we have been subsidising over the last five months of this year, it will cost the Exchequer £15,000,000 should it continue for a full year.  And, by the way, I think that £15,000,000 is enough to spend on subsidies without spending £54,000,000 or £60,000,000.  It is hard enough to get £4,750,000 out of the taxpayer and the man who drinks an odd pint.  I certainly would not like to have to impose the taxes that would be required in order to get £54,000,000 or £60,000,000.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note what the unsubsidised price of certain commodities that we are subsidising at the moment would otherwise be.  The 4 lb. loaf at the moment is selling for 1/-. Its unsubsidised price would be 1/7½. Butter is selling at 2/8 per lb., and its unsubsidised price would be 3/2. Sugar is selling at 4d. per lb., and the unsubsidised price would be 6d.  Tea is selling at 2/8 per lb., and the unsubsidised price would be 4/10.  In addition to the subsidies that I have <Col N="1193" /> mentioned, Senators are aware that we are also subsidising fuel, fertilisers, seeds and lime.  The total cost of our subsidies, in a full year at the present rates, would, as I have said, amount to £15,000,000.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield asked me was this Budget to be a permanent feature of our national life.  All I can say is that I trust it is temporary, and that the £15,000,000 will disappear by a decrease in the cost of production: that, as Senator the Earl of Longford has said, we will get more goods in order to have cheap goods.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat again the difference as between wages here and in England.  The artisan gets 4d. an hour more here than he will get in big English cities such as Liverpool and Manchester, and even a penny an hour more than he will get in London.  He has less income-tax to pay; he can get a packet of cigarettes here for 2/-, even yet after this swizzing Budget, while he would have to pay 3s. 4d. in England; he can get a pint for 1/1, instead of 1/7 in England, and the pint that he would get there would be pretty watery stuff at that. He can get a good meal of meat here, instead of the small slice of meat that he would get in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, by and large, this country is in a good position to increase its production if our people will realise that it is a country not only worth fighting for but one in which they should remain at home working.  There are ample opportunities for men of ability and men of initiative to start out in business here: to go to work and get a few pounds together so that they may make a start on their own.  People did that here before.  They started to work for somebody and then when they had some money saved they were able to start work on their own.  There are opportunities here for every man who has energy and initiative, for every man who is prepared to study and train himself in order to be able to do a productive job of work.  I trust that our people will do that.  If they do, then we can get moving together so <Col N="1195" /> that goods will become so plentiful that they will fall in price.  In that way a lot of the taxation that we have to impose in order to collect money to reduce prices by the payment of subsidies would be unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take the Minister over a number of the questions that I raised.  He did not answer practically any of them.  I raised a question which was raised in another form by Senator Douglas.  I asked especially with regard to our purchases in the Argentine.  I asked what that money was spent on, and if the Minister would indicate the quantity of maize that was purchased or that was available or likely to be available. Senator Douglas raised a question as to what purchases Irish citizens could not make with dollars.</P>

      <P>I know, but I have other work to do besides looking up the answer to every question the Senator can fire at me in half an hour.  We have spent some money on maize.  It has been imported and a certain amount has been distributed.  In regard to dollars, we will announce from time to time if there are things which are definitely prohibited on the dollar list. We want to interrupt business as little as we can, and, as every Senator knows, one very difficult question to answer is what one can import even if one had the dollars.  We have told business men to go ahead with the ordering of machinery from America, from <Col N="1196" /> Sweden, from Switzerland, from Britain and from various other countries, and they come to us for currency saying: &ldquo;We have been promised this in six months' time&rdquo;, and it is sometimes 18 months and two years before the machinery is obtained.  It is impossible to answer the Senator's question with any accuracy, and I propose to delay making any statement about it, until we can do so with some security.</P>

    <Title>Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Bill, 1947&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this short Bill, I am seeking powers to enable me to control this new&mdash;if I may call it new&mdash;method of breeding by artificial insemination.  It is not a matter of announcing any policy on this new method.  We have not had any demands from any section of farmers for its introduction, but, as we have already one station in County Cork and as there are some prospects that we may have an application for the establishment of another such centre, I thought it necessary to seek the powers I am asking for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These powers briefly are (1) the licensing of all artificial insemination centres, excepting certain herds where the bulls and cows used are in the same private ownership; (2) the right of entry for authorised officers to any premises where there is reason to believe that artificial insemination is carried on; (3) power to prohibit the import or export of semen, except under licence; (4) power to revoke licences, if necessary; (5) power to make regulations the object of which will be to ensure the proper conduct of centres, and requiring that the technical qualifications of the staff, the premises, the equipment, the bulls used and the breeding methods, the records to be kept and the distribution of semen shall be subject to official <Col N="1197" /> approval.  These powers are the powers contained in similar measures introduced by other Governments.</P>
    <P>If any Senator should ask me to make a statement of my own attitude or the attitude of my Department towards this method of breeding, I am afraid I have little to say on the subject.  It is only natural that our farmers should not be inclined to raise any fuss about the introduction of this practice because all of us would be more or less inclined to be prejudiced. I must say that I felt somewhat prejudiced on my first visit to the only centre we have here, but, when I went to the place, I changed my mind, and, although I might not be very enthusiastic yet about it, I came away with a view somewhat different from the view I held when going there.  We can at any time we think it advisable&mdash;we have sufficient information from other countries&mdash;devise a scheme, if there is any public demand for it, to encourage these breeding methods, but, as I have already announced, I am not seeking power to devise, and I do not think I should be asked to outline, any such scheme in putting this Bill forward. The Bill merely gives me the right to see to it that, should any one make an application for the establishment of any further centres here, I, as Minister, will have the right to stipulate certain conditions before the applicant is allowed to start.</P>

      <P>In any remarks I make on this Bill, I am speaking for myself and not on behalf of the national executive of the live stock trade.  I oppose the Bill, and I do so because I believe it is against the natural law.  I oppose it because I regard artificial insemination as a demoralising process, which can be described as nothing less than animal masturbation.  We will be told that this practice of animal and other insemination is carried on very extensively in Russia and in many other countries, but that is no reason why we should have it here.  In many of these countries, it is not only artificially inseminated cows, mares, or sows, they have, but artificially inseminated humans.  I understand that in England, without going to Russia at <Col N="1198" /> all, there are two or three hospitals or clinics established for the artificial insemination of humans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to develop the subject but I hope that the farmers will not approve of the practice of artificial insemination.  We have got on very well during all the centuries without adopting this process. Individual farmers may carry it on and the Ballyclough centre may be continued but I think it is not right that that action should have the sanction of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave the Minister to deal with Senator Counihan.  As far as I am concerned, I suppose this action is forced upon the Minister. Ministers like to have power when they see new developments that are outside their control.  The fact that a co-operative creamery society in the south, the members of which were somewhat better informed than even some well-informed farmers in this country, came to a decision to establish such a centre as this in that district.  Whatever Senator Counihan may think, in the animal world the application of science is more important to-day in raising levels than it has ever been.  Science is making a very considerable contribution in other countries in every field of animal husbandry.  We are more backward and more conservative than they are elsewhere and the fact remains that some of the finest stock in the world have been produced in this way.  I have met some of the world's most famous breeders and the information they have on this is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> As we know, not very much has been done in this respect in this country as yet, and I am afraid that we must admit having very little knowledge of it.  As far as the Minister and his Department are concerned, the Minister is taking very wide powers in this Bill.  He says in a cautious kind of way that he is only taking power to issue licences but he is also taking power to revoke licences and, of course, he is taking power to make regulations. I agree that the regulations are going to be laid before the House but, in all these Bills, the most forceful part of them is embodied in regulations, so that we will have to watch what these regulations may contain. I do not mean to suggest that the Minister's Department are going to do something that is not sensible, so to speak.  Whatever we may say about other powers which the Minister may desire to take or has already taken in other fields, I do say that in regard to the administration of a measure such as this, some provision should be made for the establishment of a consultative body that would help in framing regulations and advise the Minister generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I am sure, will admit that his Department has very little information on this and very little practical experience.  Those of us who have been interesting ourselves in this development for a considerable period realise that that is the truth.  Whatever Senator Counihan may think about it, this practice obtains in other countries.  It is developing.  Considerable developments have taken place in Britain and in Canada.  I am not going to travel with Senator Counihan to Russia.  We hear quite fantastic stories of what the Russians are doing but we hear that about them in every field.  It is true that a considerable amount of knowledge has been gained by what has been done in Britain.  There have been successes and there have been failures.  Some of these centres have done wonderful things.  Some have been failures. That does not come under consideration in this Bill but it is important that if centres are established we <Col N="1200" /> should be able to make a success of them and, in so far as the administration of the Act may play any part, I suggest to the Minister that it is very important that in administering it there should be consultation between his Department and the people who are interested in this in a practical way.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be any dissent, except, I suppose, from Senator Counihan, with regard to the passage of the Bill.  I believe the Minister is more or less a passenger as far as this Bill is concerned.  It has had to come because these people were moving in this particular way and probably others would move.  The fact that the private breeder can act on his own, as the Minister has indicated, will I think, relieve certain people of some anxiety they may have with regard to the powers the Minister is seeking in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I dislike Government interference where groups of farmers show initiative. On the other hand, I realise that it is possible that if this matter were tackled in an indiscriminate fashion by some farmers it might have rather unsatisfactory results and, therefore, in so far as legislation is necessary in order to have order, I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, my approach to this subject is purely materialistic.  It seems far-fetched to be in any way concerned in this matter with questions of Christian morality as applied to human beings.  I regard it purely as a question of how we can improve our live stock in quality and in reproductive capacity.  If by these means we can spread the stock of our selected bulls or sires better than we can by the natural methods of insemination, it is our duty to do so.  The world is crying out for more and better goods of every kind.  The demand all the time is for more and more agricultural produce and quantity is affected by quality.  If by this method you can make better use of your selected herds I think it is your duty to do so and to be in no way concerned with notions and analogies of Christian behaviour.  I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude towards <Col N="1201" /> this measure.  He frankly says he has no information to give the house. Surely the Minister has access to what is being done in other countries.  He could have told us that.  I understand a great deal has been done in Russia and while the ordinary person may not be able to get the literature the Minister should be able to get it.  We are trying to approach this matter in a realistic manner and the Minister should tell us what is being done so that when these regulations come along we may have certain guidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly a good deal has been done in England, but the Minister says: &ldquo;I can give you no help at all in this matter and I want you to give me <i>carte blanche</i> to make regulations as I see fit.&rdquo;  To my mind that is a very dangerous way of legislating in a democratic state.  I know I will be told that these regulations are subject to review by Parliament and that in certain conditions they can be annulled, but may I reply that under our present method this precaution is of little worth.  What will happen under this system is that a type-script document will be what is called &ldquo;tabled&rdquo;: that means it will be put in the library and also recorded in the Order Paper of the House.  Possibly at a later stage an Order of this kind may attract the attention of some diligent Senator who may go and root out the one copy that is in the library. But when are we going to get a printed copy of it?  It may be months before the printed copy is in our hands and during those months the 21 sitting days within which the Order can be annulled may have elapsed.  Does the House know that printed copies of Orders have been received as long as six months after they have been tabled?  I received on August 25th an Order that was tabled in January.  It is really ridiculous to say that you have officially received notice of the Order when one copy has been put in the library.  We really do not get any knowledge of these Orders until we get them in our hands in print.  How can you adequately table an amendment when only one copy exists?  It may be more appropriate to raise this general <Col N="1202" /> principle on the statutory Bill. I only make the point to show the utter inadequacy of this machinery for annulling Government regulations.  On this Bill we are told nothing.  The Minister is to be given <i>carte blanche</i> without giving us any suggestion whatever as to the lines on which he is going to proceed.  He says that its purpose is to avoid dangers.  At least we might be told what dangers he foresees.  I see one danger, the danger of giving to the veterinary profession a vested interest in this matter. Personally, I fail to see why there should be only highly qualified persons dealing with this business.  Is a farmer not allowed to castrate his own stock?  So far as I can see this is a quite simple matter and the dangers much less.  I hope the Minister is going to resist making it the preserve of the veterinary profession or, if he is going to make it a preserve that he will come along and say so and say that educated people may not deal with their own property as they choose.  There again the Minister should have told us what the objections are to any herd owner using this method within his own herd or within the herd of his neighbour.  It is simply an extension of the natural method of the ordinary breeding.  We are told of dangers of abuse but I fail to see what the dangers are, or what the abuses are likely to be.  It is in the interests of the ordinary owner to safeguard against the abuses of his own property. Unless it is such a skilled operation that an ordinary layman cannot perform it, it is wrong to put any profession in a vested position.  It may be said that it is against the vested interests of owners of pedigree herds but I think it would be wrong if science has given us this method to restrict its use.  I think there should be no obstacle placed in the way of the fullest use of science in this respect. It is an abuse of legislation to come here and simply say: &ldquo;I am going to wait and see.&rdquo;  At least I hope we will get this assurance that when he has gained a certain amount of experience he will give us an amended Act so that we will know exactly the lines on which we are working.</P>

      <P>I will not delay the House for very long.  I would like to support Senator Counihan's arguments. I really do not think that the position of the live stock is so perilous in this country that we have to look to Russia or even to England for salvation.  During the term of office of another Government I do not think that the late Mr. Patrick Hogan, when he was in charge, advocated this particular way of improving the quality of live stock.  I think the State would be much better employed if it helped private producers along lines that the people understand without introducing new fangled methods.  It is all very well to talk about the progress of science.  Science travels very fast, but there are limits that we should be very careful of reaching.  There are scruples that we are not prepared to sacrifice in the interests of science. Until it is definitely established that the improvement of live stock has fallen down along natural lines I would not favour the introduction of the new system.</P>

      <P>I intervened owing to the remarks of Senator Sir John Keane.  It is not the first time in this House that I heard Senator Sir John Keane speaking in absolute ignorance on subjects like this.  I think he spoke here in a similar manner when he suggested that everybody should be allowed to intervene in the treatment of live stock.  The Senator does not appreciate that outbreaks of disease could be spread by such operations. He went on to express the opinion that it was all moonshine to talk of the effects tuberculous milk could have on the human subject.  The Senator seemed to imply that this is a very simple operation, and that it should not be in the hands of skilled <Col N="1204" /> people.  He says he does not want it to be a closed borough for the veterinary profession.</P>
      <P>I do not want anything to be a closed borough for any profession.  What are professions for but to study and to be capable of doing things in the interests of the community that people cannot do efficiently themselves.  I do not see why anybody should object in such an ignorant manner as Senator Sir John Keane objected to-night.  Actually, the application of this method could only apply in order to raise the milk production of our herds.  There must be some official control, let it be local or some other authority.  Senator Sir John Keane is such a democrat now that he wants things done entirely through local authority.  Certainly this cannot be done indiscriminately and ignorantly.</P>
      <P>The application of a science like this should not be left promiscuously in the hands of people who do not know anything about it.  The line I take is that this is what should have been done by the State and by the Department for the farming population.  Co-operative societies have been doing it for their clients in Cork and Limerick.  Ballyclough Co-operative Society employs a veterinary surgeon to attend the live stock belonging to its members.  That is what the veterinary profession wanted the Department of Agriculture to do for all sections of the farming community, whether they were members of co-operative societies or not. That co-operative society undertook to do what the Department of Agriculture has so far failed to do.  Other co-operative societies have veterinary surgeons to look after the animals that their members possess.  There are some diseases that no farmer can control. There are diseases which they can help to eradicate, an outstanding one being tuberculosis, of which Senator Sir John Keane on a previous occasion spoke so lightly.</P>

      <P>I would immediately proceed to withdraw if the Senator had given me a chance.  This Bill concerns research.  We know enough about this subject to say that it should be controlled.  We know as much about it in this country as they do in England or in Russia.  There is no need for this House to recommend that the system should not be controlled by the State.  There is no need to have it classified as totalitarian.  As representatives of the people, we must see that they have control, and that a system that concerns our live stock is not practised by everybody.  Co-operative societies have adopted certain methods for the purpose of improving the fertility and productivity of milking stock.  It is along such lines the system can be developed in the future, when we have sires of proved parentage, I mean when we have bulls of a certain classification, and not only that, but high quality progeny, in order to raise milk production.  As far as sires are concerned, there will be little widespread application of this system.  We had talk of interference by Government. The Government consists of heads of the household, elected to look after our affairs.  We should be unanimous about that here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reverting to Senator Sir John Keane's remarks that there should be no interference, and that this should not be made a closed borough for the veterinary profession, naturally those <Col N="1206" /> who are trained in the disease problems of live stock are the people who should be operating the system.  It is useless to think that anybody could start fidgeting in a matter of this kind.  It must be controlled by people who know what they are doing and who know the danger of spreading disease through ineffective supervision of the operation.  The urgent need of the country at the present time is to eliminate disease and that cannot be done by the farmers' own initiative or enthusiasm.  It must be tackled cooperatively. The Minister should try to implement quickly the recommendations which were made by the PostWar Planning Committee&mdash;and it is well post-war now to do this.  It will mean increased expenditure and more veterinary surgeons, but it is in the interests of the agricultural community that that want be supplied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The only body that can deal with this matter properly and is capable of doing so is the Department of Agriculture. They have all the experts and from years of experience they can see what is badly needed for our live stock. Senators would be astonished to learn the number of our live stock that died within the last 20 or 30 years because of neglect or because of treatment by home doctors.  They were not in a position to give the proper treatment, and in many cases the small farmer could not pay the fee for the veterinary surgeon to attend to his herd, with the result that by the end of the year he lost far more than he would if he had a veterinary surgeon near at hand to treat his cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no necessity to set up a body to consult with the Minister.  If the Minister's veterinary inspectors are not capable of understanding what the people want, there is no necessity to take in a body of farmers, who have not the slightest experience of the work and certainly would not carry it out to the satisfaction of a great many of those concerned.  I welcome the Bill for two reasons.  One reason which I had in mind some years ago, and certainly a number of co-operative societies have had in mind in the south, is that if we were in a position <Col N="1207" /> to have this inspection we would, through time, have also an insurance on the life of the cattle.  If they were examined and passed by veterinary surgeons, we could have a comprehensive scheme of insurance so that, in the event of losses being incurred, the unfortunate farmer would have something to get back instead of having nothing to recoup him.  Listening to Senator Sir John Keane making an attack, you would not believe that the man knew what he was talking about. I have no hesitation in saying that he did not.  He tried to ridicule the Bill and wanted the people to have a better understanding of it before it would be imposed on them.  He wanted from the Minister a more elaborate way of explaining to the people how this Bill should work in the future.  The Minister has quietly said that he has introduced the Bill and that there will be ample time for discussing it; and I am sure that all owners of live stock will welcome the Bill and give it every support possible, as it is badly needed and is in their own interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I know, this is a comparatively modern science.  It is in operation in a considerable number of countries in the world, where they may have much better stock than we have.  Will there be an international arrangement whereby the semen may be exchanged?  Will that be part and parcel of the regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not happen without my permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Take it that there is a prize bull in some foreign country which is an outstanding figure.  If we can get the semen from there, it is likely to help our people and would be valuable in this country.  To that extent, I think the Minister must have control.  We know that up to a short time ago, inexperienced people who have no knowledge or care in breeding, produced very poor animals.  If this will enable us to improve our stock, at what I consider a very simple and certainly not a very costly arrangement, the entire <Col N="1208" /> matter should be in the hands of the Minister.  I take it that this applies to horses as well as cattle and stock generally.  If we are satisfied that there are tubercular-free herds in certain countries and can get the semen from them, is there any international channel to effect the exchange?</P>
      <P>I am not interested in whether we are making jobs for veterinary surgeons or anyone else.  If they are necessary, by all means have them, but if they can be done without effectively, without injury to the objects we have in mind, then we need not employ them.  Senator O'Donovan might have enlightened us a bit more.  The Minister certainly did not give us a whole lot of information on this matter. As an ordinary citizen, I see a marvellous opportunity to improve our stock and if an international channel were arranged for swopping semen, it would be a very good thing for our live stock.  Consequently, I believe that it should be in the hands of the Minister.  Whatever regulation you may make, it must be in his hands and certainly this method cannot be allowed to be used indiscriminately, to the detriment of the whole cattle population of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I humorously prevented Senator O'Donovan from replying to the objections raised by Senator Counihan and Senator Ruane.  As Senator O'Donovan rightly pointed out, these two Senators were violently opposed to this method of breeding and also to the Bill.  The strange thing is that, without the Bill, anybody could come in here and introduce this method of breeding into any district in the country.  It could be made, as it were, a sort of free for all.  The Bill, at least, has this to recommend it to the two Senators who are opposed to the system that it gives the Minister power to say whether or not a particular person, society or group of people will be allowed to introduce this practice.  Senator Foran was quite right in saying that under this Bill I have the power to admit under licence&mdash;just as I have the power to <Col N="1209" /> admit a bull under licence&mdash;semen from outside this country for the purposes set out.</P>
      <P>Some other Senators have spoken quite enthusiastically of this system.  I do not know that there is any need to be in any way excited about it.  It is true to say that we have not had any practical experience, worth talking of, of this system.  We can see from what is on record what the experience in other countries has been.  Even if tremendous advantages were to be obtained from this practice, you cannot move out of line completely with public demand.  I will admit that if once it is established that benefits can result from this particular practice it would then be the duty of the Department of Agriculture to endeavour to lead those who would be likely to benefit most from it.</P>
      <P>I do not profess to know anything about this other than what I have learned from breeding reports.  Members of the House can see these for themselves, and can learn from them what has been done in other countries. It would appear from these reports as if the practice has been quite successful, but the problems in those countries may not be just the same as ours.  Our live-stock problems are, I suggest, somewhat different from those in most other countries.  For that reason, you cannot make comparisons between our conditions here and the conditions in those other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane has expressed some surprise and disappointment that I did not announce some general policy, so far as my Department is concerned, in regard to this whole matter.  It is not on a Bill such as this that I would make such an announcement, because really there is nothing in the Bill except the power to see that a number of things cannot happen without my permission as Minister, and that if I get applications from the Mitchelstown society, or from some society in Limerick or some other group of people, I will be able to say to them that they have my permission to go ahead, as well as to stipulate the sort of animals that I think they should use.  I can also impose any <Col N="1210" /> other conditions which I think are necessary.</P>
    <P>Some Senators seem to regard as very objectionable the giving of powers to Ministers and Departments to make regulations.  That is the usual sort of approach we find to measures of this kind&mdash;how undesirable it is to give Ministers and Departments such powers.  Great play is always made on measures of this kind as to the undesirability of doing that.  As everybody knows, however, there are a number of matters which arise in the course of legislation where it would be absolutely impossible to set out in any Bill just exactly the way in which you are going to deal with every problem that may arise.  I admit, of course, that excellent debating points can be made by suggesting that it is all wrong to give this power to Ministers and Departments, but in reality these points have very little substance in them.</P>
    <P>I am not a bit keen on giving professional people all kinds of control where it is not necessary to do so.  In the carrying out of this practice at any particular place, it is not necessary that a qualified veterinary surgeon should be there, but it is necessary that a veterinary surgeon should be in charge of each station.  Lay assistants can be employed and trained, and are being trained, not only at the one centre that we have but in other places, and their services are being availed of successfully.  I do suggest that it is necessary to have a veterinary surgeon in charge of each centre. As to the advantages that may accrue from the development of this practice here&mdash;an ordinary man might not be fully appreciative of the dangers that may result from it&mdash;I think it is right that we should be careful lest, while trying to do good, harm might result. If, as I said in a few remarks I made in introducing the measure, I should find at any future date that it was desirable to introduce here a scheme by which encouragement might be given by the State to this practice, we can discuss the many other aspects of this matter then, but in this, as I say, there is nothing with any reference to these aspects.  I am merely asking for <Col N="1211" /> powers which I think I should have and which are enjoyed by every Minister in every other modern country, so far as I know.</P>
