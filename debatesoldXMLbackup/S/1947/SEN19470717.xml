      <P>Yesterday, the Minister had just concluded his remarks in relation to this amendment, in the course of which he suggested that the case I had made regarding the difference between Ministers and Deputies in respect of postal and telephone charges was not correct.  I think that the Minister and I were at cross-purposes.  I did not suggest and never intended to suggest&mdash;if my words could be so construed I regret the laxity in putting them together&mdash;that if, for example, Mrs. Aiken happened to be elsewhere and the Minister desired to telephone her, he would get such a call free.  I fully appreciate that he pays for such calls in the ordinary and proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, I am satisfied that the postage on personal letters are paid for by Ministers in the normal way.  I ask the Minister to accept my assurance that that was not the type of case to which I was referring.  The case I had in mind was such as this: Suppose that citizen Patrick Murphy, of Dundalk, writes to Deputy James Coburn and to the Minister while the Dáil is in session about some goods which are held up by the Revenue Commissioners at the frontier post in Dundalk.  Neither <Col N="486" /> Deputy Coburn nor the Minister knows that the other has been approached. Deputy Coburn finds it necessary to telephone to Dundalk in connection with the matter, and the Minister's private secretary, who is dealing with the matter, finds it necessary to do likewise.  Deputy Coburn would, obviously, have to pay for the call.  In the case of the Minister, I suggest that it would be dealt with as a public charge.  It would be quite impossible for the Minister's calls to be segregated in such a way as to distinguish between calls made in discharge of the Minister's public duty as a Minister and his public duty as Deputy Aiken.  I do not make any suggestion that it is wrong or improper to have matters that way.  The same thing happens in regard to postage.  If it is necessary for Deputy Coburn to write about a claim for an old age pension by somebody from Dundalk, he has to pay the postage.  The Minister has not to do so; it would be utterly impossible to have it any other way.  It is because a Deputy has to meet these expenses that his allowance is paid free of income-tax.  A Minister has not to meet that sort of political, out-of-pocket expense, and I think that the whole of his emoluments should be treated as salary.  The question raised here is not one of amount.  It is merely a question of the method of arriving at the amount.  I am perfectly prepared to admit that, if income-tax is to be deducted, the salary must be grossed up to the proper point.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dea raised a point about sub-section (3) of the section.  If it were not for sub-section (3), the Deputy's allowance would be added to the total of the salary as fixed.  That point is hardly germane to this amendment. There is a desirable principle involved and I do not think that the Minister put forward any real objections to that principle.</P>

      <P>I should like to develop what was in my mind yesterday, especially in view of the report in the Press to-day of the Minister's remarks yesterday.  I appreciate, that on principle, if the allowances <Col N="487" /> of Ministers are grossed up and regarded as emoluments then, according to practice, any expenses a Minister may incur in the discharge of his duties would be legitimate charges upon the revenue.  The Minister suggested that in the position that would arise if the allowances were grossed up a Minister would be in a position to charge for expenses.  Following on that, the Minister implied&mdash;I do not think he stated specifically&mdash;that it would, in the long run, involve more expense to the State because now, of course, any expenses of the office are included in the allowances.</P>
      <P>Then he went on to make a statement which rather astounded me.  He said that if that situation of charging for expenses should arise it is quite possible that a Minister's expenses would be in excess of the present allowance as a Deputy.  I must say that that statement completely puzzles me.  I began to rack my brains as to what the legitimate expenses could possibly be.  There might be occasional telephone calls from a Minister's home on official business, which would be a charge.  All transport is provided for. I think, therefore, we have a right to be told in general terms what further expenses there could possibly be There might also be telephone charges on public business by a Minister while on holidays, but surely they would amount to a very small sum&mdash;I imagine £50 in the year would amply cover such expenditure.  I cannot see how a Minister could possibly incur a charge for expenses amounting to £480.  I feel that it is the principle in this recommendation that should be considered and that the present situation gives a doubly false impression of the emoluments of our Ministers.</P>

      <P>The first point which strikes me about this recommendation is that it raises a question, as Senator Sir John Keane says, of principle.  I consider that the recommendation is defective in its present form and that, if passed as it stands at present, it would not accomplish the purposes Senator Sweetman has in mind.  It would have the effect not only of preventing Ministers, the Ceann Comhairle <Col N="488" /> of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad from getting certain allowances tax free but it would also have the same effect on the salaries of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil and of the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I consider that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad have expenses identical with those of other Deputies and Senators, whatever they may be.  The recommendation in its present form is, to my mind, defective and would not accomplish its purposes.</P>
      <P>I think there can be no doubt whatever that the salaries originally fixed for Ministers were not liberal I do not, however, know on what percentage basis they were fixed It must be remembered that in 1925, when the Bill of which the Minister speaks was passed, making the allowances of Deputies as well as those of Ministers free of income-tax, Ministers were not supplied with transport.  It must be remembered, also, that Ministers and the two Houses had not then the experience they have now.  It seems to me that it would be fairer, clearer and more honest if the Ministerial salary were fixed at a proper figure and subject to income-tax with, perhaps, an allowance for expenses.  I do not think, from what experience I have and from what experience I have been able to gain either personally or by contacts with other people, that a Minister's expenses can be the same as those of a Deputy.  They certainly cannot amount to £12 a week&mdash;£624 a year.  For example a Deputy gets a letter from a constituent.  He writes to a Government Department, post free, and gets a reply.  If, as is the practice, he sends that reply to the constituent who wrote to him he has to stamp the letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may seem a small point, but Deputies have often spoken to me about free postage.  A Minister has not got to stamp a letter and, therefore, he is free from the expense of postage which would be incurred on public business or to constituents. Deputies are supplied with transport from their residences to town and to their constituencies but they are not supplied with transport in their constituencies. <Col N="489" /> Take, for example, a constituency such as Tipperary which is rather a large county and which is at present all one constituency.  A Minister is supplied with free transport inside that constituency but a Deputy is not.  Therefore, I think that the expenses of a Minister are not the same as those of a Deputy.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it would be undesirable to have wranglings between civil servants in the Revenue Department and Ministers as to what are suitable expenses.  It seems to me, considering that he is supplied with free transport, with an office, with typing staff, and so forth, with which Deputies are not supplied, that there is no case whatever for saying a Minister's expenses are the same as those of a Deputy.  It is not for the purpose of decreasing Ministerial salaries that I speak in favour of this recommendation but for the purpose of having an examination in order to have Ministers' salaries fixed at a proper figure which would be ascertained and about which there would be no concealment.  I consider that it would be much better if that were the case.  The proposal now is that Ministers should have £1,501 a year, subject to tax, plus £624, not subject to tax, plus the use of cars which must be valued for at least £1,000.  I think it would be much better if a salary, subject to tax, with an allowance of £200 or £300 for expenses were fixed.  That position would be much clearer and much simpler for all concerned.  I realise that Ministers have a difficult job.  A Minister who does his work has three separate jobs, each of which is, in itself, a big job.  He has his Parliamentary work, his administrative work and also the work of keeping himself going in his own constituency&mdash;quite proper, quite legitimate and quite difficult work but work for which a Minister has facilities which a Deputy has not.  For that reason I think this recommendation calls attention to a situation which needs to be looked into.  It is meant to indicate that Ministers should have an inclusive salary clearly set forth, which would be a better system than the present system under which it is <Col N="490" /> difficult to ascertain what the expenses of a Minister actually are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had several debates on this particular aspect of this series of Bills, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  In approaching the subject as to what increases I should propose to the Government and what increases the Government should propose to the Dáil, I took it that, by and large, a certain differentiation had been made in allowances and salaries for all types of public officials and members of the Oireachtas.  I proposed that we should take it for granted that the 1938 level was fair and reasonable.  It passed both the Dáil and the Seanad then and, if anybody wished to raise it, it could have been a subject of discussion during the elections that were held since.  I take it, therefore, that there was general agreement, that that level was fair and equitable, having regard to all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>In 1937, the Shanley Committee went into the question of Ministers' salaries, Deputies' allowances and allowances for the Leaders of the two principal Opposition Parties in the Dáil, and made certain recommendations. One of them was that Ministers' salaries should be £2,250 and that both Senators and Deputies should continue to draw the same allowance of £360.  Evidence was given by various types of people, including Ministers and civil servants, and every aspect of a Minister's salary, emoluments, perquisites and services was discussed.  It was decided by the Shanley Committee to recommend for Ministers a level of £2,250, all of which would be subject to income-tax, and that the system in operation in regard to Ministers' cars from 1927 should continue, that is, that instead of a Minister getting an over-all sum for travelling, he should continue to draw his transport from an official pool and be accompanied by an armed driver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1938, however, the Government turned down the idea of Ministers' salaries being increased from £1,700 to £2,250 and they recommended to the <Col N="491" /> Dáil and Seanad that they should continue to draw the £1,700 and that the Deputy's part of the allowance&mdash;or the Senator's part, if a Senator should be a Minister&mdash;should continue to be free from income-tax.  That was accepted by the Dáil.  It was accepted by the Seanad, with one dissentient.  We will have to take it for granted that it has been accepted by the people, as otherwise if some people wished to raise it as a major issue, they could have got a majority Party in favour of some other scale, if the majority of the people approved.</P>
    <P>Let us go back to this suggestion of making portion of a Minister's salary, that portion represented by the Dáil or Seanad allowance, subject to income-tax. Let us not forget that that system was tried before, between 1923 and 1925.  The 1925 Act was introduced to the Oireachtas by the then Government because it was found that the evils which had been created outweighed the advantages.  In 1925, not only was the old system abolished for the future&mdash;the payment of income-tax on the Deputy's or Senator's allowance contained in a Minister's salary&mdash; but retrospectively it was made law that whatever deductions had been made would be repaid.  It was not for nothing that was done and I take it that it was not for nothing that the Seanad approved of it without a single dissentient.</P>
    <P>The suggestion now is that we should go back to the system in operation prior to 1925.  Senator Hayes says it would be clearer, fairer and more honest if we made the portion of the Minister's salary represented by his Dáil allowance subject to income-tax.  I do not think anything could be more clear or more known to the country, since it has been the subject of a thousand and one speeches and a thousand and one editorials in various papers.  It is well known to the country that that portion of a Minister's salary is income-tax free.  Anyone in the country knows, if he becomes a T.D. and a Minister, what his salary will be, the portion of it which will be income-tax free and what other emoluments and facilities he will be entitled to as a Minister.  No one <Col N="492" /> has tried to conceal any of this at any time.  These things have been the subject of speeches and editorials and of public reports by committees of inquiry. This particular document I have in my hand, the report of the inquiry into Ministerial and other salaries&mdash;generally known as the the Shanley Committee Report&mdash;was published in 1937 and has been adverted to publicly a million times since.  Therefore, there is nothing secret about this business, and we are enough grown up politically to discuss it without diffidence or shyness.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted generally that the scales in existence up to 1938 and to date were fair and equitable in relation to 1938 conditions.  Owing to the recent increases in salaries all round, in the State service and outside it, something had to be done to enable the representatives of the people to give the same standard of service to their constituents and to the public generally as the 1938 level of salaries and allowances enabled them to give. It has not been proposed for Senators, for Deputies, for Ministers, for the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach, or for any other officer of the Oireachtas, that they should be fully compensated for the increased cost of living or the decreased value of money since 1938.  The additions proposed correspond to the supplements to the salaries that have been granted to other public servants and do not represent in full the increase in the expenses of members of the Oireachtas, the Oireachtas staff or members of the Government.  We could re-introduce the system in regard to Ministers that the Deputy's allowance part of their salaries should be subject to income-tax. If we did that it would be open to Ministers to start a practice which has not been in operation since 1925 of claiming from the Revenue Commissioners freedom from income-tax on that portion of their total salaries that could be held by them to be wholly and inevitably portion of the expenses connected with their office either as Minister or as Dáil representative or as member of the Seanad.  I suggest that if that were started it might be found, in certain cases at any rate, that the amount claimed for exemption <Col N="493" /> would be more than the level of the allowance given to Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>There are a thousand and one expenses that a Minister has that could quite properly be claimed&mdash;I do not know whether the Revenue Commissioners would agree with it all or not&mdash;as expenses wholly, necessarily and inevitably connected with his membership either of the Dáil or of the Government.  I do not want to get into the position of having Ministers contest that with the Revenue Commissioners. Neither do I want Ministers, whose whole attention should be devoted to matters of public policy, concerned with the making and keeping of notes of expenses for the purpose of making a claim to the Revenue Commissioners for freedom from income-tax on portion of their salary.  I think that the Minister's whole energy and concern should be with the public pounds rather than with the personal pence of claims to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that this is nothing new and I want to emphasise that the other system proposed, or which Senator Sweetman has in mind, was tried by another Government and that after due consideration, after trying it out for a few years, after having experience of the difficulties between Ministers and the Revenue Commissioners in connection with expense sheets, they decided to recommend to the Oireachtas that the Ministers should be given the Dáil allowance free of income-tax and that that should be generally accepted as the limit of the claims of a Minister for expenses in connection with his office.</P>
    <P>I think the Oireachtas would be very unwise to adopt the system which is now suggested of saying to Ministers, &ldquo;We will not give you a certain stated allowance for expenses but we will increase your salaries by a further amount in compensation.&rdquo;  I say that from the point of view of the public interest it would be much better for the Oireachtas to say to Ministers, &ldquo;Your salaries will stay as they are but you will get the Dáil allowance free of income-tax.&rdquo;  I think a Minister's energy should be devoted to his public <Col N="494" /> work rather than to keeping personal accounts for the purpose of making a claim to the Revenue Commissioners at the end of the income-tax period.  Every business man who knows what is involved in keeping accounts of that kind will appreciate that if his time and energy could be spent on his business, it would be more profitable for him to give a certain sum to the Revenue Commissioners than to go to all the trouble of keeping these accounts.</P>
    <P>In the modern world a Minister's whole time, whether he is in the Dáil or in the Seanad or in his office, by and large goes either in carrying out public functions or in thinking about public problems.  I do not think that any professional man would do the work that a Minister does, simply looking to the reward that a Minister gets in the way of salary.  I do not think that the salary attached to the post would attract the service from an ordinary individual that Ministers give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an improvement in the Minister's outlook now anyway. Experience has taught him that.  He did not always think that.  I agree with him entirely on that point now. We are in agreement now, at last.</P>

I had not intended to speak on this Bill, but in view of the Minister's remarks, I think I had better state my candid personal views on it.  I think that nearly all the changes that took place, whether in 1925 or now, or at any other time, have been largely due to the fact that at no time since the State was set up have our Ministers of State been properly paid.  A good many of the changes have taken place because Ministers have discovered&mdash;I include political reasons and I include the thinking which they are paid to do&mdash;that neither their opponents nor themselves have ever been paid on a proper basis. Personally, I think a Minister should be paid £4,500 a year, and that he should deal with his income-tax in exactly the same way as the businessman does. He should, of course, get any allowance that he would be entitled to under the law, but after that he should pay income-tax or surtax.  The salary, however, should be on a basis which would show the standard we ought to expect from our Ministers.  They should be free from any possibility of worry, and the salary should be such as would enable them to keep up what would be a high standard for this country.</P>
      <P>I have always felt myself that it was rather ridiculous to pay Ministers less than judges.  That is a purely personal point of view.  I am not quite satisfied with the amendment as it stands, and I hope it will not be pressed.  There is a good deal in what the Minister has said.  I disagree with him if he imagines that the ordinary businessman goes to the trouble of keeping personal accounts in the hope that the Revenue Commissioners will make up the cost to him in the way of allowances off his personal income.  I think it would be a good thing if all Parties agreed to pay Ministers a substantial salary.  If the rate of income-tax was low the Minister would get the benefit of that, and if he were liable to surtax he should pay it the same as everybody else, and I think it would be a good thing that the people of the country should know that he was doing that. I hope that some day we shall have the courage to deal with the matter in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> I supported the previous amendment on this Bill because I think the position of Deputies and Senators is totally different from that of a Minister.  When you ask a man to become a Minister of State you stipulate that he cannot engage in any other business activities. After spending a number of years in office all that he is entitled to in the end is a small pension.  I think that during his term as Minister he should be adequately paid.  I believe that you will get the best service by doing that. I think we should try and forget old political arguments, whether they were used at any time either by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, and agree that Ministers ought to be properly paid.  That is my personal point of view, and I have just intervened lest my attitude on this question might be misunderstood.</P>

      <P>In view of the publicity given twice to the Minister's remarks and his references to the payment of income-tax on a Minister's allowances, it is desirable that our intentions should be made clear. What was suggested was that the allowances should be grossed up, and that the tax should then be paid on the gross sum.  I am sure the Minister did not intend to mislead.  I feel it necessary to make this point clear because the public might feel that we were endeavouring to reduce Minister's allowances. That is not so.  If this recommendation were accepted the only thing additional that a Minister would have to pay would be a small sum possibly in surtax.</P>

      <P>The point that Senator Sir John Keane has just dealt with was made clear by me.  When I proposed this amendment I knew that it would have to be followed by a subsequent amendment in the other Bill.  I could not, of course, move an amendment that would increase a charge on the Exchequer.  When the Minister was speaking a few moments ago I felt that he had travelled quite a long way along the road that I had referred to earlier&mdash;that is since some 15 years ago.  In his last sentence I felt that matters were perhaps getting under his skin so much that he wanted to be a bit sharp.  The Minister must <Col N="499" /> know that I was aware that this was in operation under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  I knew that before I put down the amendment, and if I did not know it Senator Hayes told me when I showed him the amendment. Therefore, there was no stupidity about the matter as the Minister seemed to think.</P>
      <P>I think that we have discussed this in a way that the Minister would not have discussed it if he were in opposition. We discussed it in a way that the Minister did not like, and he felt that he had to get a crack at some Party.  However, as Senator Hayes said, we are quite used to that sort of thing.  Senator Hayes has, without question, put his finger on a definite flaw in the amendment.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Leas-Chathaoirleach have the expenses of Deputies.  There is no question whatever about that.  I am not quite clear whether the same applies to the Cathaoirleach and perhaps this is not the right place to discuss that.  On account of that flaw, and for no other reason, I am prepared, with the leave of the House, to withdraw the recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in sub-section (1) line 13, the words &ldquo;and in Section 4&rdquo; be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> This proposal is limited to this extent, that if the recommendation is accepted the proposal in Section 2 to increase the salary of the Attorney-General by 20 per cent. will have no effect.  It will be observed that throughout this Bill there is a clear desire to conceal what is being done.  As I mentioned on the Second Stage, instead of setting out fully what is proposed, in other words instead of substituting a new section for the section in the Principal Act which is being amended, we find included in Section 2 (1) merely a reference to the sum of £2,500 in the Principal Act and a proposal that it be increased by 20 per cent. or one-fifth.</P>
    <P>The position of the Attorney-General is different from that of Ministers.  It was so regarded by the Shanley Commission. As a matter of fact, the proposal of that commission was that the salary of the Attorney-General should be fixed at precisely the same figure as that of a Minister.  That has not been done.  The occupant of the office has been frequently changed in the meantime, but no action was taken to bring the salary attaching to the office into conformity with that of a Minister. The Attorney-General has the same salary as the Taoiseach and this Bill gives the same increase in that salary as is given to the Taoiseach.  I do not understand the grounds for this figure. Generally, the Attorney-General is a young man&mdash;that has been almost always the case&mdash;and he has prospects. It is almost inevitable that the Attorney-General will ascend to the Bench, either in the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I am not referring to any particular individual.  I do not know the present Attorney-General.  I do not know whether he is young or old; I have not even inquired because I am not concerned. I am concerned only with the question whether the Attorney-General should be distinguished from Ministers and have a salary similar to that of the Taoiseach.  I think it is fair to say that, in the main, it has been the practice in this country not to select the Attorney-General from the senior members or the older members of the Bar, but from the younger members.  It is <Col N="501" /> the practice, I think, that if a suitable vacancy arises on the Bench, the Attorney-General, by custom and tradition, is entitled to claim it.  In any event, I think every Attorney-General we have had, with the exception of two, became judges.  A case was made for special consideration for the Ministers on the ground that on entering on their office they broke with their business, profession or calling and found it difficult to re-establish themselves on leaving office.  That does not apply to the Attorney-General.  As I have said, he has been preferred for High Court office and, in addition to that, he is practising his profession of the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what was said on the subject by the Shanley Commission.  I am all the more free to quote this because I did not subscribe to it.  I recommended a lower salary for the Attorney-General than was recommended by the majority of the commission.  Let us bear in mind that the commission included two lawyers&mdash; Mr. Cecil Lavery, one of the senior counsel, and Mr. Arthur Cox, a solicitor who is intimately associated with the promotion of companies, with the Incorporated Law Society, and with the profession generally.  I should like to refer to paragraph 48 of the Shanley Commission Report in reference to the Attorney-General:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He is presumably the best advocate in court that the Government has at its disposal, and, moreover, we have been told that appearances in court by the Attorney-General not only help him to keep in contact with his profession but are welcomed by the judges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point there is that the Commission are building up towards the proposition that the Attorney-General should appear in court without additional fees. In recommending a salary of £2,250 a year for the Attorney-General, the Commission had in view that he would appear in court in important State cases without additional fees, that the £2,250 would be his total remuneration. They then proceed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If an Attorney-General is subsequently promoted to the Bench, the fact that he has not made a complete break with his court practice is of <Col N="502" /> considerable value to him in his new sphere.  It may be argued with some force, however, that the interests of the State would not be served by permitting the Attorney-General to receive fees in respect of Government work.  There might be a temptation for the holder of the post to appear as often as possible in court with a view to augumenting his income...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then they go on to say in the next paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the assumption that the Attorney-General will not engage in private practice, and that he will, when the occasion so demands, appear for the State in important cases without additional remuneration, we recommend that his salary be at the rate of £2,250 a year, fully subject to taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the one instance in which the commission recommended a salary for an existing office lower than the then prevailing salary.  The commission recommended an increase in salary of £550 per year for Ministers. They recommended an increase for the Taoiseach and for Parliamentary Secretaries. The one instance in which they not only recommended no increase but in which they recommended a lower rate of remuneration was that of the Attorney-General.  Still the Attorney-General continues to receive, not the salary of a Minister, but the same salary as the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>It is proposed now to continue that practice by giving him a 20 per cent. increase to bring his salary up to £3,000 a year, notwithstanding the fact that he does not practice in the courts and notwithstanding the fact that our expenses on law charges, according to the Appropriation Bill, which will come before us later were £96,000 odd in the last financial year.  In other words, we are spending as much on law charges as would give an increase of 5/- per week to every blind person in the Twenty-Six Counties.  With these facts before us, I do not see any ground on which the Minister can justify the proposal that the remuneration of the Attorney-General should be increased <Col N="503" /> by £500 a year and his total income brought up to the same level as that of the Taoiseach.  I go further and suggest, although it is perhaps not germane to the amendment, that, when the present office holder vacates office, the question of the total all-over salary should be reviewed, having regard to the recommendation of the committee. I consider the present rate entirely excessive.</P>
    <P>I do not desire to go into the affairs of any section of the community, but I cannot omit saying this, that one of the most distinguished judges we have had&mdash;he is still on the Bench&mdash;told me several years ago that every person appointed to the position of Attorney-General and every person appointed a judge in our courts for the past 25 years improved his position enormously because of that appointment.  It is not a matter of our asking somebody with £5,000 a year to serve the State for £2,500.  It is a matter of giving people who have a reasonable income a rate of income far in excess of what they have been earning outside and I urge the House strongly to agree to this recommendation.</P>

      <P>This shows a very small attitude on the part of Senator Duffy. If the Senator reviews the whole situation, he will recollect that in this country at one time there was an Attorney-General and a Solicitor-General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I will come to that.  The present Attorney-General does the work of the former Attorney-General and Solicitor-General.  He does the work of the combined offices. Senator Duffy says they both practised in the courts.  They did, in the old days, and it is very well known that, apart from the salary the Attorney-General had, every time he appeared in court he got one hundred guineas marked on his brief.  It is well known that one man, who afterwards became a High Court judge, accumulated great wealth&mdash;not while on the Bench, but while he held the office of Attorney-General.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not what he made from good investments, but what he accumulated as Attorney-General.  He took briefs and went to the different assizes all over the country, and, in every case in which a prosecution was brought, he had his big fee marked on his brief.  He was not a great genius and the cases could have been much better handled by local barristers than they were by him and for a very small fraction of the fee he received.</P>
      <P>This office must be made such that the best man at the Bar can be got to fill it.  What has the Attorney-General to do?  He has to read the depositions in every prosecution brought in every Circuit Court in Ireland, as well as those in cases before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Even in cases where informations have been refused, he sometimes has to read the depositions and to consider whether, notwithstanding the refusal of informations, a prosecution should be brought.  He has to be at the beck and call of the Government, and has to attend every Cabinet meeting to which he is summoned to advise the Government on every important matter of a legal nature.  The responsibility is tremendous, and, for a man doing all that, I say that a salary of £3,000 a year is not at all sufficient, in view of the mental qualities required to carry out the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy says he is sure to be promoted to the Bench.  I understand that that is not now a condition of the employment of an Attorney-General and that the Attorney-General is given to understand&mdash;I may be wrong in this &mdash;that the Government would be under no obligation whatever to promote him to the first or any vacancy which may arise on the Bench.  Senator Duffy seems to think that it is a good thing for a man to have been Attorney-General, if he goes back to the Bar.  I know of one case in my lifetime of a man who was Attorney-General&mdash;he was a very famous barrister who practised in every court in the land&mdash;<i>nisi prius,</i> chancery and every other&mdash; and who, when he lost his appointment as Attorney-General and returned to the Bar, found that his practice had <Col N="505" /> completely disappeared and that he was left to live on the money he had previously made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I took it for granted, in making my proposals to the Government with regard to the salary of the Attorney-General, that the Oireachtas had approved a certain level of salary for the Attorney-General in relation to that of Ministers and other public servants. It is true that the Shanley Committee recommended that the Attorney-General should receive the same salary as a Minister, but our Government, after considering the matter, felt compelled to come to the same conclusion as other Governments before them, that the Attorney-General should get the same salary as the Taoiseach or former President of the Executive Council.  It is true to say that the Attorney-General has very heavy responsibilities. Even Senator Duffy's allusion to the fact that we spend £93,000 a year on law charges will give some idea of the volume of business which the Attorney-General has to handle, especially since the beginning of the war, with an increase of prosecutions of all kinds, with new offences being created by law, in which the Seanad concurred occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to protect the public in the matter of supplies, a lot of new offences came into being and the Attorney-General has to handle all these cases.  Again, there is the matter of legislation.  The large number of Orders made by the Government, which the Seanad has sometimes complained about, all have to be approved by the Attorney-General and passed by the Government on his approval of them as meaning what the Government intend to carry out.</P>
      <P>From every point of view it is important that the Government of the day should get the best possible advice from its legal Department.  In order to secure that, the salary fixed for the Attorney-General should be such as would command the services of the best available man at the Bar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not always a fact that the <Col N="506" /> Attorney-General becomes a High Court judge.  We all know of one gentleman who was Attorney-General and was not appointed a judge.  It took some years before he got back the volume of practice which he surrendered when he became Attorney-General.</P>
    <P>I know very little about the Bar, but I understand that a salary of £3,000 a year is not over-attractive to a senior counsel with a large practice.  I think that if we decided in 1938 that the Attorney-General should get £2,500 a year, it is not an inordinate compensation for the decrease in the value of money to offer a man in that position an additional 20 per cent.  Senators will have noticed that as salaries go up, the percentage increase granted under these various measures goes down.  In the case of a member of the Dáil or the Seanad the percentage increase is 30 per cent. and in the case of Ministers 25 per cent., whereas the percentage increase proposed for the Taoiseach and the Attorney-General is 20 per cent.  That corresponds to what happened in the case of the judges, and I do not think there were any Senators here who objected to the increase for the judges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Senator Duffy did not agree.  That, at any rate, was the nature of the criticism in the Dáil and my recollection of the criticism in the Seanad was that, instead of trying to cut down the increases we proposed for the judges, an effort was made to increase them. The other day we had a Bill here proposing an increase for the Comptroller and Auditor-General and there was not a mumbling word about my proposal <Col N="507" /> to give him 25 per cent.  Senator Duffy did not even growl; he did not stand up to object to our giving the Comptroller and Auditor-General 25 per cent.  All we are proposing for the Attorney-General is 20 per cent. and I do not think that is inordinate.  I think there was general agreement in 1938 that the Attorney-General should get the same as the Taoiseach.  I am making a similar proposal in this Bill and I think the Seanad should accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis the Attorney-General will get £3,000, plus unlimited transport.  He will get that transport entirely at his own discretion, according to the Minister's statement.  A High Court judge gets £3,000 under the new system, out of which he pays income-tax and provides transport for himself.  The Attorney-General will get £3,000 and will be provided with transport, which is a very valuable thing&mdash;its value would be in the region of £1,000.  The Taoiseach gets an allowance for a car and he has to pay for the petrol used in the car after that.  The High Court judge is in the same position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Attorney-General is better off.  I did not know that he is given a car.  It would appear, then, that he has a higher salary than a High Court judge and a higher salary than the Taoiseach.  He has a higher rate of remuneration, which does not seem to be in accordance with reason.  The Minister appears to be proud of Cumann na nGaedheal precedents&mdash;I never heard Cumann na nGaedheal praised so much; they never made such a case for themselves as the Minister now makes for them.  He says that the Government are doing what their predecessors did in giving the <Col N="508" /> Attorney-General the same salary as the Taoiseach, or the President of the Executive Council, but in the Cumann na nGaedheal days the Attorney-General never had the use of a car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He had not.  The Attorney-General at present is not guarded.  He has a car for transport purposes, as the Ministers have.  That has nothing to do with guarding, except in a couple of cases which I do not want now to particularise.  I submit that the Attorney-General, with a car, is better paid than a High Court judge.  The Minister says he is merely following a precedent, which apparently he misunderstands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a blunder in his speech and I would like to correct him, in case somebody else might treat him more harshly than I will treat him.  One of the Minister's suggestions was that the Attorney-General is overwhelmed with work as a result of the Emergency Powers Orders arising out of the shortage of supplies and so forth.  The Minister suggested that the Attorney-General had to give consideration to each of these.  I do not mean to suggest that the Minister tried to convey to the House that the Attorney-General read each of them, but he endeavoured to convey to the House that the Attorney-General's Department was responsible for the approval of these Orders.  Of course, that is not a fact.  The fact is that these Orders are dealt with either in the Department concerned or by the Parliamentary Draftsman and in no circumstances does the Attorney-General come into it until after the Orders are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to keep away from the issue of what the Attorney-General does, because if that issue is raised we may start a debate which may not end in a hurry.  There will be criticism probably of how some of the work is done and criticism of appointments.  I want to avoid that. I mentioned at the beginning that I do not know the Attorney-General and I repeat that.  I have not looked up whether he has been 25 years or five years at the Bar; I do not know, because that is not the issue I am raising.  I do not know that the House is very satisfied with the case made by the Minister and by Senator O'Dea. Senator O'Dea told us that under the British régime there was an Attorney-General and a Solicitor-General, both of whom made fortunes.  That is probably true, but they were then the Government of Ireland.  The British Government did not have Ministers in Dublin.  They did not have an Irish Government, except that which was carried on in the Custom House and the Castle by a few gentlemen who actually had the status of civil servants.  The Attorney-General and Solicitor-General were in fact part of that Government machine and, in the absence of the Lord-Lieutenant, they were sworn in as a Council to govern Ireland.  A comparison of the relative cost would not be a contrast between the salary paid to the Attorney-General under the British régime and the salary paid to the present Attorney-General, but a contrast between the total salaries of Ministers of the Government to-day and the salaries paid to the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General under the British régime.  That is not the case we are considering here and it has nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point that there was an independent Committee appointed by the Government in 1937, ten years ago, <Col N="510" /> to report to the Government as to what should be the salary and functions of the Attorney-General.  It was the view of the Committee that the Attorney-General should have the same salary as a Minister, provided&mdash;and I want to stress this&mdash;he appeared in. court as prosecutor in important cases. I have no doubt that the Committee would have considered that he should have a lower salary than a Minister if he were not to appear in court.  Again, as to his duties, I do not want to go into these matters.  I know nothing about what he does, but I do know that we had at least one Attorney-General who found time to leave his office and to go into court to prosecute on behalf of the State, yet the same salary is paid to the Attorney-General who has not gone into court.</P>
    <P>The figures which we have got from the Minister in reply to Senator Hayes are illuminating.  Transport, in my judgment, now costs £1,000 for this officer.  I do know that evidence was officially submitted to the Shanley Commission in 1937 by the Department of Finance to the effect that the cost of transport per head of those for whom it was provided was £636 per annum. That was the evidence given to the Shanley Commission, of which I was a member.  I assume that it is not less than £1,000 now, having regard to the increased cost of cars, petrol, drivers and everything else, and the fact that the use of transport has been extended even in individual cases.  So actually when you pay the Attorney-General £3,000 in cash and provide transport for him, you are paying him what is tantamount to a salary of £4,000 a year as against £3,300 for the Taoiseach and £3,000 for a High Court judge.  If we are going to be generous, let us be generous knowingly.  Let us be fully aware of what we are doing.  If Senators are satisfied that they are entitled, in the circumstances I have mentioned, to provide an increase of £500 a year on the present salary of the Attorney-General, I hope that will be done with a full knowledge of the facts, because if I come along next week and ask the House to increase the allowance for old age pensioners by 2/6 per week, I shall no doubt meet with great opposition from various parts of the <Col N="511" /> House, particularly from the Government Benches.  I am now suggesting that we should hear a better case than the case made by the Minister or Senator O'Dea before we agree to increase by £500 per annum the salary of an officer who has already a salary of £2,500 plus £1,000 for transport.</P>

      <P>I had an open mind about the amendment but I confess that I am on Senator Duffy's side after hearing the arguments.  At the same time I appreciate the position in which the Minister finds himself.  Senator Duffy has kept the discussion on a high plane but there are aspects of the amendment to which one cannot close one's mind in considering the proposal of the Minister.  The Minister makes the case that what he is contemplating is fixing such a salary as will make it possible to get the services of the Leader of the Irish Bar.  One can sympathise with that line of policy but one has immediately to ask the Minister, does he achieve that purpose by fixing the salary at the figure at which it stands?  Has he or has his Government since they came into office ever succeeded in attracting the Leader of the Irish Bar to this post?  I do not think so.  I do not know whether that has been the predominant consideration at all.  I think it will be generally accepted that the political affiliations of the particular individual concerned is the primary consideration.  The facts being as they are, while one would like to fix a salary adequate to the post, it is very difficult to separate the question of salary from a consideration of the individual who fills the post. Again it is difficult to separate the question of salary from the kind of service you get in the office.  Senator Duffy has, perhaps advisedly, kept away from any discourse on the type of service, but when the Minister indicated that the man who occupies that office has responsibilities in regard to supervision of services, where there is £96,000 involved, one has to ask what sort of service is given in that post which involves an expenditure of £96,000.  A great many people think that, if the State got better service from the occupant of that post, there <Col N="512" /> would be no necessity to expend £96,000.  A great deal of money is spent by the State on law charges which ought not to be spent.  It is very difficult for Senators, in attempting to pass judgment on a recommendation such as this, to separate the occupant of a post and the service given in the position from the salary.  It is quite clear that the amount which is drawn by the Attorney-General is not commensurate with the service which the State gets and is beyond what ought to be necessary to expend when one considers the much greater responsibilities which have to be shouldered by the Head of the State.  I am completely with Senator Duffy in his recommendation.</P>

      <P>One thing has emerged from this discussion which, I think, is most extraordinary.  That is that, apparently, in order to get a first-class legal man, you have to pay a very high salary while, in order to get a man who is fit to govern the country&mdash; it is more or less clear that, to all intents and purposes, the occupant of the office in question does govern the country&mdash;you have to pay no more.  In fact, you pay less.  That goes to show that, on the whole, public service to the nation is not well paid.  A man who fills a post in which he serves the nation is, on the whole, paid less than if he were merely serving himself.  It is very easy to say that the Government &mdash;this applies to the last Government, too&mdash;are making large fortunes and that Teachtaí and Senators are handing out large sums to themselves.  But it is clear that, if they are first-class men, they are getting less than they would get if they were engaged in some form of private business, profession or trade and were consulting their own interests.  In this case, it is clear that the Attorney-General is getting a salary which might not even secure us the absolute leaders of the Bar.  At the same time, his salary is higher than that which the Taoiseach receives, when the allowance is considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that it is very foolish to adopt a cheese-paring attitude in the matter of public salary or remuneration. I think that we should attempt to get the very best people.  I know <Col N="513" /> that ideally speaking, no man should want money for serving the nation but, in every country where people are not adequately paid for national service, one of two things occurs&mdash;either you do not get the most able men or you get people who make money in other ways&mdash;corrupt ways&mdash;which I need not mention and in that way lower the whole standard of national life.  I think that it is deplorable that there should be any doubt as to whether people who fill responsible positions should be adequately paid or not.  Of course, it is very hard to say what anybody's service is worth, but I think that a man in the public service should get, at least, what he would receive if he were out for himself.  Therefore, I do not agree with this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this to be said regarding the Attorney-General: Senator Baxter says that the Attorney-General should be the Leader of the Bar.  It is desirable that the Attorney-General should be a first-class lawyer, but it must be remembered that the Government of the day has to get the services of a lawyer who agrees with them as Attorney-General.  If there are no first-class lawyers who agree with the Government, then the Government cannot get a first-class lawyer as Attorney-General.  As regards the Attorney-General's duties, with the growing complexity of government&mdash; even since 1932&mdash;the Attorney-General's duties have, undoubtedly, increased and the quasi-judicial nature of the Attorney-General's office has become more marked.  His position as an officer of the State, rather than as a prosecutor or pleader, has become more prominent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with Senator the Earl of Longford with regard to the remuneration of public service, I do not see any reason why the Attorney-General, who has not to leave Dublin in the course of his duties, should be provided at the public expense with transport.  That makes his salary considerably higher than that of a High Court judge.  The salary originally fixed&mdash;£2,500&mdash;was the same as that of a High Court judge.  I am not discussing this question on personalities.  The <Col N="514" /> Minister is quite wrong in saying that the Attorney-General in 1932 was supplied with a car for transport.  He, certainly, was not.  The Attorney-General at the moment is paid more than a High Court judge and, as has been pointed out, more than the Taoiseach.  That is a foolish position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the debate is shifting from the issue at stake.  The issue at stake was fully examined by the Shanley Commission.  The commission included one of the outstanding Leaders of the Irish Bar, Mr. Cecil Lavery.  He signed his name to the report which set out that the salary of the Attorney-General should not exceed £2,250 and that that sum should be paid on condition that the Attorney-General appear in court as State prosecutor in important cases.  The evidence the commission had was that transport was provided only for Ministers and two Parliamentary Secretaries.  There was no evidence in 1937 that transport was provided for the Attorney-General.</P>

      <P>I remember distinctly the number of cars and drivers, but I did not think that the Attorney-General was included.  In any event, the provision of transport makes a tremendous difference in the income of the Attorney-General.  I feel that if a Leader of the Irish Bar was prepared, in 1937, to sign a report that a salary of £2,250 was adequate for the Attorney-General, we should be guided largely by that report.  Further, there is this point.  While it is true that the Attorney-General has no firm guarantee that he will be elevated to the Bench it has, in fact, been the practice that the Attorney-General becomes a judge. That practice was not followed in one case because the Government which he served went out of office.  It was not followed in one other case because the person concerned, I believe, was over age or at least had reached a point in years at which it would have been inadvisable to appoint him to the Bench. <Col N="515" /> In every other case the person who served as Attorney-General was appointed to the Bench.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that.  The point I am trying to make is that appointment to the Bench is a reward for the Attorney-General&mdash;that it is promotion for the Attorney-General. How can it be promotion for the Attorney-General to take him out of an office in which he has an income of £4,000 per annum and to put him into one with £3,000 per annum?  It is true, of course, that the real reward is that after ten or 15 years he can retire on pension.  He cannot retire on pension as Attorney-General&mdash;if he left office he would only get a gratuity.  I suggest to the Minister that the matter needs to be seriously reconsidered.  I do not suggest that the actual salary paid to an existing officer should be reconsidered while he is in office, but that it should be reconsidered on the termination of his office.  That course is frequently followed in the case of civil servants.  If one examines the Book of Estimates one will frequently find that a reference is made to some particular salary as being personal to the present holder.  That means that the salary will be scaled up or scaled down when the present holder ceases to hold office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in speaking, did us an injustice&mdash;whether he meant it or not&mdash; when he said that the Bill providing for an increase to the Comptroller and Auditor-General passed through without opposition.  I cannot speak for the members who were here on that occasion because, unfortunately, I was absent on business elsewhere, nor for <Col N="516" /> the grounds on which the House agreed to that increase, but I do think that at least some of us were sufficiently vocal to indicate when we were here that we did not agree with the proposals of the Minister for Justice regarding the salaries of the judges of the High Court.  My view was that the salaries proposed for district justices were insufficient; that the salaries proposed for Circuit Court judges were probably generous and that there should be no increase for High Court judges.  That was the view I expressed.  I hope that if the Minister is referring to the matter again he will not blame us for having passed over this proposal too easily.</P>

      <P>I hate to intervene in this debate, because I think most Senators feel tired of it already. Senator Duffy, in opening his last few remarks, expressed the view that the ground had shifted from the issue at stake.  To my mind what has actually happened is that the debate has gone completely out of order.  The issue in question is a very simple one and I think we ought to keep our minds fixed on it.  The sub-section in question aims at adjusting the salary of the Attorney-General.  That salary was originally fixed at £2,500.  I think it will be agreed that when the Attorney-General took office something in the nature of a contract was entered into to the effect that he would be remunerated at the rate of £2,500 per annum.  We have heard here, and I think we all agree, that the duties of that office are very heavy and that these duties are increasing.  Is it unreasonable that that person, having entered into a contract whereby he would be remunerated at the rate of £2,500 per annum, in view of the fact that the value of money has changed to the extent that it has, should receive <Col N="517" /> some compensation for the change in the value of money by way of an adjustment in his salary?  I think everybody who has spoken on this matter has referred to an increase in the remuneration of the Attorney-General. There is, in fact, no increase. The amount that is being provided for the Attorney-General under this Bill does not bring his emoluments up to the level contracted for when he agreed to take office.</P>

      <P>Yes, in the last four months.  Everybody will agree that the value of money is changing every other day.  Is the Labour Court not continually in session to adjudicate claims for increases in salaries?  However, the salary was fixed and agreed as a reaonable one, say, some years ago.  I do not know when it was fixed. One thing is clear, namely, that since the salary was fixed and since the time when it was agreed that £2,500 was a reasonable remuneration the value of money has changed.  Therefore, the idea underlying this proposition in the Bill is to make some adjustment for the change that has occurred in the value of money.  It does not provide for an increase in the remuneration of the Attorney-General.  That is the point in question.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to impede our progress towards the Appropriation Bill if I could avoid it, but, on Section 2, I would like to say that I agree entirely that Ministers should be properly paid and that I think Ministers should be paid a definite sum.  The history of Ministers' salaries is interesting.  A Minister's salary was first fixed by the Provisional Government at £80 a month.  That was £960 a year.  I do not know who fixed it. It was then fixed by an all-Party Committee in the Dáil at £1,700 a year and, <Col N="519" /> as the Minister told us this evening, the £360 paid to Deputies was allowed out of that free of income-tax.  The present Ministers when in Opposition argued that Ministers should only have £1,000 a year and when they came into office in 1932 they purported to take £1,000 a year but in fact they took £1,000 a year free of income-tax which, of course was much more than £1,000 a year.  That was a bit of political sleight-of-hand.  They then discovered, as their predecessors had discovered, that the salary was not a big one and they, took the whole £1,700 on the same conditions as their predecessors and they found then that that itself was not a very big salary.  As well as the £1,000 a year free of income-tax they took for themselves, not as an escort, but as a convenience, transport for a Minister and his family and his friends, entirely at his disposal&mdash;unlimited transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Sir, the present proposal is that Ministers should have a salary of £1,500, subject to income-tax, an allowance of £624 not subject to income-tax and transport worth, as has been pointed out, at least £1,000.  That brings the Ministerial income up to £3,500.  I think it would be better if a sum of £3,500, or even a sum of £4,000, free of income-tax were paid. I do not want to go into all these arguments and to start this thing all over again about our having simply an increase of what was done before.  The assumption that everything that was done in the beginning is right is a very refreshing, interesting and satisfactory thing for me to hear, but I think we ought to benefit by our experience and our experience is, I think, that Ministers ought to be paid, not so much because you cannot get the best people without paying them, as because people who do that kind of work should be paid for doing it, and if Ministers have to be escorted, which is a lamentable state of affairs, it cannot be helped and whatever expense that involves must be cheerfully and gladly borne. The present situation, I think, means that a Minister has a much higher effective salary than a High Court judge.  He should have the same salary or, if you like, a higher salary, but it <Col N="520" /> should be clearly set down and subject to income-tax, with an allowance fixed to keep him from doing, what the Minister says, wrangling with the income-tax authorities about his expenses.</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is my view on the whole matter.  It is a view that Ministers should be properly paid but that the sum should be properly set out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>My principal reason in speaking now is so that the Minister could not misquote me.  Four or five times the Minister has used the expression, &ldquo;This has passed the Seanad without objection&rdquo;, or &ldquo;This was passed in such a place without objection.&rdquo;  In case anybody should misunderstand me, I want to say that I do object to these salaries. Nobody can say that I do so because I am a member of the Labour Party or of any other Party.  I did this when I was a member of the National Executive of Fianna Fáil.  The Fianna Fáil Party got into power in this country principally because they opposed high salaries.  As a matter of fact, one of their main planks on the political platform was their opposition to high salaries while the standard of the majority of the people was low.  At that time I supported Fianna Fáil because I believed their policy was right.  In 1938, when they abandoned that policy and increased their salaries, I opposed the increases.  I oppose them still because I am satisfied that they are entirely out of proportion to the standard of life of the mass of the people. Further, I believe that to approve of these salaries would be to approve of the policy of the Ministers and of the Government and to admit that they have served the nation.  I for one do not approve.  I am not satisfied that they have served the nation in the <Col N="521" /> manner in which they should or could have served the nation.  I believe that the Ministers have failed or that the Government have failed in the matter of finding employment for our people within our country.  In that respect I believe the Ministers have completely failed and, therefore, I do not want to be misunderstood or to let it appear that an increase in their salaries was unanimously approved.</P>
      <P>How could I conscientiously allow an increase, and a substantial increase, for a Minister for Local Government who has refused to sanction an increase of 3/- per week for a road worker?  Anything that I say is not in any way personal; but how could I support an increase for a Minister for Agriculture when the farm labourers of this country, even though they received decent increases under the previous Minister for Agriculture, have not reached the standard which would be appropriate to workers engaged on such important work?  From that point of view, I could not support an increase for the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for that position.  As I have said on a previous occasion, the members of this House will be going on holidays.  Deputies have already gone on holidays.  Supposing they remained on holidays for the next 12 months the business of this nation could be carried on but if the farm labourers and the small farmers and producers of this country went on holidays until next Christmas, we would all die of starvation within 12 months.  In regard to the standard of living of farm labourers, I believe that the Government have failed.</P>

      <P>I object to these increases.  Yon have insurance workers walking the streets of Dublin to-day. They are men who are in receipt of £4 a week, and they are out because of conditions laid down by the Government. I am not blaming the insurance companies.  They say that they give certain guarantees, to their policy holders and to their shareholders and that they are so tied up that they have not the finance to give an increase. This has been done by this Government without making any attempt to remedy the position.  The Minister said, and rightly so, about 20 times during the last few days that to be as well off as one was in 1939 one would want to get an increase of 41 per cent. <Col N="523" /> I accept the Minister's word as being correct.  I never heard a man speak as well for labour as he did.  He has put the case that we have been trying to put all the time.  Why should we give Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries an increase?  It was the conduct of those Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries that placed other people in the position in which they cannot get an increase of 1/-.  Is not a Minister responsible and should he not review the position immediately and put an end to it?  The Ministers themselves who feel they are in need of an increase are responsible for placing those individuals in the awkward position in which they find themselves.  That is all that I want to say.  There are other things in which the Government have failed but I am not going to go into them.  As far as the Departments of Agriculture, Local Government and Industry and Commerce are concerned, they have refused to sanction an increase of 3/- a week to road workers, or to make any provision for farm workers, or any provision for insurance workers.  Therefore, I want to be recorded as voting against the increases in this Bill.</P>

      <P>When speaking on this Bill last year, I referred to some agricultural problems which at the time seemed to be the subject of perhaps the greatest grievance amongst the agricultural ocmmunity.  It is only <Col N="524" /> right that I should commence my remarks by thanking the Minister for Finance for what he did on the beet issue.  It is grand to see the sun shining to-day.  It is an encouragement to those of us who are engaged in agriculture, especially after the weather we experienced in the last two years.  I believe some Senator said yesterday that he wished the Government would do something about the weather.</P>

      <P>If the good weather that we are enjoying to-day is the response from Above to prayer, fasting and alms-deeds, that is all the more reason why we should plead again, and hope that some further benefits will be bestowed upon us.  As regards beet growing, I should like to tell the Minister that the position is very nearly right, but then as usual there is a slight snag in what is offered to agriculture.  Within the last fortnight I found strawberries getting very ripe, and as a grower of beet I communicated with the general manager of the sugar company.  He is the most enthusiastic man that I have ever found working for the cause of agriculture in Ireland.  I refer to General Costello who, in a reply, told me that it would be impossible for him to order a release of sugar permits until an estimate of the crop had been obtained.  I wrote back and said that the sugar would be of very little use to us if we did not get it in time, and that the crops of strawberries and raspberries would be lost. I asked him again to put his big shoulder to the wheel and see if he could not do something for agriculture. Within six days I got a further reply from him saying that he had impressed on the appropriate authority the desirability of sending out the permits, and then there was the usual &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash;the permits could only issue from the Department of Industry and Commerce. He hoped they would be out within a week.  I hope so, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Minister for Finance the desirability of having these &ldquo;buts&rdquo; removed from agriculture.  Heaven knows we have had enough of them.  For five weeks I have been carting 35 workers from my <Col N="525" /> native town to my own place to deal with the beet crop.  Not one of them has been able to work three whole days in one week, due to the inclement weather.  My entire staff of men and those workers were drowned by the showers.  They had to be taken back which meant a loss of time to them. There is always a loss to myself and to any other producer in such circumstances. Beet-growing is an essential part of the agricultural industry.  It can become a main promoter in the development of an independent Ireland, and be regarded as the foundation to keep the Irish soil right.  That is my opinion after 15 years' experience as a grower.  I want again to ask the Minister why these &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in agriculture? I know that the Government and the Ministers are in earnest.  I would appeal to the Minister for Finance who is a political opponent of mine&mdash;both of us stand for the same county&mdash;to use whatever influence he has to have these &ldquo;buts&rdquo; removed in the case of beet-growing.</P>
    <P>If I wanted a text for my speech it was to be found in this morning's issue of the <i>Irish Press</i> in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is reported to have stated that the &ldquo;wheat shortage is world-wide and that rationing must remain.&rdquo;  Last year I pleaded with the Minister for Finance, in the case of wheat-growing, that the latest impediment of moisture content should go.  Why are these irritations brought into agriculture? I know that the Minister is enthusiastic and that our farmers are enthusiastic no matter what their political views may be.  I suggest to the Minister that that is an irritation which should be removed.  My own townland consists of about 500 acres.  In the case of two producers there, their area under wheat this year will be down by about 45 statute acres.  Neither myself nor my neighbour is prepared to take the risk of growing the complement of wheat we could grow and have grown to the Minister's knowledge whilst that impediment is in front of us.  It was unfair for the Minister ever to have done that.  In 1941 I was a member of a Committee which sat until 11 o'clock at night at which there were present the Taoiseach, Deputy Hughes, Deputy <Col N="526" /> Corry, Deputy Dillon and the late Minister for Agriculture, and afterwards the price of wheat was raised to 50/- and subsequent increases ensued. No mention was ever made to any farmer or any county committee of agriculture about the moisture content. That was brought in without authority.  It is an impediment which an enthusiastic Ministry would not have permitted against the farmers. We have been enthusiasts.  Some of us have gone out to equip ourselves to grow wheat.  It does not matter what price we get from the Minister; we are used to that.  Whenever the Minister wants to abuse any part of the community he begins with the farmers.  I believe we have Ministers that will protect us and acknowledge the justice of the demand we make.</P>
    <P>As regards the price of wheat, it is very evident that the country will not get away with that as easily as it thinks.  It is evident that the consumers are not going to be permitted to enjoy the privileges which this House and the other House seem to extend towards them at the cost of the farmers and chiefly at the cost of farmers who have put every 1/- practically which they had, and perhaps their fathers before them, into their business while other people can erect great factories and run the country at their expense.  It is pretty evident that these crops which are so essential will not be grown in other countries either and that, therefore, the people must be prepared to pay for them.  I think the Minister should take the bull by the horns and see that a decent price is paid to the farmers who are willing to grow wheat if fair treatment is given to them.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to compulsory tillage. because you can bring a horse to the water but you cannot make him drink. The fact that we have a large number of people who are incompetent of growing a crop is no reason why the rest of us should be made to suffer.  It was the produce of these incompetent growers who are forced to do something with land which they do not know how to do that made the wheat bad with the result that we are not able to make our living out of it.  For that <Col N="527" /> reason, I have not much hope that compulsory tillage will yield much fruit. I would prefer to see these people out of it.  The growing of an equal percentage of crops is not possible everywhere. There is land unsuited to the growing of crops, just as there is land suited to it.  Those who are willing to do it are entitled to a fair crack of the whip and to a livelihood as good as those in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why are we not in a position to pay the same wages here to our labourers as is being paid elsewhere?  It is all very well to have English people coming over and buying land at good prices here, while small farmers and their children are in slavery sometimes and the labourers are the same.  The contentment is not there and the rural population is decreasing.  The tendency is to leave the land because the money is not coming back into it.  Why? Because the system has been rudely upset.  Manures are sold in one country at £6 per ton and in the other at £60. Can we produce these manures here? I hold that we can produce 75 per cent. of the manure we require, always provided that the Government gives for our output the same price as the other Government gives for what is produced there.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong in my figures, but I have made the calculation that every beast born, fed and fattened in England for the last 12 or 14 years made £10 roughly more than it would make if it were fed and produced here.  If that is so, the Government owes to the Irish producers an equivalent amount.  If anything like that applied to the Irish consumers, they would be placed on an equal footing before 24 hours elapsed. The Dublin Press and the Dublin civil servants would see to it.  But because it happens down the country there is not a word about it.  The fact that a vast sum of money has been extracted from the cattle trade and particularly from the stall-feeding branch of it is one reason which prevents manure being made on the land that we were trained how to make.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to permit store cattle to leave the country, but I am <Col N="528" /> doubtful of the wisdom of that policy, because we can, and should, fatten our cattle.  Now that feeding stuffs are again coming in that should be done. The basic consideration is that a foreign government with which we are in competition for our workers and everything else is treating its farmers in a fair way.  Our Government should see to it that we are not prejudiced by that.  When I see statements in the Press about giving guarantees that we will not produce things here in opposition to the North of Ireland, I should like to think that we who are engaged in agriculture would get similar treatment. Sometimes I wonder how enthusiastic the agriculturists in the North are about coming in here.</P>
    <P>The idea is growing that rural Ireland is practically without hope. With intensive cultivation there is a living to be obtained from the land, but the hand of the Government is against it.  When wild statements are made about certain branches of farming without due consideration, a damper is put on enthusiasm.  If a member of your family were starting in life on the land and went into a bank for a loan and there were headlines in the papers about all kinds of wild threats against farmers, I wonder how the directors of the bank, who, in 99 cases out of a 100 are city residents, would feel about making an advance and what hope they would have for agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am putting forward these views for the Minister's consideration.  I am making no political propaganda out of this matter.  I have asked for no favour for myself.  A few weeks ago I seconded a motion by Senator Counihan asking for earnest consideration of the fact that 250,000 calves had been slaughtered.  If you multiply that by 20, in two years it would amount to-one or two millions.  It strikes me that it has not received the consideration which it ought to have got.  I may be wrong in these things, but it is the duty of an Opposition Senator to state his. views for the consideration of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is true that an effort is made in the distribution of rates.  The first £20 of a man's valuation is subject to derating with an allowance of 2s. in the <Col N="529" /> £ in respect of the rates on £12.  That is not of very material benefit on a farm of, say, 500 acres, 300 acres being owned by the farmer and the balance taken in conacre, if something like 111 citizens derive their sole sustenance and support therefrom.  If the first £20 of valuation of a small farm is derated, why should there not be an equal division according to the number of labourers employed?  Is not the employer who employs a labourer with three, four, five, or six children and a half acre plot of ground on his farm of 300 or 500 acres just as much entitled to a reduction in proportion to the number of these labourers as the small farmer is, in view of the fact that the more extensive man cannot expect to get the same return?  He has fixed hours, whereas the small man has none. The labourer is bound to have an hour at which he stops and why not a division in respect of each labourer employed?  I cannot see why that should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I read the encouraging statements made at a meeting of the Federation of Rural Workers last Sunday.  Deputy Larkin and others said they had no antagonism against the farmers, but that they would have to push the farmers when the labourers were not getting sufficient.  When economic measures completely opposed to the economic interests of the country were introduced, I wonder was the Labour Party against their adoption, or if they deliberately and definitely, in the past 10 or 15 years, allied themselves with them; but, whether they did or not, there is no use weeping over it.  The proper course to adopt is to examine the position in the full light of to-day's necessities and see if a remedy can be found, whether by the Opposition, of which I am a member, the Government, or the Labour Party.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture have returned from the conference in Paris. It was no petty conference they attended.  There is a world-wide scarcity of most essential foods and there is here a people willing, anxious and eager to put their shoulders to the wheel.  It rests with the Government to decide which course will be taken.</P>

      <P>As I have a great <Col N="530" /> respect for Senator Fearon, I would nate to incur his censure for making 100 words do the work of 10.  My intervention, therefore, will be very brief, but I should like my 10 words to do the work of 100 in enlisting the sympathy of the Minister with regard to certain matters arising out of various Votes in this Bill which I desire to put before him.  It would he impossible for me, as one having my roots deeply set in the Six Counties, not to say something with regard to the interesting contributions by Senator Douglas and Senator Johnston, last night.  I should like to remind Senator Douglas that what he desires&mdash;Northern representation in the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;is already, to a certain extent, effective.  It is a very interesting fact when one thinks of it that, of the personnel of this Chamber, 60 members, one-tenth have been elected on a franchise which covers all Ireland.  I am one of these six University representatives, and when I speak with the Doric accents of the North, perhaps it may not be a surprise for anybody to know that I have a large vote in the lost province, but the same thing, I think, is true of all the University representatives.  For us, thanks be to God, the Border has been abolished and we hope that, with that auspicious beginning, it will be abolished in our time, a short time, for the whole representation of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that Senator Johnston had a more realistic approach and realised better the real difficulty in the Northern question.  Some people place great hopes in fraternisation.  I do not know that I have great hopes in that respect. I think that perhaps we shall have to leave time and education to soften the differences and it will be a good many years before that can take place.  I was reminded when the Senator was speaking of an incident which occurred to a very distinguished Northern patriotic woman of the same liberal stock to which Senator Johnston is proud to belong, Miss Alice Milligan. Many years ago, when she was lecturing for the Gaelic League, she happened to be in a train on 12th July which was bringing some excursionists of the Orange persuasion from Belfast to Ballycastle.  One lady was particularly <Col N="531" /> vociferous and was consigning His Holiness the Pope to a place which 18th century clergymen did not mention to ears polite.  She, however, had no inhibitions at all about it.  Miss Milligan thought it did not matter very much, as the Pope was in Rome and could not hear her, and, even if he did, would not understand a word of what she said; but she began to talk about the Catholics, and then Miss Milligan said mildly: &ldquo;I do not think they are as bad as you think.&rdquo;  This lady evidently belonged to the school of thought about whom Senator Johnston told us, who believe that the northern Catholics are one of the most regrettable mistakes of the Almighty.  She held that view strongly, and Miss Milligan remonstrated and said that she knew Catholics and they were not so bad as she suggested.  Said the woman: &ldquo;Tell me about Catholics?  I know.  I was married to one and I reared seven&rdquo;&mdash;so she knew all about them.</P>
    <P>To pass from these high matters to the Bill, I am particularly interested in the Vote for the Universities, Vote 26. When the Finance Bill was going through we congratulated and thanked the Minister for what he had done in making more adequate financial provision for the universities, but, at the same time, I should have liked to have got an assurance from him that the students would benefit more directly. The matter of living accommodation for students is a very urgent one.  The conditions under which students live in Galway, Dublin, and Cork, are very trying, and I think the Government and the university authorities ought to come together and find some solution of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Last year, when speaking on the Vote, I made a suggestion which the Minister was kind enough to receive with some sympathy, that, in our effort to spread Gaelic culture, we ought to try to aim at having in one of the university towns&mdash;I naturally thought of Galway&mdash;a hostel for Irish speakers, run by Irish speakers.  Perhaps we might get some understanding with the students that they would carry on their ordinary conversations in the Irish language.  I think that could aid a <Col N="532" /> great deal in advancing the language and I commend the suggestion for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    <P>Last night, reference was made to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, and there was a good deal of talk about dower houses.  I am naturally very interested in that matter.  Dower houses seem to me to be an excellent suggestion.  I would like some consideration given to the kind of women the young men will be inviting to help them to occupy these dower houses and the sort of education we will give to future farmers' wives. In no department of the national economy is the help of women so important as in farming.  My experience has been that if the farmer has not a good, practical wife, it will be very difficult for him to make a success of his holding.  Therefore, we should aim at giving practical education to future farmers' wives.</P>
    <P>To do that we have, through the country, in many counties, very excellent schools of rural domestic economy. I here make a plea to the Minister on behalf of the ladies who, for many years, have been instructresses in these schools of domestic economy.  They are usually in schools run by nuns, they are not given a very big salary, and they will have no pensions.  A good many of them, after years of very important national service, are seeking retirement.  Some consideration should be given to the question of adequate pensions for these people, because it will be difficult for them to live.</P>
    <P>It would be a good idea if we were to give these ladies adequate pensions and enlist young women in the Irish-speaking districts who will be able to give instruction through Irish.  That would do great work for rural economy and for the Irish language.  It would help very much the schemes which the Minister has in mind.</P>
    <P>Last night reference was made to greenhouses and tomato raising.  If you want to make a success of that, you must have the co-operation and the interest of women.  Women are much better at this type of work.  It requires great care and attention.  Usually countrymen like to do things in a broad kind of way and they would find <Col N="533" /> it difficult to devote their time to this type of occupation.  I know people in the Aran Islands who make a success of tomato growing.  The girls of the family usually do the work.  That is the reason I am anxious that we should have in these Gaelic colonies schools for rural domestic economy run by Irish-speaking instructresses who will be competent to interest the girls in this branch of horticulture.  There has been one instructress in the Gaeltacht for many years who has done heroic work.  She has earned her retirement and I hope she will get a pension.</P>
    <P>Talking about pensions, I will draw the Minister's attention to Vote 49&mdash; Primary Education.  Once again I make a plea on behalf of the old pensioned teachers.  Some of them are in a deplorable condition.  Their pensions were based on miserable salaries and now the cost of living has gone up.  We have been making a case for the more favoured classes and if these old pensioned teachers are to be left unconsidered, it may mean starvation for many of them.  The Minister's figures indicated 104 points for 1939 and the cost of living now has risen to 207 points, an increase of practically 100 per cent.  Something should be done as soon as possible for these old pensioned teachers and I appeal to the Minister in a generous mood to take cognisance of their needs.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the housing of officials.  This is a matter in which I am very interested. It has come to my knowledge that there are a great many officials who are changed frequently from one district to another, such as school inspectors and people employed by the Revenue Commissioners.  When they are moved like that it is very difficult for them to get houses.  I know cases in Galway where the wife and family remain in the house while the husband is employed in Dundalk, Limerick or somewhere else.  In such circumstances family life is impossible. Arrangements should be made so that houses will be provided for officials such as these.  The houses should be sufficient to accommodate an ordinary family and the rent should be reasonable. I lay these few points before the <Col N="534" /> Minister in the hope that he will give them sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Though this Bill offers an opportunity of having attention directed to various services, I do not propose to avail of that opportunity, beyond referring to a few matters of particular interest to County Mayo and a few more of general interest.</P>
      <P>The first matter to which I wish to refer would, I think, arise regularly on Vote 29, concerned with salaries and expenses of the Department of Agriculture. Some months ago an Order issued from that Department forbidding the sale of the commodity known as country butter to any concern other than a creamery or to anybody other than an accredited agent acting for a creamery.  I have no doubt that the Order may operate successfully and to the mutual benefit of all concerned in districts where country butter is produced in large quantities, but in a county like Mayo, in which there are no creameries and in which this butter is produced only in small lots, the total production would not justify an agency. The result will be that, if the Minister insists on enforcing the Order, there will be a drastic cut in the production of that very useful article of food.</P>
      <P>Where country butter is produced, after the home requirements are provided for, the residue is generally sold in the shops in which the butter producer gets his or her supply of groceries.  Those shops in return retail that butter to customers who prefer it to the produce of the creameries.  If the Order is enforced little or no country butter will be produced and the demands for creamery butter, already in very short supply, will be considerably increased.  For that reason I respectfully ask the Minister to draw the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to the desirability of having that particular Order revoked so far as Mayo is concerned, and also any other county that may be similarly circumstanced to Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter to which I wish to refer, also arises on this Vote.  Some time ago a number of individuals in Ballina invested a considerable amount of capital in the purchase of up-to-date <Col N="535" /> motor trucks and lorries.  They were duly licensed as hauliers and as such carried on a lucrative business, providing very necessary and regular employment for a considerable staff. Some short time ago one of these hauliers was commissioned by a potato factor to remove a quantity of potatoes. He was preparing to do so when the merchant who commissioned him was notified by an inspector of the Department of Agriculture that the potatoes would have to be removed by rail.  Any Senator knows that the less handling potatoes get in transit, the better it is for their condition and if this Order was intended to preserve the quality of the food it is going to defeat its purpose because if the potatoes have to be transported by rail, they will first have to be taken from the merchants' stores to the railway station in lorries, there dumped into railway wagons and, when they reach the end of the rail journey, they will again have to be removed by some other form of transport to their ultimate destination.  The deterioration in the quality of the food consequent on this repeated handling would be entirely obviated if the hauliers were allowed to complete their contracts and transport the potatoes by lorry for the full distance.</P>
    <P>I may say that this interference with the rights of these licensed hauliers is very much resented and is regarded as something in the nature of a conspiracy between Córas lompair Éireann and a State Department to give a monopoly of transport to Córas lompair Éireann and to cut out these people who, as I said at the outset, invested a considerable amount of capital in providing that particular form of transport and, by doing so, gave much employment in that particular area, employment which will cease if this drastic Order is persisted with.  In this matter I would also ask the Minister for Finance to impress on his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, the desirability of having the Order cancelled.  If persisted in, it will certainly interfere with the constitutional rights of citizens whose property rights are guaranteed by the Constitution. As I have said, it also makes for giving a monopoly to a large concern and for cutting out the private individual <Col N="536" /> who through his initiative has invested capital in an industry that is of benefit not alone to himself but to a very considerable number of his neighbours for whom it provides employment.</P>
    <P>The next matter to which I wish to refer concerns the service provided by Córas lompair Éireann.  Since extra supplies of coal allowed additional trains to be run, a second train has been run to Mayo from Westland Row.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Senator would be in order in referring to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I imagine that I am not out of order in referring to it since Córas lompair Éireann is, I think, more or less subsidised.  The train stops at Castlebar with the result that people travelling to Ballina, 25 miles further north in the county, and to intermediate stations have to depend for further transport on buses, if accommodation is available.  I think, since Córas lompair Éireann is so anxious to monopolise transport, so far as merchandise is concerned, it should show some consideration for the travelling public and in particular for the citizens of County Mayo who have occasion to use their services from time to time.  That train, I suggest, should complete its journey to Ballina. It is a matter that is regarded in a very serious light by the people of the county because we know that when some years ago considerable stretches of railway running from Westport to Achill and from Ballina to Killala, were torn up, the people were guaranteed that they would be provided with an alternative service, at least as satisfactory and as cheap as that provided by these railways.  We know that these guarantees have not been honoured.  These are the matters of particular interest to County Mayo to which I wish to draw attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter of general interest, and though I have referred to it on a few occasions here before, I make no apology for returning to it to-day.  Since the removal of the Standstill Order, various bodies of public servants have been provided for <Col N="537" /> in the matter of additions to their salaries to enable them to meet the increased cost of living.  Other services not controlled by the Government have also provided increases in emoluments for their employees.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one particular body in this country, a body which rendered very considerable service to the State, all the members of whom served under one or other of the two Governments we have had since we secured national independence and who have received no consideration, notwithstanding the fact that the purchasing value of the pound has fallen as much for them as for any other body in the community.  I refer to the pensioned national teachers.  These people gave very faithful service in essential work.  They never spared themselves in the extra efforts they were called upon to make for the restoration of a language that was practically dead in many of the areas in which they functioned. The State has certainly shown scant consideration for the representations which they have themselves made to the Government as well as for the representations made on their behalf by other bodies since the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I would make a last appeal to the Minister for Finance, who is directly concerned with this, that even now something might be done to redress the grievances of these people.  The number involved is not very large.  Several of them have been retired on a very low scale of pension and the amount of money necessary to provide them with an extra allowance with which they would be satisfied would not be very considerable.  It looks very bad at the present time, now that we have been so generous to everybody, not forgetting ourselves, that we should be unmindful of the needs of these people who, as I say, gave good service to the cause of Irish nationality when it was neither as safe nor as fashionable to do so as it now is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on this Bill has ranged over a very wide field. Listening to Senator Baxter last night, <Col N="538" /> one would think that one was listening to a weather forecast from some station in the west advising us that there was a terrible wave of depression moving from there.  No matter what the subject, Senator Baxter's speeches in this House are the same.  That might be no harm if the Senator's statements were confined to the House but statements of this kind go out over the country and have a very bad effect on the farming community.  We should realise that the farmers did a magnificent job during the years of the emergency, that they did wonderful work during last harvest and that, after accomplishing that, they were faced with what one might describe as disaster this spring.  All the farmer could do for months, owing to the weather, was look out.  Despite all those difficulties and despite the discouragement resulting from the spring and summer of last year, the farmers faced their work with enthusiasm and interest as soon as they got the opportunity, with the result that, when one moved through the country in recent weeks, one hardly believed that the spring was as late as it was.  We must admit that, despite the depression which Senator Baxter seems to see, the crops are just as promising as if we had a normal spring.</P>
      <P>The Senator made reference to our fuel supply.  Here, I agree with what he said.  The amount of turf produced last year in the west has not been produced this year.  That is not due to any lack of interest in the production of turf.  It is due to weather conditions over which the Ministers have no control.  Senator Baxter and other Senators who took part in the debate requested that the Government should do all sorts of things.  Last night, a Senator asked that something be done to make animal feeding-stuffs available. We all must appreciate that the Ministers of the various Departments are doing all that can humanly be done to keep our people supplied with food and fuel.  No matter what effort be made, particularly with regard to fuel, I believe the position will be difficult next winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of turf-producing areas, I have been told by the people that, <Col N="539" /> according to a statement in some of the papers, coal will be available next winter and that, if they produce turf, no market will be available for it.  It is not too late to kill that idea.  I know that it has been stated officially by the Department concerned that this will not be the case, but I think it cannot be overstressed, even now, that all the turf which will be produced will be taken off the producers' hands.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane also complained about the regulations in regard to the sale of country butter.  If I am not very much mistaken the same Senator complained here some months ago about the ration of butter.  It was pointed out then by those who took part in the debate and by the Minister, that the only butter rationed at the time was creamery butter and that of the total amount of butter produced in the country&mdash;farmer's butter and creamery butter&mdash;farmer's butter formed the greater part.  He said that the people in County Mayo like country butter.  I am sure, however, that those people whom, he stated, like country butter also go to the shops to draw their rations of creamery butter.  If this regulation is not enforced&mdash;and it is very hard to enforce a regulation of this kind except with the goodwill of the producers&mdash;it will mean that those who need the butter most will not have it and that those who can afford it and who are convenient to where it is produced will have their ration of creamery butter as well as whatever they may be able to purchase from the farmers.  I think it is a bad thing for a public representative to take up an attitude of this kind because, by making a complaint in this House or in any other place of a regulation that is made in the interests of the people as a whole, he is encouraging and leading the producers to think that they are labouring under a disadvantage and that they should not produce the butter.</P>
    <P>Last night Senator Douglas put forward some views and recommendations in regard to the attitude that is taken up officially here to our people in the North.  He made a suggestion that the doors of the Parliament here should be open to the representatives elected <Col N="540" /> in the Northern areas.  I think that that is a most dangerous idea.  It is a suggestion that this question of Partition is merely a question between the people in the North and the people in the South.  We know perfectly well that Partition was not brought about by the will of the people in the North or of the people in the South, or by any Act of theirs.  Partition was enforced in this country by a foreign Parliament and in a foreign Parliament without the voice or the vote or the approval of any single representative of Ireland&mdash;either that of a Unionist or that of a Nationalist.  Senator Douglas also suggested that we should not stress the fact that this question of Partition is a question primarily for the British Government&mdash;that we should not say that the good relations essential to the well-being of both countries cannot exist nor continue to exist until this question is solved-Good relations can exist and do exist and will, I hope, continue to exist, but there cannot be that co-operation of a free people, one with the other, while one party holds or helps to hold in subjection the inhabitants of a part of our country.  The mere admission of these elected representatives from the northern area or from that portion of the northern area which is-represented in the Parliament there would only mean that they would have-no functions in this Parliament and that they would be taking part in the-Legislature here for an area over which this Parliament has no jurisdiction. The question is would they be allowed to take part and to vote in the House; would they be just spectators; would they be allowed to take part in the debates and, if so, what effect would it have on the question of the removal of Partition?  Senator Douglas also seemed to suggest, I think, that the statement recently made in the Dáil by the Taoiseach was some new departure-by Fianna Fáil and that it was something that was welcomed by the Senator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of correction. I do not think my suggestion was actually that.  I remember distinctly the very words.  I said that I was very glad that the Taoiseach had once again repeated his statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="541" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression I got from the Senator's statement was that he was glad the statement had been made again, if you like.  I feel that in saying that he felt that prior to this statement or to its first being made some other policy was encouraged by the Government or by this Party.  It has never been the policy of this Party to encourage that any actions but those of persuasion and co-operation should be undertaken in attempting to solve the problem of Partition.  It is also our policy, and the policy of this Party, I think, to make it quite clear to our people here and to the people across the way that this question of Partition does not concern the Irish people alone.  It is not a question that the Irish people, by themselves, can solve.  As I said, Partition was first put through by an Act of the British Parliament.  By their goodwill and approval and with that co-operation of our people in the North this question of Partition can be settled.</P>
      <P>Even at the time when that Parliament was established in the North, Lord Craigavon, who was then the Prime Minister, made the statement&mdash;&ldquo;We have here a Parliament that we do not want&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that that Parliament was forced on them not by their wish but by the wish of some other power.  I think if we realise that and bear that in mind we will be very careful before we make a suggestion that something that will not be of any practical use towards the removal of Partition should be adopted.  To my mind, the suggestion made by Senator Douglas last night for the adoption of a policy, which, incidentally, has already been put forward by another group outside, would not help to remove Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which was referred to by other speakers and which I think it is right that I should mention, concerns the scheme for the erection of glass-houses in the Gaeltacht.  I should like to make public how very much we, in the West, appreciate this scheme which was recently introduced by the Department of Agriculture.  We hope it will meet with every success and that it is only the forerunner of other schemes to be undertaken in Gaeltacht <Col N="542" /> areas.  As has already been said by other speakers, if we are going to solve the problem in the Gaeltacht we must find employment and, as far as possible, establish industries there in order to keep the people there.  This question of the Gaeltacht and of the congested areas cannot be solved, no-matter how much we may try, by land division.  We must realise that we have not enough land to give each of those people an economic holding.  We must face up to the fact that the only long-term view to take is to keep the people in these areas by providing a means of livelihood for them.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, we must appreciate what has been done.  Every facility is being made available to local authorities and I am not satisfied they are availing of them.  Some months ago, the rate of interest on local loans was reduced from 4½ per cent. to 2½ per cent.  A fund was set up by the Minister from which additional grants to the ordinary grants could be made available to the local authorities to build houses for letting at reasonable rents, but from my experience in going through the country I feel that the local authorities are not fully availing of these facilities.  I know that materials are not in sufficient supply to permit of the vast housing scheme which is essential, but much more could be done in the way of site development and the laying of foundations so that the work could go ahead as soon as materials become available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an Estimate in the Dáil dealing with cultural relations and some allusion was made to it in this debate.  It is an old point of mine that we are spending a considerable amount of money on the teaching of Irish and a great many people are labouring hard, but the results are disappointing and an inquiry is needed; but the official attitude is that what was done before they came in is sufficient and we are not to learn from our experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the money that is being spent for cultural purposes on the Irish language or kindred subjects, there is one organisation which gives excellent value&mdash;the Folklore Commission.  It <Col N="543" /> deals, not with the history of kings and queens but with the history of the common man in Ireland and, more particularly, the common country man.  As well as doing that important work, it publishes a treasure of living Irish, accurately recorded, which is of immense value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigOSiochfhradha" hpid="Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha">
      <NameTxt>Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha</NameTxt>
      <P>That is done by the Folklore Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is the Folklore Society of Ireland which publishes it, but I think it is largely part of the work of the Folklore Commission. This folklore work gives us very valuable international contacts and international standing with Scotland, Walea and the smaller Scandinavian countries that resemble us in more ways than one.  The commission is fortunate in having a director who has a rare combination of qualities.  Not only is he a scholar but he has a quality which, unfortunately, is very lacking in a great many of our people, in that he can organise and agree with his helpers and subordinates.  He has an excellent staff.  I think the Minister himself has taken a, personal interest recently in the matter, and I take it he knows that the money available for the work, which is urgent, is very small and that the staff is in danger of being completely dissipated unless better salary conditions can be achieved.</P>
      <P>In the nature of their work, the members of the staff have to do field work and need expenses for that.  Since they are very badly paid, their expenses are correspondingly low.  The archivist, who is the principal assistant in the Folklore Commission, was a national teacher and is now receiving a lower salary than a first-class national teacher or a secondary teacher, whose qualifications he has, and lower than any assistant in University College, Dublin.  He is a man of particular good qualities and has done very remarkable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Folklore Commission deals, not only with the language and traditions but also with music and they have been fortunate in getting the kind of person required for this work, one with certain Qualifications and a particular <Col N="544" /> interest in the work, having a knowledge of the Irish language and a knowledge of music.  That particular man is leaving to go to Radio Éireann. I do not begrudge Radio Éireann the best staff it can get, but it is lamentable that a person peculiarly qualified for this folklore work, which is very difficult, should not get sufficient salary to keep him in the post.  In my opinion, this work is very important and, indeed, more important than that of Radio Éireann.  It requires not only qualifications but enthusiasm and the staff should be placed upon a better salary basis than it is on at present.</P>
    <P>Of all the organisations and agencies we have, this one certainly is giving the State and the ordinary citizen extraordinarily good value.  There is considerable urgency in the work they want to do, as they are collecting from sources which are naturally tending to disappear.  They are interested in the scientific handling of material from an international point of view and also in oral material, instruments and implements, the collection of photographs and records.  Last September, in a very small part of Cork where the Irish language survives, I met one of the finest speakers of Irish I ever heard.  He was an oldish man then and has since died and a record of his speech, which would have been desirable, was never obtained.  Therefore, there is urgency in this work and it is well worth doing.</P>
    <P>If we are to get the people to understand the principles underlying the revival of the language and if we desire to understand what the ordinary man in Ireland, the ancestor of the great majority of us was like, this work should be done and the facilities should be made available to do it rapidly and properly.  The amount of money required to put it on a proper foundation would be small.  There is a good deal of talk about aggression and imperialism.  It has been suggested we should get in touch with Irishmen all over the world, but that is a rather difficult problem.  It is very difficult to distinguish between propaganda for Ireland and propaganda for a Government or a Party.  There is a spiritual empire at our doors and, for a comparatively <Col N="545" /> small expenditure, we could take possession of it.  A beginning has been made in the collection of folklore in Scotland, by an officer of the Irish Folklore Commission who is a native speaker of Scotch Gaelic.  This work could be extended.  This is the only part of the world speaking a Celtic language, where there is a national institution, a national Government and a national Parliament.  I think we should undertake the collection of folklore outside our own realm, particularly in Scotland.  It would give us cultural relations with people with whom our ancestors have been in contact.  It would give us an international standing and it would help us in our own movement and help us to understand ourselves and to understand what is behind the Irish language movement. I would like to put that point, Sir, and particularly to people who think that there is what is called a city mind and a country mind.  The understanding of the country mind depends to a very great extent upon how a commission like the Folklore Commission is enabled to work.</P>
    <P>I think, as I have said, the Minister himself since he became Minister for Finance has been induced to take a personal interest in it and an improvement may be on the way but I would like to urge upon the Minister that an improvement is urgent and that there is no other branch of State activity connected with the revival of what is called Irish native culture from which better results have been obtained for a small expenditure of money.  I would urge him that he should expend a little more money and that he would get from that extremely good results. There are plenty of other things one might say on this Bill but I would like to confine myself to that particular point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I indicated that I desired to discuss on this Bill one item, that is, the failure of the Government to take effective steps to control prices.  As I have said, considerable sums of money are being expended by the Government in relation to price-fixing machinery of one kind or another, including the payment of subsidies, but, for some strange reason, <Col N="546" /> the effect of that expenditure is not apparent to the man in the street.  A very strange statement appears in this morning's papers arising out of some dispute with the fishermen at Howth. According to the newspaper reports, the fishermen who take whatever risk there is and perform the arduous task of ploughing the seas to bring fish to our shores were getting £2 2s. 0d. a cran for the catch.  They were demanding £3 a cran for some and £4 a cran for other portions of the catch.  The top figure was £4.  A fair amount of the take would have been bought for £3 but the retail price in Dublin, seven miles from Howth, is £12 10s., more than three times the cost to the distributors of the catch.  Does not this illustrate what is happening?  Here in the City of Dublin an ordinary popular commodity like herrings showed that between the producer, if we can call the fisherman the producer, and the consumer there is that wide gap, the difference between £3 and £12, that £9 or £8 10s., or whatever it is, being the reward which the distributor gets for his services.</P>
      <P>That picture is true of almost all distribution in this country.  Go out to the country and ask the farmer what price his cabbages, turnips or vegetables generally realise and he will tell you that he is getting some reasonably small price which often is inadequate reward for his work; but go into the cities of Dublin, Cork or Limerick and you will find that that commodity is either unobtainable or selling in the shops at prohibitive prices.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane made the point here on another occasion that that element in the community that is engaged in protected industries and in distribution netted during the war £40,000,000 in excess profits.  I do not think there is much question about that.  Nobody has questioned that figure as far as I am aware.  That sum has been paid by the Irish people and has been paid, to a very large extent, by people whose wages were pegged down, who could not get an increase in wages to compensate for the fantastic increases which took place in the cost of commodities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One instance of the extraordinary <Col N="547" /> profits which are being made in the drapery trade was brought to my notice this week.  A lady showed me a dress, the costings of which were worked out from the moment the cloth was bought until the garment was completed.  The actual cost of the garment, everything included, and allowing a very substantial figure for overheads, was slightly over £7&mdash;£7 2s. 0d. or £7 3s. 0d.&mdash;but a similar garment was selling in a retail shop in Grafton Street for 20 guineas.</P>
    <P>We are told that margins of profit are controlled by the prices fixed by the Minister.  What that means to me I dislike to say.  It is very hard to characterise a statement of that kind when we know that in fact there is no control at all and that shopkeepers who find themselves caught with goods which have an uncertain life can reduce the price by 50 per cent.  Garments selling at £1 to-day can be sold at 10/- to-morrow and there is no evidence that any of the firms who are making these substantial reductions have sought the protection of the Bankruptcy Court.</P>
    <P>What affects us primarily by this price level is the extraordinary fact that the vast majority of our people have very low incomes.  It is very easy, I suppose, for people to become complacent about the fact that the large majority of the people have low incomes, but what is going to be the ultimate economic effect of that situation?  It was calculated recently that more than 80 per cent. of the people in this country in receipt of incomes whether from wages, from interest, or from State or local authority benefits have less than £3 a week.  That is not 80 per cent. of the people, but 80 per cent. of people with incomes, and in many cases that would refer to two, three, four or five people who are members of a family.  On the other hand, one-half of 1 per cent. of the community are receiving, by way of income, one-sixth of the national income of the country.  The matter might be expressed like this.  If we take the class of the community described as the higher income group, and in that group I would, for this <Col N="548" /> country, classify those with £1,000 a year or more&mdash;it represents roughly one-half of 1 per cent. of the community&mdash;they have between them one-sixth of the national income.  It works out in this way, that those in the higher income group receive on the average £17 out of £100 of national income.  Those in the lower income group&mdash;that is the 80 per cent. to whom I have referred&mdash;receive 16/- on the average out of £100 of national income.  These are the extremes&mdash;80 per cent, in the lower income group, and one-half of 1 per cent in the higher income group.  In between these, there is the remainder of the population with incomes of between £150 a year and £1,000 a year.  Their income, as compared with the two I have mentioned, would represent about 21/- on the average out of £100 of national income.</P>
    <P>The question might reasonably be put, what can the Government do more than they are doing to-day?  I would not like to say what they could do that they are not doing because, as far as I see, they are doing nothing.  In most other countries Governments have succeeded in controlling and regulating prices.  I mentioned the result of Government intervention and activity in relation to price fixing on a former occasion.  I pointed out that in Britain to-day a wage earner's real wages are 40 per cent. higher than they were in 1939, so that by allowing increases in wages and by controlling prices and profits, the British Government have so altered the economic relations between the classes that real wages&mdash; that is wages in relation to purchasing power&mdash;are 40 per cent. higher than they were in 1939.  In the United States real wages are 30 per cent. higher than in 1939, in New Zealand they are 19 per cent. higher, in Canada 9 per cent. higher and in Sweden 4 per cent. higher.  In this country they are 14 per cent. lower than they were in 1939. If you take the whole wage-earning community here, their wage rates, on the average, are 14 per cent. lower than they were in 1939.  As we know from the discussions we had on the Finance Bill some weeKs ago, they have been cut still further by the inroads made by the State and by the local authorities in the levying of taxation and rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Now, if a remedy is to be found for that situation, it seems to me that the Government must either secure machinery which will effectively prevent extortionate overcharging or else set up machinery for the distribution of certain essential goods.  In other countries it is quite a common thing to find the municipal authority authorised to set up depôts, for instance, for the distribution of fuel, milk, vegetables, fish and commodities of that kind which enter into the every-day life of the community.  That must be done here if there is no other method open to the Government for controlling prices and preventing profiteering because the figures of taxation show that profiteering has been carried on as one gigantic racket.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that the Government are not serious in this matter, and that they have abdicated to a body of manufacturers who describe themselves as the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, Limited.  I have here the annual report of the secretary of that organisation which was presented to the members at their annual meeting held in the Gresham Hotel&mdash;as it might well be&mdash;on the 11th February last.  Before drawing the attention of the House to that statement, I should perhaps point out that the secretary recounts a number of visits which his executive paid to Government Departments in connection with the system of price control imposed by the Government.  In the first instance, there was a deputation to the Government in January, 1945, when the federation, apparently, asked the Government to clarify the innovation of gross profit directions. Later, in October, 1945, there was another deputation to discuss what the federation called a further innovation by the introduction of a net profit basis for calculating profits.  Now the upshot of these discussions appears in this very interesting summary contained in the secretary's report. Referring to the date, 1st May, 1946, when three members of the council and the secretary visited Ballsbridge, the report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By this time, the suggestion of a net profit control appeared to have been dropped by the Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> In other words, the federation had beaten the Department.  The report goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And in only one case did it come to the notice of the council that a member had acquiesced in an alter&mdash; ation of his gross profit rate to a limitation of net profit on his working capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, the Federation Council found one black-leg in the organisation who obeyed the Government's order. The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem that most members who had been asked by the Department to change over to net profit control had declined to do so in consonance with the council's resolution and with the advice which would have been given them at group and regional meetings and when they called individually on the secretary. By direction of the council, its correspondence with the Minister was circulated to a number of trade associations, the majority of which expressed themselves as being in support of the council's attitude.  It may therefore be assumed that there was an extensively united front...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What a famous phrase!</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... on the part of manufacturers against the proposed system of net profit control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now I think that is a most illuminating document.  The Government gave directions to the manufacturers in relation to the fixation of profits; but the manufacturers said: &ldquo;No.  We are not complying with your instructions or directions.&rdquo;  The manufacturers got away with it.  One unfortunate man seems to have obeyed the law.  I do not know whether or not&mdash;the report does not say&mdash;he was expelled from the association.  The others towed the line. It means that the Government's efforts to control profits in such a manner as to prevent excessive profit-taking, in other words, to prevent highway robbery, failed utterly and completely.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is an agitation being carried on, in Dublin at any rate, and probably in other parts of the country, against profiteering and the excess profit margins charged by the distributors.  Where that may lead I <Col N="551" /> do not know.  But it can have very dangerous consequences, not merely for the traders but for the whole economy of the country.  The purpose, so far as I can judge, of the organisation dealing with the matter is the organisation of a consumers' boycott. It may be that, if the Government fail or refuse to take action, nothing else is left except a consumers' boycott. But, when a consumers' boycott commenced in the United States of America, it was discovered that it had rather unexpected reactions, as all such unregulated, uncontrolled agitatations of that kind must have; because in the case of a consumers' boycott every individual is a judge of his own conduct.  He decides what to buy and what not to buy.  Some people may decide that they will not buy clothes; others that they will not buy boots, and so on.  It may happen that actually the commodities affected most are those in which there is the least profiteering. I think, therefore, that the Government should give some indication that they have effective control or, if they have not effective control, that they intend to have it.</P>
    <P>Here is a most extraordinary thing in relation to the Government's attitude. This profiteering has been going on openly, avowedly to the knowledge of every person in this community for seven years and just a month ago the Government introduced a Bill for the purpose of creating some machinery like a price control council, or a prices commission or some other machinery, and, having introduced the Bill, the Government then adjourned the Dáil for three months.  One would imagine that, having waited seven years to produce the Bill, they would be at least as anxious to have it enacted as they are to have enacted the two Bills which we discussed earlier this evening, one of them increasing the allowances for members of the Oireachtas and the other increasing the salaries of the Ministers. These Bills were not left over; these Bills were not put on the shelf until next October; they became a first priority claim on the time of both Houses.  The Bill which was introduced <Col N="552" /> for the purpose of creating machinery for the regulation of prices has got tenth priority.</P>
    <P>There is another matter occurs to my mind and that is how far we should go, in all our generosity and in all our Christian charity, with the sending of food from this country to certain European countries which are reputed to have an exportable surplus of their own.  I would draw the Minister's attention to a leading article which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on the 10th July and, in order that he may have an opportunity of adverting to the tone and purpose of that article, I shall quote one short extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What puzzles the Irish public at the moment is Mr. Aiken's statement in the Dáil last Friday that, in addition to millions of pounds of meat and herds of cattle, we sent 285 tons of bacon to Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia.  This revelation came strangely upon the heels of the announcement a few days earlier by the British Minister for Food, Mr. Strachey: &lsquo;We are getting supplies of eggs, sugar and poultry from Poland, and soon Hungary, under a three years' agreement, will be sending us supplies of bacon, eggs, poultry, lard and vegetable oils, and I hope soon to negotiate a similar agreement with Yugoslavia.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a quotation from the British Minister of Food, who evidently is speaking of something in regard to which he has first-hand knowledge. Nobody can doubt the statement that he has made these agreements and is getting these foodstuffs from countries to which we are sending bacon and butter which are in short supply at home.  That is something which requires explanation.  I do not think there is one person in the House who will object to the giving of relief, of food, to people who need it.  Whatever else may be said about the people of this country, nobody denies their charitable instincts, but it is a totally different matter if we are sending out to European countries food which is in short supply at home, while, at the same time, these countries seem to have an exportable surplus which they <Col N="553" /> are selling against our products on the British market.  There is hardly any wonder that, in its front page article last Saturday, <i>The Economist</i>, a British paper, should make this comment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Propping up the bastion of democracy is one thing; propping up an elderly and impecunious European aunt is another thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I drew attention to a matter which I thought might have been dealt with by the Minister, but which was ignored.  It seems to me to be a matter of great importance&mdash; the question of the use which can be made of our external balances, moneys held outside this country.  I pointed out that, in 1946, for every pound's worth of goods we sold in the dollar area, we bought £23 worth.  In other words, every time we spend £23 on the purchase of goods in the dollar area, we spend £22 out of the pool, apart from the value of our export trade.  It seems to me that that can be done only within limits and for a short time. Last year, the total volume of our imports exceeded the total volume of our exports by £33,000,000.  I think the Minister said in the Dáil that that gap was closed by our invisible exports, but let us bear in mind what our invisible exports are.  Remittances from people who have gone to Britain looking for work represent £13,000,000. That will scarcely continue indefinitely. If the men and women who have taken up employment in Britain remain there permanently&mdash;they are likely to marry, to settle down and make their homes in Britain&mdash;they will cease sending remittances to Ireland.  Therefore, we cannot go on expecting to have this sum of £13,000,000 a year by way of remittances from exiles in Britain.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that a further £13,000,000 came our way from investments, but, if we are called upon to eat into our capital resources abroad, this income from investments will also shrink, and, in any event, if the British pursue over a long period their policy of cheap money, it must react on the income we will derive as the years go by from our foreign investments, so that one can see that the £33,000,000 <Col N="554" /> representing the value of our invisible exports may shrink very substantially in the next few years.  Should that happen, we can only buy goods up to our full requirements by utilising existing capital balances abroad.  To what extent can these balances be utilised to buy goods outside the sterling area?</P>
    <P>I should imagine that many sections in this House would be interested to know what plans the Government have, what policy they intend to pursue, in relation to the convertibility of our external balance into currencies other than sterling.  It is a matter which affects the whole economy of the country.  It affects the farmer, the townsman, the manufacturer and the worker because it affects the importation of fuel, farm machinery, petrol, tobacco and even films, the great bulk of which are imported into this country from the non-sterling area.  A brief reference was made by two or three Senators who spoke to the presence at the conference in Paris last week of representatives of our Government, but I notice in this morning's paper that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not seem anxious to discuss with the newspapermen who met him at the airport what his hopes were in relation to the Paris Economic Conference. He did make one very significant statement when he said that the prosperity of neighbouring countries must at all times have great significance for us.  &ldquo;If they sink, we sink,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;If they rise, we rise.&rdquo;  That is a statement which is probably very obvious, but what appears to be significant to me is that that statement should be made at the airport when the Minister returned rather than that he should speak with some confidence of the proceedings at the conference which he had just left.  I imagine there is a little more involved in the conference than appears on the surface, and I think it would be desirable for the Government to make a full statement to the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity as to what are the implications of the conference, because one can easily have the suspicion that if our intervention there means the end of our isolation, it may also mean the end of our policy of neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to mentioning the subject of Partition in conjunction with this Bill, I am afraid that I am not in a position to compete with the excellent anecdote told by Senator Mrs. Concannon, as, I regret to say, the only anecdotes that I know about the North are neither drawing-room nor Parliamentary.</P>
      <P>Last night we all listened with deep attention and a great deal of sympathy to the interesting, if somewhat unique, suggestions dealing with the Partition problem which were made by our colleague, Senator Douglas.  Listening to the Senator, nobody could doubt the sincerity that lay behind his speech, and those of us who have been privileged to know the Senator for a period of years have no doubt whatever that he gave long and careful consideration to these suggestions before making them here.</P>
      <P>This problem of Partition is one which, over a period of 25 years, has been of the gravest concern to everybody in the Twenty-Six Counties, no matter to what political Party, group or creed one might belong.  In this House, as in the lower House, and, in fact, in all Parliaments, members have their differences.  They differ on internal policies, on economic policies and on agricultural policies, but we have one thing in common in both our Houses and that is an ardent desire on the part of each and every one of us to see our island united and we are all anxiously awaiting the day when our fellow-countrymen in the north-eastern counties will join with us in making this country a happy, prosperous and united State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not difficult to find flaws and to criticise Senator Douglas's suggestions. They have, however, the advantage that they were made in good faith, that they are free from prejudice or hatred, and that they contain nothing that can be interpreted in any way expect as a gesture of goodwill and anxiety to co-operate with our brethren in the North.  It strikes one that the first objection which might be raised is that this proposed invitation to take part in the work of our Parliament could only be issued after a change in our Constitution.  This, <Col N="556" /> surely, is not an insuperable difficulty. There is machinery in existence which provides for the changing of our Constitution. It could, for instance, be done by way of referendum at the next general election.  I suggest that between now and the next general election, whenever it may be held, the Government should give very serious consideration to the holding of such a referendum.</P>
    <P>A reference by Senator Hawkins to Senator Douglas's speech gives me an extra reason for making that suggestion. Senator Hawkins quite rightly pointed out the historical fact that there are more than two parties to Partition. There are three.  It is an historical fact that this island was originally partitioned by an outside Government, by an Act of the British Parliament in which neither ourselves nor our brethren in the North had any hand, act or part.  I make this suggesttion about a referendum because I believe that it is necessary, while the British Government are responsible, that at the same time we should adopt a policy of self-help.</P>
    <P>There is also this other reason. Charges have been made by people, outside the State particularly, that we are not sincere in our desire to end Partition.  The arguments put forward in that respect are that, over a period of 25 years, we have given much lip service to the Partition problem but that so far we have failed to take any initiative or any practical steps towards a solution.  The other charge that is made is again made by people who are not citizens of this State.  It is that there has grown up in the course of these years, on this side of the Border, vested interests that do not desire to see the Border abolished.</P>
    <P>I think that most of us will agree that all these charges are without foundation. Nevertheless, they have been made and I can see no more clear-cut answer to those charges than the holding of such a referendum which, I am quite convinced, would return at least a 99 per cent. majority in favour.  I have no doubt that some of the legal Senators&mdash; though I think I am rather lucky that most of them are absent at the moment &mdash;while giving a sympathetic hearing <Col N="557" /> to Senator Douglas's suggestions, would make the objection that they entail a course of constitutional action and practice which would be unprecedented in the annals of constitutional law.  If that be so, then in all good faith let us in this matter be unprecedented and make the first practical move in solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I think that where Partition is concerned it might pay us veiy well in this part of the country to adopt the motto that was adopted by a famous army during the recent war.  It was: &ldquo;The difficult we do immediately; the impossible will take a little longer.&rdquo;  That is, I think, the optimistic spirit in which we ought to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>I have always admired&mdash;and I do not always admire very much about the Government&mdash;the fact that when our responsible Ministers, headed by the Taoiseach, speak on this subject of Partition, they have always been at great pains to treat the matter with understanding, with sympathy and, above all, to avoid any phrases that might be interpreted as being coercive or bombastic.  For this careful and sympathetic attitude they deserve the highest credit from our people and I think it is regrettable that anyone, even the Head of the State, should speak with a different voice from theirs.  I appeal therefore that, for the future, we in this part of the island should leave the bombast to our erring countrymen who are vainly endeavouring to maintain the unnatural state in the north-east and who succeed only in making themselves appear ridiculous by their bombastic explosions.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of the Department of External Affairs, since the cessation of world hostilities, to increase our representation in the United States of America by the appointment of additional consuls and consuls-general to certain centres.  That is a policy with which I find no fault.  I think it is a very praiseworthy effort. I should like, however, to ask the Minister on this occasion to draw the attention of the appropriate people in our Department of External Affairs to an article to which my attention has been drawn and which appeared in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> of the 7th June, 1947.  The <i>Saturday Evening <Col N="558" /> Post</i>, I understand, has the reputation of being quite a reputable American magazine, containing fiction and articles of general interest and is, I understand, supposed to have one of the largest circulations of any such publication in the United States of America.  It is getting rather late in the day that a journal of this standing bhould produce this kind of ill-informed, pig-in-the-parlour article about this country.</P>
    <P>The article in question appears under the heading, &ldquo;Report to the Editors&rdquo;. The next heading is: &ldquo;Dublin's Different.&rdquo; The author is somebody called Stuart Rose.  I do not propose to read all the article.  Although it is quite short, I will not waste the time of the House.  It starts rather deceptively by describing the arrival of this person in Dublin by air.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After the rather squalid hodgepodge of one-storey, temporary shacks that serve as administration buildings at the great British airports, like Heathrow and Northolt, it was pleasurably shocking to see, as our transport winged into the Dublin field, a handsome modernistic structure rising out of the incredible green sward.  Here, I thought, was a splendid monument to the young Irish Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a very deceptive start.  The article goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Somewhat less pleasurable was my discovery, as we neared the ground that no concrete or tarmac runway had as yet been built to mar the sodden emerald turf.  It was as if the Government of Éire had sagely deliberated to impress the airborne traveller at all costs, even if it killed him a minute or two later.  It is no less than fair to add that a single airstrip seems now to be under somewhat desultory hand construction.</P>
    <P>The thing that most impresses the traveller on first visiting Éire is the enormous amount of handpower that appears to be needed to keep that country creaking along.  Jolting cityward in an ancient and filthy taxi, I observed on every side men, and women, too, engaged at purely <Col N="559" /> manual tasks, cutting turf in the fields ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as my geographical knowledge of County Dublin goes&mdash;of course coming from Cork I admit that I do not know everything about Dublin&mdash;I do not think any turf is cut within 20 miles of Collinstown.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Twilight had commenced to settle in as my driver tooled tortuously through the narrow streets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is on the way from Collinstown, mark you.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We debouched presently into one of the city's great squares and came to an abrupt stop while all about us swelled a plaintive bawling reminiscent of Chicago's stockyards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think he must have meant Senator Counihan's cattle trade.  At any rate, he gives a graphic description of being held up in one of the city's squares, apparently pursued by millions of Senator Counihan's cattle.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The next day, a Wednesday, I had business in a nearby city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He does not name the city and again he gives a description of being held up along the Dublin streets by cattle. He finally arrives at this city, which he does not name, and he says, although it is supposed to be only a short distance, that the trip took three hoars.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we arrived at the city of our destination, beef on the hoof jammed the streets.  We made our laborious way to the Munster and Leinster Bank.  When I entered to cash a traveller's cheque I found the marble floor knee-deep in straw.  I inquired the significance of this, guessing it to be some rite from an ancient harvest festival.  &lsquo;Oh, no, sir,&rsquo; answered a bank attendant. &lsquo;You see, we're very busy of a market day and with the doors openin' and shuttin', some of the beasts are bound to get in.  Sure and we can't have the poor creatures slippin' and breakin' their legs on the stone floor.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it would be no harm if the Minister drew the attention of our representatives in America to articles of <Col N="560" /> this kind for appropriate action.  I am not casting any blame on our representatives in America for not having already spotted this because I do not think they could possibly be expected to read every magazine published in America where, I think, there are more magazines and papers published than in any other part of the world.  I do think, however, that it would not be outside the bounds of possibility&mdash;and I think, financially, this State could afford it&mdash;to provide that all our legations and consulates should subscribe to a Press-cutting agency.  Then anything connected with Ireland would be supplied to them by that Press-cutting agency and they would be able to deal with what is best described as stupid, ignorant stories like this as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In the time spent during the last two days discussing this Bill we travelled pretty widely.  I do not propose, in reply, to cover the whole field of Government activities to which Senators adverted in their speeches.  It would simply be impossible to do so.  All I can do is to promise to call the attention of the various Ministers concerned to the points made by Senators during the course of the debate.  There are just one or two matters that come within the purview of my own Department to which I should like to refer.  First of all, immediately after I had announced that the Government were going to make an amending agreement with the British Government on income-tax, Senator Sweetman spoke.  He had not much time to study my statement and it would have been just as well if he had taken time to study the statement and consulted with others about the matters contained in it.  Three or four of the statements he made were inaccurate. Lest they mislead anybody, I want to make quite clear that the British legislation does not affect dividends paid before February, 1946. That is in accordance with Section 52 of the British Finance Act, 1945.  Normally, therefore, the first year specifically affected, for Irish tax parposes, is 1947-8, not the beginning of 1945, as Senator Sweetman stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish assessment will be confined <Col N="561" /> to the amount of the net dividend received from the company, together with the amount of the British repayment. This applies to both preference and ordinary dividends.  Further, the repayment of the British tax at the full rate deducted will, it is understood, be made up to and including 1947-48 in respect of ordinary as well as preference dividends and will not be confined, as Senator Sweetman seemed to think, to preference dividends.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to a leading article which appeared in the Evening <i>Herald</i> and which seemed to have been based on a letter which appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> that morning, or the day before, dealing with relief supplies for Poland.  If Senator Duffy asked me for some bread and I were to say: &ldquo;Wait until next September and you will get bread&rdquo;, the Senator would not be very grateful.  He would point out that there was a difference between giving bread now and giving it next September.  The relation between our supplies to Poland and that statement by the British Minister for Food, that he is arranging to receive supplies of food from Poland, should be obvious to anybody who can read.  I referred to the supplies sent to Poland last year, not the supplies which we are sending this year.  The supplies of beef were sent in December, 1946. The bacon supply was shipped in August, 1946.  Any other goods sent to Poland had been sent prior to that.</P>
    <P>The British Minister for Food recently announced that they are to make arrangemens to get food from Poland in the future.  All I can say about that is that I hope it is true and that the Polish people will be able to spare food for export in order to buy things which they badly need.  This story is the same as I had to deal with last year&mdash;the canard by the <i>Sunday Independent</i> that the chocolates we got from Holland were made from Irish sugar.  Of course the facts were that, immediately after the liberation of Holland, we made an allocation of sugar to the Dutch people.  They were grateful for it and we were very glad to be able to give it to them.  A couple of years afterwards, the Dutch got into <Col N="562" /> a situation in which they were able to make chocolate from their own sugar, or sugar made elsewhere, and sell it to us.  We were very glad to get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Polish position is much on the same lines.  I hope the Polish people will get on their feet as the people of Holland did and be able to re-establish the traditional export trade in food which they had prior to the war.  I got notice that one question would be raised in this debate.  If, instead of ranging over very wide ground.  Senators would give me notice of a few subjects which could be debated and replied to in a reasonable way, it would be more satisfactory.  I received notice from Senator Hayes that he proposed to raise the question of the Folklore Commission and ask what generally we proposed to do about it.  The Folklore Commission has been in operation since about 1931.  It is not the responsibility of my Department but I have to deal with it when propositions come up respecting it from time to time from the Department of Education.  It first received a Government grant, amounting to £500, about 1930-31.  For the following three-years it received £500 per year.  Then I notice that the amount went down to £300 and came up to £800.  In 1935-36, it went up to £3,250 and remained about that level until 1945-46, with the exception of a couple of years.  In 1945-46, the grant was increased to £6,250.  That sum is again made available for the commission this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true; it was transformed into the Folklore Commission. The figures are as I have given them.  Senator Hayes suggested that the Folklore Commission should do certain work in Scotland and Wales. As a matter of fact, a representative of the Folklore Commission has been doing collection work in the western <Col N="563" /> islands of Scotland during the past 12 months or thereabouts.  I think that everybody is interested in getting oral traditions collected before they are in danger of disappearing.  I am sure that the Department of Education will give favourable consideration to any propositions which the Folklore Commission may put forward.</P>
      <P>Before he sat down, Senator Duffy asked what was the purpose of the Government in sending representatives to the Paris Conference.  The purpose of the Government in sending representatives to the conference was to do what we could to promote a plan for the economic recovery and development of Europe.  Everybody at that conference, from the chairman, the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, down, agreed that that was the purpose of the conference and that no political objectives were to be achieved in Paris.  All the time was spent in discussing how best the economic recovery of Europe could be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One rather large question referred to by a number of Deputies is the question of pensions for ex-national teachers.  The Senators who referred to the matter spoke as if that were the only pension problem involved.  As a matter of fact the ex-national teacher pensioners are only a small fraction of the total number of pensioners who are pensioned as a reward for service, that is, as against the ordinary social security pensioners.  What I call social security pensioners&mdash;old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans, and so forth&mdash;have already been dealt with.  They have got various additions since the beginning of the war.  The lowest any of them got is about 50 per cent. and they range from that up to several hundred per cent.  Apart from that security group of pensioners, we have the various classes of State servants&mdash;of people who rendered service to the State for which there was a contract to give them a pension.  There are two groups of civil servants.  One group is not pensionable and the members of it are supposed to make their own savings to take care, in full, of their old age. Another group pays a portion of its <Col N="564" /> salaries in order to provide a pension upon retirement.  Even that group is again split into two.  There are pensioners whose pension had some relation to the cost of living at the time of retiral and pensions which had no relation at all to the cost of living but were merely fixed sums to be paid upon retiral no matter what way the cost of living stood.</P>
    <P>Recently, I introduced into the Dáil a Bill which will provide that, in the type of pension case which was related to a cost of living at retiral, pensions which were held down in amount owing to the operation of the Standstill Order will be increased to the standard rate of 270 which, as Senators will remember, was the figure, upon which the salaries of civil servants were recently consolidated.  Apart from that group of pensioners the Government have not done, nor have they undertaken to do, anything for any other group which are paid not a social security pension but a pension which was a portion of deferred pay or which was a reward for service.  Senators, I am sure, will agree that if we depart from that particular type of pensioner and if we are to guarantee to other classes of pensioners that their pensions will, in all cases, have the same purchasing power as at the time in which the service was rendered we are taking a line of action that may have very big consequences in the future.  There is no pension awarded for service which was at any time, or under any circumstances, guaranteed to give any stated standard of living.  The pension was contracted to be paid in terms of pounds&mdash;not in terms of wheat, butter, eggs or gold. If we are to depart from that particular system of rewarding for service we will be undertaking something which, under present circumstances, I do not know where it would lead.  We have, during these last, six months, and we have been discussing, here for the last few days legislation to increase the awards for service to existing State servants.  That was done not merely for the purpose of compensating for the increase in the cost of living but to ensure that the civil servants we have, the Police officers, the Army officers, and all the other officers of State we have been dealing with <Col N="565" /> recently, would continue to give the people the service they undertook to give and that they would be enabled to carry out their duties.  The other type of pensioners, Ministerial pensioners, and any other type of pensioners, granted sums for reward for service have not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senators Baxter, Counihan and McGee referred to agricultural and industrial production.  I wish Senator Baxter would spend half the energy on encouraging the farmers to carry out the ordinary advice of the Department of Agriculture that he spends on calling upon the Government to produce what he calls &ldquo;a long-term policy&rdquo;.  The only long-term policy for agriculture is the policy that has been there since the time of Adam and Eve, that is, if we want food from the land we must till the land, and if our population is increasing we must get more from the land.  Everything the Department of Agriculture can do in the line of giving advice to the farmers and amending that advice as farming technique improves has been done, but the pity of it is&mdash;perhaps, with our history, it is inevitable&mdash;that the advice that is given and that should be taken is not accepted and is not put into operation with the promptitude that it should.  There are some things which should be obvious to our farmers.  One of the things most apparent to strangers coming in here is that we should cut the weeds and cut them early.  It would add considerably to our output if we did that, but even the best farmers seem to slip up in some years.  I only mention that as a small point, as I do not intend to go into the whole question of agricultural or industrial production, or the wider aspects of our national economy, at this stage.  All I can promise to do, in relation to the various matters mentioned, is to bring them to the attention of the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>If Senators give a few minutes' thought to this recommendation, they will probably agree that it should be sent to the Dáil.  This is a Bill to confirm an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order made on the 28th January last and which came into force on the 29th January, 1947, the following day.  It imposes an ad valorem duty of 37½ per cent. on all kinds of combs, for use or for ornament, subject to the reservation that, if imported from countries of the British Empire, they will be subject only to a 25 per cent. duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the Order the usual licencing provision, which is rather peculiarly worded.  It says that the Minister may authorise &ldquo;a particular person&rdquo; to import combs without paying the duty.  I do not know if the <Col N="567" /> words &ldquo;a particular person&rdquo; have any special significance, but if so I object very strongly to any provision in an Act or Order that a Minister may authorise a particular person to import goods free of duty if every other importer must pay the duty.  However, that is not the main purpose of the recommendation.</P>
    <P>This Order was made under the authority of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  The word &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo; in this connotation has a meaning quite distinct from the usual meaning we associate with it in our present legislation.  At present, we have Emergency Powers Orders made under an Act passed into law at the outbreak of the European war in 1939.  That is a totally different connotation from that in the 1932 Act, which was passed seven years before the outbreak of the war.  It is interesting to look at the 1932 Act.  So long as I can remember, there has always been a short cut in Ireland for all our grievances.  Resolutions used to be passed years ago, calling on the old Irish Party &ldquo;to remedy our grievances by a one-clause Act.&rdquo;  This is a one-clause Act.  The only effective clause in it provides that the Execctive Council, may, if and when they think proper, do by Order all or any of the things set out in paragraphs (a) to (j) in the first sub-section of that section.  The second sub-section provides that an Order made under sub-section (1) shall continue in force for eight months and shall then expire, unless in the meantime it is given statutory effect by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give permanent statutory effect to this Order.  It is interesting to go back to the origin of the 1932 Act.  It was enacted on the 23rd July, 1932.  A week earlier the British Government had imposed a tariff on cattle, dairy produce and agricultural produce imported into Britain from this country and our Bill was very largely retaliatory.  The economy of the country was in jeopardy and the Government, in July, 1932, came to both Houses and asked for a measure to which there was no bounds, except the reservation I have just mentioned that they had to come <Col N="568" /> back with their Order within eight months to get a confirming Bill if the Order were to live.  When the Bill was going through both Houses very important statements were made concerning it, although reading the debates now one feels that the attention of Deputies and Senators was given very much more to the underlying motive than to the actual text of the Bill.  Little was said about the Bill.  A good deal was said in bitterness and anger about the things that led up to it.  There were some statements made which indicate what was in the mind of the Government at the time and what influenced both Houses in giving their approval to the measure.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 14th July, 1932, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. MacEntee, made the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If another State seeks to interfere with our trade, to attack our industries, we shall defend them....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Bear these words in mind&mdash;if somebody is attacking our industries, we will defend them&mdash;and this is the machinery, this is the instrument which was provided by the Oireaehtas for the defence of our industries in 1932.  Obviously, it was not intended as a permanent measure.  It was intended as a defensive measure in the midst of a crisis.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the Seanad on the 18th July of that year, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Connolly, a member of the House, made this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The clauses of this Bill give a considerable amount of power to the Executive to act, and to impose such tariffs as they may think it desirable to impose, in view of the economic position that will inevitably be created by opposition on the part of the British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, note the grounds on which the enactment of the Bill was sought&mdash;in view, as the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said, &ldquo;of the economic position that will inevitably be created by opposition on the part of the British&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>But the matter was put very much more clearly by Mr. MacEntee who, <Col N="569" /> when replying to a question in the Dáil on the 15th July, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not the desire of the Government that this Bill should remain in force one moment longer than is necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was an undertaking, and I think something similar was said in this House by the Taoiseauh in relation to the duration of the emergency legislation which was being enacted in 1932&mdash;&ldquo;Give us this measure; give it to us urgently so that we can cope with this menace to our economy.  Once that menace passes we can see whether we require this legislation or not.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The menace passed in 1938, nine years ago, and an agreement was made with the British, the very thing that was needed to get rid of the emergency legislation of 1932.  The agreement was made.  The British menace passed and the Act of 1932, automatically, should have been repealed or should have ceased to exist in 1938.  But 15 years after this emergency legislation became law we are now presented with an Order made under that Act imposing a tariff on combs.  It may not be a very important economic question whether or not there is a tariff on combs although I understand from the Minister's statement on the last occasion that £61,000 worth of these articles were imported last year, but what influenced me largely in putting down this recommendation was the fact that complaints had been made to me that this Order, made last January, is imposing undeserved hardship on a large section of the community.  I am not entitled to make the case that the firm or firms making plastic combs in this country are charging unreasonable prices.  I do not know whether they are or not.</P>
    <P>No complaint has been made to me that the prices were unreasonable but the complaint has been made that the ordinary person who buys a fine comb wants an ivory comb and not a plastic comb and that the ivory comb is affected by this Order as well as the plastic comb although we do not make ivory combs and do not intend to make them.  I have received figures from one firm of importers and it is very interesting to know how the tariff affects the <Col N="570" /> ordinary people.  The import price of an ivory comb is 1/-.  The wholesale price would be 1/3 and the retail price 1/11.  That refers to one particular comb of particular dimensions.  The price will vary with the size.  That refers to a particular comb which was on sale last January.  When 25 per cent. is added, if the comb comes from Great Britain, that is, if it gets the Imperial preference, the import price becomes 1/3, the wholesale price 1/7, and the retail price 2/6, but if it comes from outside the Imperial circle, the tariff is 37½ per cent. which means an import price of 1/5, a wholesale price of 1/10 and a retail price of 2/9 for a comb which could have been imported into this country at 1/- last January.</P>
    <P>There is a certain firm, in which I have no interest and about whose business I know nothing beyond the fact that some members of the company know me and wrote me a letter in ths matter but I should like to read for the House what the proprietor of this firm has said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A firm in County Dublin is making very nice plastic combs and deserves the protection they received in the recent tax.  The matter of importance, however, is that the customs demand a similar tax on the ivory tooth combs.  These are not made in Éire.  The above firm makes a substitute, but of all household items nothing will take the place of a real ivory comb.  Dublin makers state in their own interest that the substitute is just as good as the ivory comb.  Our experience of nearly half a century as importers of these items shows that there can be no substitute.  Any housewife will confirm this.  The imposition of a tax makes no difference to us.  We simply levy the tax on the combs. If the tax is doubled we must still import, but the poorest person will still give any price for the ivory.  It is in the interests of the latter that we ask you to have this tax abolished.  The victims are chiefly the poorer classes, and, of course, they are not aware of the injustice done to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that what actually is happening is that the Minister uses this 15 year <Col N="571" /> old machinery to impose a tariff on combs.  He is not keeping out the ivory comb&mdash;but he is making the poorest people pay 2/9 for an article for which they paid 1/11 last January. I suggest that this thing is entirely an outrage.  I ask Senators to bear in mind that the next item on the Order Paper is a Bill which authorises the Minister for Health to make regulations which will have the effect of sending people to jail if they do not submit their children for school medical inspection. People are now to be made to pay 2/9 for a comb for which they paid 1/11 before this Order was made.  I suggest to members of the House, irrespective of the side on which they sit, that this thing is an outrage.  It is not protecting the plastic comb which is the only comb made in this country. Here is a wholesaler writing to me that he must go on buying the imported ivory comb because the public demand it.  What is happening is that the public are just being asked to pay 10d. more than they would have to pay if there was no tariff put on the comb. The 10d. is divided between the Minister for Finance, the wholesaler, and the retailer.</P>
    <P>I would urge strongly that this Bill be given a life of 17 months and that, at the end of the 17 months, the Order should lapse.  I would prefer that it lapsed now.  I am perfectly willing to say to the Minister that he can have it for 17 months.  In that time he can reconsider the position.  I hope that in the meantime the whole structure of the Act of 1932 is going to be examined.  I think it is an abominable thing, 15 years after this emergency Act was passed into law, that it should still be used for the purpose of making emergency Orders in relation to all kinds of things.  I suggest that if we retain this Act and operate it to make these emergency Orders that we are defeating the whole purpose of the Finance Act, of budgetary discussions and of everything else.  What is the purpose of the Finance Act and of the legislation which the Minister for Finance brings in here annually if, four months before the Budget, a Minister can make an Order in his office automatically <Col N="572" /> imposing a new duty on some imported articles which then becomes operative?  There is no sense in having a Finance Act or in having the pretence of control by the Houses of the Oireachtas over revenue, expenditure and income if, at any time he likes, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other Minister, can sit down in his office and make an Order imposing a duty which may bring him in thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds without having to consult anybody, and without having to come to either House of the Oireachtas until the thing has been in operation for eight months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply amazed to find Senator Duffy, or any man supposed to be a representative of labour interests here, taking the line that he-has taken in connection with this measure.  Over the last ten or 15 years we have been arguing the question of protection here.  Now and again we have found somebody to come and point out where the Government policy was wrong in connection with the protection of native industry, but I think this is about the first time that we have found a man who poses as the standard bearer of the labour cause in this House to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator tell me what native industry there is in ivory combs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain to the Senator if he will give me a quarter of the time that he took when speaking. The Senator comes along and elaborates on this question of ivory combs. I have heard of elephants' teeth and things of that kind, but Senator Duffy must know that the term ivory comb-is a trade name and that the comb is no more ivory than it is gold.  If we were to take up the attitude that Senator Duffy suggests we should take <Col N="573" /> in connection with this particular item then we could take exactly the same attitude with regard to practically every other article of Irish manufacture. Is Senator Duffy going to be consistent and say that if he can produce a wholesaler who says that the shoes that are manufactured in Clonmel or Dundalk are not meeting the requirements of his customers&mdash;that the customers are prepared to pay the price on the imported shoes whether they come from England, America or any other country&mdash;that we should follow his advice?</P>
      <P>I believe that there are plenty of people in the country at the present time who do not bother very much about price and have got some kind of a bee in their bonnet for articles which are manufactured in America, England, China or Japan.  They would be prepared to pay the price for them, because they will say that the article suits them better.  But are we going to be parties to that kind of thing to the detriment of Irish industry and Irish workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that you may find a small number of women in the country who will not buy Irish-made combs as long as they can get imported ones. Are we going to accommodate them to the point of allowing these combs in free of duty to the detriment, as I say, of Irish workers, and I say, deliberately, to the detriment of Irish workers?  We have a factory here which has not been very long started. It happens to be in my own county.  I would take the same line if it were in any other county, because it is the line that we have pursued here ever since the start of the drive for the development of Irish industry.  Are we going to make it easy for some people to say to themselves: &ldquo;There is something in this; we are familiar with this name, ivory combs, for a long time; there must be some good in them because our grandmothers used them.&rdquo;? They did, because they could get nothing else.  Thank God, we have a Fianna Fáil Government now, and we have the situation whereby people can get practically anything they want in the way of Irish manufacture.  If these articles are not quite as good as the imported articles I say that we should <Col N="574" /> still protect Irish industries, no matter what Senator Duffy may say on the-matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to stress the personal note too strongly, but I do feel rather gratified that my opposition to the taking of all Stages of this Bill last week has brought forth the statement made by Senator Daffy which, may I say, has not been countered in any way by anything that Senator Quirke has said.  It shows-however that this is a matter which merits debate and examination.  I feel greatly gratified, too, that on this subject I have enlisted the support of such an able and industrious colleague as Senator Duffy.  He has the ability and the industry to carry out research into past legislation, which I do not say I am incapable of, but which I am rather reluctant to do unless I have to do it; if I can get somebody else to do it so much the better.  I do not want to widen this into a general debate on our whole tariff policy, but I do repeat, and I feel every justification for repeating, and Senator Duffy's statement affords that justification, that I regard this imposition of duties, largely in the dark, with the gravest suspicion and I shall continue to do it in spite of the histrionic patriotism and declamation in which Senator Quirke indulges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want only certain limited information with regard to this duty.  I want to know if the provisions of the Bill that we passed about a year ago which enabled the Minister to draw up specifications with regard to home-manufactured articles, has been applied in the case of the output of these comb factories. If we put industries in a privileged position and secure them against outside competition and remove all the checks that habitually protect the public in the economy of free enterprise, we are entitled to know what quality of goods they are making. That is why I ask if this Bill to enable the Minister to impose specifications and to ensure to a certain extent a standard of quality in the case of home-manufactured articles has been applied in this case.  I would not ask the Minister to say if it has been applied in every case, because he is not in charge of the Department.  I gave notice, however, that I would ask <Col N="575" /> him if it has been applied in this case.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy has shown, and Senator Quirke has reinforced the implications of his argument, that this sort of thing brings us down to a hair-shirt policy.  I am not opposed to safeguards for the protection of any local industry.  I am associated with local industries myself where the public is fully safeguarded.  I am only asking if the public is safeguarded in a case like this, because it is against decent living that this hair-shirt restriction of variety in the use of the ordinary things of life should be imposed unless there is a strong case made for it.  I have heard no case here.  We are told that a certain class of comb is made with which to comb your hair.  I suppose it will come.</P>
    <P>It has got to be used, not in preference to others, but presumably under favoured conditions.  If you want other combs, you must pay accordingly. Generally, I call that a hair-shirt policy.  It is hard to deal with this in general terms.  If before this industry was set up there had been something in the nature of a tariff commission inquiry, where the parties were heard and there had been an examination of the whole problem, it would be a different matter.  In this case, in abuse of earlier legislation, which Senator Duffy showed was passed for a special purpose, this duty is imposed.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement, I should like to ask what practical steps will be taken to ensure efficiency in this industry and to control prices.  I am not making any suggestion that it is not highly efficient and does not work on a narrow margin of profit.  But what actual steps does the Minister propose to take to ensure that it is efficient and that its profits are not more than would be reasonable in relation to the capital involved.  We are entitled to know that in the case of a protected industry.  That question would never be asked in a state of free competition; competition would supply the answer; but, where there is protection, we should know that.  I ask the Minister to indicate, if he can, what protection the public is afforded in the case of this special industry against inefficiency and excessive profits. <Col N="576" /> I also ask what steps the Minister has taken to ensure that the prices will be comparable to the prices of similar articles made in Great Britain. We have a High Commissioner in Great Britain and similar articles could be obtained.  If, after examination, the articles are deemed to be similar, then the prices are more or less kept in line.  Is something of that kind being done?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there is every hope for an export trade but there was difficulty in getting import licences to certain countries.  I am entitled to ask into what countries did we seek export and were refused import licences.  The hope of export is one of the redeeming features of this high protection policy.  If we are able to get export we are able to get output.  If we are able to get output, we are able to use the latest machinery; we are able to get mass production methods; and we are then able to reduce prices.  As export is hoped for and contemplated, I ask the Minister to say where we have found import difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words before the Minister speaks in view of the statement of Senator Quirke, because I think the House should not discuss the matter in that atmosphere.  There is no use in Senator Quirke coming along here and wrapping the green flag round him. That always makes one suspicious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It always makes one suspicious that there is something being hidden.  I think there is something being hidden in this case.  I made no aspersion on a tariff policy. I suggested that this was the wrong way to implement it, namely, under an Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act passed in 1932, which precludes the Houses of the Oireachtas from having a proper discussion such as they could have on a Finance Bill if <Col N="577" /> tariffs were imposed in the ordinary way.  I should like to see it done in a different way.  I do not like this method.  In regard to the Irish workers who are involved, I observe that Senator Quirke did not tell us how many workers were involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter if there were only two.  The fact is that the factory in Nenagh has only been in production for a matter of weeks. Evidently, we must knock it on the head to oblige Senator Duffy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was only one factory in existence, the one in Dublin, when the tariff was put on.  Apparently the method is to put the tariff on first and then start the factory.  There was a factory started in Dublin before the tariff went on.  The Minister's statement on the last occasion was that because of the large quantity of these commodities imported last year, which imperilled the Dublin factory, the tariff was put on.  That is the case that was made.  Might I point out &mdash;and I think it must weigh with any person who has an honest approach to the subject&mdash;that when we place a tariff, as we have, of 5d. on this article, the consumer is paying 10d.?  The retail price of the article to which I refer, prior to January, was 11d.  The present retail price is 2/9, but there is only 5d. duty in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator make it quite clear that the combs to which he is referring now are imported combs and not those manufactured here, and that the prices of these combs have no relation to the prices of the combs manufactured here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator had been listening, he would have heard me read a letter in which the importer said that the combs made in Dublin were selling at competitive prices&mdash;not even a suggestion of overcharging.  The case being made by these people&mdash;and I want to remind Senator Hawkins that <Col N="578" /> this is a firm in Galway, who are not dealing with wealthy people in Dublin; they are wholesalers who have been importing these articles for 50 years and selling them in hucksters' shops in Clifden, Oughterard, Tuam, Loughrea and all over the West of Ireland &mdash;is that the country woman who goes into the huckster shop still insists on buying the ivory comb; in other words, the comb they are importing.  I have a further letter, from them, because I did not take this story at its face value &mdash;I pursued it&mdash;and their suggestion is that, if the duty were removed from all ivory combs costing less than 12/- per dozen, or 1/- each, it would meet the position of the public with small incomes and leave the better-quality article a luxury item.</P>
      <P>Do not forget that these people in making the suggestion are working against their own interests, because the very fact that there is a duty on the comb makes it more expensive, and, if their rate of profit is still 25 per cent., there is a larger cash income because of the duty.  But they are very decent people who are most anxious that the ordinary people who insist on having an ivory comb&mdash;and it is an ivory comb, with all respect to Senator Quirke&mdash;should get it at a reasonable price.  They consider that combs at 1/- each should not be subject to duty and their contention all the time is that it will not interfere with the production of combs in the Irish factories. I want to get that established.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that this kind of comb is demanded in the West of Ireland, in the rural districts and small towns, and the people will get it, whatever they pay for it.  The fact that you put a tariff on it does not sell one Irish-made comb.  The people will still pay the additional price for the imported article and all you are doing is collecting revenue from them, and giving the wholesalers and retailers a bigger profit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank God for that.  On the previous occasion, Senator Hearne made the point that he saw combs being imported at ½d. each.  A duty of 37½ per cent. will not bring this price up to 6d., which is the lowest priced comb made in plastic in Dublin or in England.  I went to Woolworth's yesterday and the cheapest comb there is 9d., so that if Senator Hearne saw them being imported at ½d. each, behind this tariff wall, somebody has been making a fortune by putting the price up to 9d.</P>
      <P>I suggest that Senator Quirke might take stock of the situation and instead of making these flippant speeches ought to get down seriously to the problem involved.  There are really two problems involved in this&mdash;one, the importation of an article which the people insist on getting and which, so far as I can see, no tariff will keep out; and the other, the method of levying the duty, my suggestion being that, if we want to place a tariff on a particular commodity, it should be done in the Finance Act and not under an Emergency Imposition of Duties Order.</P>

      <P>It is with considerable timidity that I stand up to face the new Duffy-Keane Party and my timidity is considerably increased by the danger that I might be thought to be on the same side as Senator Quirke, with whose remarks I equally disagree.  It seems to me that this is much ado about extremely little.  I do not think the issue of the method of applying the tariff arises here, but it is a fact that, since 1932, practically all tariffs have been imposed by this method and debated eight or nine months later.  If you intend to encourage a local industry, be careful, before you put a tariff on, to see that it is not swamped by enormous imports.  I cannot see any other method than a tariff which can be put on quickly.  I do not think it is ideal and, for my part, I think there ought to be a tariff commission and an investigation after these emergency tariffs have been put on, but I do not believe for one moment that you can ever provide any kind of adequate protection on the principle of holding a public, or even a semi-public, inquiry first, because everybody in the trade would import and, if it is a small industry like combs, and conditions were normal, three or four years' supplies would be imported and the thing would be impossible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is a tariff or a quota order, all I am saying is that I cannot see any way by which you can avoid dealing with it on the basis of the present practice.  I am in favour of an inquiry.  Some of these matters are not inquired into as well as they ought to be and I agree with Senator Sir John Keane in so far as he thinks that a statement such as that in the letter to Senator Duffy is something which should be inquired into. I completely disagree when he says it should be inquired into first.  It could not be written until after the tariff was put on, because it could not have happened, and it is only with the experience you get in the first three to six months that it would be possible to have an inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> When you come to this particular duty, I know very little about it.  I imagine if all Senator Duffy wants is that all real, guaranteed ivory combs costing less than 1/- should come in free, the Minister could agree to it, because you cannot get one anywhere. What he presumably means is a fine-tooth comb.  That has a special use and it is important for children.  The Minister ought to find out if this new industry is providing a really suitable and adequate substitute, apart from the medical point of view, because it is really, in the first instance, a medical matter.  If the Government are satisfied, then I do not think it matters very much if a certain number are imported and people are willing to pay the price.  If they are not able to produce a suitable substitute, the Minister should introduce an amendment so as to make some provision for that useful article.  The sum total is negligible from a retail business point of view, but it could be extremely important.</P>
    <P>All that Senator Duffy is entitled to is an assurance that the Minister will satisy himself that the substitute is, from a medical point of view, satisfactory and, if it is not, he will take steps to see that importation is facilitated. From my knowledge, I have no doubt that the ordinary combs that are being made are reasonably good and I have not heard complaints of the price.  I may say, incidentally, that I am rather surprised to see Senator Duffy falling into the quite common mistake that, because articles are at a certain price at Woolworth's, nobody else has them any cheaper.  That is a complete fallacy.  The Minister should see if the facts are as stated, but to say that we should cease to provide reasonable protection for an industry because a certain position exists seems to me to be absurd.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about exports. I happen to be connected with an industry that has exported for years and its only grievance is that it cannot get enough material to resume its export trade.  The idea that you can start a new industry and, as Senator Sir John Keane seems to think, produce in large quantities and export, is the <Col N="582" /> wrong way round.  You have to start, to instal your machinery, and to produce in bulk and then gradually work up your export trade.  There may be a case for not having tariffs.  If you are to have tariffs and you wish to encourage smaller industries of this kind, there will have to be some machinery by which you will put on the tariff.  If you put on the tariff too soon in the case of some industries, it might be unhealthy.  You have to watch carefully, so that your smaller industries are not swamped.  In such circumstances you have to act promptly, because without some such prompt action I do not see how it can be done.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Douglas has explained the position satisfactorily and, taken as an answer to Senator Duffy, I do not know whether that Senator is quite satisfied.  It is the easiest thing in the world to come here and make the allegation that there is overcharging and that Irish manufacturers are little better than gangsters.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that the Senator made that statement.  We are accustomed to this kind of propaganda generally and, whether the Senator likes it or not, he will find himself placed in the company of those people who claim that a large number of Irish manufacturers are out simply to exploit the public.  The fact that £64,000 worth of combs came into this country last year, according to the evidence supplied to me, as against some £10,000 or £12,000 worth pre-war, would seem to indicate that perhaps the importers of these combs are doing a pretty good business.  We have to make up our minds whether we are going to stand by the importers or the manufacturers&mdash;whether, on the one hand, we will favour the interests of those who are in the distribution of the foreign product, a thing we have been up against all the time under this tariff policy, or, on the other hand, whether we will pursue the policy of giving employment here by providing the manufactured commodities for our own needs as far as possible.  We cannot reverse engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> We cannot do what Senator Duffy has suggested.  Even for the first four months of the present year some £10,000 worth of combs was imported and, were it not that this duty was imposed early in the year, I believe that not alone would these industries not be making progress, but they would have to pay off their hands so far as this work is concerned and possibly have to close down.  That was the position with which they were faced.  I said on the Second Reading that the duty was imposed in the first instance in consideration of the fact that the combs to be produced here would be sold at prices not exceeding those for similar combs in Great Britain; also, that the manufacturers will have to maintain equal standards of efficiency in so far as these can be secured.</P>
    <P>The Government have no intention &mdash;and the Minister for Industry and Commerce has frequently emphasised their position&mdash;of regarding the protection policy as a hothouse plant, as he described it early this year.  They believe that in the initial stages protection must be given.  It may be given by way of tariffs or by limiting imports, but, after a certain time, particularly with the opportunities that Irish manufacturers now have&mdash; they have had experience of the business and are not embarking in it for the first time&mdash;with the scarcity of goods that there is in the world, the scarcity of manufactured articles, the high prices they are fetching and the fact that demands cannot be satisfied, one would expect them to become reasonably efficient.</P>
    <P>All these things were referred to by the Minister for Industry and Commerce some months ago in a speech in Waterford in which he emphasised that, except for the steps that have to be taken in the initial stages to set up an industry&mdash;he felt strongly and he was speaking with the full authority of the Government&mdash;after a certain period, with the opportunities that now present themselves, our manufacturers ought to be able to make themselves reasonably efficient as compared with manufacturers in countries similarly circumstanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> The line that has been taken all along is that prices here should not exceed prices in Great Britain.  The Minister emphasised that the cost of production here and our general standards of efficiency also should certainly not place us in an unfavourable position or leave our consumers open to be exploited by reason of the fact that our manufacturers were not prepared to have the same standards of efficiency as in Great Britain.  An undertaking to that effect has been given and, if that undertaking is not observed, let somebody come along and make a complaint. There is a special branch in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Neither the Tánaiste nor I can investigate this matter.  Senator Duffy cannot investigate it.  If consumers or distributors have a grievance with regard to price, let them make their complaints in the ordinary way.  We cannot go into the question of prices here.  Even if all the information were at the disposal of the Senator and myself we are not in a position, I suggest, to give judgment as to the merits of the case.  You require a body like the officials of the Prices Branch, who are specially trained in this work and who have been in the habit of examining records and the accounts of these companies, to go into all these matters.  I simply say that these undertakings have been given and if they are not carried out, the Prices Branch of the Department can go into this whole matter very carefully.  According to the information I have here regarding prices, which I would make public were it not for the fact that there is only one company actually manufacturing at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Nenagh company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It has got into production only now.  The retail prices would be very considerably under the prices that Senator Duffy has mentioned. Since the tariff was put on this company, as well as reducing prices in some cases, has certainly adhered to its promise to the Department not to increase prices above the English level. In addition, they have increased the <Col N="585" /> range of their products.  I am informed by the officers of the Department responsible for the administration of these matters that they are producing at least six types of the fine comb to which Senator Douglas alluded.  I am informed that the articles are being produced in that variety and if they are a substitute, as we are told, for the imported article, I cannot understand why the importers will not change their policy and try to sell the Irish product, for a change, instead of trying to put Irish industrialists into the position of having to close down their business.  Having invested many thousands of pounds to set up a very up-to-date industry, an industry that would be capable actually of developing an export trade, it would really be extraordinary, if we were to force such people to close down.</P>
      <P>If, on the other hand, the argument is that they are not producing a type of comb to satisfy this particular need &mdash;I am informed they are&mdash;or if importers can make the case that the type of comb they want for their clients is not being produced, then let them go and make that case.  Senator Duffy read out a letter but we cannot, in framing legislation of this kind, go on letters.  If the Senator at least had given, as Senator Sir John Keane was kind enough to give, some notice of the matter, while there would not, it is true, have been very much time to investigate it, even at this stage in the legislation, if we found that there was substance in the statements made in the letter, the matter could be made the subject of inquiry by the Prices Branch.  Alternatively, if the firm interested cannot get what they want, then they can make a case to the Minister to allow them to import the product in which they are interested. Presumably they will be able to show that they cannot get it here and the Minister, I am quite sure, will favourably consider their representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I need go into the point as to the particular legislation under which we are proceeding.  As Senator Douglas pointed out, we have been working it now for years.  Section 3 of the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act empowers the Government <Col N="586" /> to revoke any Order previously made under the Act, if the Minister is satisfied, as in this case he would have to be, that a definite undertaking had been given to him.  I should like to say, with reference to Senator Sir John Keane's discourse, that customs duties were suspended to a very large extent during the emergency.  Some 90 of them were suspended.  In addition, the operation of other protective duties on commodities in short supply is modified as circumstances justify by the grant of a duty free licence for specific consignments.</P>
    <P>In the case of many commodities subject to protective duties, licences are issued freely.  It may be said that for all practical purposes, therefore, these duties are suspended also.  It amounts to a suspension of the duty. I have already emphasised that prices have not been increased in this particular case since the duties were imposed. The Prices Branch will look into the undertaking that has been given.  They are in direct touch with this case and any facts that were brought out here, or are communicated to the Department will, of course, be sent along to the officers investigating these matters.</P>
    <P>I think I might be permitted to refer to the statement made by Senator Sir John Keane, with regard to wireless sets, that the ink was scarcely dry on the Order imposing the duty on wireless sets when there was an increase in prices.  I am informed that an increase was made in Britain in March last and this increase was followed by a similar increase here&mdash;roughly, an increase of £2 per set.  The price of the £15 set was increased to 17 guineas.  With regard to the other point Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, the countries which have refused import licences are Denmark and Britain, including&mdash;I do not know whether I should include it&mdash; Northern Ireland.  In the case of Britain and Northern Ireland, the refusal was made verbally to persons who sought import licences supported by <i>pro forma</i> invoices received from the Irish manufacturer.  The letters are on the file and I have read them.  This is not, of course, a reflection on the products of the Irish company but simply means that, for reasons best known to <Col N="587" /> themselves, the authorities in these countries were not prepared to give the necessary import facilities.</P>
    <P>As regards the steps contemplated to ensure the efficiency of the industry, it would not be possible to deal with this matter of plastic combs under the Industrial Research and Standards Act of 1946.  It is not considered that ths matter could be sent to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards for a recommendation as to the formulation of a standard specification or for a test or analysis.  There is such a great variety in types of combs for personal use or adornment, that it would be very difficult indeed to devise tests or analyses which would give us additional information beyond that which is available.  As regards the durability of the article, we, I fear, can only depend on the public, if they find that an article which they have purchased is not up to the standard they expected to try to get a different article on the next occasion.  Some of those articles made from plastic powders have been coming on the market in various degrees of quality and in great variety. It has been claimed for some of them that they are quite durable and will stand a good deal of hard treatment. Personally, I am of opinion that it is extremely difficult, as matters stand in the world to-day, to get combs which would not be easily breakable when subjected to pressure.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are satisfied so far as plastic combs are concerned&mdash;if I may so describe them&mdash; that as regards quality, finish and price they are competitive with those which would be imported, and no complaint has reached the Minister since the duty was imposed in January last as to the quality of the article or the price charged by the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill has not yet been circulated.  When the Tánaiste makes his appearance here in connection with that Bill&mdash;I hope I am not making things unduly troublesome for him in saying this&mdash; the Seanad will have greater scope and, perhaps, wider opportunities for going into many of the questions which I could see Senator Duffy and <Col N="588" /> Senator Sir John Keane would like to raise.</P>

      <P>I cannot give examples at the moment.  This is a matter which has been receiving constant consideration. If the Senator refers to the speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to manufacturers and industrialists and to the advice he has given them, he will see that the Government is doing everything possible to get them to appreciate their duties in this matter.  Of course, we realise that private enterprise in this country may be lacking.  Importing interests and the lack of an industrial tradition, to which Professor Lecky so frequently referred in his writings, may have brought about a condition in which we would not have the initiative which they have in countries with an industrial tradition.  But there is a good deal more initiative now than there was previously.</P>

      <P>The Minister would have saved himself a certain amount of <Col N="589" /> trouble if he had adverted to the fact that I stated on three occasions that there was no suggestion, in relation to this case, of anything in the nature of over-charging.  I read a letter from a firm which handles the products of the manufacturers concerned in which they stated that this firm was conducted on a competitive basis and deserved the protection it received. That was the case made by the firm. It is not the kind of firm the Minister appears to have in mind.  I know members of the firm for many years. They have been Irish-Irelanders and Irish industrialists as long as I remember.  That is their attitude to this day.  They are handling the products of this firm.  The difficulty is that their customers insist on getting something which must be imported.  In the first four months of this year, notwithstanding a tariff of 37½ per cent., there were imports valued at £10,000.  That shows the demand there is for this imported commodity, for which no Irish substitute can be had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Duffy has fallen into an error in connection with this question of the importation of combs.  Those of us who have families know that, during the war, combs could not be procured outside the country and we were dependent on the limited number which were being manufactured here.  It was quite natural to expect that people engaged in the importation of an article of that kind would, immediately there was an opportunuity of making purchases, place an order for as large a quantity <Col N="591" /> as they could possibly get.  The quantity of combs available at the present time bears no relation whatever to the question of whether the people in Connemara or in any other district wish to buy the Irish article as against the imported article.  Those articles were imported because it was felt by the importers that there was a market here for them, and the importers, having these articles on their hands now, must make a case to get rid of them as well as they can.</P>
