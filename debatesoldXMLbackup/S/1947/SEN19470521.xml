    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On the section, I should merely like to say that I do not understand why it is that for work of this nature the Chief Justice should be brought into the Bill, or any judge of the High Court or Circuit Court.  For the work proposed to be done under Section 13&mdash;the work of distributing money and weighing the claims of various people in needy circumstances to grants of a benevolent nature&mdash;judges, as such, do not seem to me to have any particular qualifications.  It seems to me very unfortunate that the Chief Justice should be in a Bill of this kind to do that work, first because I do not know why that particular office&mdash; I am talking of the office rather than of the individual&mdash;should be considered for the work and, secondly, because whatever anybody may say about it the purpose of the Bill is in sub-section (1) of Section 10: that is to say, the Bill is for the purpose of taking a particular matter which is before the courts out of the courts.  I think it is unfortunate that judges should be put into the Bill while, so to speak, the Bill's purpose is to take certain things out of the courts.  In the circumstances, it would seem to me to be beyond the wit of any given chairman to protect the Chief Justice from attack, if there were people who wanted to attack him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say a word about this.  I should like to say at the start that the objection came as a surprise to me the moment it was raised first.  I am not objecting, so to speak, to the basis of it, but I should like to explain that the proposal contained in the section originated in this way: First of all, in the draft Bill that was submitted to us&mdash;we really took it over to implement it&mdash;a judge was mentioned. If the phrase is causing any wonder&mdash;I explained this in the other House, and I do not know if I explained it here&mdash;I should say that the Government action really started by our getting from the representative of the last of the treasurers a proposal for the disposition of the money, and so on.  That proposal was taken around to the surviving members of the Standing Committee of Sinn Féin, and there was a certain amount of agreement reached. It came to us, roughly, in the form of a draft Bill.  My recollection is that in that draft Bill a judge was mentioned as chairman.  That did not seem strange to me because, first of all, this board was getting very wide discretionary powers.  There were only certain directives given in the Bill, and one would like to feel that there would be somebody who would understand the general purposes for which the money was being allotted.  I did not think it strange then to have a judge as chairman of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It occurred to me&mdash;I am afraid I am responsible personally for making the suggestion in the first instance&mdash;that, first of all, it was desirable to have someone who would have a fair acquaintance with the whole movement. I think the Chief Justice would have that.  Secondly, the present Chief Justice was also chairman of the Red Cross Committee and had a certain amount of experience in that line. Consequently, from every point of view he seemed to be a suitable person.  I have to confess that the objections that were raised in the Dáil never occurred to me.  I do not think, however, that they have very much material weight if you examine them fully.  It was objected, I think, in the other House that it was not fair to a judge who might have to consider <Col N="1701" /> whether the Bill itself was unconstitutional, that he should appear to be in any way committed in advance.  It seems to me that there could be no question of that.  If the Chief Justice consented to act in this way it would be on the clear understanding&mdash;that was obviously implied&mdash;that the Bill, when passed, would be constitutional. The Chief Justice in saying: &ldquo;All right, if the Oireachtas passes the Bill, I am willing to function,&rdquo; was simply saying so to convenience the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any knowledge of the work that will be entailed under this Bill knows that it is going to be very onerous work.  It would be very onerous work for the Chief Justice if he took it himself.  The possibility is that he would not find time to do so. As I have said, he was chairman of the Red Cross Committee, and I was fully aware of the amount of time that he gave to that committee.  My own belief was that he would not find time to do this, and that what, in all probability, would be done was that he would nominate some other judge to act in his stead, as is provided for in the section.</P>
    <P>What occurred to me first when I saw a judge mentioned in the draft Bill that came to the Government was that what was being done was to indicate clearly that there is no partisanship in this, and that it is going to be done impartially.  While I am willing to admit that if this matter had originally occurred to me&mdash;that is, that objections were going to be raised in the way in which they were raised&mdash; I would have avoided it, because, I suppose, somebody else could have been got, but I think it would be very unfortunate, once the matter did come before the Oireachtas, if it were changed now, because it would seem to suggest that there was some real foundation in the objections that were made.  I do not see any real objection.  It is desirable to have someone who would know the law and who would generally direct the committee so as to keep in line with the intentions of the Bill. Then there is the feeling that you have an impartial chairman, and next you have the advantage of having a person of judicial mind as chairman.  Since <Col N="1702" /> we have gone so far, I think that no real objection can be taken to the fact that the Chief Justice is to be chairman, and I would ask the Seanad to accept it on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the Taoiseach that I think he is quite misguided when he says that there is no real foundation for this objection. There is very real foundation for it and the Taoiseach's speech indicates that. I have not in mind the personality of the Chief Justice at all.  I have exactly the same interest in the preservation of the courts as the Taoiseach has. Every member of this House is entitled to take any step that seems good to him to see that the courts are kept in the position in which they ought to be kept.  That is not the special province of the Government.  I have some experience of this type of committee and there are several things that fall to be settled.  I think I am right in saying that, when the Chief Justice was originally put into the Bill, there was no case before the courts.  I understood from the Taoiseach the last day that before any case was brought to the courts the surviving trustee was anxious to have the matter disposed of and this scheme was put up.  It is one thing to have the Chief Justice in an arrangement when no case is before the courts; it is quite a different thing to have the Chief Justice in a Bill when there is a case relating to it before the courts.  There is a real ground for objection there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without adverting to personalities, I am entirely at variance with the Taoiseach in holding that a judge is necessary in this case.  I do not think that he is.  He is no more suitable for the position, by virtue of his office or training, than many others, nor is it desirable that a judge should occupy the office.  It is not a question of interpreting law, as the Taoiseach knows. After the Rising, there was a body known as the National Aid Committee and there was a Volunteer Dependents' Fund and other dependents' funds.  I, myself, am chairman of a Post Office benevolent fund&mdash;the Rowland Hill Fund.  We appoint certain types of persons as trustees but we should never <Col N="1703" /> think of appointing a judge, as such. My functions have nothing whatever to do with law when I act as chairman, nor do you require a judicial or impartial person except in so far as a great many people would be judicial and impartial in the distribution of money. What you need is a person with a soft heart and a hard head and a knowledge of law does not necessarily give you both of these things.</P>
    <P>The real reason for the introduction of the Chief Justice, as revealed by the Taoiseach, is that he wants to prevent the notion of partisanship applying to this Bill. It seems to me that, in endeavouring to do that, and in putting a judicial smear on an action which is not judicial at all, he has done grievous harm to the people mentioned and, perhaps, to the courts themselves.  The work will be very onerous.  There will be a very small amount of money but there will be an enormous number of applications. I have seen a certain amount of this work done.  I do not know what machinery has been devised for the purpose of testing these applications. What is required for this office is a person with a considerable knowledge of the previous circumstances.  I could give the Taoiseach the names of several persons, not all belonging to my own Party, who would be suitable for this office.  It will be very onerous work&mdash; work which no Chief Justice, I think, could himself undertake.  Any judge who undertakes it will find that it will make serious inroads on his time without the feeling of getting very much done.  It would have been much better to avoid all this fuss.  This business of attacks upon judges would not arise if this section were not in the Bill in this form.  We may learn from this experience that judges should not be put into any Bills except in a judicial or semi-judicial capacity.  There are many cases in which judges come into Bills. In cases between a Minister and some person whose property is being taken from him, it is very often provided in Bills that, in the event of failure to reach agreement, there will be compulsory arbitration, the arbitrator to be a barrister of seven years' standing and to be appointed by the Chief <Col N="1704" /> Justice.  That is the common form and, in that case, the Chief Justice is doing a job which, no matter what the régime, would be regarded as a proper job for the Chief Justice.  That is different from the present case.  This is wholly exceptional.  I do not propose to discuss it but I want to put on record that it is very unfortunate it happened.  I want to repeat that no chairman could possibly prevent a judge from being criticised when he occurs in this form in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that it could have been dealt with on its merits without the introduction of personalities. I stated that the Chief Justice was put in so as to make it quite clear that there would be impartiality in the distribution of the funds.  That is a very different thing from the question whether this Bill is constitutional or not.  Two points are involved, and we have carefully to distinguish between them.  The Chief Justice cannot function under this Bill until it has passed the Oireachtas and has become law.  If we get that clearly into our minds, we shall get the position in its proper perspective. There may be a difference of opinion as to whether or not this is a proper function for the Chief Justice, but the point is that he cannot function under this Bill until it becomes an Act of the Oireachtas.  Once it becomes an Act, the Chief Justice will be merely facilitating the Oireachtas in acting as chairman, if he can act personally, or by appointing a chairman.  That is very different from the complexion which it was sought to put upon this matter&mdash;that his name was brought in here for the purpose of giving some sort of judicial appearance to the Bill as a whole.  The Bill must pass through Parliament on its merits.  To take the statement that the Chief Justice's name was introduced so that <Col N="1705" /> there might be impartial distribution of the funds and to say that it was done to try to give a judicial colour to the Bill as a whole is not right.</P>
      <P>On the question as to whether it is desirable that there should be a person of legal training in the chair, the terms of reference are set out in the Bill, and surely it is desirable that there should be somebody to see that these general terms of reference are carried out.  I think that these two points are sufficient to justify what we have done. However, we have different points of view, and I admit that Senator Hayes is as much entitled to his view as I am to mine.  I try to keep as open a mind as I can, and I admit that, if I had thought there would be anything like the personal attack which was made elsewhere on the Chief Justice, I should be very slow to expose him to anything of the kind.  I think that I should be adding to the damage done if, because of a slight inclination on my part to meet opposite points of view, I were to give way at this stage.  I think that the objections to the proposal to have the Chief Justice as chairman have no real foundation and that we should depend on the Chief Justice to act in that capacity.  The work will be very onerous, and I doubt that it will be possible for him to act personally.  Accordingly, he may have to appoint somebody else who will act as an impartial chairman in the distribution of the funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I differ from the Taoiseach with regard to the desirability of appointing a judge to carry out any function which is not a judicial <Col N="1706" /> function.  If he carries out any public function, apart from a judicial function, it means that he is doing something which may be criticised by certain people, and it is very undesirable that a judge should be sitting one day in court dispensing justice and next day carrying out any public policy which is open to criticism.  The Taoiseach mentioned the Red Cross Society and I had intended to mention it myself.  It was very undesirable that the President of the High Court should have become Chairman of the Red Cross Society, because certain people were entitled to take the line that they did not like the way the Red Cross Society did a certain job.  It was undesirable that the president should have been put in the position that his actions were open to criticism, because obviously the Chairman of the Red Cross Society was open to criticism in relation to a certain action which came before the courts. It could have been suggested&mdash;I am discussing this entirely in the abstract and not on the basis of personalities&mdash; that it was the chairman's influence which made the Red Cross Society take a certain course and the fact that the chairman was at the same time President of the High Court was highly undesirable.</P>
      <P>I rose to speak on this section for the purpose of registering my belief that the course of appointing a judge as chairman of the Red Cross Society, or to carry out a public function of any nature which is not judicial or quasi-judicial, is highly undesirable and is liable ultimately to mean that the court over which that judge presides will be brought into disrepute.  So much for the general aspect.</P>
      <P>So far as the particular aspect of this situation is concerned, I must confess, quite candidly, I understood the Taoiseach to say a few minutes ago that a judge was brought into this section for the purpose of making it appear, as will be the fact, I hope, that there would not be any partisanship. I understood Senator Hayes to hold the view that that was wrong, and so do I.  I thought it was the Taoiseach himself who said it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether the Taoiseach said it or not, may I say&mdash;and the Taoiseach has told us that this came to him in the Bill&mdash; that I believe that was the reason it was put in the original Bill, perhaps before the Taoiseach saw it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong views on the subject of judges being asked to do anything which is not judicial and I think that was a very grave mistake.  A grave mistake having been made by the Executive&mdash; the Taoiseach will, of course, agree that he must accept responsibility, once he introduces the Bill&mdash;in regard to an infringement of that principle, a further grave mistake was made by the head of our judiciary in consenting to adopt, so to speak, the mistake of the Government.  I do not propose to put the matter any further, except to say that I consider that those two mistakes were made, and that, if the matter had not already been adequately ventilated, I would feel perfectly entitled to ventilate it and to express my views strongly on Section 4, but at this stage I do not propose to say any more than I have put on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one portion of Senator Sweetman's remarks with which I should like to associate myself.  I do not wish to associate myself with any attacks in connection with this section, but in so far as he has expressed the view that it is undesirable that a judge, while acting as a judge, should be asked to undertake any outside work in respect of which it might be suggested there is any political partisanship or political flavour, the general principle he has enunciated is sound.  I would suggest respectfully to the Taoiseach, however, that the same does not apply in the case of retired judges.  When judges have retired, they have all their experience, both of law and of considering evidence, and they are people who are eminently suitable to be asked <Col N="1708" /> to become chairmen of inquiries, bodies, tribunals and so on.  It may not be altogether germane to the particular section, but I suggest that the services of retired judges should be employed to a greater extent and that the services of judges who are acting as judges would perhaps be best employed exclusively on the particular functions which have been assigned to them under the Constitution and by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Chief Justice could be regarded as having made a mistake.  His position, I take it, was that he was asked whether he would be willing to act if the Bill went through the Oireachtas.  Anything that was in it was a matter for the Oireachtas, and, if the Oireachtas made mistakes, he should feel about them only as he would feel if the Oireachtas failed to express itself properly in regard to some matter of law.  This Bill is our business and the only point was that, as a matter of courtesy and propriety, if you introduce a person, either by way of his office or personally, into a Bill, you naturally tell him about it. Putting myself in the Chief Justice's position, if the matter were put to me, I would say: &ldquo;I am quite willing to do any public service I am asked by the Oireachtas to do&rdquo; and go no further into it than that.  If there is any blame attaching to anybody arising out of this, I am responsible for it, in the first instance, in making the recommendation to the Government; the Government is responsible for adopting it; and, in so far as it is put through the Oireachtas, any blame must attach to the majority who put it through.  In my opinion, there is no blame of any kind which can attach to the Chief Justice, and it is only fair that I should say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the points of view taken by the various speakers, and I should be inclined to say that, in the main, I agree that perhaps a case could be made that it is not desirable that this should be done.  It never occurred to me, even when speaking about the chairmanship of the Red Cross, that there could be anything improper in a judge being chairman, and I never heard that view expressed until now. <Col N="1709" /> At the same time, I admit that there is a certain amount of force which can be attached to it.  In other words, if in carrying out the functions as chairman of the Red Cross, he were open to criticism, that might in some way reflect on him afterwards in his capacity as judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to admit the force of that and probably this will now be a sort of signal in the future with regard to the use of judges in any particular capacity.  I would have been rather inclined to use them, as they are known to be independent of political connections, and could be relied on to act independently in regard to any particular work as chairman.</P>

      <P>May I give the House a concrete example?  I do not think that the principle the Taoiseach lays down, if it is a principle, is correct&mdash; that a judge should do whatever the Oireachtas asks him to do.  I do not think he should.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Facilitating the Legislature means facilitating, in the case of an opposed Bill, the people in the majority.  As an example, I was not the Chief Justice but I was the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, and I was chairman of the Civil Service Commission.  The Taoiseach, of course, is very keen now on the recognition of institutions.  He got into power by recognising no institutions and showing respect for none of them&mdash;but that is another question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be controversial, but we are here for the purpose of controversy.  I was Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann and chairman of the Civil Service Commission. A Bill was passed for the purpose of applying, roughly speaking, the principles of the Civil Service Commission to offices under local authorities, setting up what is known as the Local Appointments Commission. I was asked to be chairman of that, and I refused.  It is an exact analogy with the Chief Justice being asked to do something.  I refused on grounds which I think a judge could easily use also.  I said: &ldquo;There are people who object very strongly to this Act, and they may object to the administration of it, and they may object to the chairman; and as Chairman of the Dáil, I am not able to answer criticism, and I am not going to be in a position where I can be criticised and cannot answer.&rdquo;  That is the exact position in which a judge is put when he does something which is not a judicial function&mdash;he is open to criticism.  I think judges should be sufficiently discerning&mdash;and I think in future they will be&mdash;to read what is asked of them and if they find it controversial, refuse to do it.  As someone remarked when the Taoiseach was speaking, judges ought not have political affiliations and should not be partial in any shape or form, but the suspicion exists in some cases, and you add to the suspicion by doing anything of this kind.  The principle is a wrong one, that a judge simply assists the Oireachtas by consenting to perform a particular function which is not a judicial function, and I thought it would be interesting to give an example from my personal experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, for the purpose of clarification, to refer to sub-section (5) of this section.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  If a committee, consisting of three persons nominated by the Chief Justice, is requested by the Attorney-General to inquire into, and report upon, the question whether it is desirable that a particular ordinary member of the board should cease to hold office&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the committee shall comply with the request,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Who begins this?  Is it the Attorney-General who requests the Chief Justice to appoint any three persons or is it the Chief Justice who appoints the committee and they are there all the time, and then the Attorney-General requests that they will do such-and-such a thing?  The sub-section does not seem clear to me, and if it is clear to other members, I would like to know if the terminology is correct.</P>
      <P>The second point is that, if a committee of three persons, without any definition as to who they are, is to be compelled to do a certain job&mdash; that is what the clause really means when it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the committee shall comply with the request&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>any three individual citizens may be asked to do this and then, because of the fact that they are asked, they are compelled to do it.  It seems to me that the wording is not quite clear, and I would like to know if it could be made more clear to us, not to mind any lawyer&mdash;as I find that the lawyers are the best people to dispute anything.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it could be made more imperative, but I think it will work as it is.  I take it that the <Col N="1713" /> purpose of this provision is that if there were some member of the board who was unable to act&mdash;for instance, if there was a case of mental incapacity&mdash;you would want to have the position in which if it was clear that someone was unable to function, he could be removed.  The idea behind this is that, in such a case, if there was a need of that kind, a committee of three either could be appointed <i>ad hoc</i> or appointed earlier: that some committee of three would be in a position to inquire into the matter and give a judgment as to whether the person was or was not fit to function.  One of the difficulties is that when you appoint people for a period, for a definite period or indefinitely, cases may arise in which somebody is unable to function. Obviously you want some means of settling a position of that sort. Curiously enough, I raised the question at an early stage as to whether this was an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, and as to what would happen if the people mentioned did not act.  I think that we will have to leave it as it is.  I do not think that any difficulty will ever arise in practice in getting three people in the community to act.</P>

      <P>I think the sub-section could be easily redrafted to make it more clear.  If you were to say that &ldquo;if a question arises whether it is desirable that a particular member of the board should cease to hold office, the Attorney-General shall request the Chief Justice to appoint a committee consisting of three persons and the Chief Justice shall do so&rdquo;.  I am not giving the exact drafting.  You could then set out that &ldquo;thereupon the committee shall inquire into the question&rdquo; and say that the committee by a majority report&rdquo; and so on.  I think we all know what the sub-section means, but it is not a very elegant bit of drafting.  I think the sub-section could be easily redrafted.</P>

      <P>It is possible that it could be redrafted without any difficulty.  It is not very clear as it is. <Col N="1714" /> I think it would be fair to put in &ldquo;if in the opinion of the Government a question arises as to whether it is desirable&rdquo; and so on.  What has got to be done after that has then to be considered.  You could say, &ldquo;the Attorney-General shall request the Chief Justice to appoint a committee consisting of three persons to inquire into and report&rdquo; on the question.  You could then set out that &ldquo;the committee shall thereupon comply with the request; if the committee, by a majority, reports that it is desirable that the said ordinary member shall cease to hold office&rdquo;, so-and-so shall be done.  I am just suggesting a draft on those lines as the points have occurred to me while speaking.  If the sub-section were redrafted on these lines, I think it would be an improvement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the sub-section is unnecessary.  I think that Senator O'Donovan is right that it should be made more clear.  The Government appoints the ordinary members of the board.  If it does that why should there be any need for the elaborate machinery set out in sub-section (5)?  If the other members of the committee report that some particular person should be removed, the Government will have to initiate proceedings for getting him removed. The Government, having taken the initial step, then the unfortunate Chief Justice again and three members, whose qualifications are not in any way defined, are to sit solemnly on the question, and by a majority report that A.B. is not a proper person to hold office.  That seems to me to be very elaborate machinery for doing a simple thing.  I think the average attitude of the average Government is that having appointed people it will suffer them as long as it can.  I think that, if the Government came to the conclusion that a person ought to be removed, the simplest thing would be to give it power to remove him.  If the Government does that, it is open to question in the Dáil.  Perhaps it is intended &mdash;I do not want to be accused again of having the bad mind&mdash;to prevent a. question being raised in the Dáil.  The <Col N="1715" /> Attorney-General is not a judicial officer.  He is an officer of the Government and if he has to take the initial step that is an administrative act which can be raised in the Dáil.</P>

Then there is a comma and after that it goes on &ldquo;consisting of three persons nominated by the Chief Justice, is requested by the Attorney-General&rdquo; and so on.  That appears to me to mean that the Attorney-General would request the committee.  I suppose the other interpretation could be put on it too.  From that we proceed to say that these three persons shall comply with the request.  It is paragraph (a) of the sub-section that perplexes me.  Three persons are nominated by the Chief Justice.  I think there is no necessity for the clause which says that the committee shall comply with the request. It seems to me to mean that the three are compelled to act although they have already agreed to act.  I think that the whole clause requires alteration so that the meaning would be definite to any lay mind or legal mind.</P>

What is to be done is clear, that if you get three people who are prepared to act this gives them power to act, and they comply with the request to go about the business they are appointed to do. That is all it means.  I am not talking about the elegance of it.  Perhaps, if I were drafting it, I might do it differently. I am quite satisfied that it is done sufficiently well, and I really do not see any reason why we should change it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I want to raise on Section 10.  These costs have been incurred partly in assembling documents of several kinds dealing with Sinn Féin.  It seems to me that we should take this opportunity of depositing as many of the original documents of the printed matter mentioned by the Taoiseach.  I do not know if we need anything in the Bill to that effect but I do think that the Taoiseach should take some steps&mdash; I do not like to say compel, because compulsion would not be necessary&mdash; to ensure that all the parties to the action including the solicitor who went out of the action, should deposit these documents in the National Library for the purposes of records for historical students.  I do not think that the Oireachtas Library is a suitable place. In 1922 there was a certain library in the Castle and I was asked to look <Col N="1717" /> after it for a certain time.  We took it to the Oireachtas Library but eventually we handed over the bulk of it to the National Library.  There were a number of files of country newspapers in it.  I know that the National Library through a very definite effort by the very competent librarian has made a great bid to get historical documents together and I think that no matter what our views are, no matter what side we may take in this particular action or whatever view we may take about this Bill, we will agree as to the desirability of having all the documents, particularly the early documents, which are of great importance, together in some place like the National Library where they would be available for <i>bona fide</i> students.</P>
      <P>I think it is something we should accomplish since we are actually paying out the Sinn Féin funds to those people who have them.  A good result of this Bill would be that all possible documents would be deposited in the National Library.  It may give an opportunity of appealing to people who have other documents in addition to those deposited there already, to come forward and deposit them now.  It is a matter of great importance to us because we cannot have confidence in the future unless we have belief in our own past.  Everybody, no matter what his political views are, will agree that the Sinn Féin movement and its documents will be an important part of Irish history and we should do as much as we can to make these documents available.  The National Library would seem to be the most suitable place for them and <i>bona fide</i> students coming here as they sometimes do, to the universities in Dublin, Cork or Galway, can be sent there to study them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">

      <P>It has been represented to me that certain small costs have been incurred in this case after the 11th day of March, 1947, and it seems that these costs should be taxed up to the date of application to the court to have the funds paid out. If the principle is allowed at all I think it should be allowed in full. I associate myself with Senator Sweetman's view that the parties are <Col N="1718" /> going to do very well out of this Bill. Certain of them are going to get a good deal more out of it than if the action had gone on.  Some of them would not have been entitled to anything.  I think, however, that the costs should be allowed up to the date of the motion to the court to have the moneys paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to whether the parties to the action will get more than they are entitled to out of this, I do not know.  The matter was raised a few times here by Senator Sweetman.  I tried to verify my lay opinion by getting professional advice on it since, and I found that my lay opinion was not far from the mark&mdash; that is, in a case where a person is deemed by the judge to be in it <i>bona fide</i>&mdash;when there is sufficient indication that there was a case to be made, and where the person is deemed to have been defending what may be regarded as a general interest or a public interest or a trust interest&mdash;in such a case the court would probably allow him his costs.  Obviously we cannot judge this.  We consider the best thing&mdash;the proper thing&mdash;to do is to say that the costs, so far as they have been properly incurred up to the present, will be paid.</P>
      <P>In regard to the documents, I have exactly the same view as Senator Hayes has.  I do hope that people who have old Sinn Féin documents will make them available for historical purposes. In this case the documents deal with the period after 1923 rather than with the period before it.  These are the documents that are printed here in this volume I have in my hand, and it was this volume that gave me a shock when I saw it and realised what expenditure must have been incurred in printing them.  I reconciled myself to it by saying that they are printed now, and that from the point of view of the archivist, something of value had been produced.</P>

I have indicated that he felt that in getting these documents <Col N="1719" /> made available in a form like this they would be available for counsel, no matter which side he represented. Copies of this volume are available and they will certainly be put into the Library.  The Attorney-General has made certain selections, I am sure, for his counsel, and these can also be made available.  The original documents from which these are taken are now in the hands of a solicitor who has a lien on them, and I do not think we would be justified in taking these documents away from whoever gave them to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but the documents will go back to those who gave them to him.  I have carefully avoided that aspect of the matter. What we are dealing with are funds of which the existing Sinn Féin organisation never had physical control at all. As regards the documents, these people had some of them, and they gathered some from others.  In any event, I think that it would be wrong to introduce into this Bill any provision which would have the effect of trying to compel the solicitor who has these papers to deliver them up to a public authority rather than the people who gave them to him.  The documents of which I have copies here deal mainly with the question of continuity.  They do not deal with the earlier period.  I believe that many of the documents dealing with that period are in private possession. I add to the appeal by Senator Hayes my appeal to those who have documents relating to that period to make them available in the National Library, where they will be preserved and where students interested in that period can obtain information from them.  Senator Campbell mentioned that documents had been taken away by the Black and Tans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of these have, probably, disappeared.  Some people were very careless about minute books and documents of that sort.  When changing from one place to another during the 1919-21 period, individuals. had possession of books and documents. and they did not feel that those documents were really the property of an organisation&mdash;rather that they were their own property.  I appeal to those who have documents, which really belonged to a great public organisation, to make them available in the National Library and preserve the history of the period.  One thing we have gained out of these proceedings is that we have these printed documents, and they are in a form which makes them readily available.  Many of them are of no great importance, but some of them might, from a historical point of view, be regarded as important.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach did not deal with my point, that the costs should be taxed up to the date when a motion is made to pay the funds out of court.  Certain reasonable costs will have been incurred since 11th March, 1947.  Under sub-section 3 (b) &ldquo;the costs to be paid in pursuance of paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall not include any costs incurred after the 11th day of March, 1947, other than costs of taxation&rdquo;. The Bill was ordered to be printed on the 1st May, 1947.  Even since then, inconsiderable costs, but certain costs, would have been reasonably incurred. I think that all costs which the taxing master considers to have been reasonably and properly incurred up to the time when motion is made to pay the funds out, should be reimbursed to the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>Since the last day, I, like the Taoiseach, made it my business to consult other persons more skilled than myself with regard to the costs of the trustee, Mr. Wyse Power. Not merely did I get confirmation of the opinion I expressed here that he had incurred costs far and away above what was reasonable but I found amongst those who would know something about these things&mdash;barristers and solicitors&mdash;that there was prior to that time no appreciation at all that it was his costs which had amounted to so large an amount.  I found complete universality of opinion that it was his duty, as trustee, when the funds had been lodged in court, and when Mrs. Buckley and her associates instituted this action, to say that he would abide by whatever decision the court gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to turn this into a judicial argument but I can assure the Taoiseach that some colleagues of mine and I went back over reported cases and found such cases to bear out our view.  We found sufficient to satisfy ourselves that what had happened in <Col N="1722" /> this case was that the trustee did not content himself with doing what was his bare legal duty but decided he would like to have a finger in the pie. Having so decided, he incurred costs. I do not want to suggest that the costs he incurred were not proper for the work done.  What I say emphatically is that the work done was not work which it was proper for the trustee to do and was not work which should be paid for out of this fund.  It is unfortunate that I did not see the wording of paragraph 1 of sub-section (3) earlier. It provides for payment to him of the costs as between solicitor and client, properly incurred by him as trustee.  If I had seen that provision, my view and the Taoiseach's view could have been determined by the proper officers.  It would be too much of a judicial argument to use here but there was plenty of precedent to establish that what he did was entirely of his own volition and without necessity.  That is the main cause of the Taoiseach's estimate of the diminution of this fund.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not it is right that I should say what occurs to me now.  In the pending proceedings there were really three sections.  At the time of the Treaty, or after the Treaty&mdash;I do not agree with Senator Hayes that the break occurred officially and absolutely at the time of the Treaty; I will admit that the foundation was there, but the break did not occur then <Col N="1723" /> because the body met as an Árd-Fheis in May, 1922&mdash;there was a break, and you got two big divisions.  The late treasurers went one way and represented one division, and that was the point of view which might be regarded as having been expressed by the representative of one of the deceased treasurers; I looked on that as one section.  There was afterwards a further division, when the remaining half was divided again.  I regarded myself&mdash;as in a sense having a certain moral responsibility, having been appointed trustee&mdash;as representing one section.  In so far as the public interest was concerned, the Attorney-General would represent that section, as the Government would naturally put its view before the Attorney-General.  So that if the case did go for trial in the courts, these three sections would be represented: Judge Power could be regarded as pleading any views which might be expressed by those who took the Treaty side, and the Attorney-General, in so far as he would represent any Government view or any public view we might express, would, so to speak, represent our section, and the plaintiffs would also be represented; so that there was an opportunity for the three points of view being presented to the court.  I am quite willing to admit that I became really frightened when I saw the rate at which expenses were being piled up.  I can tell the House that it was this book which really frightened me, and, when I got it, I said that if we were dealing with State money, I doubt if we would feel justified.</P>

      <P>I consoled myself with the point of view that there was one thing which would come out of it, that is, that the documents were in a form which would be available for the Library when the lawyers had finished with them.  I also saw that there might be a saving of money in it. Lawyers have to be paid for their time and much less time would be spent in going through a book like this than in going through a mass of typewritten <Col N="1724" /> documents.  If one looks at the section fairly, I think it will be found to be just.</P>

      <P>I am inclined to agree that nothing else in the circumstances could be done.  The surviving trustee was justified in thinking that the point of view of the person he represented would be to make every effort to prove that the money was not to be given to those who at present call themselves Sinn Féin.  Coming to the point with regard to the documents, I agree entirely that you cannot compel a solicitor to hand back to public custody documents which were given to him by a private client, that he will have to hand them back to his client; but when the Taoiseach says that these documents will be available for the Library, does he mean the National Library or the Library here?

      <P>Has any estimate been made as to the amount of the need in this case?  The section could not be more widely drafted and I take it that it has been drafted widely for a purpose. It includes all members of the forces and it includes people &ldquo;who have given service in the national cause&rdquo;&mdash;an extremely vague and all-embracing phrase.  It also includes the present dependents of these people, and, in so far as I am able to read it, future dependents, for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be drafted purposely in order to embrace the greatest possible number.  The work which will have to be done by a committee is very difficult indeed, and, if there is a substantial need, the £16,000 is only a drop in the ocean.  It <Col N="1725" /> will go only a very short distance. There are bound to be expenses.  It is not like the old days when the National Aid or Volunteer Dependents' Fund worked on voluntary assistance and with a very small amount of paid aid. This kind of thing is very costly.  I am familiar with one particular fund which costs very little because it works through post office officials.  It is worked by post office workers, practically speaking.  The postmaster in a given area carries out the inquiries and sends up his information in official time as is recognised by the post office, and in that way inquiries and payment for inquiries are cut out.</P>
      <P>This, however, will be expensive and it is analogous, as a matter of fact, to the case of wounds pensions.  It is comparatively easy to establish whether a person is entitled to a wounds pension, but the Taoiseach knows that, when you go beyond wounds pensions and proceed to compensate people for illness contracted on service, you go into a very wide field, or, rather, into a morass, and while there is justice in it, it is very difficult to establish whether a soldier's illness has arisen out of service.</P>
      <P>In this case you are dealing not with wounds or illness but with needy circumstances. I know myself a few cases in respect of which I regretted very much that there was no place I could turn to in order to remedy a particular difficulty.  We all know some of these cases.  Whether there are very many of them, I do not know, nor do I know how many there would be in each county. There is already a provision that a man with service, a single man, can get his income made up to £78, and to £90 if he is married, and £90 plus certain allowances for dependent children where he has dependent children.  This seems to me to be the beginning of a process by which this money will be spent and an Estimate will be introduced in the Dáil to continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £16,000 might have effected some good, if it were spent in one sum for a particular purpose.  I have no means of determining how widespread the need is and I do not know whether the Taoiseach has any means, either, <Col N="1726" /> but I understand there were a great many applicants.  I also know this&mdash; and we might as well be frank about it&mdash;that the moment you say money is available, all kinds of people make application. I had the good fortune, after 1916, not to be interned, and anybody in Dublin then who knew the circumstances and who, having been in the Rising, was in a position to express his personal view, came upon very great difficulties.  Once people begin to make application for money, you have to make inquiries and have to take up, I am afraid, a rather untrusting attitude.  That is a position we are all familiar with, so that the job being given to this committee is a very unenviable and very indeterminate one and I do not know how they will do it. I do not know what particular type of cases it is intended to cover.</P>
    <P>I know a few cases.  Take the man with military service or 1916 service in a non-pensionable Civil Service post who goes out at a certain age and then reverts from £6 or £7 a week to a pension and a military service pension. I do not understand how this work will be done.  I feel that this money might be devoted to another purpose, and if the thing mentioned in this Section 13 is agreed to and left to be dealt with out of public funds, but I do not know if that can be done now. If, in fact, the need is great, it will eventually be dealt with out of public funds, when the £16,000 will be gone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator said is quite right with regard to the difficulty in a case like this.  The State has difficulty, in making provision, to try to draw a line as to who should come under a Bill and who should not. We have had Pensions Bills and wounds pensions provisions and so on. Outside anything we have been able to touch, some cases have been brought to my notice personally.  I do not know how extensive the need is, but I agree with the Senator that the trouble is that the moment the board is established and this fund is available, there will be a large number of people seeking something from it.  As a matter of fact, some have come to my office already.  If I were a member of the board I would sit tight to start with, <Col N="1727" /> and make up my mind that I could only relieve, with that small sum of money, what one might call the almost desperate cases.  I would be extremely conservative about it, as you cannot come to the relief of all the cases that will be submitted to you; you have only to glance at some of them to see that they would not be the kind that should be dealt with in the first instance.  I would wait until satisfied that I had found the very desperate cases, and I would move slowly.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that somebody has to go through the applications.  If you get a large number of applications, <i>a priori</i> you cannot know whether one is important or not, so someone has to do the first run through them.  I agree that one of the unsatisfactory things about the whole Bill is the method in which the money is going to be spent, but there is hardly any other method one could suggest that would not be open to some of the objections.  An Seabhac, for instance, is anxious that it should be used for some purposes connected with Irish; there again immediately the question arises that you have not nearly enough in these funds to go on with the big job to be done, and the State would have to come in in a much larger way.  If this is regarded as a benevolent fund, to be used only in extreme cases, I believe it will do some good.</P>
      <P>It will be better than having the money frittered away.  I honestly do not know if I can make any better case for it than that it should be kept by this board to be availed of in cases of dire necessity.  To do that, we have to depend upon the judgment of the board.  That is the important thing.  It is not a fund that will be sufficient to deal with every case of hardship.  It is only of value if it is used to deal with cases of dire hardship where no other fund is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose I should not raise difficulties for myself by talking about the subsequent section, which contains the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo;.  That was objected to in the Dáil on the ground that, if there was any question of State gifts to an organisation of this sort, seeing that this Bill has not got the general <Col N="1728" /> approval I would like, it would probably not be the best basis on which to provide any necessary supplementary funds.  If it were necessary for the Dáil to go further and a large number required assistance, for which this fund proved insufficient, it would be a question of coming to the Dáil.  In that case, seeing that this particular Bill has not received the general approval I would like, it would be better to do it independently.  Nevertheless, there is a possibility here.  After a period, when people have seen this board function, they may revise their views, and the apprehensions they had may prove unjustified, and we may change our views as regards the advisability of having a body of this sort.  If it functions well and it is thought desireable to help it from the State point of view, or if private individuals desire to help it, it can be done.  As a matter of fact, the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; was put into Section 14 to enable anyone who got money to repay it.  We did not want to have provision for loans, and this is one way in which a person who got some money from the board, and later found himself able to pay it back, could do so, and the board could receive it.  It would have to be received more or less as a gift.  That was why it was put in, as a simple arrangement; and also if there were members of the community who wished to help a fund of this sort, it would enable the board to take any moneys offered to it.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely that, if the need is very extensive, the sum is too small. It can only be of value if it is used conservatively to help desperate cases of dire necessity which definitely come under the general terms of reference. If done in that way, it will be helpful. It could not be regarded as a general fund to relieve distress of people in general who might have suffered in the national struggle.  I do not think it is large enough to do that, and I doubt if even a public Bill could be brought in satisfactorily to deal with it.  We must remember that in the national struggle we had the whole or a very large percentage of the population of this part of Ireland and of Ireland as a whole.  In the case of a struggle like that, you can hardly make arrangements <Col N="1729" /> so that all those who suffered in any way will be compensated.  All you can do is to relieve cases of outstanding distress.  If that is done, we might get somewhere.</P>

      <P>May I ask if for the purpose of administering Section 13, it would be necessary to have a staff, including investigators?  How are we going to determine under the section the term &ldquo;hardship&rdquo;?  It must be related to something.  It must be investigated, and we have this question of a means test back again.  There seems to be a good deal of investigation involved, and the cost of administration in the long run is going to be high.  The Taoiseach might give some indication as to what he considers will be the costs involved in administration, including investigation, and whether this money is to be disposed of finally within a period of years.  Is it to be disposed of on the basis of hardship within two, five, or ten years?  That will be important.</P>

      <P>Years ago, I had some experience in matters kindred to this. I do not see how this clause could be made different from what it is.  The amount of money is relatively small. There are two things which the committee would have to decide and I am thankful I will not have to decide them.  One is the definition of &ldquo;needy circumstances&rdquo; and the other of &ldquo;service in the national cause&rdquo;.  The committee will have to decide these.  I hope that this will not be administered like a pension fund under a Government Department.  I would rather see the committee make some mistakes than spend half the fund in careful investigation and examination of every case. It may be that the problem is so acute that they will be able to do nothing until they come to the State and say: &ldquo;Are you going to help us?&rdquo;  It may equally be that there are a number of people for whom that sum of money could be used.  I am glad that it is not confined to service in the Forces because, as the Taoiseach knows, and as any of us who lived through that period know, services of great value to the national cause&mdash;by that I mean the winning of the independence of the <Col N="1730" /> country&mdash;were given by all kinds of people who never would, or could, have served in the national services.  I hope, if my words count for anything, that one thing the committee will do is to say at the outset that it will not listen to, or read letters from, T.D.s or Senators in regard to these cases. It is going to be bad if applicants think that they will have to go to T.D.s or Senators to have their applications properly made.</P>

      <P>According to the definition, what qualifies a person for payment from the fund is &ldquo;needy&rdquo;,&mdash; anybody &ldquo;in needy circumstances&rdquo;. This person may have a pension and his &ldquo;needy circumstances&rdquo; may arise from his own fault.  I think that as far as possible it should be applied to needy people not covered by either the military service or disability service pensions.  It is so small that it should be conserved.  A person may have a military service pension and be described as &ldquo;needy&rdquo; but it need not be stated why he is needy.  It might be due to drink or some other cause like that.  That makes it very wide.  I think the whole idea behind the Bill should be to try to give to needy people whose need is not met by any funds already provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he must be in needy circumstances arising out of services. At least I hope that is what it is.  It is not the case in paragraph (a) but it is the case in paragraph (b).  I feel that Senator Douglas is quite right, and he has more experience than any of us in these matters because of the administration of the White Cross. If you are going to have this body acting under statute it is better to have rather loose terms of reference.  The Taoiseach used the words &ldquo;dire necessity&rdquo;. I do not agree.  The words &ldquo;needy circumstances&rdquo; have different meanings for different people.  Destitution is not exactly the proper test and the person who has already a military service pension should not be entirely excluded.  I agree with Senator Douglas that Senators and T.D.s should not be listened to as such, but there may, of course, be members of the Oireachtas whose opinion has value <Col N="1731" /> and whose testimony in regard to service has value.  The committee may ask them for that.  If a man applies from a particular area the committee might easily apply to Deputy Seán MacEoin or to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Moylan, for information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the staff of the committee, I wonder whether they cannot get one or two very intelligent people of experience to work for them and then have voluntary labour in the country. I do not think you will improve the situation by restricting Section 13. Those you want to deal with are people who are not dealt with by existing Acts of the Oireachtas.  I mentioned, quite casually, yesterday evening, a man who, I have since learned, fired the first shot in the Rising.  I understood that he had both a military service pension and a pension from the Dublin Corporation, but I discovered this was not so.  He was a temporary officer. That being the case, his circumstances must be worse than they appeared to me.  You will not improve it by restricting the provisions of the section.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Hayes says.  I have no objection at all to an applicant saying that Senator So-and-so, or Deputy So-and-so, has information.  What I meant was that members of the Oireachtas should say, when approached: &ldquo;You make your application and if I have any information I will give it to the committee if they ask for it.&rdquo;  One thing I would like to say in view of a remark made by the Taoiseach is: I hope and believe that this committee will be successful and I believe everybody here will wish it success and will want to help it.  The fact that this Bill is controversial does not mean that we do not want to see the committee function successfully and in an impartial and fair way.  Therefore the Taoiseach should not assume that because this Bill is controversial we wish otherwise. It may very well be that in 12 months' time we may be willing to give assistance to it.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that applications are already coming in.  That is an indication to an extent that we are going to be smothered with applications in a similar way as the Military Service Pension Board was smothered.  I think there were something like between 60,000 and 70,000 applications for pensions.  One can readily see 10,000 or 15,000 persons applying for grants under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Assuming you have 15,000 applications there must be somebody to sift them, read them and assess them, keep records and make inquiries if it is to be got through in a reasonable time, say, 12 months or two years.  That would take a big staff.  It would require a big staff to handle 1,000 applications per week; inquiries will have to be made and letters written; you will have to have typists; you may have some investigations to make in Kerry, or Donegal, or even in England, to ascertain why particular persons should make a claim and to investigate their <i>bona fides.</i>  What is running through my mind is that there is going to be great delay incurred if the funds are to be administered in, shall I say, the traditional Civil Service manner. Secondly, there is the question of cost. The more you attempt to hasten decisions, the greater the staff required and the greater the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The objections of the Senator are quite well based.  A certain amount of investigation will be necessary but you can visualise yourself as a member of the board, with this sum of money at your disposal, how you would deal with it.  If you were a member of the board, you would make up your mind that you were not going to see this money spent on administrative costs.  Since the sum is small it will not be able to deal with every case.  Therefore, while the word I used perhaps would not be acceptable generally, I myself would be inclined to keep before my mind cases of dire necessity to start with.  I would say to myself that I would deal in the first instance with cases of dire necessity and I would be in no great hurry either; I would take my time.  I know that the sum is small and therefore there would be no question of rushing <Col N="1733" /> in and trying to save all possible distress: you cannot do it that way.</P>
      <P>I would wait until I had a <i>prima facie</i> case before I had any investigation made in order to see that this was the type which really deserved to be dealt with in the early stages.  I would proceed by a process of gradual sifting of the cases.  I think the board should be extremely conservative&mdash;or the money will be exhausted&mdash;and deal with cases that everyone would agree should be dealt with.  The amount of the administrative expenses will not be so great if you proceed in that way. I know that there will be a large number of applications, but I would be inclined to find out, first, if there were any outstanding applications among them, which obviously ought to be dealt with.  It is a case of going slowly in dealing with them.  If there could be on this board people with previous experience of the administration of other funds, it would be a very great help. It may be possible to get some such people on the board.  I agree that the danger to this fund, which is so small, is of wasting it in administrative expenses.</P>

      <P>On this stage I should like to refer briefly to what was said by the Taoiseach on the Second Stage in connection with this Bill, and particularly to certain references to the courts as protectors of the people. According to the Official Debates, column 1685, the Taoiseach stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is all nonsense in the long run to suggest&mdash;it was suggested very strongly in the other House and here &mdash;that the protection of the rights of the citizens depends on the courts. The protection of the rights of the citizens, in the last resort, depends <Col N="1734" /> on the Legislature.  There is no doubt whatever about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like very respectfully to differ from the Taoiseach on what seems to be a matter of some importance. In general I agree with what he said about the courts.  It would be absurd if anything I said would give any other impression than that the fundamental protection of the people depends upon the courts.  But I cannot help thinking that the Taoiseach has gone to the other extreme when he stated that &ldquo;the protection of the rights of the citizens, in the last resort, depends on the Legislature.&rdquo; As this matter is of some importance I am raising it now.  It arose in connection with this Bill.  Personally, I belong to a tiny religious minority of some few thousand people.</P>
    <P>I meet those in the Six Counties and hereafter, if any of them had doubts&mdash; as some of those in the Six Counties have&mdash;about the protection of their rights, if I told them that that depended upon the Dáil and the Seanad, they might laugh and say: &ldquo;We thought so.&rdquo;  I would tell them that I believe the Irish people would not allow interference with the fundamental rights of a minority, would not stand for it, and that if it did happen in the case of Parliament, then that Government would be defeated.  The ultimate protection is the tolerance and the good sense of the people.  If that was not there, there might be no protection or temporary protection.  The Constitution has its limitations.  It could be changed by the people.  It is valuable in the sense that it sets out in writing certain principles.  But those principles are not enough if you do not have the backing of the people and a belief in tolerance, that there are certain rights, whatever powers Parliament may have, in which legally Parliament has no right to interfere.</P>
    <P>In this country, in which there is very considerable belief in the importance of the individual, and the rights of the individual, where there is universal belief in the family as the fundamental unit of society, you cannot, if you accept such principles, but recognise the rights of minorities.  I <Col N="1735" /> put this view forward because the importance of the courts can be minimised. The value of the courts, first of all, is in the interpretation of the law but, as the Taoiseach very properly pointed out, they cannot do anything but interpret the law as they understand it, except where they believe that law is contrary to the Constitution. In that case there may be protection in the sense that the courts prevent Parliament from acting hastily or taking away what seem to be important rights of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the present Government or that any Government in the lifetime of anybody would knowingly or deliberately set out to interfere with religious rights or with political rights, but they did so in one Act that was adverted to, and it was one of considerable importance. Already we have the case of the School Attendance Act in which the desire of the Government to achieve what was attempted was difficult and they took powers which many in this House thought interfered with family rights and which they fought all through Parliament. That was not sufficient.  Parliament was not the protector there, but eventually the courts decided the matter under the Constitution.  I do not want to raise that matter now, but to say generally, if my words count for anything, that I do not depend on Parliament in the last resort, as stated by the Taoiseach, but as a last resort on the people to maintain individual rights.</P>

      <P>I hope that this Bill is not going to be taken as a precedent, because I disapprove very strongly of the practice that when a matter has come before the courts it should not be left to be decided by the courts but resolved by legislation. Even before this Bill was introduced by the Taoiseach I thought that there were exceptional circumstances in connection with these funds which would justify the matter being dealt with by legislation.  There was a political element as well as a juridical element. As a matter of fact, long before the Taoiseach introduced the Bill I had <Col N="1736" /> discussed the question, whether it might not be dealt with by legislation, but I should like, if any future Bill of a similar nature is introduced, that the Taoiseach should not quote this Bill as justifying interference by the Legislature with the courts.</P>
      <P>I hold very strongly that although the Legislature can always overrule the courts, and has the power to do so, it should not do it, except when a very particular and specialised case is made, as in the long run, the real safety for the individual lies in the courts. The courts deal with individual cases. The attitude of the courts is: &ldquo;I find no fault with these just men&rdquo;, but the Legislature is inclined to sacrifice the individual and say &ldquo;it is expedient that one man should die for the multitude&rdquo;.  That is rather the difference. The court looks at each individual case.  It tries to do justice, with a passion for justice.  The Legislature is sometimes swayed by popular prejudice or popular passion.  It feels that it wants to get on with the particular job which it has near its heart, and that it is expedient that one man should die for the people.</P>

      <P>I want to say before the Bill leaves the House that the more the discussion progressed the more convinced I became that this proceeding was entirely unwise.  I cannot imagine anybody in this House feeling either happy or satisfied because this Bill is being passed into law.  It is true that we could not prevent its being passed into law.  Whether we gave it a Second Reading or not would make very little difference.  If we had not given it a Second Reading, its enactment would have been delayed.  The fact that we have given it a Second Reading, and have expedited the other stages, merely means that the Bill becomes law a few months earlier than it otherwise would.  We can bear in mind that, if there is something seriously wrong in the principle involved in the adoption of this Bill, the responsibility need not be laid at our door. I do feel, however, that there is at least one section of the community highly gratified by what has happened. I imagine that the Sinn Féin organisation will feel very gratified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Six months ago the Taoiseach probably felt that he would achieve a good deal when the last intransigent element in the community went into the courts and was prepared to have its case decided by the courts.  The Taoiseach, I think, unwisely prevented that issue being decided by the courts.  He has given the Sinn Féin organisation the excuse to say that they cannot trust the courts, because if there is a danger that the courts will decide something in their favour the Oireachtas steps in and takes the case out of the courts. I think that is unfortunate, but it is true.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Buckley and her friends will get all their costs out of this fund.  Every party that appeared in the courts will get their costs, so that the original £8,000 will be paid out under this Bill in costs of litigation, and we are left with the residue, which is merely the earned interest&mdash;not the money subscribed by the Irish people&mdash;and that is going to be distributed.  We learned, as we went along this afternoon, that a fair share of this money will go in administration expenses, so that the unfortunate people held out to us as the meritorious objects of this benevolence are going to get very little, even though they are in very needy circumstances. They will probably be dead before the awards are made.</P>
      <P>I think all of us must feel that there is nothing about this Bill on which we need pride ourselves.  It is going to be a bad precedent for the future.  It has done injury inasmuch as it has given the Sinn Féin organisation justification for saying that they cannot hope to get justice in our courts.  This is the first occasion upon which they were prepared to recognise the courts, to go into and litigate their claims in the courts. They have been denied that opportunity, and I think the very fact that the case is being taken from the courts, because the Taoiseach was afraid that the courts might not decide wisely, is a concession to the Sinn Féin organisation that they have proved the continuity of their existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down an amendment on the Second Stage of the Bill, but I do not wish to continue this debate.  I listened to Senator Duffy with considerable interest.  One of his points was an excellent point, namely, that we must all rejoice that a particular section of the community that refuses to recognise the State should recognise it by going into court.  I think that the people who will benefit under this Bill will not be very much worried whether they are benefiting from the original £8,000 or from the accrued interest. I think that is a thing that will not keep them awake at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I should like to make it clear that my opposition to the Bill was based entirely on principle and was independent entirely of my political views.  I was not actuated by opposition to the Government in the normal way.  I am in complete agreement with other people with regard to the insufficiency, as far as I can judge it, of the claims of Mrs. Buckley and her fellow-plaintiffs.  I did not think that my opinion as a politician and as a partisan in certain events should be allowed to intervene between any body of citizens who claimed to go to court and have their case decided upon the law as it stood when they opened their case.  I agree entirely that we have made an extremely bad precedent.  I do not agree that there were precedents made before.  It was also mentioned on the Committee Stage to-day that a bad precedent was made by bringing in a judge to carry out a function which is in fact not a judicial function.  I think we have made progress here, and I think that on the discussion on this Bill we have made it abundantly clear that this kind of thing will certainly not happen again.  The intervention of Parliament between a litigant and the court when a case is on is undoubtedly a bad thing.  In this particular instance, I am not accusing the Taoiseach or anybody else of bad motives.  They considered that there were sufficient grounds for doing this thing, but for various reasons, I think it was not worth doing, and it was not worth doing to save £16,000 for purposes for which the £16,000, as we dispose <Col N="1739" /> covered this afternoon, will be entirely insufficient.</P>
    <P>The case has been made that the Bill may be unconstitutional.  I am not saying whether the Bill is unconstitutional or not, but it is not because of its possible conflict with the Constitution that I oppose it.  Different religions and people with different outlooks opposed certain sections of the School Attendance Bill because they thought it violated certain fundamental rights.  We are opposing this particular Bill for the same reason. The answer that we have power to do certain things and that, therefore, we may do them is, I think, a very dangerous answer.  Whether we have power or not to do this thing, if it is not right we ought not to do it.  Every parliamentarian interested in the survival of parliamentary government will have to recognise that the greatest danger to parliamentary government here&mdash;and the greatest danger that appeared elsewhere&mdash;is the full and unscrupulous use of its power by Parliament.  We certainly, whether we have the power or not, ought to hesitate to do certain things which seem to some of us to be contrary to fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>For my part I would have been prepared to let these people go and recognise the courts.  They were taking the action at their own risk.  They are now in the position in which they can say that when they wanted to have resort to the courts a parliamentary majority&mdash;a political majority&mdash;interposed between them and that position. They may in secret be comforted by having their costs paid instead of taking the risk that the decision of the court might be against them.  Any opposition to the Bill, as far as we are concerned, is opposition based entirely on principle.  It is not personal opposition or political opposition, or opposition, for example, to the person of the Chief Justice or to the person of anybody else, but an objection to interposing Parliament between a particular litigant and the right that that litigant ought normally to have of having his case decided on the law, as it stood, by the judges when he started his case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> You can always change it but this is an example that ought not to be followed. In this House, in particular, I think we have dealt with the matter in a way which has made the principle stand out and the opposition to that principle stand out.  I think that we have improved the point of view generally regarding legislation of this kind and that we may congratulate ourselves upon that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, if I may, to congratulate ourselves on the way in which we have dealt with this matter.  I do not agree with a number of the arguments which have been put forward but I do say that we have approached this matter from the point of view of reasoned argument, without introducing personalities and dealing with it in a way which is never helpful in getting at the truth.  I think that the position has been overstated by those who oppose as to how far it is permissible or right for the Legislature to step in when an action is brought before the courts.  Perhaps, by our opposition to that opposition, it has been suggested that we want to go to extremes on the other side.  We have no intention of doing so.  As Senator Kingsmill Moore pointed out, this is a wholly exceptional case.  I do not want to go over the grounds again which make it an exceptional case.  I may say, without making a political argument out of it, that my reaction to the whole thing was precisely that of the Leader of the Opposition when he made his first statement in the Dáil. He expressed exactly, and in better words than I should have used, my feeling that this was a question which was not for the courts to decide at all. Apart from that, there is the question how far it is right for the Legislature to act in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid that the Legislature frequently intervenes when there are pending actions.  There is no vested right in any individual in the existing state of the law.  There are fundamental rights in which we all have a vested right but, so far as the ordinary law is concerned, I do not think that anybody at any particular moment <Col N="1741" /> has a vested right in that law as against the Legislature.  Every time the Legislature goes into action by way of legislation it is changing existing rights generally.</P>

      <P>Only in cases where the legislation is specifically directed to individuals.  So far as the general principle is concerned, I do not think you can say that the Legislature cannot come in if there is a sufficiently good reason for doing so and if the cause is just.  It is a question of where justice lies.  I must not be misrepresented when I said that ultimately people will have to get justice and protection of their rights in the Legislature rather than in the courts.  It is clear that what I meant is that the Legislature does determine and change rights with regard to one section or other of the community and that the courts are compelled to take note of them.  Therefore, the place where justice is, so to speak, meted out between different sections is in the Legislature when the law is being made.  Senator Douglas said quite rightly: &ldquo;You are not right, either; you must go further back.&rdquo;  The Legislature is not the last word because the personnel of the Legislature and the majority there depend, ultimately, on the will of the people.  If not satisfied with what the Legislature does, the people can, at a later stage, change it. What I want to have stress laid upon is that the people, when electing their representatives, <Col N="1742" /> should remember that they are choosing people who will mete out justice.  They should keep that carefully in mind.  Ultimately, the Constitution and the people are the final court.  That is set out in Article 6 of our Constitution, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The people are, ultimately, the final court, and the Legislature, only in so far as it represents the people, can be regarded as more final than the courts. Each has its own particular functions.</P>
      <P>At one stage of this case, I had an extract made from a judgment by the retired Chief Justice.  He refers to a matter which we ought to keep in mind.  The case is reported in the Irish Reports, 1940, page 481, and it relates to Article 26 of the Constitution and the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1940.  This is the extract:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The people, by the Constitution, have provided for the setting up of three great Departments of State&mdash; the Oireachtas, the Executive and the Judiciary&mdash;and it is essential for the harmonious working of the machinery of State that each Department should confine itself to its own constitutional functions.  If the Oireachtas enacts a law within the scope of its legal and constitutional powers, it is for the courts to construe and apply the law.  Any criticism by the courts of the manner in which the Oireachtas exercises the discretion and powers vested in it would be as much open to objection as would any suggestion, in either House of the Oireachtas, that a decision of a court, within the scope of its authority, was not in accordance with law.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, we are making a law.  It seems to me that we have the right to make that law.  While the fact that a case is before the courts should, naturally, be borne in mind, it is not the ultimate thing of which account <Col N="1743" /> should be taken.  It has to be noted, but the question is: Are we acting justly in any particular case when making a law?  In this case, I have not the slightest doubt that we are acting justly and that we are doing what we should be expected to do by the community&mdash;prevent money which might be devoted to good uses from being spent on litigation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that we have lost one good thing which could have been secured if this question had gone to the courts and had been left to their decision&mdash;that the courts would have been recognised.  I think that, if the case had gone to the courts and if a decision favourable to the parties making the claim were not reached, they would not be so inclined to consider that the courts had given them fair play.  I believe the courts would have given them fair play&mdash;I am perfectly certain of it&mdash;but I do not think the argument would not be used by them&mdash;which would be just as bad as, and, in fact, worse than, any other argument&mdash;that their claim was not admitted by the courts because the courts are institutions which we have set up here.  I think that, in the long run, it is better that we here in the Legislature, as representing the people should take any blame, if any blame is coming to us, and I am prepared personally to stand over&mdash;and I think the Oireachtas as a body can stand over&mdash;our action here, and that, in all the circumstances, it is fair and just.</P>
    <P>I want to say with regard to powers that I agree that it is very foolish of people to think that, simply because they have power to do something, they can do it.  The right to do something which you have the power to do is another matter, and even the wisdom of doing things which we have the right to do is, in cases, a matter of opinion. It is not likely that we will all agree upon this, but I have not got the slightest complaint to make about the way in which the Bill has been received in the Seanad, or the criticisms made against it.  I am perfectly certain that the criticisms offered were offered in good faith.  There have been no personalities, and I am very happy that we are ending, so to speak, on the note <Col N="1744" /> on which we are ending.  I think it is the right way in which to end.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that in order to maintain our cattle population, it is essential to restrict the present slaughter of calves and requests the Minister for Agriculture to devise a scheme by which the increased price to be paid by creameries for milk be paid only to suppliers who rear a certain percentage of calves.</P>
      <P>It is with a certain amount of reluctance that I propose this motion, because I am very definitely opposed to Government interference in any business, and particularly Government interference with the farmers and telling them how to carry on their work; but calves have been slaughtered to such a very great extent that the cattle trade have become alarmed. They feel that, if some restriction is not put on the slaughtering of these calves, the country in a few years will be denuded of cattle.  In the fortnight from April 4th to April 18th, 5,400 carcases of calves were exported by the L.M.S. to England.  I have no record of the number exported since, but I understand that slaughtering is still going on.  Senator Corkery, I am sure, can tell the House that, in his part of the country, there has been no slackening off, and that they are slaughtering all the calves they can get.  I have been told that a particular firm in his district, up to now, have been slaughtering 1,000 calves per week, and, in addition, in every part of the South, hundreds of calves are slaughtered every week and fed to greyhounds.  That is a fact and anybody who has any knowledge of the South must admit that it is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the biggest number of calves sold for slaughter come from those districts where they have the best land and the good cows.  In the poorer districts, very few calves are <Col N="1745" /> ever slaughtered, and I am sure that the Minister and Senator McCabe can tell us that, in County Cavan, they very rarely slaughter a calf.  I have been told that, in Cavan and other Border counties, calves are being smuggled across the Border from the Six Counties for rearing, so the fact is that calves are not being reared in the Six Counties, are not being reared in England and are not being reared in Éire.  The position appears to be getting very serious.  There are many other farmers outside the Minister's county who rear calves, but they are not rearing the same number as they used to rear, and if the calves are all slaughtered in the producing districts they will not be able to get the calves to rear.  The motion does not propose that there should be any compulsion on farmers to rear calves.  What it suggests is that, where a farmer sells his calf for slaughter for a few shillings and sells the separated milk for manufacturing purposes for a few pence, there should be some restriction.</P>
    <P>Farmers outside the creamery districts are the biggest section and consequently they pay a very large proportion of the £2,500,000 of bounty which the Minister says is now being paid to farmers who supply milk to creameries.  We who are outside the creamery districts and who are not getting one penny of that sum of £2,500,000 while paying the biggest proportion of it, have a right to have a small say in what these farmers should do.  I do not say that these farmers are getting a great price for their milk, or getting anything more than they are entitled to, but if the slaughter of calves is not in some way restricted, it will mean disaster for the country.</P>
    <P>The cattle trade believe it would be a wise policy to subsidise the rearing of calves and they recommend that every calf reared by any farmer in Éire, and in good condition at nine months old, should get a bounty of 30/-. They recommend that that bounty should be given in the shape of a voucher to be exchanged for artificial manure and accepted only in payment for artificial manure, the same as the <Col N="1746" /> half-crown bounty which farmers get from the millers in respect of every barrel of wheat they supply to them. I have been told that to administer such a scheme would be very expensive, but I do not think it would be. It could be administered in the same way as the scheme of relief of rates in respect of agricultural employment.</P>
    <P>In that scheme, every one of the 350,000 farmers in this country got at the beginning of every year a form on which he was asked to state the number of agricultural workers employed by him for the whole year, including members of his family or relations under 17 years of age.  He fills up that form and sends it to the county council, then it goes to the Gardaí and there is a check upon it.  I have hardly heard of a single prosecution of any farmer for making a false declaration of the number he had employed.  If the Minister would adopt the proposal, the question of expense of administration need not trouble him, as it could be done in the same way and with just as little expense.</P>
    <P>Every economist preaches that, if we want to improve our standard of living, we must increase our production per man, per cow and per acre and make exports balance imports.  Our production per man is fairly satisfactory, but our production per cow and per acre could be very much improved.  The greatest help would be a liberal supply of artificial manure.  It would improve our tillage land and our grass land, and as grass is the cheapest and most nutritious of all foods the giving of a subsidy for the rearing of calves would pay for itself and produce very good dividends for the country.  It would increase the number of calves and increase the food available to rear them and keep them in good condition.</P>
    <P>I know that a proposal to produce more cattle for export to feed John Bull was never very popular with a certain section.  It was unpopular with the Government when they were advocating the slaughter of calves and preaching the policy of self-sufficiency. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has exploded that policy in a recent speech.</P>

      <P>It is touching on the proposal that, if we do not rear the calves, we will not have anything for export.  It is all hinging on the policy that if the calves are slaughtered, we will have nothing to export.  In a recent statement, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;We must export or perish.  Our adverse trade balance in 1946 was over £33,000,000 and to meet that demand we had to draw on capital, as the returns from exports and our interests from investments abroad would not meet the charge&rdquo;.  If this is our position in 1946, when we can get only a quarter of the goods we require, what will be the position in 1948 when we can import all the goods we can pay for?  If our calves are slaughtered and we have no cattle to export, our adverse trade balance may not be £33,000,000 but four times that amount. When it was £15,000,000 in the old days &mdash;I do not remember it ever going over £20,000,000 or there would be a great to-do about it&mdash;cattle were a big proportion of our export trade, so I do not know what the adverse balance may be when we have not the cattle.</P>
      <P>Certain people may find satisfaction when that occurs.  They were always denouncing the British and the paper money of England.  That will all be used up in a few years if this policy goes on and that may be a great satisfaction to those people.  Over 90 per cent. of our total exports is in the form of cattle, horses, poultry, rabbits and eggs.  Our cattle exports are steadily declining.  The total number exported to Britain and the Continent was 276,000 through Éire ports and 53,000 through Northern Ireland ports, together with a certain number&mdash;I do not know if it is on record&mdash;sent to be fed in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>If it were said in 1930 that, in the year 1946, our exports of cattle&mdash;which were then 800,000&mdash;would be reduced to 330,000 and that we would have no exports of sheep or lambs, of pigs or bacon or of butter; that we would not be producing enough of those commodities to feed our own population; that a fat 10 cwt. beast would be worth £20 more in the Dublin market than a British-bred beast would be worth in England; that we would be smuggling fat cattle across the border to feed our population here and that the Government would have to prohibit the export of the few pounds of beef we were sending to our friends in England, the man who would make that statement in 1930 would be laughed at and told he was a fool, that there was no sense in it and that it could not happen.  I am saying here now that the cattle trade is going down quickly and in a few years' time it will be a serious proposition unless the Minister takes some steps to alter it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had statements by the Minister and I think a few times by the Taoiseach and others about the millions that are being given for the relief of agriculture.  The Minister has spoken a lot about the £2,500,000 he is giving to the dairy farmers supplying the milk to the creameries. There is no truth in these statements whatsoever.  The farmers are not getting one solitary shilling out of these millions.  All these millions are being paid to keep food cheap for the <Col N="1749" /> manufacturers and the shopkeepers and the people living in the towns and cities.  The farmers are getting nothing out of it though they are paying their portion of it.  If the old rule of supply and demand operated in fixing prices, it would not be 1/2 per gallon that we would be getting for our milk, it would not be £3 per ton we would be getting for our wheat, it would not be £4 a ton we would be getting for our beet.  We would be getting more than twice these prices if it was a question of supply and demand such as operates in the case of manufacturers and others in connection with the sale of their goods.  Nobody can deny that if we were not controlled, and controlled at uneconomic prices, we would be much better off.  I am sure that some of the creamery representatives, if they speak here, will thank the Minister and the Government for their generosity in giving this extra price for milk.  I do not thank the Government. I think that the price they have given now should have been given eight years ago.  If any thanks are due it is to Senator Baxter and Senator Sweetman for their able advocacy of the farmers' case which persuaded the Minister to consent to examine the case made by them and I may say that I think the Minister had a tough job getting the Government to advance the price.  We can congratulate him on his success in that regard.  I am not asking the Minister to decide definitely on the proposals that I have put up here.  I ask him to consider the proposals and to do as he did in the last case, that is, if he thinks that matters are as serious as I have suggested, to consider putting up a scheme to prevent the slaughter of calves.  If he does this, I will withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>To have a discussion on this subject is to me very interesting indeed and accordingly, as a member of the same executive as Mr. Counihan, I second this motion.  I think he has, from his own point of view, made a very excellent case but I must say as one in contact with dairymen there is another side of the case to consider just as well.  I am almost as much opposed to the slaughter of calves as <Col N="1750" /> I am to compulsory tillage.  I hate the very idea of compulsion in a free country. My idea is to insist upon the Government devising and operating schemes upon such lines as the nation's best interests would demand.  If for the well-being of the community calves must be slaughtered in order that milk will go into the homes of the people I hope it is only a passing phase. Slaughtering of calves looks to me like cutting immature and unripened oats or taking out potatoes too soon.  I have yet to learn that there is not room in the country for every calf that is born in it.  There is an opinion prevailing that certain sections of the cattle trade want to utilise the poor districts to rear calves in order that the people on the richer lands can live lives of ease and opulence.  We all hear of the great grazing lands of Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  At the same time if milk is made sufficiently profitable you will have these rich lands devoted to it to the detriment of the poor lands where the younger cattle are reared.  We have to consider all these matters and I do not like to see us rushing at our fences. I would like to see us taking our time and considering the changes that are taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a lot in my 40 years' experience.  In 1903 I was secretary of the United Irish League. Then I came down to 1912 and I remember well being on a deputation to Mr. Redmond asking him to establish something like the Drogheda factory in order that our cattle might leave the country only as dead meat.  Then we came to the time of our own Government and we had various schemes implemented.  I remember myself going wholeheartedly for a scheme in 1933 against political opponents.  I was going to become a millionaire out of wheat growing.  Then, again, I came to what is called the moisture content and again I found I was on dangerous ground.  Now we have the slaughter of calves.  We certainly should not say to a man who finds it necessary to slaughter calves that he must not do so when we are not prepared to pay him for them.  We are told the pig trade is gone.  People whom I knew who reared thousands of pigs will not rear one at all now.  I am quite willing to <Col N="1751" /> say there are excuses.  The past winter has been severe and you cannot blame the Government for that.  At the same time since I came into this House I have been harping on the necessity for giving every possible encouragement to stall-feeding.  In stall-feeding the much-condemned bullock, to my mind, becomes the nation's greatest employer if he is well looked after and cared for through the winter and the spring.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether in favour of sending live cattle out of the country as I think much more could be done to mature them here and to have the offals converted into raw materials that are required for industry.  What has been happening is what has been going on for generations.  If economic conditions were to go back to the position that they were in some 30 years ago the cattle trade would disappear.  It would be unwise to rush to a decision without giving grave consideration to the various aspects of the question. The object should be to devise a scheme that would be of greatest benefit. Personally, I do not think the position of owners of calves should be prejudiced.  I should not like to have farmers rearing calves for the benefit of other people.  I do not like compelling people to slaughter calves, if at the end of three years these same calves could supply the manure that is now supplied by factories.  Manures can be imported more easily this year than in recent years, but the old system of having animals on the land was better for the country.</P>

      <P>Calves are being slaughtered in dairying districts and prior to the economic war thousands of them were exported by dealers. Buyers came to the southern markets for calves.  Those who own cattle always rear a certain number of calves and sell the others.  Senator Counihan does not suggest any way that would bring people from the Midlands and from the West to buy calves. There must be something wrong when buyers are not now coming to the markets for calves.  It cannot be due to the transport charges as they are not very high.  When there is no demand <Col N="1752" /> something has to be done with the calves that are not needed.</P>
      <P>The slaughter of calves has been going on as long as I can remember. A certain number of white calves were always slaughtered before being exported to England, and there never was any outcry about it.  The position of the dairy farmer has to be considered. He brings calves to the market in September or perhaps keeps others until May.</P>
      <P>At present some farmers find it very hard to feed the stock they have.  They complain that they are overstocked, and this motion would compel them to increase their stock.  If Senator Counihan could get buyers from the West and from the Midlands to buy more calves something might be done to solve this problem.  Many people have gone out of the dairying industry, not because of the price being paid for milk, but for other reasons.</P>
      <P>That is not altogether due to the price that is paid for milk, but rather to the difficulty of getting people to milk cows on Sundays.  Perhaps the difficulty that we are up against could be got over if Senator Counihan could provide us with a six-day cow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horan</NameTxt>
      <P>As an indication of how this question is viewed in the dairying counties, I would like to refer Senators to a resolution which was brought before the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture a week ago dealing with the slaughter of calves.  The only support the resolution got was from the proposer and the seconder.  I think that Senator Counihan is unduly alarmed about the position.  There is no danger of the cattle trade suffering from a scarcity of raw materials because of the fact that calves are not being reared.  What we are suffering from at present is a scarcity of feeding stuffs to feed the cattle that we have. There is something wrong, as far as the dairying counties are concerned.  In the old days they were generally overstocked. At that time farmers always reared their calves.  The price of dairy products was uneconomic then and one of the things which helped to keep the dairy farmer on his feet was the slight profit he made on rearing young stock. <Col N="1753" /> Another was the unpaid labour of the members of his own family.  One of these props has since been completely withdrawn, due to the uneconomic price for young stock.  In the past these calves were taken off the farmers' hands when they were from three weeks to six months old.  They started selling them about the 1st of May and were able to find plenty of buyers for them.  There are now no buyers for them.</P>
      <P>We have, therefore, the position in the South that we have a lot of yearling cattle which are difficult to sell. If Senator Counihan were to attend some of the fairs in the South he would find a surplus of these cattle and very few buyers to look at them.  While there seems to be a good price for the finished article, the gap between young stores or calves and the older class of cattle has widened considerably.  Who is going to tide the farmer over the period when his young cattle are most unprofitable to him?  For a long number of years the farmer was supplying cheap butter and cheap milk to the rest of the community.  I think the limit of his endurance is reached when he is asked to supply raw material for the cattle trade at his own expense. I do not believe there are as many of those calves being sold for slaughter as some people say.  I know a number are being sold.  What are the unfortunate men who have them to do with them? As a rule the dairy farmers in the South are men with small farms.  The big farmers have long since gone out of dairying.  The men with the small hillside farms of 15, 20 or 60 acres always kept their full complement of milch cows.  They are unable to keep young cattle until they reach an advanced stage.  If young cattle are not taken off their hands they are going to be confronted with a very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was our experience in the South last year?  Farmers in the Kerry area usually dispose of 50 per cent. of their cattle between the 1st of September and the middle of December. We all know the very inclement weather we had during the last harvest. It affected the Midlands as well as the South, but from the 1st of September <Col N="1754" /> the fairs in the South collapsed and there was nobody to buy the young cattle.  From one-third to one-half of them died.  Many farmers, as a result, were placed in a very serious position indeed, and I do not know what remedy is going to be found for them. It is not going to be found by rearing young cattle as Senator Counihan has suggested.  What guarantee can we have from the cattle trade that if the calves are reared they will be taken off our hands?  It is out of pure necessity and not because of any perversity on their part that southern farmers are selling their calves for slaughter. Normally, that is the last thing a dairy farmer would do.  I think that Senator Counihan is unduly alarmed about the position.  There are plenty of cattle on offer at our southern fairs, and I hope Senator Counihan will do his best to get buyers to take the cattle off the people's hands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I approach this motion with mixed feelings.  Generally I have a certain sympathy with the various policies advocated by Senator Counihan but, so far as this motion embodies a concrete recommendation, I, certainly, could not support it.  At the same time, it does draw attention to certain important facts and to the existence of certain very real problems affecting our economy in a most important way.  The first fact to be constantly kept in mind in this connection is that there are certain regions in the country which are relatively specialised in dairy production, especially the <Col N="1755" /> Limerick region.  In those regions the farmers normally produce considerably more calves than they are in a position to mature.  Consequently, they have to get rid of them fairly young in some shape or form.  There are certain other areas in the country, with which Senator Counihan is more intimately associated than I&mdash;the dry stock farming regions&mdash;in which notoriously the farmers can and do mature considerably more young stock than they hitherto attempted, or than, they say, they would be in a position to rear.  Consequently, there is a certain natural interdependence between the dry stock farming regions and the dairying regions and an important part of the raw material of the dry stock farming regions comes from the dairying districts. If, for any reason, that part of the raw material of the dry stock farming regions should cease to come, it would make a substantial difference to the total farming output in those regions and, if nothing were done to counteract it, it would make a difference to the total national income. Therefore, Senator Counihan does draw attention to a very real problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the dimensions of that problem, nearly half the cows of the country are cows the milk of which finds its way to a creamery, but there remain another 500,000 or 600,000 cows which are not associated with creameries.  I imagine that the calf-slaughtering phenomenon has not yet affected those areas where the milk of the cows is not sent to a creamery. Consequently, the dry stock farming regions might reasonably hope to continue to get raw material, in the form of young cattle, from those parts of the country where creameries do not exist. At worst, half, but not more than half, the raw material of the dry stock regions might be cut off if every single calf produced in the dairying regions should have its throat cut soon after birth.  I do not think that that is at all likely to happen.  It is a case of a few thousand calves and I do not think it is likely to be a case of a few tens of thousands of calves.  There, again, perhaps the Minister would give us some information to add to that which Senator Counihan has already <Col N="1756" /> given us.  To what extent has the slaughter of calves actually proceeded in recent months.  Is it a matter of 5,000 or 10,000 calves or is it a matter of 50,000?  If it is a matter of only a few thousand, then it is a very trifling phenomenon and need not worry us unduly. But if it is a matter of 50,000 or 100,000, it would be a serious state of things, for which we might have to think out some policy which would have the effect of counteracting it.  I should also like to know what kind of calves they are which are being slaughtered. If they are mainly calves of specifically dairying breeds which, in no conceivable circumstances, could be worth much as store cattle, then I think their death is inevitable and, from an economic point of view, not at all regrettable.  If they are Friesian calves much the same consideration would apply.</P>
    <P>I understand that, to some extent, farmers in the south-west have been going over to Friesian cattle.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us to what extent dairying interests in the south-west are going into Friesian cattle and if it is the policy of his Department to encourage them to do so to the extent of discouraging the dual-purpose cow which, hitherto, has been characteristic of farming in practically every part of the country.  If the policy is to be to encourage the dairying regions to specalise in Friesian or other specifically dairying cattle, then, to that extent, we have introduced a completely new factor in our whole agricultural economy.  We shall have to think out the repercussions of that and recommend something which will enable the rest of the country to adapt itself to that very revolutionary change.  If the 500,000 dual-purpose animals now in the creamery districts were, in the course of ten or 15 years, to become nothing but Friesian cattle and nothing else happened, to that extent we should lose several hundred thousand potential store or fat cattle in the year, because the progeny of these specifically dairying cattle are not worth a hoot from the point of view of people like Senator Counihan.  The surplus males would have to be killed and the surplus females would have to be killed, or exported, <Col N="1757" /> as soon as the total number of Friesian cattle in the country had reached saturation point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the policy suggested in this motion, I think it is quite impractical. There is no use in saying to the farmers: &ldquo;You must not kill your calves, and if you do, we will penalise you&rdquo;, because there is the old proverb: &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill but needest not strive officiously to keep alive.&rdquo;  The farmer might perhaps not kill, but he certainly will not strive officiously to keep his calves alive, unless it is worth his while financially to do so.  The real solution of the problem is to create, if we can, such a situation as will make it worth the while of the farmers to rear these calves, assuming that they are the kind of calves that would be of interest in the dry stock farming regions. In that connection, I believe it is true to say that the relative price of calves, of yearling calves, in the dairying regions, bears unfavourable comparision with the price of two-and three-years-old calves.  The calves which somehow manage to survive to be about 12 months old in a mainly dairying region are not, apparently, in demand by people like Senator Counihan, and are picked up remarkably cheaply.  They are then carried on for another year or so, and when they come within shouting distance of the relatively high price of stores exported to England, they suddenly leap up in value, and if they are any good at all, command very high prices at the two-and three-years-old age.</P>
    <P>As things are at present, there seems to be a lack of organisation in the cattle trade which causes too low a price to be offered for these young cattle between six months and a year old and which makes it not attractive to the producers to keep them to that age.  An ordinary calf will consume from 40 to 50 gallons of milk in its early life which at 1/- per gallon means that it will cost the farmer at least £2 or £3 in the value of milk consumed before he has the calf weaned.  And what will be the value of the calf to him at that stage?  Unless it is worth a good deal more than £3 to him, the temptation to kill it rather than to feed it will be <Col N="1758" /> very strong.  I think you will find that in the south-west, during last winter, anyway, a great many calves approaching a year old were not worth more than £5 or £6, and yet, possibly, these calves, if they had been well done and properly fed, might well have been worth £10 or £12 if only they had been able to get a market where they were in demand.  I do not know why they do not get there&mdash;whether it is a transport problem or whether the cattle trading interests are not interested in buying calves so young; but whatever the nature of the problem may be, there is a case for trying to bring about a situation in which the demand for cattle at all ages will be better distributed, both regionally and temporally.</P>
    <P>Another factor in the case which I hope is only temporary is the scarcity of feed for cattle of all ages which characterised the country, last winter especially.  The grazing last year was bad, and the weather was bad, with the result that the grass had not the same nourishing quality as it had in a normal year, and consequently, milk, even in the summertime last year, was scarce, and it was possible to make hay into really first-class hay during only one fortnight in the year.  Any hay made in any other fortnight was bound to be more or less lacking in nourishment and some of it was scarcely fit for bedding.  Consequently, farmers, in the south-west especially, were faced with the certainty that they would be short of feeding supplies for their live stock all winter, and, that being so, it was a natural tendency to conserve that limited amount of feed for their more valuable animals and not to waste any of it on young stock of doubtful prospective value.  That phenomenon is, I hope, only a temporary one, and the ultimate solution of the problem is to produce more feed for stock, both young and old, especially from more and better grass, and more and better hay and silage.  If there were plenty of feed for stock, both young and old, I think the disposition to slaughter calves would be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us whether, as a matter of fact, the dairying <Col N="1759" /> regions in the south-west are going over to Friesian cattle or not, and whether he is going to encourage them to abandon the dual purpose animal and go over to Friesian cattle or not.  If it is public policy to go over to Friesian cattle, I think we shall have to encourage the dry stock farmers to replace these missing potential store animals by rearing a large number of calves of their own, which would mean a revolution in their economy.  They would have to keep considerably more cows per 100 acres than they are now in the habit of keeping and perhaps do a great deal more mixed farming than they have recently been in the habit of doing.  Maybe it would not be a bad thing for the country if they did mix their farming rather more than has hitherto been traditional, but, at all events, it would be desirable that the implications of a policy of going over to Friesians in the south-west should be faced and realised by the rest of the country and by the Government. In my own view, it would be a good thing if more calves were reared in the dry stock farming regions, especially as, in such regions, the calves reared would probably be of the beef breeds&mdash;more Herefords, more Polled-Angus and more beef Short-horns&mdash;and I think it is true to say that calves born, reared and finished in the rich east midland areas will produce younger and better beef in a shorter time than the kind of animal that originates in Limerick and is bandied about the country from fair to fair and ends up as a three-year-old beast somewhere in Meath or Kildare.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, my own limited experience of these matters is altogether in favour of the animal born, reared and finished on an east-midland farm, and I am told by people in the trade that while they cannot very well do without the Limerick calves, they very much prefer calves from other parts of the country, where calves are treated with greater consideration and more kindness, and are better fed than the ordinary Limerick calf is fed during the first six months of its life, even when it manages to survive, so that if we could replace these Limerick animals, <Col N="1760" /> which frequently are no great catch when they reach the east-midland areas, with other calves of specifically beef quality reared in the east-midlands, it might not be a bad thing, from the long-term point of view, for the economy of the country; perhaps then, if this calf slaughtering phenomenon has come to stay, and if in any case it is inevitable by reason of a change-over to Friesian stock, the ultimate solution of the problem is more calves of specific beef breeds, reared in the east-midlands, and I should like to hear what Senator Counihan has to say about the possibility and the desirability of that policy and what the Minister's attitude would be to a policy of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister would excuse me if I asked a question, quite frankly, out of the depths of my ignorance?  My only excuse would be that, out of the similar depths of their ignorance, a lot of people are asking the same question and looking for an answer, which no doubt the Minister will be able to give very simply and very clearly.  When I and a lot of other people were young, this country was flowing with milk and butter.  There was a superfluity of these commodities.  Milk, butter and cheese were to be had almost for the asking, and we exported them.  Now, we cannot get them for love or money. For a certain large amount of money, we can get a very small ration.  There is a simple question to which, I assume, there is a perfectly simple answer, or perhaps several answers, but the answer to it has not yet percolated down to the townspeople of a similar depth of ignorance as myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure from what Senator Johnston has said that a good deal of it can be accounted for by reason of the fact that we are short of artificial manures, and especially phosphates.  I do not know whether that answers the whole question, but, if that is so and is likely to remain so, what are we doing about it?  Are we making sufficient experiments with large-scale composting such as the Indore system which was quite successful in India?  Are we utilising adequately the sewage resources of our great cities, remembering that the <Col N="1761" /> whole of Chinese agriculture through-out the centuries has depended upon the proper utilisation of human manure?  Do we remember that the import of phosphate rock is a comparatively recent thing and that in the 18th century they were able nearly to double the weight of their beasts and of their products by applying their minds to improved farming?</P>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to think that I am asking these questions in any heckling spirit.  I am asking them because I really want to know the answer.  If there is one question members of the Seanad are being continually asked by the man in the street, it is this: &ldquo;What has become of our milk, of our butter, of our meat? They are all of a fantastic price and very little of them, yet we were brought up to regard ourselves as the greatest cattle breeding and dairying country in Europe&rdquo;.  If the Minister can assist me to answer this question when I am next asked, which will probably be twice in the course of to-morrow, I will be under a great personal obligation to him.  I can assure him that it is not an unreasonable question.  The slaughter of calves may not have anything to do with it and may be only an excuse for asking the question, or it may have something to do with it. I say with perfect honesty and humility that I will be glad to escape from the embarrassment to which I might be put in not being able to answer such a very obvious question.</P>

      <P>I have really no idea of what I am going to say, for the very good reason that I had no idea as to what Senator Counihan was going to say until he said it.  But before I say anything else, let us see what this problem is, if one may call it a problem.  I take it we are talking not so much about the posers which Senator Kingsmill Moore has put to me as about the slaughter of calves.  In the first place, there is nothing very alarming in what is taking place.  I have the numbers here and it is better that we should know the extent to which it is going on before we proceed to give reasons why it is happening and before <Col N="1762" /> we ask ourselves if it is sufficiently serious to warrant our taking any action, whether along the lines suggested in the motion or in any other way.</P>
      <P>The figures are fairly large, but they are not alarming.  For 1942 the number was 11,000 odd; for 1943, 4,422; for 1944, 10,626; for 1945, 36,189; for 1946, 29,699; and for 1947 up to the end of April, 31,649.  We must remember, of course, that these six months of 1947 cover the main portion of the year in which the slaughter policy is resorted to.  I imagine that the figure for 1947 will not be much greater than that for 1945.</P>

      <P>There are some slaughtered for home use, but I have not got those figures.  In the Seanad recently, when discussing a motion dealing with the price of milk, I gave the number of cows.  The cow population has consistently, over a number of years, remained fairly steady around the figure of 1,250,000.  When you take that figure and the figure for our export of cattle in any one year, which is in the neighbourhood of 500,000, when you think of the number of cattle exported as dressed meat and the number converted into canned meat, when you think of the number used here at home, the total for last year will work out somewhere in the neighbourhood of 915,000 &mdash; something short of 1,000,000.  After all, the slaughter of 36,000 calves is a very small matter where figures of those dimensions are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to consider the motion seriously or take seriously the arguments advanced by Senator Counihan in favour of it.  When we were discussing milk prices here some weeks ago, I moved into this field during the course of the discussion and referred to this problem.  I invited Senator <Col N="1763" /> Counihan, who is interested in the cattle business, as we all are, and those who think like him in terms of the type of farming in which he is engaged, to apply their minds to a solution of the problems to which I referred. Somehow or other, no matter how keen or how genuine my invitation to take up the running along the lines I suggested, Senator Counihan and those for whom he speaks will always look for some other way out.  They will always look for some way out that is not available to them or to me or to anybody else.  In proof of what I am saying and challenging against them I would remind the Seanad that very recently, a few weeks in fact, after I came into office, I invited tenders for the supply of canned meat for Europe from the canning factories here.  I received certain tenders which I decided to accept.  The contract was distributed amongst canning concerns and they or their agents moved into the market to buy their cattle.  The contract provided for the purchase of certain types of cattle but it had hardly reached the ear of the public that such contracts had been entered into than Senator Counihan and the Cattle Traders' Association came hot-foot to the Minister for Agriculture, just to tell him what he should do about it, just to warn him as to the harm, as to the injustice that he was likely to do the cattle trade and just to invite him to take counsel and advice from them and to move cautiously fearing that when Senator Counihan and his friends were proceeding to look for their store cattle in the month of March, when the storms had blown by, cattle would be there in abundance for them.  They would then be able to walk through the fairs and see to what extent cattle carried the necessary condition on their backs and they would be free to accept and reject, after using their own excellent judgment.  But there was never a word or a thought about what was going to happen to the farmers who had these small little cattle, not good enough in condition for the export trade, but carrying a certain amount of flesh that would now be, God knows where, if they had not been converted into tinned meat then and these cattle <Col N="1764" /> would have consumed a good deal of the food that, at least, kept alive some of the cattle that are still alive.</P>
    <P>I told Senator Counihan and his friends who visited me exactly what the Senator from Kerry told him and us now, that there was here a problem that the midland farmers were just refusing to recognise, that there was no use in their talking or regretting here or in any other place because expressions of regret would not find a solution for the type of farmer to whom Senator Horan and Senator Corkery referred, all these men depending mainly on the production of milk whose farms are small and who do not want to slaughter a calf.  I agree with those who say that it is the last thing in the world a farmer wants to do.  I would even go so far as to say that a farmer would be inclined to incur reasonable losses rather than have to engage in the slaughter of a calf.  But when those farmers who are confined to a limited area and are dependent upon the dairying industry for a living realise that they are going to lose substantially on the wintering and rear ing of calves, there is no use in our thinking there is any means by which we can compel them not to do what they have decided to do, nor would there be any justice in it if we could do it.</P>
    <P>The one thing that is inclined to rule me in a discussion of this nature, although I suppose it is meant in a harmless way and I should not take exception to it, is this talk about the desirability or undesirability of our feeding John Bull.  I will feed any man: the farms of this country will feed any man, any men or any people.  There is no objection to John Bull or to anybody else.  It is a question for the farmers and especially for the type of farmers to whom Senator Counihan has been addressing himself.  It is a question for them and they will do what pays them best.  I say here that there is too much selfishness.  If I did not use the expression on the occasion of the motion dealing with the milk prices I use it now and I say there is too much selfishness by far on the part of those who own the lands that are capable of converting aged cattle into beef <Col N="1765" /> in a short time.  There has always been too much selfishness on their part.</P>
    <P>When they talk about this subject, they have no thought for the very small man whose land was covered with cattle all winter for which he could not get a market while they, because they would not winter cattle, were free to take advantage of the high prices of hay and feeding-stuffs.  They could put in their hay to the Dublin market and get most attractive prices for it because of the severity of the winter and at the same time have their land nicely covered by the month of April with not a hole or a puddle in it.  There was no rush down to the store areas on St. Patrick's Day as there used to be because the weather had not cleared sufficiently to give them the kind of security that they would require.</P>
    <P>I am not talking on this question because I am Minister for Agriculture. I should not have any prejudices, nor have I, but if I have shown in what I have said, or in the course of what I intend to say that I have a particular prejudice in favour of one type of farmer as against another, it is because I am prejudiced against the type of selfishness &mdash; I call it selfishness &mdash; displayed by Senator Counihan and those for whom he speaks.  I say here in the most deliberate way that they are not serious in this, never have been, and that they should look around for a solution of this problem.  That solution is not along the lines portrayed in the motion.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator McGee was seconding the motion or not.  I do not know if he were speaking in favour of it.  I do not know if the Senator was for or against the motion. His attitude was a sort of níl agus tá. Anyway, he put the motion in order as far as the Chair was concerned, and I suppose that was something.  I think Senator McGee went on to talk &mdash; or was it Senator Counihan?&mdash;of the plight in which we find ourselves, with a scarcity of meat, a scarcity of bacon, a scarcity of milk, a scarcity of butter and of commodities to which Senator Kingsmill Moore referred.  Senator <Col N="1766" /> McGee does not like compulsion: neither does Senator Counihan.  They only like compulsion for a farmer down in Cork with 25 or 30 acres of land which is jammed up with milch cows, a bit of tillage as well as ducks, drakes and geese.  It is a case of just a little bit of compulsion for that farmer, but at the same time Senator Counihan or Senator McGee do not like compulsion.  In their view compulsion is bad, and a farmer should be allowed to do what he likes.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan and the people for whom he speaks in this House, and perhaps outside it, talk about the shortages.  How were these shortages to be provided against for the last seven years?  I suspect Senator Counihan knows, yet the class for whom he speaks, if they have a bloodstock mare roaming about their fields would, on that ground, want exemption from tillage for a couple of hundred acres. They do not like compulsion except when it applies to men who are jammed into small farms.  At the same time they deplore the shortages of meat and butter, and talk about cattle coming across the Border to supply the Dublin market.  How does Senator Counihan think we are going to have meat for the Dublin market when people with land were unable to get imported feeding stuffs for their animals or for human beings?  How do they think we will have cattle for the Dublin market unless they till their land?</P>
    <P>I think there has been a good deal of play-acting about this matter.  We are told that we have 11,000,000 or 12,000,000 acres of land, and of the demands made for compulsory tillage. We had pleas to have the tillage Orders amended.  These people avail of every conceivable excuse to seek exemption.  They are the very people in this House who know that during the past seven years we could not get feeding stuffs for man or beast.  They know that the only way in which we could provide for ourselves was by tilling our land.  Yet these are the people who come here and complain that in this agricultural country there are shortages of bacon, butter and eggs. How are we going to get these things <Col N="1767" /> unless those for whom Senator Counihan speaks stand up and do their job? They complain of the injustice of having to till land and, in the same breath, complain of shortages.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan talked about a particular type of farmer, in whose welfare he is keenly interested, and complained that he is paying the major portion of the subsidy given to the dairying industry.  The greatest shame of all is to have many of the farmers for whom Senator Counihan speaks lining up at their grocers to get their ration of butter across the counter, just the same as any ordinary labouring man, rather than keeping, at least, a sufficient number of cows to give milk and butter for themselves, their families and their workmen.  A man in my position should not have any prejudices. Neither have I.  But I dislike the kind of selfishness that I can detect, not only since I assumed office but for many years, in the frame of mind, in the sort of approach, the type of argument and the fear to which Senator Counihan and his friends give expression from time to time.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore wanted to know why it was that people were asking him every day in the week why there was a shortage of butter in a butter and milk-producing country. That, of course, has been explained very often.  I do not suppose that even another explanation is likely to sink into the minds of those people.  Butter is scarce and short in this country because more butter is being consumed here than previously.  All that Senators have to do is to go back for ten years and look at the figures for production. Let them take, on the one hand, the quantity of butter produced from 1936 to 1946, and on the other, the figures for consumption.  When other fats went off the market in 1939, the consumption of butter gradually reached the point that, as far as creamery butter is concerned, we were capable of using it all, and more if we had it.  If bacon had been more plentiful that scarcity, of course, would not have shown itself to the same extent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we cannot control that.  I do not want to go into a discussion on that.  I hope I could give a lucid explanation of it.  It is a long and tedious sort of history.  All that I can say is that the actual production of butter, both farmers' and creamery butter, has not declined to any appreciable extent.  Because of the price of butter, because of the unavailability of other fats, of the scarcity of margarine and of bacon, of the price of mutton and a number of other factors, because butter is a valuable food and because of Govern ment policy to peg butter prices down &mdash; all these made it an attractive pro position from the consumer's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator Counihan and the farmers and land owners whom he represents, had shown a keener tendency to cooperate without the introduction of compulsion to the extent to which it had to be introduced in order to pro duce the necessary feedings stuffs to enable us to increase the pig population, they would have made a very substantial contribution indeed.  One would think, listening to Senator Counihan and Senator McGee, that one could feed a pig on air.  Of course, they do not want to understand these things. In the main, all they want is to have a brood mare roaming their lands.  She may happen to produce a winner.  I have no objection to that type of industry, but I object to have it followed for the purpose of evading one's responsibilities in a time of crisis such as this.  I object, if those people <Col N="1769" /> engage in that kind of business and at the same time come into this House and complain about these shortages.</P>
    <P>As long as I am in my present office &mdash; be it long or short &mdash; I want to be of the greatest possible assistance to the farming community.  I want to do everything I can to help the agricultural industry.  I know what the farmer's mind is, and what his attitude is.  I know what his desires are.  I know the things that are distasteful to him.  I know the farmers who, because of their geographical position or of the nature of the soils they own, have to work hardest.  I want to say here in the most deliberate fashion that I have no prejudices.  I am just as fond of the cattle trade as Senator Counihan.  It is the greatest nonsense for Senator Counihan or Senator McGee or other Senators to say that I want to feed John Bull.  My heart is as much in the cattle trade as is Senator Counihan's, and I will feed anybody.</P>
    <P>I will feed those who pay me best after I have first fed my own.  While I have no prejudices, my tendency, as long as I am Minister, must be to help to put in the forefront, by whatever encouragement or guidance I can give, those who have to work hardest.  They are the people Senator Counihan would compel to do something that they do not want to do, and that they do not find it a paying proposition to do.</P>
    <P>Senator Counihan would ask the Exchequer to give a bounty of £1,500,000 in the shape of 30/- per calf. I am assuming that about 1,000,000 calves are born every year, and that of that number about 35,000 are being slaughtered.  Senator Counihan, in order that he and those for whom he speaks, could go to bed and sleep quietly, knowing that the markets in March and April would be chock full of store cattle jumping out of their hides with feeding, in order that there would be an abundant supply of those cattle, wants the Exchequer to give a bounty of 30/- per calf on 1,000,000 calves, so that 35,000 of them would not be slaughtered in the winter months. That is the agricultural policy of Senator Counihan, and it is the agricultural policy&mdash;or is it?&mdash;of the Party <Col N="1770" /> with which he is associated.  I would love to know.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston put me a question which I was put in the <i>Irish Times.</i> It is very seldom they take any notice of me in the <i>Irish Times,</i> but once in a while they do.  I have been challenged in other places, more or less, to follow up a statement which I made in this House and outside.  I have no intention whatever of letting the matter rest where I left it when I last spoke on this subject here.  I shall not do anything hasty or hastily.  I intend to bring together the representatives of a number of interests in the form of a consultative council to give me what advice they can as to the best means of solving a problem which I believe exists, though other people may not agree with me.  I refer to the problem of helping the dairy farmers &mdash; in the main, the farmers of Munster and Kilkenny &mdash; to get a cow that will give them the best possible return. That is a long-term affair.  It is a matter of policy and one which, no matter what the decision, you cannot change in a short period.  However, I should like to have the advice of a number of those concerned.</P>
    <P>I intend to make the scope of the council which I propose to bring into existence very wide, so that we shall have the widest possible view on this matter.  Notwithstanding the protests of Senator Counihan and Senator McGee, I do think that these dairying districts have, to some extent, been burdened by our breeding policy.  It may have been a wise policy; I cannot say.  I am not prepared, until somebody produces very convincing reasons, to admit that it is a just policy.  All I can say to Senator Johnston is that I have not given encouragement to one side or the other.  I have made a statement and I have expressed my doubts.  I feel those doubts even more strongly since I gave expression to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have, as the result of that statement, focused attention on the question of releasing <Col N="1771" /> those in the business of milk production from the entanglements in which they found themselves over a long number of years.  As a result of that, I am more confirmed now in the belief which I held when I made that statement than I was then.  I have not since taken any action other than that of having a conference with my own live-stock inspectors.  I have now decided to bring this other body together and to be guided by the combined wisdom and advice which such a body can give on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the matter upon which I want them to assist me. I have the belief that, since our farmers have been accustomed to short-horn cattle, they will be inclined to stick with them.  I do not want to do anything that would seem to suggest that I was compelling them to take this road or that road.  If the belief which I hold is true &mdash; that these hard-working farmers have been burdened with a breeding policy&mdash;then my attitude is that I should do what I can to release them from those chains of bondage, without outraging their own feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who expect me to go rushing around making dramatic decisions on matters that are vital can be assured that I have no intention of doing so for the sake of being dramatic. I want to do what is right.  I came into this House without any notion as to the line I should take.  As I said at the outset, I came in rather sore because I could almost make the kind of case that was made for the motion, understanding the mentality <Col N="1772" /> behind it.  Because I understood the mentality behind the motion, I knew the arguments to which we should be called upon to listen, if one can describe them as arguments.  I may be a bit aggressive but, while I am here, I do not intend to let off anybody in whose mind I suspect there are lurking the sort of ideas I know are housed in the mind of Senator Counihan, without giving him a bit of my mind.  As I have said here on a previous occasion, they are entitled to use their land in whatever way they like.  They have been accustomed to using it in that particular way.  They dislike having to do any winter feeding &mdash; they feel it breaks the surface of their good grazing lands.  They have a number of excellent reasons, according to their own reckoning, for the course they are pursuing, and they can have these reasons as long as they wish, but they need not come to me and expect sympathy from me with the kind of agricultural policy which they, in their wisdom, pursue, because I believe in work.  I have been accustomed to work and I know what hard work is.  I know that the majority of our farmers who are giving us whatever milk and butter we have &mdash; let it be too little or too much, or let it be short or otherwise &mdash; work hard, and it is on them we must depend.  It is they who have done this job for us, and they are the people who are engaged in the type of farming which is most beneficial, in my opinion.  They are the type of people who must not, and will not, be interfered with by me while I am Minister, except when it is in the national interest to ask them and, where necessary, to force them, to undertake a certain job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strange thing about it is that these are the very farmers whom it is never necessary to force to do national work.  It is the type of farmer who is represented by Senator Counihan whom you must always be after.  If there is any compulsion, you must have the fields full of officials and you must have tractors, ploughs and everything else.  They are the type of people who talk about uneconomic farms, about small farms.  They seem to scoff at the idea of the farm of 25 or 30 acres, or even down as low as 15 acres.  They <Col N="1773" /> talk about mechanisation.  They have the only land that is capable of being mechanised, but the only mechanisation on it is the mechanisation of my Department &mdash; the mechanisation of officials breaking in through the gates to till their land.  The small farmer down in Cork, in Kerry, in Clare, the small farmer in Munster and Connaught who is feeding the cow and carrying on feeding the whole winter round, bringing the cans, the milk and the butter and keeping us going &mdash; it is this type of farmer that Senator Counihan talks about and invites me to compel to feed calves, so that, as I say, from 17th March to 14th May, the fairs will be brimful of store cattle which they can buy at will, and when the months of August, September and October come, the man with the small year-and-a-half or two-year-old beast will not be recognised and will have to go around pulling their coats and asking: &ldquo;Will you not buy this off me, and will you not buy that off me?&rdquo; only to get the reply: &ldquo;No, they are too young.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I have lost my patience to some extent, it is because I know there lurks there a selfishness which I will attack everywhere I see it.  I invite Senator Counihan and all those who profess to be interested, and who are no more interested than I am in the cattle trade, not to be gallivanting around looking for a little publicity about the danger of the slaughter of calves, a danger which in fact does not exist and which does not exist not because of any exertions on their part.  It does not exist because of the industry, because of the habits, because of the desire and the thrift, of these small, hardworking people who, as I said, often fed and reared these calves, even at times when they knew they were not a paying proposition, rather than slaughter them.  Let Senator Counihan, then, go out and get his Cattle Traders' Association and his farmers together and see what they can do, if there is a problem.  It does not exist yet, but a time may come when it could exist.  A time may come when the Munster farmers will say to themselves: &ldquo;We will produce milk because it pays us.  It is on milk we <Col N="1774" /> must live and we will get after the breed of cattle that will give the highest yield.&rdquo;  The time may come when they may make that decision and who is it who, in my position, would say: &ldquo;You shall not take that course&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I would, but I know quite well that Senator Counihan and his friends will toss that over in their minds for a long time before they engage in it.  It is along these lines rather than along the lines on which they are inviting me to travel that they would find a better solution. If I have not said enough, there is always another chance, so long as a man lives, and I am sure I will get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given me the answer on the subject of butter.  Does the same apply to milk?  Is it that milk consumption has gone up, while the supply has remained comparatively steady?  I have to pass on these answers and I want to get them right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must, first of all, look at the cow population. Everything is in order, so far as the cow population is concerned.  There has been no falling off, although there might be a change to the extent of 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000.  I have here the figures back as far as 1911, before this country was partitioned.  I have the figures for the whole country and I find that we had more cows in 1941-42 in the Twenty-Six Counties than we had in 1911 in the Thirty-Two Counties. That being the case, the shortages have not arisen from a falling off in the cow population.  Let us look then at the creamery butter production figures.  We have here about 1,250,000 cows.  The milk of about 600,000 &mdash; I am giving round figures &mdash; of that number is being sent to creameries.  Therefore, we can only control the butter produced from the milk of these 600,000 cows, out of 1,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> The production of butter in 1941-42 was 658,283 cwts.; in 1943-44, it was 603,265 cwts.; in 1944-45 it was 576,575 cwts.; in 1945-46 it was 605,949 cwts.  In 1927 the home consumption of creamery butter was 232,271 cwts.; in 1943-44 it was 605,238 cwts.  In 1927 the export of butter was 419,000 cwts. odd; in 1943-44 it was nil.  If you look at those tables and take the number of cows for 20 years, the production of butter from the creameries for 20 years, the home consumption for 20 years and the export of butter for 20 years, the explanation is quite simple.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there is the question of milk.  I am satisfied about the butter.  There is also a shortage of milk and I want to know whether the answer is the same &mdash; that the consumption of milk has gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The consumption of milk in Dublin has increased by 50 per cent. in the last 5 or 6 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>And the supply is relatively stable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As a matter of fact, the supply has gone up.  Of course, last winter those who were engaged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for people here to talk, but the men engaged in the production of milk and trying to keep up the supply, with contracts to fill, experienced difficulties no one can fully realise.  There is a great deal of loose talk here in relation to a number of matters.  Some of it is quite innocent, some of it rather deliberate. There is to be found a legitimate explanation for everything and that explanation has its roots in the simple problem which I have set here &mdash; that is, the amount of land under the plough and what it gives us, the amount that it takes to feed ourselves, to give us sugar, potatoes, and so on.  It is on that we must depend for everything and those who in one breath talk about shortages and in the next talk about compulsion &mdash; but only when it is being applied to the tilling of their land &mdash;<Col N="1776" /> are the people who put up a case for which I have no respect and they are the people for whom I have no sympathy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>While Senator Counihan is feeling whether he has any bone that is not broken or collecting his senses after the lacerating he got from the Minister &mdash; it is fair to say he has got it on the chin&mdash;I would like to refer to a few items mentioned in the debate previous to the Minister's speech and mentioned by the Minister also.  We have the fact that there are 1,250,000 milch cows in the country and that we had only 1,000,000 calves per year.  The aims and objects of the profession to which I belong are to have 1,250,000 calves per year.  We want to have a calf per cow per year.  That would mean, in our present economy, another 250,000 calves to slaughter. That is the correct way to have it. Otherwise, we should be able to feed these extra 250,000 calves.  I agree entirely that Senator Counihan's motion is a most selfish one.  He wants the people who produce the 1,000,000 calves at present, or the optimum of 1,250,000, to feed them for one or two years, until they are at the age to be placed on the rich lands of Meath, to put the last cwt. of flesh on them for sale in the export market.  I am delighted to find that I agree with what Senator Johnston has said.  I have often disagreed with him up to this, but he has pointed out to Senator Counihan one of the ways to remove this problem &mdash; by producing more of the type of stock he requires on the land of Meath itself, or else bring the calves from Cork, Limerick and Kerry and rear them until they are ready to be sold.  He can do that from, say, three to four weeks old.  I have seen the trade of selling dropped calves, but it is not the proper thing to sell dropped calves. A calf must get whole milk for three weeks and a portion of whole milk for a further five or six weeks.  The selling of dropped calves means further casualties, but from three weeks on, farmers like Senator Counihan could to some extent provide for rearing them away from the land where they are produced, which is not sufficient to feed the remainder of the dairy cows.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> The production of milk per cow has been at an average of 400 to 500 gallons.  We get various estimates of that.  Taking what is consumed at home and fed to calves, it is up to an average of 500 gallons per cow, which is a low production for the country as a whole.  Limerick is the county, with its short milking periods produced on grass, that gives the highest milk production. If the cows in Limerick and the cows generally in the country were properly fed during the winter period, that production would be up 100 gallons per cow per year.  That would mean that we would get 100 gallons extra with the same cow population. Otherwise, people will say we should have more cows.  There should be no necessity for more cows, if we increase the production per cow by 100 gallons.</P>
    <P>There are other factors, but the Cathaoirleach might rule me out of order if I refer to the elimination of disease and the prevention of sterility. That is the reason why a certain number do not produce every year.  The slaughter of calves is natural when the material is not there to feed them, unless they are taken by the people who have the material elsewhere to feed them.  I do not know whether they had a whole lot this year.  The fact is that they must rear these calves when the producers cannot do so themselves. They want to feed the milch cows to produce, and you cannot rear calves without milk, and when the farmer who is producing milk is getting a better price for it and must try to give every gallon into the creameries or produce butter on his own farm to feed the community, it is up to somebody else to try to help to rear the calves and fatten them for the stock market. Senator Counihan talked about hating compulsion, but this means compelling the farmer to feed his calves to the State when they would be suitable for his trade.</P>
    <P>In the portion of Cork from which I come, it is not the practice to slaughter calves.  The farmer, no matter how he manages it, will feed them in some way or other&mdash;and the Leas-Chathaoirleach can verify that.  The slaughter of dropped calves and calves a couple of <Col N="1778" /> weeks old is not practised at all.  The gentleman whom Senator Ó Corcora referred to, Mr. Kelleher of Macroom, has a factory in which these calves are slaughtered under supervision of the Minister's officials.  The trade is perfectly legitimate and beneficial to the farmers of that district and the district of Limerick generally, when it is not economical to keep all the calves and rear them until the time at which the gentlemen who want to feed them on the grass lands of Meath has arrived. There is no other outlet but to slaughter them at an early age or get somebody else to feed them, to bring them to the age at which they are suitable for the type of trade that Senator Counihan represents.  It is selfishness for these people to consider themselves all the time and I think I will conclude with that.</P>

      <P>With the Minister in his present frame of mind I think there is not much use in my speaking or putting forward any suggestions on behalf of the cattle trade.  I would like to remind the Minister that we in the cattle trade have had dealings with his two predecessors, the late Mr. Paddy Hogan and Dr. Ryan.  They were always anxious to have our advice on anything in connection with the cattle trade but when the Minister comes to the House and attributes selfishness to my motion I must say that he is under a grave misapprehension.  The cattle trade is the most honourable and unselfish body of people in the whole country.  They are giving their time and their money trying to forward the interest of the trade and the country which means the interests of the nation.  When I put down this motion I did so not from a selfish point of view but from a national point of view. We could see from our own experience and from reports from all over the country what was happening; the fairs are only a quarter in size of what they used to be and the numbers of cattle are declining.  We could see our cattle which were recognised as the best live stock in the world declining to vanishing point.  When we put this up to the Minister he showers all the abuse he can on the trade.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> It is most undignified for a Minister to use the expressions he used here this evening.  I was not at the last interview but I understand that the cattle trade will not trouble him very much in the future because of his attitude. I think the cattle trade will leave the Minister and his Department severely alone in the future.  He accuses the cattle trade of coming to him last November to put forward pleas in regard to the canning of cattle for export as a gift to the Continent but their sole and only object in going to him was to point out the position of the beef trade and what was likely to develop and to ask him to stagger the contract or postpone it for a short time.  That was the only suggestion they made to him.  I told my colleagues in the cattle trade that the Minister appeared more abrupt in his manner than he really is and does not mean all he says.</P>

      <P>At the same time I want to remind the Minister that the organisation which I represent has been complimented by the Vocational Organisation Commission which heard evidence from the different vocations. The comment of the Most Rev. Dr. Browne, Bishop of Galway, was that what we were doing for the cattle trade was an example for other organisations and vocations to follow.  The Minister does not think much of that but that statement of Dr. Browne's is on record. The Minister is going to do a lot of things for the cattle trade.  He is going to wipe out a section of it.  The only thing I suggest and I believe it should be done as a matter of policy is that the creameries should not be allowed to sell skimmed milk for manufacturing purposes.  It should go back to the farmers.  If one did not take it there would be many others who would and use it for the purpose of rearing calves, pigs and poultry. <Col N="1780" /> Separated milk is a most useful food and instead of allowing it to go for manufacturing purposes it should be diverted back to the farmers for feeding purposes.  I think I am justified in that and the Minister will change his mind about it later on when he sees that it would be in the interests of the country that this milk should not be used for powdering and for making chocolate.  The Minister has his back up against the cattle trade and there is no use in my saying anything about it now.  He may change his opinion about it later on and I hope he will.</P>
      <P>Senator Horan and Senator McCabe spoke about the small demand for young stock.  I admit there is very little demand for young stock.  The Minister wants the graziers to use the good fattening land for rearing calves and year-and-a-halves. To my mind that is a silly proposal to make.  These calves usually went round in a cycle.  First they went up to Tipperary and perhaps back to Galway and Clare and finally after being reared and fed on the land that is not suitable for fattening and on land on which they would never get fat even if left on it for one and a half or two years they came along to the good land.  And it is well to realise that the proportion of land we have fit to fatten cattle is limited.  If the Minister thinks that it would be in the national interest that this limited quantity should be used for rearing calves and producing milk I think his policy is &ldquo;boloney&rdquo;.  I may be able to induce the cattle trade and the Minister to come together some day because I think it would be in the national interest.  We can give the Minister and his Department some advice still, but if the Minister wants to put his head in the air and say that he does not want the cattle trade he can have it that way.</P>
