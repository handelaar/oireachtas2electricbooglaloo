      <P>If the only matter of any urgency on the Order Paper is No. 1, the Agricultural Credit Bill, it is a pity you had not noticed in time that it would not be taken, as, if you had, there would be no necessity for any meeting at all.  In the present situation with regard to transport, both from the point of view of expense and inconvenience, it is rather unfair to have a meeting of the House when there is no need for it.  One would imagine that the business could be so arranged &mdash;I am not saying it has anything to do with you, of course&mdash;that we would meet only when we had something to do.  I am a Dublin person and it makes no difference to me, but from the point of view of country people and the expense and inconvenience, it seems to me to be very bad management and very unfair.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Senator says.  I am always desirous of so arranging business that inconvenience may not be caused, but <Col N="1494" /> we had not notice of the postponement until Friday afternoon, when the Provisional Order Paper had gone out. Even then, the notice was not definite, and it was only on Saturday that we learned that it would not be possible to take the Bill this week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a question on this, which the Minister promised to consider, was there not?  It was with regard to the council reporting on the circumstances of its award and the losses occasioned to the individual being rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did consider that, but I did not think it was necessary to bring in an amendment. There are several objections to doing so.  First of all, I am of opinion that this committee ought to concern itself with the deeds of bravery&mdash;with the giving of the certificate or medal&mdash; and that anything in the way of remuneration could be considered afterwards by the Minister, or even before. <Col N="1495" /> Because of the constitution of the committee the members might meet only at certain times.  They come from different parts of the country.  There is one Cork representative.  For example, a man might have lost a suit of clothes in performing a deed of bravery.  That might want to be attended to immediately.  Even though an award of a certificate or medal might not be considered in his case, the man might have suffered a certain amount of damage to his clothing in his attempt to save life.  As the Bill stands, the Minister for Justice would be at liberty to go to the Minister for Finance and ask him to give compensation. That, I think, is one of the principal reasons why we should not do what the Senator asks.  The principal objection in my mind is that I do not want to associate the two things: the actual award of the certificate or medal for a deed of bravery and the compensation. I think that the award for the deed of bravery should stand on its own.  The compensation is another matter.  It is a matter that the Minister might deal with, apart from what the committee may think.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, therefore, that the Minister's point is that Section 5 covers the matter that was raised.  It leaves the individual who may have suffered damage to deal directly with the Minister for Justice. Is that so?</P>

      <P>The real trouble under Section 5 is that &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; will be interpreted to mean &ldquo;any T.D.&rdquo; That will simply add to the troubles of T.D.s and, possibly, of Senators.  It is not a very desirable thing, because there will be an endeavour to get something for a constituent.  That is why I was endeavouring to make the council responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to make provision during a period of three years for the clearance of additional quantities of rum for home consumption by reducing the maturity age of spirits of this description from five years to three years.  At the same time the opportunity is being availed of to consolidate the existing enactments dealing with the delivery of immature spirits, viz., the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Acts, 1915 and 1926, under which home-made spirits or foreign spirits (including rum, but excluding geneva and liqueurs) are ineligible for delivery for normal home consumption unless they are at least five years old. A clause dealing with definitions is also included.  A large proportion of supplies from abroad, which are being imported in increasing quantities, consists of rum over three years but under five years old, and thus under the existing law not eligible for home consumption. Before the decision to introduce this Bill was taken, the main distilling interests in this country were <Col N="1498" /> consulted and they intimated their agreement with the proposed reduction of the maturity age in respect of rum, provided the concession was limited to a period of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points on this Bill in reference to which I should like to have some information.  I am not an authority on the subject and, therefore, I shall concern myself with only two or three points.  In the first place, the Bill provides for the re-enactment of the 1915 Act.  I cannot see the purpose of that provision in the Title, inasmuch as the Schedule provides for the repeal of the whole of the 1915 Act.  It seems to me most ambiguous to commence your Title by saying that the Act has for its purpose the re-enactment of a statute which was passed by the British Parliament in 1915 and then, in the Schedule, to proceed to repeal the whole of that Act.  I do not suppose it makes much difference.  To me, it does not seem obvious that there is a difference but I cannot understand the procedure followed unless there is, in fact, some difference.  I should like if the Minister would clear up that point and tell us why he describes this as an Act to re-enact something else which is being totally repealed.</P>
      <P>I looked at the 1915 Act and I find that Section 3 provides that, where any existing contracts were interfered with by that Act at the time of its enactment, the contractor was, to the extent of such interference, to be relieved therefrom.  It would be interesting to learn why no similar provision is made in this Bill to relieve the party to a contract from any obligations imposed by the contract which are interfered with by the enactment of this Bill.  I do not know whether or not such contracts can legally exist at the moment but it was contemplated that such contracts could have existed in 1915 when the first of these measures became law. Provision was, accordingly, made to ensure that there would be no interference with such contracts.  I am anxious to learn why a similar provision is not included in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point with which I am concerned arises on the definition section. We carried on for many years with the <Col N="1499" /> statute made in 1915, as amended in 1926.  Neither of those statutes contains a definition section in the sense of Section 1 of this Bill, which defines foreign spirits, Irish spirits and spirits. These expressions are not defined in the Act of 1915, which is being reenacted, with temporary modifications, in this Bill.  It may be that the Revenue Commissioners have some reason for inserting these definitions but, if the House is asked to agree to the enactment of this Bill, it should be told the reason for the insertion of these definitions and what their significance will be in the application of this Act to the warehousing of spirits, as distinct from the law as it stands. These are the only points in which I am interested at the moment.  I do not want to elaborate them and I put them in the form of questions to the Minister so that he may clarify them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any particular reason behind this little Bill.  So far as the trade in the country is concerned, there is no necessity for it.  It is a very bad principle to commence by lowering the standard of quality of spirits sold here. By bringing out spirits at an immature stage, the standard of quality is lowered.  There is no necessity for this step, as rum is extremely plentiful all over the country and there is very little demand for it.  It bears about the same relation to whiskey as coffee did to tea when tea was very scarce and coffee was very plentiful.  It was almost an insult to offer coffee to anybody at that time and it is almost an insult to offer rum to a person now.  I made it my business to visit a number of persons in the trade.  In case the Minister should be under a misconception, I hasten to add that my visit had no other purpose than to elicit information regarding this Bill.  The general idea is that there is plenty of rum in every retail shop.  Why the Bill is introduced, I do not know.  There may be some reason for it which is not visible to the naked eye.  There is no necessity to lower the standard of rum by taking it out at an immature age.  I think that the Minister should, at least, reserve to himself the right to <Col N="1500" /> refuse to allow it out unless a case is made and it is proven that there is necessity for such removal.  Rum should be allowed to mature for five years unless it is proven to the Minister's satisfaction that there is a real necessity for its release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was at the request of the trade association that this Bill was introduced and for no other reason. They say, and the stock position proves, that while there is a fair amount of three-year-old rum in stock and to be purchased in the country, the same amount of five-year-old rum is not available.  That aspect of the Bill is temporary and I do not think that it will do any particular harm to sell rum for a couple of years, while it is scarce, at three years' maturity.  At least, that was what I was informed.  Now, in regard to Senator Duffy's points I want to say that this is a consolidation Act. Many members of the Dáil and Seanad have, for years, been urging Ministers to consolidate.  I agreed with the suggestion that we should consolidate the small bit of law that relates to immature spirits but when doing so I did not undertake to study all the past Acts of Parliament that were to be consolidated and I have not the slightest intention of doing so.  I am responsible to the Seanad for what is proposed in this Bill.  What it does is, first of all, to define what are foreign spirits and what are Irish spirits, and what are warehoused spirits, and it then goes on to restrict delivery for the purposes of human consumption of immature spirits.  That will be the whole law relating to immature spirits in the future.  Whatever was in the 1915 Act that is not in this particular Bill will no longer be the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the Parliamentary draftsman's attempt at consolidating the whole law, and as Minister for Finance I am satisfied that there is sufficient law relating to immature spirits in this Bill.  I think there will have to be some procedure other than having a Minister swotting up the whole of the law to be consolidated <Col N="1501" /> when the laws in general are being consolidated.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach discussed this here with the Seanad.  I think he did.  Proposals for procedure in relation to consolidating the law will, at any rate, be put before the Dáil and Seanad if they have not already been consulted about it.  This particular Bill consolidates what we want.  I think it is a straightforward business.</P>

      <P>I object to the Committee Stage being taken now.  I asked three questions and I got an answer to none of them.  I asked the Minister why the Bill proposed to re-enact a statute which was to be repealed by the Act itself?  He tells me it is a consolidating Bill but there is nothing to be consolidated. There are two short Acts, one a short Act of the British Parliament of 1915 and the other a short Act of the Oireachtas of 1926.  I asked the simple question, why the Bill proposed to re-enact something which is being repealed and I got no answer.  I also asked a question regarding the safeguarding of contracts.  I do not know if there are any contracts.  I may be told there are none and I am quite satisfied if there are none.  But I do know that in previous legislation provisions were inserted to safeguard existing contracts.  This is omitted from this Bill and I want to know why. I have not been answered.  I also referred to definitions.  I want to know why these definitions are inserted in this Bill when they were not inserted in the previous legislation.  Until these questions are answered I cannot agree to the next stage being taken.</P>

      <P>If the Senator is aware of that I think he is unfair, certainly it is the wrong procedure.  Senator Duffy is one of the men who are always talking about consolidation.  If he wants consolidation, I think, at least, he should apply his mind to this statement: this is going to be the law in regard to immature spirits and there is nothing in it about the law of contract. There were certain things in the 1915 Act that were temporary and do not run on over into this Bill.  The definitions that are here are those of the Parliamentary draftsman.  I am not the Parliamentary draftsman and I do not know why the Senator refers to this Bill as re-enacting some other Act.  All the Acts in relation to immature spirits are being put out of effect and when a lawyer wants to know the law in the future he can see that he has no business going back on those other Acts of Parliament, that they were wiped out and that the whole law in relation to immature spirits is here and that whatever was contained in the 1915 Act or <Col N="1503" /> the 1926 Act is now null and void.  I think that is a reasonable explanation.</P>

      <P>The Minister answered at least two of Senator Duffy's questions in his last statement.  It is not my business to explain Acts of Parliament, but I do object to the notion that Ministers and members of the Oireachtas must accept a Parliamentary draftsman's idea.  We cannot take him on faith and, indeed, I have heard the Minister in rather faithless mood on Parliamentary draftsmen on occasions.  It is wrong for the Minister to state that this is the Parliamentary draftsman's definition and that we must accept it.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That as soon as may be after each <Col N="1504" /> Seanad election the Seanad shall appoint from amongst its members a committee to be styled and known as the Committee on Statutory Orders;</P>
    <P>That the Committee on Statutory Orders shall consist of 10 members to be selected by the Committee of Selection, of whom five shall constitute a quorum;</P>
    <P>That it shall be the function and duty of the Committee on Statutory Orders to examine the regulations and Orders capable of being annulled by either House of the Oireachtas which are made under statute, from time to time, by the Government or a member thereof and to report thereon to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>This motion has been on the Order Paper for a very long time and I have no doubt it has received the attention of the members of the House and that my task, therefore, will be rather simple.  I have made no effort to ascertain whether this is an acceptable or an objectionable motion.  I am assuming that, in the main, it will not arouse any serious objections.  If I thought it would create any difficulty in its present form, I would be willing to have it suitably amended.  I do not even suggest that the present form is the best way in which to express the purpose in view, but it gives us an opportunity of discussing a matter of considerable importance to this House. That matter is the need for establishing some form of machinery which would enable this House to perform one of its principal functions, namely, to keep a check on the delegated legislation which is made in Department offices and, in some cases, outside Departments by local authorities and other bodies which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are various kinds of Orders made under the authority of statutes. For instance, you have the provisional Order.  That is a form of delegated legislation which has fallen into disuse in this country to a considerable extent. I am very glad to notice that it has been revived quite recently, in a manner that is entirely satisfactory. Senators will recall that, in the Harbours Act, the Minister made provision <Col N="1505" /> in certain circumstances for the use of the provisional Order, that is, an Order which has no effect until it gets confirmation by statute.  One of its great features is that it arises out of an inquiry of some kind, an inquiry by the Minister on the application of a harbour authority, or a public inquiry in relation to an application from a local authority desiring to take over possession of land or property of any kind.  The public are informed of what is being done and have an opportunity of objecting and of offering evidence in opposition to the proposal.  It is only when these regulations are complied with that the provisional Order is made and then it is still provisional until confirmed by statute.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned with that kind of procedure here, but only with the Orders made under the authority of legislation passed by the Oireachtas, when these Orders are tabled and, having been tabled, when it is competent for either House to annul them.  That brings us down to a narrow limit, to the Orders which may be annulled by a vote of either House of the Oireachtas. It is interesting to know that this subject has interested this House and its predecessors for more than 20 years. As a matter of fact, I think it was in 1923 that the late Colonel Maurice Moore moved a motion here to establish some form of machinery so that the House could excercise control over delegated legislation.  He went further and thought that the committee should be consulted in relation to Bills before they were introduced as well as in the examination of statutory Orders made under the legislation.  In 1923, of course, nobody thought that statutory Orders would occupy the prominent place they have occupied, particularly in recent years, in regard to our legislation. People think mainly of legislation as Bills which would not always be clear and they do not think so much of the Orders and regulations which may be made by authority of the Legislature.</P>
    <P>That effort by Senator Colonel Maurice Moore was followed up subsequently, I think, by a proposal from Senator Douglas and later, in 1929, by a proposal made by Senator Thomas Johnson.  In the intervening years the question of keeping track of delegated <Col N="1506" /> legislation has occupied the minds of people not merely here but in most democratic countries.  In Britain, for instance, the subject was raised frequently in the House of Commons, and in 1944 the Coalition Government accepted a proposal for the establishment by the House of Commons of a Parliamentary committee to advise the House in relation to legislation of this kind.  I do not know if I can quote the actual form of the order made by the House.  The terms of reference are pretty long, but they will be found set out in the Third Special Report of the Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders published by order of the House of Commons on the 29th October, 1946.  Anyway, it was a committee of pretty wide powers in relation, I should say, to orders which are placed in the House of Commons and are capable of being annulled.  Subsequently, the Parliament of Northern Ireland took steps to secure a similar check over delegated legislation within its jurisdiction.  The terms of reference in that case will be found in the Fifth Report of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Statutory Rules, Orders and Regulations dated the 25th February, 1947.  In the case of the Parliament of Northern Ireland there was a joint committee representative of both Houses, but I should say that the idea was the same in both cases, except that the distinction is made that the committee in Britain is established by the House of Commons and consists of members of the House of Commons only.  In that case, however, it is well to bear in mind that there is an old procedure in Britain by which a special committee of the House of Lords is selected after each new Parliament is elected. The committee is selected by the House of Lords.  It is a committee with certain limited powers.  I cannot lay my hands on the document setting out its powers, but, in any event, that committee of the House of Lords has placed upon it the function of examining certain types of orders and of reporting in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Now, in case any member of this House is apprehensive that this proposal is aimed at limiting the powers of Ministers to make Orders.  I want to <Col N="1507" /> say at once that it has no such purpose. I am entirely in favour of conferring on Ministers the power to make regulations within such limits as may be prescribed by the Oireachtas.  I do not see how you could carry on legislation in the modern world without these powers, unless the legislation is going to be loaded down with all kinds of detail which, in my opinion, is undesirable, and in any event is impracticable. Every Bill that passes through both Houses contains provisions enabling Ministers to make regulations covering a number of things, some of them specified in the Act and others merely implied.  In this House in particular we have insisted that, so far as these Orders involve an expansion of legislation itself, they should be tabled, and that there should be power in the Oireachtas to annul them.  A considerable number of Orders are made which are not tabled, and a considerable number of Orders are tabled which cannot be annulled, so that in fact the number of Orders to which this motion is directed is rather limited.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the Order Paper of this House for the 13th November, 1946.  That was the date upon which the House resumed after the autumn recess.  It contains a list of 46 statutory Orders and 16 non-statutory Orders which were laid on the Table during the recess.  I think only 30 of these Orders are capable of being annulled so that the actual number of Orders capable of being annulled, although substantial, is probably less than half the number of documents laid on the Table.  Now, it may be asked if there is no objection to the making by the Minister of these statutory Orders, is there any particular need for a special committee to examine them?  I think there is.  If there is no special body delegated by this House to examine these Orders, then it is the business of all the members to examine them, and if they think fit call attention to an Order which seems to be objectionable for one reason or another or to put down a motion to have the Order annulled.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps stress the point that there is no power in this House to amend an Order made by a Minister <Col N="1508" /> under statute.  The power conferred on the House is the power of annulment, not the power of amendment, and in many cases where objection is taken to an Order it is taken on some particular ground that perhaps would not normally call for annulment but for the amendment of the Order.  There is no power of amendment, however, and of course the matter comes before the House only if some member of the House puts down an annulling motion. To put down an annulling motion involves, on the part of members, the obligation of each member for himself going into the Library or otherwise getting a copy of each Order as it is made, of reading the Order and making sure that he knows what it is about as well as making sure that it is an Order that is capable of being annulled because, as I have said already, a number of the Orders which are Tabled cannot be annulled.</P>
    <P>The ordinary member of this House will not move that motion without having recourse to the statute under which the Order is made to satisfy himself that it is one which can be annulled.  There is a tendency in certain quarters to say that the Minister and his staff take great care in relation to these Orders and that there is nothing wrong with them.  I think that that is a wrong view. If the committee were never to make a report to the House, under my suggestion those responsible for drawing up the Orders would take good care that they were in proper form and did not exceed statutory authority.  The mere existence of the committee would be a check and would ensure that the Orders would be kept within proper bounds and would conform with the statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read an advertisement by Córas Iompair Eireann before Christmas announcing certain restrictions on the use of trams by the public.  I was sufficiently curious to go to the Library and look up the statute under which the Order was made in order to ascertain whether Córas Iompair Eireann had power to impose a fine of 40/- on me for refusing to leave one of their trams at the Pillar on a wet night.  To my surprise, <Col N="1509" /> I found that Córas Iompair Eireann had no such authority however.  The first publication of the advertisement took place in the morning papers of 21st November, and the paper I have before me is the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The second publication took place on the 28th November, 1946, and stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Notice is hereby given that Córas Iompair Eireann, having their principal offices at Kingsbridge Station, Dublin, pursuant to the provisions of the Tramways Act, 1870, have made the following by-laws and regulations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the company goes on to set out the regulations.  A person using a tram must, according to those regulations, leave the tram at the terminus, and the Order concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any person offending against or committing a breach of these by-laws or regulations, or any part thereof, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding 40/-.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Constitution contemplated Córas Iompair Eireann imposing a fine of 40/- on me or any other citizen.  If I did not pay the fine, I suppose I should be liable to imprisonment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The fine would not be imposed by Córas Iompair Eireann; it would be imposed by a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The conviction would be but this is the company's by-law.  That regulation was made under the authority of the Tramways Act, 1870. When I look up that Act, I find that Section 2 states: &ldquo;This Act shall not apply to Ireland.&rdquo;  I commenced to search other statutes.  I assure the House that I spent an entire day, with the assistance of the librarian, digging up old statutes and old orders by the Dublin Tramways Company, covering the period from 1896 to date, to ascertain if there was any statute applying that Act of 1870 to Ireland.  I could not find any.  Every member of the House could not afford a day of searching for details of an Order of this kind. I assure the House that I cannot afford to spend a day searching the Library for information every time I want to inspect an Order made by the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> I am not challenging the company here.  There is another way of doing that.  My way of doing it would be to remain in the tram on a wet night and refuse to leave.  If the company were to prosecute me, then I could ascertain where there was any lawful authority for this Order.  I want to draw attention to the fact that some people take a great many liberties.  These liberties will be taken in Government offices, the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Eireann, and other offices if nobody is likely to have the time to check up on what they are doing.  I want to draw attention to another incident which, I think, is important. I am speaking now not of the making of an Order but of the carrying into effect of the obligations placed upon Government Departments by Orders made by themselves.  Section 12 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, provides that such sum as the Treasury may direct, not exceeding one-tenth of the receipts of the unemployment fund, shall be applied as an appropriation-in-aid for the purpose of salaries, remuneration and other expenses in carrying the Act into effect.  I do not want to lay any stress on the fact that the maximum is fixed at one-tenth because the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1933 increases that limit by 50 per cent.  I do not want anybody to tell me later that I overlooked the authority conferred on the Minister to increase the amount by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>What I want to complain about is that, under the authority of the 1920 Act, a statutory Order was made on the 3rd December, 1921, which provides that, as soon as may be after the 31st March in each year, the Treasury&mdash;now the Department of Finance&mdash;shall ascertain whether the one-tenth or whatever sum may be applied in aid exceeds the expenditure authorised by Parliament.  In other words, the intention was that the Department of Finance should ascertain whether the appropriation-in-aid exceeded the money voted for the purpose of unemployment insurance and report that fact to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Was that obligation carried out?  It was not carried out by the Department of Finance.  I came across the omission only by accident.  I <Col N="1511" /> noticed on the Order Paper an announcement that the regulations of 1921 were being revoked.  The regulations were revoked.  Then I set out to find what these regulations were and I discovered that they were regulations which required the Minister for Finance to prepare a return annually for the purposes of informing the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether in fact the Department of Finance was taking more money out of the insurance fund than they were entitled to do by statute and as in fact they have been doing to the extent of £100,000 per year.  This is a reply given by the Minister for Finance to Mr. Martin O'Sullivan in the Dáil on the 4th December, 1946:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The regulations referred to in the first part of the question were revoked on the 11th November, 1946. The position is now governed by (a) the Unemployment Insurance (Appropriations-in-Aid) Regulations, 1946, made by me on that date, and (b) a direction given by me pursuant to Section 12 (3) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920, that the maximum permitted by law should be applied out of the unemployment fund as an appropriation-in-aid of moneys provided by the Oireachtas for the purposes mentioned in the proviso to that section.  The calculations mentioned in paragraph 7 of the earlier regulations were never made and no certificate was given under paragraph 8.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Take note of the last sentence.  The calculations were never made and no certificate was given in accordance with paragraph 8.  The regulations were made in 1921, and in the 25 years that elapsed between the 3rd December, 1921, and the 11th November, 1946, the Department of Finance never made the return required by the regulations.  I do not know whether any member of this House, after these recitals, will question the need for an examination of the manner in which statutory rules and Orders are made and the manner in which they are carried into effect.  I have said earlier, and I want to repeat it, that I am not one of those who desire to restrict the power of <Col N="1512" /> making regulations.  I am in favour of the utilisation of this power to the fullest extent, so far as it is authorised by the Oireachtas.  But I believe that in the interest of both the Departments and the citizens it is desirable that there should be some check and that it should be known to the public how this authority is exercised.  The practice of publishing regulations, the practice of making them known to the public, has gone out of fashion.  I have great doubts, personally, as to the legal position in regard to the publication of rules and Orders.  There is an old British Act to which I will refer in a few moments, an Act of 1893, which requires the Government to publish every Order with certain defined exceptions, certain named exceptions, and, if a remember rightly, the Government must publish its intention to make such an Order 40 days before the Order comes into effect.  This practice, of course, has gone by the board, and what creates some difficulty in my mind is the legal view of the publication under this Act.  The question whether the Rules Publication Act applied in Ireland was raised in 1935 before Chief Justice Kennedy, and the Chief Justice said that the Rules Publication Act had been adapted by the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922.</P>
    <P>When that was so, he said it has full force and effect in this country, and rules and regulations which are made without the Act of 1893 being complied with are bad.  As we now know here, the Act of 1893 is rarely, if ever, complied with.  However, Chief Justice Kennedy has not stated the law.  He merely gave this as his opinion in the Irish Law Reports of 1935, page 263, but I notice that in the Irish Reports of 1941, at page 69, Chief Justice Sullivan says that the Rules Publication Act of 1893 does not apply to statutory rules and Orders made by the Government in this State as there has been no adaptation of the Act for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the merits of these two statements beyond drawing attention to the fact that they are directly and diametrically opposed and that they are the views of Chief Justices of the time.  I contend, however, <Col N="1513" /> that it is essential in the public interest that the fullest publicity should be given to every rule and regulation made.  Publicity is given to Bills by various methods.  The public are usually aware of what is going on when a Bill is passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  First and foremost the Bill is published or at least referred to in the papers.  Then it is debated from all angles on the Second Stage in both Houses and its details are discussed in Committee so that by and large the public is not taken unawares so far as Acts of the Oireachtas are concerned, but the public are completely in the dark in regard to regulations.  In the first place the newspapers do not bother very much noticing these regulations, and even if they had the greatest desire in the world to notice them they cannot do so because it would take newspaper men a very considerable time to know what the regulations were all about.  Any member of this House who desires to find out how intricate regulations are will satisfy his curiosity by going to the Library and taking up some of the Orders which are tabled there and trying to unravel them.  It is impossible in seven cases out of ten to know what the Orders are about unless you have regard to previous Orders and unless you have regard to the statute and a good deal of additional information which a member of this House cannot get without doing a considerable amount of research work, which takes time.  I am pleading that the public should be informed of the making of regulations which affect the public interest, and I am suggesting that the appointment of this committee would assist directly in that regard, if it were to do nothing else.</P>
    <P>Let me say briefly how I think the committee would work.  I visualise Senators, irrespective of Party affiliation, selecting ten members of the House&mdash;that is, one-sixth&mdash;because of their interest in various kinds of regulations, to act as a committee whose business it would be to meet periodically&mdash;mainly when the House is sitting, so as not to cause any inconvenience to them&mdash;and report in a formal manner on the number of Orders made <Col N="1514" /> between two given times and the purpose of any Order which seemed to call for comment.  If the committee considered that the Order or regulation was made without lawful authority or that it exceeded lawful authority, it should be its function to report that opinion to the House.  If it considered that the regulation imposed on the public an obligation which should be made known to the public and widely publicised, I assume the committee would take steps to have that publication made.  I think, too, that the committee would be entitled, as a committee of this House, to have the assistance of such staff provided by the House as it might require for that purpose.</P>
    <P>In the case of Great Britain, the highest legal experts at the disposal of Parliament assist the committee.  So far as I remember, the secretary of the British committee is the counsel to the Speaker of the House of Commons. In Northern Ireland, the committee is assisted by experienced civil servants. Apart from that, it is the practice in Britain, America, Australia and New Zealand to call before a committee of this kind any official of any Department responsible for making a regulation, so that the regulation may be explained to the committee.  In other words, the committee, in making its report, will supply, first to the House and secondly to the public, an informed opinion in relation to an Order and will supply the public with an authoritative statement of what is implied in the Order.</P>
    <P>A question might be asked whether, if the proposal is accepted, it would not be wise to have a joint committee. There is a joint committee in Northern Ireland, but not in Great Britain.  That is a matter of opinion.  My own view is that, in our circumstances, this work should be done by a committee of this House and not by a joint committee. The Dáil has work to do and responsibility to undertake which distinguishes its functions materially from ours.  For instance, during the next three months, Deputies will be occupied in discussing Estimates for the Public Services.  There are about 72 Estimates, all of which are capable of being discussed.  What will happen eventually is that 30 or 40, or a substantial <Col N="1515" /> number, will be picked out by the different groups and Parties in the Dáil and made the subject of a debate lasting, perhaps, two or three days. That is work which we have not to do. Secondly, the Dáil is responsible for finance and on that account it appoints a special committee to examine the accounts of every Department of the State.  In the course of that examination, the Committee of Public Accounts brings before it the officers of the various Departments and examines them&mdash; I think, on oath&mdash;and cross-examines them in relation to every item which they consider should be investigated. For the purpose of their work, that committee has the assistance of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff, who will in advance prepare for them a commentary on the accounts of every Department of State.  We are not required to do this work, nor are we entitled to do it, as we have no responsibility for financial matters.</P>
    <P>However, if we are to do justice to ourselves and to the public and satisfy our own consciences that we are doing some useful work for the community, I do not think it is sufficient to justify the existence of this House if we come and go and sit on 30 days in the year. I believe there is time available to do other work and the most important work the House can do is to set machinery in motion which will enable Senators to keep a check on what is being done in Departmental offices in regard to regulations and statutory Orders, all of which have the force of law.  Senators know that any such regulation made in Government Departments, which may never be published, which may never be read by the public, has the same binding force and effect as if it were a statute enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the fact that, in certain cases, the judges commented with surprise on the manner in which these regulations are made without any attempt being made to publicise them. Speaking in this House at column 60, vol. 30, Senator Comyns said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some rules that have been made under Acts of Parliament passed here have gone so far as to authorise a <Col N="1516" /> Minister to ignore the law of the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Chief Justice Kennedy said, in a case that came before him:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that counsel for the State tried for a time to stand over these documents&mdash;that is statutory rules and Orders&mdash;and ultimately recognised that the ground was untenable.  No legal basis for this new attempted extension of Departmental or Civil Service authority over the citizen was shown to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice commented that there was no lawful authority for the making of Orders which were produced in court as if they were Acts of Parliament. I have not referred to these matters for the purpose of criticising or commenting except in so far as it is a criticism of ourselves: as a criticism of this House that something should be pawned off as law which is not law.  It may be replied that the same obligation rests on all of us, and that the 60 members are all responsible.  I suggest that the manner in which the members of the House can discharge their obligations intelligently is to pick out a group from the membership of the House and say to that group &ldquo;examine all these documents, and where the House has power and is authorised to annul one of these regulations tell us if you think it should be annulled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is not an unreasonable proposition, and I do not think it is one from which any member of the House will dissent.  In this regard I assume that we are free agents.  As no member of the Government has attended the House for the purpose of this discussion, I take it that the Government assume that we will do what we consider is wise and proper in the circumstances, and that they do not propose to influence our decisions or our views in any manner.  I would urge, therefore, as strongly as I can that the members of the House would take serious notice of the dangers that are inherent in the present system of unchecked departmental law-making.  I would ask them to bear in mind two things which are important in democratic institutions.  One is that you must give the Government wide powers to deal with day-to-day incidents <Col N="1517" /> which cannot be foreseen and cannot be legislated for in advance.  Secondly, you must have a check on the manner in which these functions are discharged. The purpose of this House is to maintain such machinery as will ensure that there is a check.  I believe that these views meet with substantial agreement in the House, and I now beg to move the motion standing in my name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. Senator Duffy has dealt exhaustively with this subject and has demonstrated to those of us who have listened to him with great care the need there is for a committee such as he suggests.  I do not propose to attempt to follow Senator Duffy in the admirable speech that he has made, except to say that I think the House is indebted to him for the trouble he has taken in the matter.  I am not at all certain, however, that the members of the House appreciate the amount of work which the preparation of that speech involved for Senator Duffy, especially when we bear in mind an incident that occurred here a short time ago.  A Minister said, in effect, that he was not interested in the law but was interested merely in the Bill that he had before him.</P>
      <P>He laid emphasis on the fact that certain other people had prepared the measure, and that he was prepared to take that as representing the final word on it.  If that is going to be the mentality of the Seanad on this matter, then it would seem to me to be a reprehensible state of affairs.  I hope that the labour which the preparation of his speech involved for Senator Duffy has brought home to the minds of those who listened to him the importance of having a committee of the character that he suggests set up, a committee to examine the Orders and regulations laid on the Table of this House.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last speaker that we must appreciate all the work which Senator Duffy must have put into the preparation of his speech.  Yet, I feel that he has not <Col N="1518" /> convinced us, and that he did not make a case for the setting up of this committee. He told us that the purpose of the motion was to have a committee set up, consisting of members of the House, which would examine the various rules and Orders that are laid on the Table, and particularly those Orders that are capable of being annulled, and that would then report to the House.  The Senator did not convince me, and I am sure he did not convince other members of the House, that it is necessary to set up a committee for that purpose because every member of the House has the right to examine those rules and regulations.  If he thinks that any of them should be annulled he can put down a motion and obtain the views of the House on them. Senator Duffy said that would involve a lot of work for a Senator; that it would mean that a Senator would have to devote a lot of time and patience to the examination of these Orders.  If that is so, does Senator Duffy think that each individual Senator who has a responsibility in that matter should pass over his or her responsibility to a committee and have the work done by the committee?  I do not think that a case has been made for the setting up of this committee.  If the House sets up the committee, what power will it have?  Senator Duffy proposes that it should report to the House.  It may recommend that a motion should be tabled for the annulment of the Order in question.  Senator Duffy suggested that this committee would meet when the House was in session.</P>

I should like to point out that the issue of Orders does not always coincide with the meetings of the House.  It would be necessary for a Senator to table a motion for the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The point on which Senator Duffy did not convince me was the necessity for this committee.  There is plenty of machinery at present for doing what the committee would do.  A Senator can bring a motion before the House to have any Order annulled.  If an Order affects any section or group of the public, I am sure that it will be brought to the notice of public representatives in the Dáil or Seanad by interested parties with a view to getting additional information or to having the Order annulled.  We have a number of committees in this House and I do not think that the proposed committee would serve any useful purpose.  Therefore, I am not prepared to support the motion.</P>

      <P>I hope there will be no suggestion of collusion when I congratulate Senator Duffy on the service he has rendered to Parliament in bringing forward this motion.  It has involved a great deal of research and it is a motion to which we should give very serious consideration.  The dangers of delegated legislation have been before the public for many years.  I cannot recall the Senator mentioning Lord Hewart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Lord Chief Justice of England, he was qualified to speak with preeminent authority on the dangers of delegated legislation.  He published a book on the subject.  I feel that there is a special duty on this House to examine this matter in the way Senator Duffy suggests.  I think that his suggestion is an admirable one.  Despite what Senator Hawkins said, we are not overworked in this House and we have plenty of time to look over those Orders and examine them, with a certain expert approach which few members are able to give individually at present.  They mostly refer, as the Senator said, to previous Orders and they are tied up with legislation. Although I agree with Senator Hawkins that there is a responsibility on every member of this House to read <Col N="1520" /> these Orders and satisfy himself regarding them, I wonder how many Senators could conscientiously say that they do so.  I do look through the Orders but I cannot say that I do much more, unless the subjects dealt with are subjects in which I am specially interested or of which I can claim to have some special knowledge.  Most of these Orders deal with customs duties and quotas, of which I cannot claim any special knowledge.  It is wrong to suggest that this work could be equally well done by individuals and that, if done by a committee, it would detract from the responsibility of the individual. The individual will always be able to act independently of the committee. It may be evidence that these Orders have been very well done that so few motions have been put down to challenge them.  I am rather afraid, however, that they are so complicated that few of us have been able to get at the inwardness of them.  The Senator made a very serious and worthwhile contribution to the cause of Parliamentary control and I hope that this motion will be approached in a cooperative spirit, not in a Party spirit, and will be carried by the House.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to know exactly how one ought to approach this motion.  The motion itself is very simple, perhaps too simple, but the problem which the motion seeks to solve is one of very great complexity and one which has been developing in complexity for a considerable time. Senator Duffy appears to me to be in a dilemma.  As a socialist&mdash;if I may apply that description to him&mdash;he desires to give Ministers all the power possible to interfere in as many directions in our life as possible.  As a parliamentarian, he desires to keep track of these Orders and to keep control of the Ministers.  I suggest that he cannot do the two things at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Kyle, who does not often give us the benefit of his views, would tell us how to <Col N="1521" /> reconcile these two things.  I should like to prevent Ministers having these powers if I could but it seems to me that you cannot take up the attitude of endeavouring to get the Government to interfere more and more in every department of life and, at the same time, keep a Parliamentary check upon the operations of the resulting Civil Service, because there can be no doubt that, when Ministers get additional powers, they require more civil servants. When they require more civil servants, they want to give more power to the civil servants.  How Parliament could keep track of all the various acts by civil servants, acts which they do legally and properly under statutes passed by Parliament, I frankly do not know.  I do not think that you can get a solution of so difficult a problem in modern life by so simple a motion as this.  I do not think that there is anything sinister in the Civil Service or that civil servants lay themselves out to make illegal Orders or to seek illegal powers.  I do not believe that they have sinister motives of any kind. They are just ordinary human beings, doing a very difficult job, which is becoming more complicated every day. The difficulty is to find out whether they are doing it in accordance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether, if Senators acting singly cannot do this, Senators acting as a committee could do it, and if they discovered something what particular steps they could take.  For example, Senator Sir John Keane said that experts would be needed.  If we need experts it would seem to follow that we are not experts ourselves.  If I am not an expert, if Senator Duffy is not an expert, or if Senator Hawkins is not an expert, the three of us when we meet in a committee do not become experts.  I feel that the problem is one that is very difficult of solution.  If we are going to have any kind of committee I suggest that we would have to be very explicit with regard to the powers and the terms of appointment of the committee.  That could not be achieved by this motion.  A British committee of a similar character issued a report on these Orders and rules in October, 1946.  It was appointed on 23rd <Col N="1522" /> August, 1945.  It was known as a Statutory Rules and Orders Committee and was given power to send for persons, papers and records.  Power was given to examine civil servants, to ask for documents from civil service departments, and the committee was to report to the House of Commons on certain grounds and on these only.  I think you would have to have something of that kind in the proposed committee and even so I doubt if it would work.</P>
    <P>There would be no value in the committee unless it had the assistance of the officials who drafted the Orders or some persons on their behalf who could explain the position.  The situation is as Senator Duffy remarked. I agree with what Senator Sir John Keane said, that the Senator must have put a great deal of work into examination of these very difficult and tangled Orders.  The only power this House or the other House has is to put down a motion of annulment. We put down such a motion ordinarily to get information.  Whenever such a motion has been put down it was to get information rather than for the purpose of getting an Order annulled.  No machinery has been devised&mdash;and I think none could be devised&mdash;to allow these Orders to be amended.  I find several objections to this motion.  In the first place, it should be a joint committee of both Houses, consisting, say, of five members of the Dáil and five members of the Seanad, and I think it should have power to summon certain people before it.  In the next place, it should have certain things fixed upon which it might report.  What would that amount to in the end?  It would amount to this, that some individual who had read a particular Order, or knew something about it, would deal with that Order and would have the advantage in the committee of arguing privately rather than publicly in the Dáil or in the Seanad.  That might be an advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be a disadvantage. At present a Senator can walk <Col N="1523" /> into an office and make an inquiry.  We should not get into the position, however, of thinking that we are going to solve a problem which is rather difficult merely by sitting on a committee. Like Senator Sir John Keane, when I get the Orders sent me I look at them, and like other people, I read some of them for the Irish rather than for what is in them.  Whenever a matter upon which I have some knowledge is dealt with, I read the whole Order, and I go back to see what it means.  But I could not undertake to read all Orders or to understand all Orders.  Perhaps I am taking too pessimistic a view, but I am afraid I would not understand all of them.  One could only grasp what is in a certain number of them.  The real difficulty is that members of Parliament do not understand a number of things contained in these Orders.  That is the simple truth.  If members of the Dáil, the Seanad or the House of Commons or House of Lords are not in the position that they can inquire into particular Orders, I do not think, when you find them in committee, you can get any better work done than could be done singly.</P>
      <P>There has been a suggestion to get experts' advice.  What is that?  Experts' advice would be, presumably, the advice of officers of either House who examined the question.  What you really require about these Orders is a political examination.  That is what I should like to have.  What I find wrong about the Orders is politics, using the word politics, not in a dirty sense, but in a public sense; its influence on the lives of the people, to see whether they are exceeding their powers.  You will not get the experts who will give you that kind of examination in a committee composed of members of different Parties.  Frankly, I think the motion as it stands is too simple, and would have to be passed in a form asking the other House to join with us in setting up a joint committee, and giving that committee power to send for papers and records.  As in the case of the British committee the motion should define the particular thing on which the committee was to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even when the committee reported unless somebody in either House was <Col N="1524" /> sufficiently interested to put down a motion and to argue it, I do not think you will get any work done.  Ultimately the Parliamentarian himself is the best safeguard and the Parliamentarian is the type of person that is sent to Parliament. If people who are ignorant, careless or lazy are sent to Parliament &mdash;and a great many people are careless and lazy&mdash;you cannot remedy the situation by a joint committee.  The setting up of machinery to remedy the position is not going to help.  The position in the other House most emphatically is that a Parliamentary majority exists, and that Parliamentary majority will back the Minister.  The same thing, if I may say so with bated breath, exists here.</P>
    <P>What good are you going to get from a committee any more than from an examination of a particular Order by an individual who puts down an appropriate motion?  I feel that the whole tendency of legislation is to deal with more and more topics, and to make Government powers more and more wide, by interfering more and more in things, necessarily involving complicated legislation and the making of statutory Orders.  Anybody who supports that general tendency is not able to devise any scheme which will keep it from resulting in a spate of Orders of which nobody can keep track.  I am afraid I am not very hopeful but I am endeavouring to put the problem as I see it.  It is not a problem that is easy of solution.</P>
    <P>If any Senator puts down a motion about an Order and explains it then we can discuss it.  As far as we are concerned, this can be said in our favour, that we give it good discussion, not Party discussion.  If nobody is prepared to put down a motion, then I do not think there is any use in setting up a committee, anyhow a committee with no terms of reference. Unless the committee gets power to summon witnesses and to interview civil servants it could make no progress.</P>
    <P>The only way to get the information is to inquire the purpose for which the Order was made.  That brings up the question, whether the Government as a matter of policy would agree with it. <Col N="1525" /> If they would not, the committee would be of little value.  I think, also, you should restrict the powers of the committee to the consideration of certain types of things.  In the meantime the real difficulty is that no machinery that anybody could devise by way of motion or committee is a sound, working substitute for the interest taken by a member of Parliament in his job.  This job is becoming more complicated every day and Senator Duffy is assisting in making it more complicated and Senator Duffy's Party and other Parties too.  Nothing could be more satisfactory than a member of the House with special knowledge using it and bringing it to bear on what is being done and convincing his fellow members. If he cannot do that, a committee cannot do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I had not the opportunity of listening to Senator Duffy's remarks but I would like to say that in my opinion the general trend of the motion should be supported and that if details are necessary to make it more effective they could be arranged by means of recommendations from the committee itself. When I saw this motion first I was reminded of a remarkable incident which I experienced many years ago and which illustrates the need for a committee such as the one proposed.  I admit that probably 95 or even 98 per cent. of all the statutory Orders made are quite harmless and are quite in keeping with the spirit of the Act as passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas but there is just that possibility that a Minister might issue an Order which might have very serious consequences.  The particular incident to which I refer concerned a very important case in the High Courts. One of the present Supreme Court judges was actually concerned in it. He advised his client that in his opinion the client had an unbeatable case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He based his argument on the existing position created by statutory Order but in the very middle of the trial the Minister issued an Order countermanding the previous one or modifying it.  The result was that that <Col N="1526" /> particular leg of the case failed completely but, luckily for the party concerned, there were other props to the case and it was successfully carried through.  It looked very peculiar that in the middle of this case this Order should be made, and while such power rests in the hands of a Minister there is always the possibility of a similar thing happening again.  For this reason, which is based on my own experience, I think the general principle in this motion should be supported. Each and every one of us has his own work to do and we find it very difficult to examine more than a very small part of all the stationery issued by the Oireachtas.  I do not agree with Senator Hayes when he says that such a committee could do nothing.  You may have members of the legal fraternity here.  If one or two of these were selected and a couple of others with specialised knowledge in other directions I see no difficulty in arranging the personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that my remarks should be interpreted in that particular way.  I understood the Senator to suggest that ordinary members of the committee would not be able to interpret properly the meaning of statutory Orders.  I say, if you select the committee properly you will get a varied type of qualification and the committee as a whole should be able to perform a very useful work.  As mentioned by Sir John Keane, this question of legislation by statutory Order is becoming very serious, not merely in England but, to a large extent, here.  As I said before, I am quite prepared to concede that most of the Orders are quite harmless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with a lot of them myself from time to time, and no one could take exception to them.  But there are other cases, the one I mentioned is one, that could have rather serious consequences.  They might appear to be very innocent Orders on the face of them, but they might affect the interests of <Col N="1527" /> various people very seriously indeed. Although I had not the advantage of hearing the explanation given by Senator Duffy, I am prepared to support the motion and to recommend it to the House generally.  It is not going to do any harm to the Minister, and perhaps it may make people responsible for issuing these statutory Orders a little more careful, and should the Minister contemplate imitating the example of the Minister I mentioned, he would be likely to consider the matter seriously before acting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes stated very well what the difficulties are in the way of this motion.  At the same time, I would like to commend the industry of Senator Duffy on the preparation of his case.  He indicated the manner in which this delegated legislation works, and there is no agreement at all, at least on this side of the House, on this point.  But I think we have to be realists.  It is important that in doing our Parliamentary work we should not commit ourselves to decisions that cannot be implemented.  Senator O'Reilly referred to the fact that practically none of us has the time to keep pace with all the Orders we have been receiving.  We hope they are going to be fewer in the future. If that is the fact how are we going to get this committee together, especially if it is going to take on itself the responsibility of examining all these Orders and passing on its recommendations?  My experience is that there is no use in asking anybody to do a job of work unless he is a busy person. The others will not do it and never did it.  That is how they manage not to be busy.  If you want somebody to do the work you are not prepared to do yourself, you have to ask people who are already busier than you are.  Where can we find those people?  I do not know.  I know the sort of people we would have to ask.  Senator Hayes made a comment when Senator O'Reilly by inference left us under the impression that you would call on <Col N="1528" /> lawyers.  I take it that what Senator Hayes had in mind is that if the Minister made an Order about a turf bank, Senator Hawkins or myself might be just as good an authority as to the value or suitability of that particular Order as the much more distinguished lawyers whom you might have in mind. Experts in the broad sense to be of value on this committee would have to be drawn from every class in society within the House.  Even though that were done, in the case of an educational problem of a particular type with which Senator O'Reilly would be most conversant, if he were not a member of the committee and if Senator Hayes or Senator Mrs. Concannon could not find time to sit on the committee, would Senator O'Reilly feel he had discharged his duty by divesting himself of the responsibility to examine any particular Order in relation to education by the setting up of this committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any difficulty. Could not the committee refer specialised Orders of that kind to people who would be capable of dealing with them?</P>

      <P>No matter what committee is brought into existence a member of the Oireachtas who is trying to discharge his duty cannot divest himself of personal responsibility to examine Orders that concern the affairs of the nation with which he himself is conversant.  Personally, if Orders are made dealing with agriculture or kindred subjects I feel myself under an obligation to examine them.  I do not know that it will save us work in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the case which I put to Senator Duffy.  Will the team work?  Will they all pull on the rope?  There are implications in a great many of these Government Orders, and although some of our distinguished colleagues on my right may now and again claim very loudly that this is a non-political Assembly, we have had the experience that it does not matter what they themselves believe; when it is a decision of a Minister, whether it is embodied in an Order or in a Bill, they feel themselves tied and that they must support that <Col N="1529" /> decision no matter what their conscience may dictate to them.</P>

      <P>We have the evidence of declarations in the other House that they believe one thing and have to do the other.  Be that as it may, let us take a particular Order that is made and has been examined by this committee. Senator Duffy, if he is on the committee, may have one view and other Senators may have another and they want to make a report.  If that report is detrimental to the interests of the Government inasmuch as it is a condemnation or criticism of the Order, it is my honest opinion that the committee will not work.  I am not blaming the supporters of the Government. When the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister makes an Order, it is not a very easy thing for a committee like that with Government supporters there to make a report to this House unfavourable to the decision the Minister has made. I am in favour of examining these Orders, and if Senator Duffy's proposition were feasible it would be an excellent arrangement.  If such a committee could function in the right spirit and were really given liberty in these matters the Minister and the Civil Service would get considerable guidance of value from Parliament and no great harm would be done to political prestige.  But things are as they are, and I honestly believe that <Col N="1530" /> if Senator Duffy got the committee set up, after a while in exasperation and despair he would throw his hat at it and say it could not function.</P>

Surely, the Senator does not expect the House to accept it that this committee would just examine and determine whether or not the Orders are in accordance with the law.  If that is what he wants he would need a couple of lawyers on the committee or he could go to the court for a determination. If the Orders are to be examined in the way that I interpreted Senator Duffy's point, I believe the Senator is expecting the impossible. There would be no reality about the committee and it would be largely <Col N="1531" /> wasted effort.  In the end it could not possibly divest any Senator concerned about the contents of an Order of his responsibility to examine it for himself and be satisfied about it or, if not satisfied, of challenging it here.</P>
      <P>The fact that this committee gave their imprimatur would not take away the right of any member of the House to introduce a motion here to have an Order annulled.  I think that this committee would not work.  I agree, of course, that it is highly desirable that all this legislation should be closely examined, but I am afraid that the machinery which Senator Duffy is proposing will not give him the results that he is looking for.</P>

      <P>I am wholeheartedly in favour of giving a trial to the committee that Senator Duffy proposes.  I agree with Senator Baxter that, as in the case of all experiments, it is quite possible that certain difficulties may show themselves when the committee tries to work, but that is inevitable.  It is only when you set up a thing and give it a trial that you find out that difficulties, which originally seemed formidable, disappear under the pressure of goodwill and practicality.  You also find out that certain difficulties which were never thought of arise and are appreciable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy is making an attempt to tackle one of the elements in the breakdown of Parliamentary Government. In the early stages Parliament had tried to do everything and it did do everything.  It concerned itself with the most amazing minutiæ of legislation. At a later stage it put a lot of matters for consideration into private Bills, such as railway Bills, but now the extent of administrative work and the number of topics which a Government concerns itself with are such that it is a physical impossibility for Parliament to deal closely with everything which has to be dealt with by a Government, so that instead of a thing being done by a Bill it is done by a kind of delegated legislation by a Government. That tendency has been increased by our practice here of having every Bill referred to a committee of the whole House.  In a Legislature <Col N="1532" /> which is not so far from us, Bills are referred to select committees so that they can receive more extensive attention, a practice which, I may say, seems to have rather broken down in the last few months.  Still it is a form of procedure which, I think, should commend itself to this House.  That is not Senator Duffy's proposal.  I merely give it as an example of the same kind of thing&mdash;not to attempt to consider everything in the House as a whole because it is impossible.  The effect of it is that nothing gets adequate consideration.</P>
    <P>There are three types of things which could be dealt with by a committee such as this and, I think, dealt with properly.  There is the case of an Order which is completely and inadequately drafted, which is drafted so that nobody can understand it except the drafter, who thinks he knows what he means to put into it.  It is not until some outsider comes to try to see what is the meaning of the Order that it becomes apparent that the drafter has not expressed himself or, as one judge said when dealing with a statutory Order concerning agriculture, in which I was concerned: &ldquo;It looks as if it were drafted either by a farmer who had no knowledge of law or a lawyer who had no knowledge of agriculture.&rdquo; Now, when an Order such as that comes before a committee which is genuinely trying to see what is its meaning, if the meaning is, in fact, obscure, it will be apt to say that it is obscure and will say to the official concerned or to the draftsman: &ldquo;We do not know what you mean; will you kindly make that clear?&rdquo;  and that would probably be done by an amending Order.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there was the case which recently came before this Assembly. This was in relation to Orders made under the Censorship Act.  It was a case in which certain considerations had completely slipped the mind of the people who had drawn up the Order. Because of that it was necessary to bring in a motion before this House to annul the Order <i>in toto</i> in order to have an opportunity of showing those portions of it which would clearly be incapable of being substantiated.  The members of the House and the Minister <Col N="1533" /> had that opportunity, and on these matters being pointed out to the Minister, he immediately gave in and said that he would consider the matter from the point of view then put before him.  Having heard the case made, he acceded readily to at least one of the alterations suggested.  It was necessary to occupy the time of the House, and to have an annulling Order put down, in order to do that.  Had there been in existence a committee such as that envisaged by Senator Duffy, it is more than likely that some member of the committee would have seen the difficult points which were involved, that he would have it referred back, and that the Order would have been altered without occupying the time of the House in doing so.  The work, of course, would have occupied the time of the committee.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the type of Order which I think Senator Baxter had chiefly in mind, the case where a Minister under delegated power is doing something pretty drastic.  He may be right or he may be wrong.  He may have a case which has satisfied himself or, what is more likely, a case which has satisfied the officials of his Department but which will not satisfy people who are approaching it from an outside or judicial point of view.  Now, there is a case in which I think a committee examining it would be entitled to say: &ldquo;This may be right, but no case has yet been made for it, and the matter should be referred to the House as a whole to see what case the Minister will make for it before we approve of it.&rdquo;  I am not going to give instances of specific Orders, but there have been Orders in the Courts within the last few years which were, I think, ill-advised, and, as a lawyer, I would say were unfair.  They were attacked on political grounds, and being attacked on political grounds they were defended on political grounds because we know that action and reaction in politics, as in everything else, are equal.  If they had been referred to a neutral committee it might have said: &ldquo;You may be right about this but we are far from satisfied and we think it should be debated in the House.&rdquo;  In that way the problem of the justification for the making of the Order might have been <Col N="1534" /> approached in a spirit in which people would not be already committed to supporting or opposing a particular side.</P>
    <P>In these three cases I think Senator Duffy's proposal would work.  I am sure he will agree with me that in the process of carrying out his suggestion in committee difficulties would arise.  I think he would be the first person to suggest modifications in the procedure to overcome those difficulties when they did arise.  I am convinced that this proposal is a genuine attempt to meet one of the greatest problems of modern Parliamentary government.  It was only quite recently that I happened to take up in the Library an article on modern Parliamentary government which pointed out that it was really a misnomer: that it was Parliamentary bureaucracy.  I think that the word &ldquo;bureaucrat&rdquo; was avoided because it has a slightly coloured connotation in people's minds, but the point made was that it was a mixture of Parliamentary government and Civil Service government.  The sooner we face that fact the better and, having faced it, the sooner we try to work it in the best way we can by reinstituting some kind of checks by Parliament, the better it will be.  I wholeheartedly support Senator Duffy's motion, and I ask the House to do so also.</P>

      <P>Thank God for that.  I was afraid they represented a message which the Government had sent to us. I never heard anything so completely lacking in argument, reason and logic as Senator Hawkins' speech.  Senator Hawkins told us that no case had been made for the committee and that he was not convinced there was a case <Col N="1535" /> for the motion.  I endeavoured to quote the views in relation to this matter of a Chief Justice.  I quoted Senator Comyn, a member of Senator Hawkins' Party at one time.  I referred to the order made by Córas Iompair Éireann under an Act which did not exist.  But none of these things convinced Senator Hawkins that there was a case for a committee. What would have convinced him he refrained from telling us.  If he had told us the kind of evidence which he wanted, I should have availed of this opportunity to put it before him. Senator Hayes was very naïve.  I have been wondering often, when Senator Hayes departs from the usual practice of Parliamentary argument and logic, whether he would like to see the destruction of Parliamentary institutions.  I am waiting for him to say that he would not.  Senator Hayes spoke as if I were pressing the Oireachtas to extend the powers of Ministers to make regulations. Senator Hayes knows that, while we have not resisted the proposals of Ministers to make regulations, except on rare occasions, we have fought strenuously in this House for a provision in all the Bills authorising the making of regulations requiring those regulations to be tabled and an opportunity of annulment given to the House.</P>

      <P>I can well understand it. I referred to the &ldquo;Party line&rdquo;.  There is no need to discuss the Party line amongst members who understand each other so thoroughly as Senator Hayes and Senator Baxter.  I should like to put to Senator Hawkins the views of the Taoiseach.  I want to recall to his mind a speech delivered in this House <Col N="1536" /> by the Taoiseach on the 24th July, 1942, when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is within the power of both Houses to set up a committee, if they wish, and to give them the duty of looking over Orders and of reporting to the House if they think it necessary to do so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Senator did not dissent.  The importance of the reference is that it followed a statement by Professor Magennis on the Emergency Powers Bill, 1942.  This is the relevant portion of the speech made by Professor Magennis:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As anyone who studies them knows, we have a large accumulation of Orders which it would be impossible for the ordinary Senator to become acquainted with.  It would be well to have some members of a committee with a duty upon them of a keeping a vigilant eye on these Orders and of making a report when necessary.  This is a procedure which would be very helpful to the preservation of liberty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I commend that statement to Senator Hawkins and I remind Senator Baxter and Senator Hayes that a man of the competence of Professor Magennis considered it was not possible for members of this House individually to check up on those Orders and that he thought a committee should be appointed for the purpose.  The late Senator Magennis was a man of great competence and industry and, if he was convinced that a committee should be set up for this purpose, I think I am on reasonably safe ground in arguing that the 60 members of this House cannot do the job individually and that if they were to try to do it it would be a waste of energy and effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of the committee does not relieve any member of his obligations.  It would still be the duty of members to make themselves acquainted with the rules and regulations and to put down annulment motions if they thought it.  However, I do not think that that is the best approach.  I consider that the best approach is to have a committee set up and, if any person considered that there was something in a regulation of doubtful <Col N="1537" /> validity, he could approach the members of the committee who would consult about it.  I cannot understand the confusion in the mind of Senator Baxter about members of the committee pulling this way and that.  The analogy I draw is with the Public Accounts Committee in the Dáil.  The members of that committee are appointed on the basis of proportional representation and the chairman must not be a member of the Government Party.  Civil servants are called before the committee and examined.  The evidence is published and the report of the committee is published.  It is signed by the chairman and I think that there is no record of any occasion on which the committee differed as to the facts proven before it.  Why should they?  Surely, there are ten competent persons in this House sufficiently honest to sit down and say that certain things have been proven before them, if they believe them to have been proven, and that they should be brought before the House.  The final decision rests with the House.  There has been criticism of this resolution on the ground of lack of precision.  I endeavoured to get a copy of the resolution proposed in the British House of Commons.  It is even less detailed than the proposal before the House.  The motion moved in the House of Commons on the 17th May, 1944, was in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this House would welcome the setting up of a Select Committee with power to send for persons, papers and records, whose duty it would be to carry on a continuous examination of all statutory rules, orders and other instruments of delegated legislation and to report from week to week whether, in the opinion of the committee, any such instrument is obscure or contains matter of controversy or should for any reason be brought to the special attention of the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was brought before the British House of Commons and led to a very protracted debate.  At the end of the debate, it was withdrawn on the assurance of the British Home Secretary of the day that the Government would introduce a motion in more detailed <Col N="1538" /> terms, setting out the functions and obligations of the committee.  The Government came to the House of Commons with a detailed motion. Senator Hayes quoted part of it.  It is contained, as I have said already, in the third special report from the Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders, dated 29th October, 1946. That committee was appointed, as I have said, in accordance with the proposal submitted to the House of Commons on behalf of the Government.  Its function is&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to consider every statutory rule or order (including any provisional rule made under Section 2 of the Rules Publication Act, 1893) laid, or laid in draft, before the House, being a rule or draft upon which proceedings may be taken in either House in pursuance of any Act of Parliament, with a view to determining whether the special attention of the House should be drawn to it on any of the following grounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It then sets out the grounds on which the attention of the House may be directed to any particular instrument. The committee reports if attention should be so directed.</P>
    <P>I commenced my speech this evening by stating that if the resolution, in its specific terms, was unsatisfactory to the House, I should be willing to withdraw it if we could agree upon a more satisfactory form of words.  But that is not the objection taken by Senator Hawkins, Senator Baxter, or Senator Hayes.  Their objection is that the procedure is unworkable.  Senator Hawkins is not convinced that we need it at all.  He thinks that everything is beautiful and that it would be a mistake to ask any body of men to perform any function for this House.  Senator Baxter thinks much along the same lines.</P>

There is no case for this House if it is merely to meet a certain number of times in the year and pass Bills as they are presented by Ministers in the same way as the Immature Spirits Bill was passed this evening when the Minister for Finance told us that the Parliamentary Draftsman had prepared it, that he presented it and that we had to take it. In his Opposition days, the Taoiseach considered that the Seanad should be abolished.  I wonder what justification there is for a Seanad that refuses to do any work.  Does this House take its responsibilities seriously and is it prepared to perform the functions it is <Col N="1540" /> capable of performing and ought to pering? I may remind some members of the House that a motion similar to this was debated on a previous occasion and that a vote was taken upon it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move motion No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann views with alarm the growth of State intervention in commercial enterprise, particularly through the medium of nominal boards and companies, and requests the Government, not merely to refrain from any extension of this policy, but also to dispose immediately to private ownership of as many of such enterprises as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, first of all, to direct the attention of the House to the wording of the motion, particularly the wording of the first phrase.  The motion deals with the growth of State intervention in commercial enterprise.  I used the word &ldquo;growth&rdquo; quite deliberately because I felt that what occurred was that over the years little nibbles were taken at a time, little actions which perhaps we were inclined to overlook because, in respect of the particular matter to which each referred at the <Col N="1541" /> time, we had some special interest.  But when they were pieced together in one picture they showed a deliberate growth rather than a series of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions.  I used the words &ldquo;commercial enterprise&rdquo; also quite deliberately because I wanted to make it clear that it was in regard to what are normally considered in these days in which we live as commercial transactions that I was interested and that I was not interested in what might best, perhaps, be described in modern conversation as &ldquo;public utilities&rdquo;.  I do not consider that public utilities are commercial enterprises in the ordinary sense. They are operated from the public point of view and from the consumers' point of view, as apart from the point of view of a commercial nature in their transactions.</P>
    <P>I ask the House, therefore, to look at the whole picture to see that there has been a gradual extension of State intervention in commercial enterprise and secondly in the manner in which that State intervention has taken shape, through what we have come to describe as a nominal board or a nominal company, or a dummy company as it has been termed at other times.  If the State is going to interfere in commercial enterprise there are two methods open to it&mdash;the direct method or the setting up of a nominal board, a dummy company, utilising the Companies Acts which were framed and phrased for an entirely different purpose and utilising them to achieve something that they were never intended, and in my view should never have been intended, to permit.  Having dealt with it in that aspect I ask the House to suggest that these commercial enterprises should be transferred to private ownership.  Those acquainted with the Irish Stock Exchange agree at once that there is nothing like the number of Irish investments available for those who want to invest their money in Irish public concerns.  Every stockbroker will say, upon being asked when it is possible for him to invest money to purchase Irish stocks and shares, that the demand for these is very much greater than the supply. Therefore I suggest that the method I have mentioned here in the latter end <Col N="1542" /> of my motion is one method in which that demand could easily and safely be met.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps refer to the two amendments.  The amendment which stands in the name of Senator Duffy, if it were confined to public utilities which necessarily must be under State control, is one which I could support in principle though with certain detailed objections.  As I read the amendment in its juxtaposition to my motion it assumes that Senator Duffy is anxious to promote the growth of State intervention in commercial enterprise and, therefore, it clashes with the principle of my motion at once in that respect.  His amendment is the embodiment of the policy of extended State intervention and socialism and as such could not be accepted, in my view.  The amendment in the name of Senator Sir John Keane largely visualises also consideration of the principles to be adopted in respect of what might fairly be described as public utilities.  In fact from hearing Senator Sir John Keane on many occasions here advocating this principle of an efficiency audit it seems fairly clear that he is considering that efficiency audit in relation to matters which it is agreed should be under the control of the State rather than under private commercial control.  Therefore, to that extent it is hardly relevant to the phraseology of a commercial enterprise. Certainly I do not think the Senator has much the same outlook or intention as Senator Duffy has in his amendment, namely, to promote State intervention in every aspect of our commercial life.</P>
    <P>To come back to the general question, this is not a question that has been suddenly sprung upon us.  It is one which we have discussed in side-line aspects during the passage of various Bills, each of which in its own particular way affected some segment of our commercial life.  They impinged upon the principle but were considered only by themselves and not as part of a general policy.  This problem was considered by the Banking Commission which brought forth its report in the middle of the last decade.  It was discussed at some length in that report <Col N="1543" /> and in the majority report the principle was condemned in no uncertain fashion.  It was condemned then as a method by which public liabilities could be increased without consideration by the body properly appointed and constituted to consider such public liabilities, namely, the Oireachtas.  In page 287 of that report one sentence is of particular importance.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is manifestly objectionable that subsidiary Government bodies, through possessing in an indirect way borrowing powers designed for private enterprise, should be in a position in effect to increase the debt of the State in a manner that does not come under the direct cognisance or control of the Legislature or the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that that was a sentiment expressed by that commission in relation to the habit these subsidiary companies had of borrowing additional capital without Parliamentary sanction.  Following that commission's report the matter was referred to in the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation.  Its report was submitted after many years of work of which most Senators are fully aware.  In its consideration of the lines upon which vocational organisation was desirable, for very obvious reasons they considered to a very serious degree the method by virtue of which the growth of State intervention in commercial enterprise had taken place up to that date.  But however much it was then a fact that there was such a growth, I think that, as I shall attempt to show, the growth has become even more marked, more pronounced, and more rapid since that time.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Vocational Organisation in making their report&mdash;I am speaking again of the majority report&mdash;on this problem did so from two points of view.  They first of all felt that there was in the Civil Service a scheme of rules and regulations built up over the years to ensure that, as far as possible, there could not be any divergence or any evasion of the one essential matter, namely, that Parliament should retain its grip on the moneys disbursed by it.  In order to do <Col N="1544" /> that there were regulations&mdash;called at times &ldquo;red tape&rdquo;&mdash;which at least made certain that the funds would be disbursed in the way envisaged when voted by the Oireachtas.  I want to be quite clear that I am not for a moment suggesting that in any of the public corporations or companies in which the Minister for Finance is a shareholder the funds are misapplied.  Nothing is further from my mind.  What is in my mind is that the Oireachtas very often intended that the funds they were granting would be given to a body for purpose A, but that, in fact, the funds they gave for purpose A were diverted to purpose B because the body in question thought that the better purpose. I shall give an example of that, but it is a fact, if that is done, that there is absolutely no manner in which, under State intervention, that can be controlled or prevented.  It is surely undesirable that a system can exist in which that is possible.</P>
    <P>If, at any time, any of us were asked what in a particular moment was the best system of government at that particular moment, I think we should probably look back and say that at that particular moment the best and most efficient method of governing a country for one particular moment was that of a benevolent despotism, provided you were absolutely satisfied that the person directing the State was benevolent; but, equally, there is not one of us who would not say that, taken out of its context for a moment and taken for even a short period in the life of a nation, it is the worst system&mdash;remember we are all human&mdash; and that it is the one system that is absolutely certain at some stage to fall into the hands of somebody who is not, to use the same word again, benevolent.</P>
    <P>In building up any system of State control, or any system of State government, it is no use whatever building it up on the basis of saying: &ldquo;I know very well that the people to whom I am now giving these powers are people who are not going to abuse them.&rdquo;  If you give powers that can be abused then, in effect, you are creating a situation or a system which is absolutely certain to mean in the long run that the powers will be abused.  In this <Col N="1545" /> system of nominal companies we are creating something by virtue of which there is going to be throughout the many aspects of our national life which they embrace a system which is going to be controlled by people who have no responsibility to anybody except to themselves in respect of their direction of these particular enterprises.  We are building up a system which is as certain as is the Communist system to mean that, eventually, there will be command at the top with tentacles stretching out through each one of these separate enterprises which can be controlled and used for purely despotic ends, even if not used for the intermediate stage of political ends.  I suggest to anybody who considers it from that angle that it is an eventuality which should make us consider whether it is a growth and a system which it is wise to permit. We must consider this from the general aspect of the people who are possibly going to administer such a system rather than from that of the people who are administering the system at the moment.  If we restrict ourselves to the latter we are going to make quite certain that we are putting into the hands of somebody who may come along something which he may use in an unscrupulous fashion&mdash;in a way that nobody visualises or intends.  None of us in any part of the House would wish to see that happen.</P>
    <P>The growth of these nominal boards and companies was also discussed rather fully in the recommendations of the Commission on Vocational Organisation. In paragraph 683 it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is interesting to note that by the device of the nominal company this form of State activity has escaped from the fundamental rules of the Civil Service, which were designed for integrity, economy and Parliamentary control.  In these nominal companies appointments of directors and officials (managers, secretaries, solicitors and auditors) are not made on a competitive basis but by patronage; there is no strict accounting of funds to the Comptroller and Auditor-General....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>May I leave that for a moment and acknowledge at once that certain of <Col N="1546" /> the companies do have their accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  That audit by him is different from the Parliamentary audit that he makes for the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is an audit to ensure that the moneys which are spent by the nominal company are not misapplied in the dishonest sense that I mentioned a moment ago.  It is an audit to ensure that the expenditure is properly vouched, but it is not the same type of audit as that carried out in the case of a State Department, the purpose of which is to ensure that the moneys are applied solely in the manner decided by the Oireachtas.  One of the chief functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General in auditing the accounts of State Departments is to see that not merely have the moneys voted been properly vouched and the accounts properly balanced, but that they have been spent on the purposes for which the Dáil voted them.  No such requirement, however, applies in the case of the audit of the accounts of nominal companies carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor - General. The requirement there is only to see that the moneys have been spent and are properly vouched, and that the accounts are balanced.  The quotation continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there is no responsibility to Parliament, as the Minister who sets up such a company or provides it with public money refuses to answer questions in the Dáil concerning it.</P>
    <P>This method of administration is clearly fraught with great dangers to the prestige and integrity of democratic government.  It offers a wide field for the exercise of political patronage of a very costly and undesirable type, for not merely may large salaries be given to persons as a reward for political services, but large sums of money for capital and working expenses may be placed at their disposal without adequate safeguards. It could provide an unscrupulous government with a means of making a large number of persons dependent on it for salaries and wages and of obtaining <Col N="1547" /> electioneering support by promoting enterprises or industries in certain localities without due regard to economic factors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It could do these things, and any system of government that could do so, regardless of whether it does do these things is, in fact, a dangerous system, the introduction of which is likely seriously to affect our national life in the future.  It is not a new system.  It is a system that started first with public utilities.  A nominal board was first started as far as I am aware in respect of the Electricity Supply Board which is clearly a public utility that could not be placed for that reason under private enterprise.  Not so very long ago the Minister introduced a Bill in this House dealing with the winding up of the Turf Development Board and the starting of Bord na Móna.  I think it was stated from these benches at the time that, in respect to the development of turf, if it was to be developed, clearly it had to be developed on a public utility basis by the State. Therefore, I subscribed to that.  It is obvious that an undertaking of such magnitude could not be dealt with by ordinary private commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>I do not think of Bord na Móna as anything but a public utility concern. In effect, if it were not for one particular body, I do not think I would have put into this motion the words &ldquo;nominal boards&rdquo; at all.  I would have left it at &ldquo;companies&rdquo;.  In addition to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna, another board was set up most specifically, according to the records of the House, for the purpose of regulating the tourist trade. The Irish Tourist Board was set up for the purpose of grading, registering and preventing abuses in respect of the tourist traffic.  The Minister when setting up that board took power for it in certain sections to operate enterprises, but made it clear, particularly in the Dáil in 1939, that there was no intention of that happening.</P>
    <P>Then we saw comparatively recently the Tourist Board coming along and, through the device of the dummy company, setting up a subsidiary of its own, Fáilte, Teoranta, which deliberately <Col N="1548" /> went into commercial enterprises. I still feel very strongly, and I said so on the passage of the last Tourist Traffic Bill, that if there was any justification for that, the proper way to do it would have been for the Minister to go to the Dáil.  He could say so openly, rather than having a nominal board promoting a subsidiary in a manner definitely not envisaged by the Minister at the time the Bill was introduced, and in a way, in fact, that the Minister most assuredly implied the powers given would not be used.  That is a most specific example of the manner in which, because Parliament had lost control over the funds, that board was able to do something that Parliament had no intention of giving it power to do when the original Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>Apart from that question, there was in 1927 a company set up known as the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited. It was set up for a specific purpose. The specific purpose was explained to the Dáil at the time; it was to acquire the Newmarket Creamery and certain other creameries in the South; it was then to pass them over to other control, out of State control; it was to ensure that they would not at that time pass into control outside the country.  Above all, it was but a temporary expedient to ensure that, while the State would make the purchase, it would equally pass them on to co-operative societies or some similar private groupings of individuals in the areas concerned.  That company was set up 20 years ago, and by its very name, the Dairy Disposal Company, the Oireachtas and the Minister at the time had it in mind that it was to be a purely temporary expedient to get control out of certain hands and pass it on to private enterprise.  Twenty years after that the company is still operating as a Government concern. It is operating as a commercial concern, is operating entirely, as far as I am aware, under civil servants; by the same civil servants who to-day are directors of the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, and to-morrow are responsible for regulating the creamery concerns of all their competitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> I mentioned already the invidious position of the Irish Tourist Board and Aer Rianta, Teoranta.  Exactly the same thing is happening there. We have in the Tourist Board regulations by which hotels in the country will be graded and made to conform to certain standards.  At one moment of the day certain people, as members of the Irish Tourist Board, are sitting in judgment on the grading which is to be adopted in respect of visitors to hotels, and the next moment the directors of the subsidiary company are considering how, in competition with other private hotels, they are going to carry on their commercial business.  That surely is not a system that presages good for the commercial life of the community.</P>
    <P>Apart from that instance of the manner in which subsidiary companies have operated or have been established, I want to refer most specifically to two other cases.  The Minister set up a company known as Irish Shipping Limited.  I do not want to go into any discussion whatever as to the achievements of that company or otherwise. That does not enter into what is in my mind.  What does enter into it is an operation of that company which was carried out some six months ago.  Irish Shipping, Limited, as is well known, is a purely Government concern in the sense that the Government owns all the share capital and, therefore, completely controls it.  Irish Shipping, Limited, and more power to it, had developed an arm for shipping insurance and some six months ago they decided that the time had come with the end of the war when they could get out of this insurance business.  They decided that it was desirable that the insurance business should be transferred to another company.  Negotiations were started and were completed by virtue of which the insurance business was transferred to a private company, namely, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  If there was any justification for public companies going into commercial business it is perhaps to act as what I might term a primer.  Irish Shipping, Limited, acted as primer in building up a marine insurance business and then decided, quite properly, <Col N="1550" /> to pass it over to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  It was formally handed over and if that was all that happened I would have no cause for complaint.  But what did happen was that Irish Shipping, Limited, while passing over their marine insurance business insisted on being guaranteed that they would be the majority shareholder. They did that and the result is that Irish Shipping, Limited, now holds more than 50 per cent. of the shares of the Insurance Corporation, Limited, and the Government through its nominees in Irish Shipping, Limited, now also control this private concern, the Irish Insurance Corporation, which deals with ordinary business, fire and accident insurance and workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may suggest that while they did acquire this control it just came and that it was not control which they proposed in any way to operate but the fact is that the very moment he acquired this control he insisted that the secretary of his Department would be made the chairman of what had been a private concern dealing with ordinary business. Because of the Minister having got this control the position is that yet another private concern has passed into his domain and the secretary of his Department is chairman of this concern. Let me make it crystal clear that I am not passing any strictures, direct or indirect, on the qualifications or the qualities of this secretary.  But it does happen that he is secretary of one of the principal Departments of State and I suggest that it is entirely unreasonable for the secretary of one of the principal Departments of State to be the chairman of an insurance company dealing with business of the nature with which it does deal and which must of course have the ordinary dealings with the Department of Industry and Commerce. Under the Insurance Acts insurance companies are bound to make certain returns in certain ways to his Department.  However desirable it may be&mdash;and again I want to stress that I am not in any way suggesting that the secretary of the Minister's Department is not the most competent <Col N="1551" /> person&mdash;I do not think it is feasible for any man, even a superman, to act in all these capacities.  It is not possible for a person to fulfil the immense responsibilities that must devolve on the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce and to be chairman of a commercial insurance company, director of Irish Shipping, Limited, director of The Irish Assurance Company, Limited, director of Aer Lingus, director of Aer Rianta and possibly a director of the other subsidiary formed to Aer Rianta.  I do not know the directors of this company or whether the directors of the parent company are also directors of the subsidiary.</P>
    <P>No man, no matter what sort of superman he is, could possibly act on these commercial enterprises and at the same time be secretary of an important Government Department like the Department of Industry and Commerce. We see also in respect of this growth that there are certain people, nearly always the same people, in control of these various boards.  I think it is highly undesirable that these people, appointed by the Government as directors of these concerns, are in a position to exercise, if they desire, a stranglehold over the commercial life of the community.  They are in a position to do it by reason of the many aspects of life into which the Government have decided that the State shall intervene in commercial enterprise. Consideration of the answer given in the Dáil on the 23rd October last to a question dealing with Government companies shows that again and again the same names are cropping up and that it is the same people who are considered desirable to operate the different angles of our commercial life. We have in consequence about ten people, some of whom are civil servants, who are now in the position of carrying on commercial business as part of their ordinary avocation and in regard to what I may call their extraordinary avocation they are in the position of running State enterprises.  And all the advantages lie behind State enterprises in regard to money and power.  If a State enterprise requires <Col N="1552" /> money it is going to obtain it in a different way from a commercial enterprise, and if it requires extra powers it is going to obtain them in a different way from the ordinary commercial concern. The obvious inference is that it is impossible for them to divorce themselves, when they are State employees, from the fact that they are running commercial concerns.  I do not know whether the Minister is of the opinion that this problem has not become a widespread one.  I do not know whether he appreciates the number of occasions upon which the State has taken unto itself to go into commercial life in respect of agriculture alone&mdash; we have the Dairy Disposal Company, Ltd., the Irish National Stud Company and the Pigs and Bacon Commission, all dealing with some aspect of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In respect of the Minister's own Department, we have the two companies which were dealt with quite recently here&mdash;Mianraí, Teoranta, and Ceimicí, Teoranta&mdash;and we have also the aspect of the Irish Shipping Company taking control of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to which I have referred.  Also, in respect of the other aspect of insurance, we have the State entering not merely into industrial life assurance but into ordinary life assurance. When it became desirable some years ago to amalgamate the existing industrial life assurance companies, whose diversity and overhead expenses were very large, two companies were set up&mdash;the Industrial Life Amalgamation Company and the Irish Assurance Company.  The amalgamation and winding up was considered a very proper thing, but the future participation by the State in competition with the ordinary insurance company was considered unwise.  Therefore, it was hoped that, when the amalgamation and winding up was finished, the new company would be able to take over as an ordinary private commercial concern.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House by going over the whole list of concerns in which the State has taken a commercial interest as apart from a public utility interest, but I want to stress with all the vehemence I can command that the Government should be there <Col N="1553" /> as the regulator between one private concern and another and if the regulator is also going to be a competitor it ceases to be an honest regulator, no matter what the intentions may be.  It is utterly impossible for the directors of the Dairy Disposal Company, Limited, when sitting in their capacity as creamery regulators, to divorce themselves from the position they are in the next moment as the owners of creameries.  It must be quite impossible for a civil servant to be sitting at one moment as a civil servant and the next moment as the director of a concern. I am perfectly certain that, as the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, that civil servant would not approve of the Government entering into the control of a fire insurance office, yet when he is sitting as a director of Irish Shipping, Limited, I can understand it.  The two things are not at all compatible and should be completely and absolutely divorced.</P>
    <P>There would be no difficulty whatever in the Minister to-morrow determining that the shares of Fáilte, Teoranta, should be put on the market and they would be taken up very quickly and it would become a private concern.  The same applies to the shares of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which are held by Irish Shipping, Limited.  If put on the market in the same way and allotted to the public, they would be taken up, probably at a substantial profit.  There should be no difficulty&mdash;and this is the final point with which I wish to deal&mdash;in the Government determining to-morrow that the Industrial Credit Company should part to the public with any shares it holds that it can part with at a profit.  That company was set up to help in underwriting Irish industries by making capital available and passing that capital on to the public and in certain circumstances by giving loans on the lines of the trade loans. That is not the way in which the Industrial Credit Company has been entirely used.  It has gone into the ordinary stock exchange market and purchased shares in commercial concerns and used them solely for the purpose of endeavouring to get its own nominees <Col N="1554" /> on the boards of those companies, even though the companies were not in need of any capital or assistance and had not ever asked for it.</P>
    <P>Not so many years ago, there was a case in court in which the whole machinations of the Industrial Credit Company were laid bare.  It was made clear to the court, and to the public who read the report of the case, that the directors of the company took it into their heads that there was a certain commercial concern which it would be very nice for them to control.  They gave their stockbrokers instructions that any time any of the shares of that concern came on the stock exchange they were to be bought for the company.  In that way, the company acquired a substantial holding in this concern, which never had asked for any assistance and did not want it, which was able to stand on its own legs and was carrying out its own business in its own way. Having bought those shares in that way, suddenly at a general meeting of that company, the Industrial Credit Company canvassed the shareholders to see whether they would be able to get the other shareholders to support a nominee of the Industrial Credit Company as a director of the company in question.  If the Minister thinks that that is a proper utilisation of the funds voted by the State to finance Irish industry, I am afraid he and I must sadly differ.  It is another example of powers being given and being abused.</P>
    <P>There should be no necessity, except purely for priming, for the State to intervene in ordinary commercial enterprise and, in the instances I have mentioned, the necessity for that priming has passed.  There is ample capital ready, willing and anxious to take up shares in those concerns and by virtue of which the concerns would pass into proper Irish, commercial, competitive ownership and cease to be the monopoly of the State.  That would put an end to these dummy companies through which control can be exercised from the top, right through the whole of commercial life, in a way that could impose a tyranny such as very few of us here can visualise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment standing in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;views&rdquo; in line 1 and insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;with concern the tendency to finance out of public moneys commercial enterprises of a monopoly character not subject to Parliamentary control and requests the Government to introduce proposals for legislation designed to secure the fullest measure of Parliamentary control, consistent with commercial efficiency, over the conduct and operation of such concerns&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the motion is a proposal that organisations established by the State by utilising public money should be disposed of to private concerns.</P>
      <P>Senator Sweetman asks that the Government should not merely refrain from any extension of the policy of establishing commercial concerns, but that they should dispose immediately to private ownership of as many of such enterprises as possible. I am wondering what he means by the qualifying words, &ldquo;as possible&rdquo;.  I take it that he has in his mind the feeling that the public might be willing to subscribe capital for some of the concerns that he refers to, and that the public will only subscribe where there is a profit to be made from the investment. Senator Sweetman, like a good businessman, does not desire the public to subscribe to non-profit-making concerns. They are to be left to the State. We leave the cleaning of the streets to local bodies because we do not make a profit out of it.  We also leave to the State and to the local authorities the duty of providing fresh water.  At one time the water company was as popular as the brewing companies, let us say, but you make much more money out of brewing ale than you do out of providing fresh water, and therefore Senator Sweetman would like his friends to get in on the ground floor of the brewing company and to keep away from the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1556" /> It seems to me that this idea of establishing concerns of a commercial character under the auspices of the State originated in the fact that private enterprise was unwilling to provide the money in sufficiently large quantities for what they believed to be speculative enterprise.  The first of these was the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;the Shannon scheme.  That enterprise will now, or will in a short time, I imagine, involve the capitalisation of about £40,000,000.  It is now on a firm footing. As a monopoly it is free to charge what it likes for its service and is sure to make a profit.  It was not always certain that electricity would be a profitable undertaking, and on that account those who now would like to see all these industries pass over to private enterprise were not anxious to float a company to provide a national electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;monopoly,&rdquo; of course, is most misleading in this connection. There is no such thing as a monopoly when applied to State enterprise.  The State is the custodian of the public interest; the State is the people's executive, and it is entirely incorrect, as I understand the term, to refer to an organisation&mdash;a commercial concern or an industrial concern promoted by the State&mdash;as a monopoly.  I have not made an exhaustive investigation into the meaning of the phrase, but nowadays it is fashionable to refer to dictionaries.  In this connection I did refer, in fact, to a dictionary to see what exactly was the definition of the word &ldquo;monopoly.&rdquo;  In Virtue's Encyclopædic Dictionary the definition: that is given is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The exclusive or nearly exclusive right to, or possession of, a given industry, resulting in a power of control over it, whereby prices may be raised through an artificial limitation of supply; a company possessing such control over supply and prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is contemplated there is a privately-owned company having control over supplies, so that it may lift prices. What is the position?  It is clearly improper to apply that term to a concern owned by the State, because there is no need for a State company <Col N="1557" /> to raise prices to make profits. Assuming it does make profits, these go back again to the community.  If the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, makes profits, they are the property of the Irish people.  That surely is to be distinguished from the instance that I gave when referring to Guinness, which is clearly a monopoly. The profits of that concern belong to the shareholders, who may or may not be citizens of this country.  It is a matter of common knowledge that a considerable proportion of the shareholders of that concern are not citizens of this country, and the profits derived from the business leave this country to the extent that the shareholders have a foreign domicile.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman is of opinion that the amendment tabled in my name proposes an extension of this policy of Government-promoted concerns.  As a matter of fact, it does nothing of the kind.  I am not arguing that point, which can be discussed on another occasion.  What I am trying to do is to invite the House to reject the proposal that these concerns, which now exist and which are now operated by the State, should be handed over to private enterprise.  That is the first purpose.  The second purpose of the amendment is to secure the support of this House for the proposal that there should be greater control, in fact effective control, over enterprises operated by the State.</P>
    <P>That is one of the problems which should concern us, not the problem of handing over to private enterprise such essential services as the Electricity Supply Board to be exploited in private rather than public interests. That is not our immediate concern. The policy of the country is settled on that point.  I do not think that there is any volume of opinion in support of the view that State concerns, already existing, should be sold out to private enterprise.  Senator Sweetman will discover that if he makes that the front plank in his platform, there will be no support for that proposal in the country.  I believe that many of Senator Sweetman's friends would desert him on that score.  I could not see Senator Hayes backing him in a proposal <Col N="1558" /> to sell out the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>I should imagine that, if the resolution were adopted by this House and commanded the support of the Dáil, the legislation which would follow would not distinguish between the Sugar Company, Irish Shipping, the Insurance Corporation, the Tourist Board and its auxiliaries and the Electricity Supply Board.  Where there are monopolies, in the correct sense of the term, there has not been a word of complaint or comment.  The Dublin Gas Company is a monopoly in the true sense of the term.  It has a monopoly given by Parliament, subject to certain reservations, to make profits for the shareholders and not to provide a public service.  Dublin Tramways Company was a monopoly and I never heard any of the opponents of Government-controlled concerns advocating the destruction of such a monopoly.  There are many such monopolies, not designedly so, but monopolies in effect. I think it would be correct to say that Irish Sewing Cotton is a monopoly. If so, what advantage does the public derive from the fact that a privately-owned concern has what is virtually a monopoly which is being denied to a concern promoted by the community, because, as I have said, the Government, in these matters, is purely the <Col N="1559" /> people's executive, carrying on the business of the community for the people in the same way that the directors of a private company carry on the business of that company in the interest of the shareholders.  We are all shareholders in this concern.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane wants an efficiency audit and control.  We all feel that there ought to be effective supervision with a view to seeing that the intentions, desires and interests of the public are safeguarded. The purpose of the amendment is to direct attention to the need for supervision by the Parliament of the nation over the conduct of concerns financed by the public.  The Government have no money for this purpose except the money provided by the public.  My own feeling in respect of many of those concerns in which public money is invested is that, while the control may or may not be effective, the publicity &mdash;the information given to the public as to the manner in which the concern is conducted&mdash;is inadequate.  The people are entitled to the fullest information regarding the operations, policy and tendencies of a concern financed by public money.  That is done in certain cases.  In some of these cases, the policy of the company is elaborated at the annual meetings.  But that is not done in all cases.  It would be a good thing for the community and for the concern in question if the widest publicity were given to its activities and an indication given as to whether it was making a profit or the basis on which it was being conducted.  We know that a concern can operate in such a way as to show an apparent profit without having, in fact, earned a profit at all.  That is one of the things in which the Minister should be keenly interested&mdash;to ensure that the public have the fullest information as to what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that it is the purpose of a concern of this kind to make a profit.  There may be excellent reasons for running a public concern at a substantial loss which would be made good out of public funds.  That would be the case if there were greater advantage to the community by running the <Col N="1560" /> concern at a loss than by making a profit.  In the case of the Electricity Supply Board, for instance, I could see an excellent argument, if there were no shortage of power, for providing light and heat to working-class houses at a nominal price, even though that involved a loss.  I do not want to be understood as suggesting that the purpose of the accountancy or of the publicity which I advocate should be to boost profit-making.  What I am anxious to secure is that the fullest information be given and that, if a concern operated under the auspices of the Government is run at a loss, the Government should have no hesitation in publishing the accounts and showing that, in fact, it has been run at a loss, and that it is regarded as good State policy that it should incur a loss rather than it should deny its services to people who could not afford to pay an economic price for them.</P>
    <P>In this city, for instance, and probably in most parts of the country, housing is run at a loss, if it is regarded on a commercial basis. Houses which would, probably, cost £1 a week if an economic rent were charged by Dublin Corporation are let at 8/- or 9/- a week.  Everybody who knows anything about the city's finances knows that a rent of 8/- or 9/- a week is not economic but nobody growls about it.  Many people have been urging the corporation to reduce the rents of working-class houses even further, and they know that by reducing the rents there must be a greater subsidy either from taxation or from the rates.</P>
    <P>In the same way a case could be made for, let us say, cheaper sugar, even though that might involve a greater subsidy from public funds.  The price of butter is now fixed at a figure which is considerably below the economic price, but it is regarded as good State policy to provide butter at a particular price, even though that involves a subsidy from public funds.</P>
    <P>What interested me in Senator Sweetman's argument was the assumption that the directors of privately-owned companies are more efficient than the persons appointed to take charge of or to manage State concerns. <Col N="1561" /> I think everybody in this House will be able to recall instances of privately-owned concerns, in which there has been at one time or another gross mismanagement, apart altogether from the neglect of the public interest. I have had some experience of directors of companies which had a monopoly of their business who were utterly unfitted to control any business.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had the instance of a very large public concern, controlled by a board of directors, which was showing a loss year after year.  A committee of inquiry was appointed to advise the directors how the loss was to be converted into a profit.  A very voluminous report was prepared by a committee of experts and the board of directors sat down to consider it.  It will be within the knowledge of some members of this House that boards of directors always manage to adjourn at one o'clock for lunch, so that they had not much time to consider a voluminous report.  This board adjourned at one o'clock having reached the decision that, as there were two cats on the premises, one would have to be destroyed in order to save a half pint of milk daily.  At the time the company was losing at least £250,000 a year.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt about it.  I can give the Senator the name of the concern.  The chairman of that concern is well known and is probably a friend of the Senator.  The argument of Senator Sweetman is that if you hand over a big publicly-owned concern to a board of directors of the type I mentioned, the situation is saved, and the country will be happy ever after.  The real trouble is that when you sell out a publicly-owned concern to a body of shareholders you have no longer any guarantee that suitable people will be appointed to control it.  As a matter of fact, directors are appointed because they are large shareholders, and as long as there are proxy votes available there will always be sufficient proxies to elect directors.  I urge the House to reject the motion, and to consider whether it would not be desirable to declare that <Col N="1562" /> it desires greater control by the Oireachtas over the management and the policy of public concerns.</P>
      <P>I do not want to suggest that control should extend so that somebody could get up in the Dáil or in this House and ask the Minister to explain why Mr. A. was appointed a door-porter.  That would be ridiculous.  One of the fears in the minds of Parties in this country is that that kind of abuse would crop up.  I do not think there is as much tendency in that respect as one would imagine.  For instance, the Post Office is a State institution, with a Minister in charge and, in the main, the number of questions asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is much smaller than the number of questions asked any other Minister.  People have got to realise, and are every day becoming more conscious of the fact, that there must be a machine to operate these concerns, and that the Minister is not expected to enter into all their working affairs.  I urge that attention be given to that aspect of the matter.  The more the Minister, the more the Government, and the more Parliament interest the public in what is happening the more the public will be conscious that the business belongs to them, the more they will realise that it is in the public interest it should succeed and the more advantage it will be to public enterprise.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the motion to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and, further, requests the Government to set up an appropriate body to examine and recommend what principles should govern the establishment of public corporations in order to secure the best services possible to the community&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if any remarks I made embarrassed Senator Sweetman, because I am entirely in agreement with the principle he advocates in his motion.  I think he rendered outstanding service in bringing into the light a number of the abuses which now accompany Government interference in commercial enterprises.  If I felt there was <Col N="1563" /> a possibility of a shake out, and a return to commercial control, or the bringing in, as the Senator advocated, of private capital where it would be readily available, I am perfectly certain that that would be the right thing to do in the interests of the community.</P>
    <P>It is because, in the first place, I recognise that it must be borderline between legitimate public corporations, public utilities and legitimate private enterprise and because perhaps I may be cynic enough to doubt the Government that I want to make the best of a poor job.  That is really the purpose of my motion.  I think we should try to get the best results.  Senator Duffy made no reference to service.  I do not give a blow whether service comes from Socialism or private enterprise, but it is because I believe and am convinced that the best service comes from private enterprise that I am concerned with private enterprise.  I know Senator Duffy spoke about &ldquo;wise guys who would not come in unless they get 15 per cent.&rdquo; and Senator Kyle&mdash;and I always welcome his intervention in debate, because he is eminently wise&mdash; suggested that a company like the Industrial Alcohol Company, a Government company, could be perfectly trusted to give the best possible service. This idea that private enterprise has failed has got no justification whatever.  Look at the standard of living increasing year by year under private enterprise and do not merely look at one country.  Take America, for instance.  Where did its high standard of living come from except through private enterprise?  Look at Henry Ford, who gave every man his own car.  I am not saying that a high standard of living may not come one day from Socialism.  I know Socialism struck a bad wicket in recent years with the aftermath of the war and all the difficulties of production, but there is nothing to show yet that we are going to get this new world, this El Dorado in which we will have everything for nothing from a Socialist Government.  Let us judge by results. If Socialism will deliver the goods nobody will be happier than myself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1564" /> I think it is necessary to examine the outstanding features of enterprise and whether they can be proved to be sound when embodied in any form of public utility or public intervention in companies.  One of the outstanding features of enterprise I suggest is efficiency.  First of all it is the outcome of a healthy organism which has gradually grown.  Private enterprise has come from trial and error over the centuries.  It is an established system which has worked and kept communities together with a rising standard of civilisation in which the working classes have materially benefited.  Then there is the factor of incentive which has undoubtedly encouraged efficiency and invention.  It is necessary if you are going to get efficiency in any form of enterprise that there should be the factor of incentive.  You will not get the best results unless there is some goal or prize in view.  That is an outstanding feature of enterprise.  Then there are safeguards to the consumer. What safeguards to the consumer are we getting out of Socialism or out of the socialistic platitudes recited by Senator Duffy?  Senator Duffy does not concern himself with the efficiency of the product.  It may be conceivably in the public interest to meet a loss in private enterprise.  The safeguards to the consumer come from healthy competition and it was competition that resulted in the narrowing of profit margins and the best possible service to the public.  Above all there was the fear of bankruptcy which could not operate in any publicly-controlled institution.  In addition, there was the possibility of change, there were no inhibitions or obstacles to a change of policy and no one suggested that changes of policy or changes of method were not very difficult to bring about in any State-controlled institution. When you come to examine Government-controlled institutions you have first of all the bottomless purse.  There is no test that could be substituted for that of solvency.  A concern might on the face of it be reasonably sound, but in fact it might be going dead, declining and nothing could be done to bring it to life because you could not apply a test of solvency.  Government <Col N="1565" /> concerns seem to lack almost entirely the attributes of private enterprise. They lack incentive and the power of adaptation, they do not possess the test of bankruptcy and are artificially detached from the realities of true enterprise.</P>
    <P>What I am asking in my amendment is that the Government should set up an appropriate body to examine the whole problem and see what requirements are necessary to serve the public in the new age in which we now are. We are embarking more and more on Government control and interference in business and we have many public utilities which have come to stay.  I suggest that there is no blueprint whatever for the best method of control. Every method must be adapted more or less to the business in hand. Take the case of a public utility&mdash;Bord na Móna.  Senator Sweetman recognised it as a public utility and I do so, too, as I do not see any possible substitute in the form of commercial enterprise being attracted to a business of that kind, on account of its hitherto utterly uneconomic background.  I would like to see, in the case of Bord na Móna, some attempt to introduce an element of competition.  It is a question that needs examination, but it struck me that it might be quite conceivable to lease a portion of bog or enter into negotiations with some independent concern to produce turf at a price at least no higher than it is produced by the board itself, and then to give an incentive in a form of profit to the company or to give it the benefit of any reduction in price it could effect on the official price.  By that means, you would get a standard of comparison and you would have a test as to whether private enterprise, in a matter of that kind, was necessarily&mdash; and I expect it would be&mdash;more efficient than the public utility.  You would then get a comparison in the form of competition.</P>
    <P>The Senator dealt with the Tourist Board.  I think he has shown there that a most dangerous state of affairs exists.  He has also dealt with the Industrial Credit Company, which certainly should no longer remain under <Col N="1566" /> Government control.  He has dealt with what I intended to speak about, the Dairy Disposals Board, which should never have been kept so long. It was essentially a concern which should have reverted, as was originally intended, to the ordinary line of the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>I am going to deal with a number of questions which I suggest should be considered in principle by an appropriate body.  The first is the composition of the board.  Senator Sweetman has dealt with one aspect of that, with which I entirely agree.  It is most undesirable to have civil servants as a class, let alone one special civil servant, on a number of boards.  It cannot be to the benefit of the concern, or the efficiency of the Department with which he is connected or of the boards of which he is a member. After all, there is a limit to the powers of one individual and he could not possibly give the time and attention necessary to those many occupations.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the consumers' interests, which should be examined by this body.  Nobody seems to have primary regard for the essential element in the whole thing, the consumers.  There are many ways of dealing with this.  I do not see a consumers' member on a board being altogether a satisfactory method, but I feel that the unorganised consumers should be associated with enterprises that are creating commodity services or goods.  Possibly there could be a consumers' council.  I think something of that kind has been embodied in the new coal legislation in Great Britain.  It should be an active body and not merely one that is called into conference at long intervals or whenever the management sees fit. It should be taken into consultation once a month and should be encouraged to come forward with complaints and with views as to how the service could be improved.</P>
    <P>Another question for a body like this to consider is the responsibility of the taxpayer.  Senator Sweetman has dealt with that.  It might be old-fashioned, but there were very good reasons for the control of Parliament <Col N="1567" /> over public moneys.  What happens now?  An Act is passed and large sums of money are divorced altogether from close Parliamentary control.  They are given, as in the case of the Tourist Board, to the management to use to the best advantage and, except for accounts which appear annually and reports which hitherto have been very fragmentary in many cases, the public know nothing and, knowing nothing, they begin to become indifferent.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I would like to suggest the necessity of keeping public opinion in close touch with Government activities.  It is the only hope we have for democracy.  An educated democracy: people shrug their shoulders and say that that is talking entirely in the air and that we will never get it.  I am hoping we may get it and that we will reach a time when Senator Duffy or Senator Quirke will come to the crossroads and promise people all kinds of things and there will be a number of people there who will say: &ldquo;You are promising all kinds of things you cannot give: you are talking nonsense&rdquo;.  When that happens, they will cease to promise things that those right in the centre of the ordinary political meeting now, unfortunately, believe.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the measuring of efficiency.  Accountancy is one method. I have seen the accounts and the usual methods of accounts.  The usual thing is to say that the accounts are to be published &ldquo;in the manner prescribed by the Minister&rdquo;.  I know Senator Duffy will say: &ldquo;Look at the bad example of private companies, how they give as little information as possible&rdquo;. That is not true, but even if it were true, two wrongs do not make a right.</P>
    <P>The Government should aim at giving the fullest possible information and set their faces against any hiding of the facts.  They should get the best possible accountants to ensure that.  I am not suggesting that accountants would be likely to do anything wrong. What I mean is, that one way of doing accounts can be very illuminating while other methods may not.  Let us, <Col N="1568" /> as I say, have the fullest possible accounts.  I do not mean only financial accounts, but the information that can be made available by a costings accountant, so that one may be in a position to interpret results.  I saw the accounts of Bord na Móna.  There was a lot of figures there.  It was an example of good food and good material but so badly cooked as to be indigestible.  The accounts, I suggest, should have been set out in a clear and more intelligible manner.  No doubt that will be done in time.  Cost accounting is now a separate branch of accountancy. I feel that in the case of all these public utilities there should be on the staff a cost accountant whose work would go on continuously.  I do not think myself that the ordinary auditors are the best people to do the work that I speak of.  If necessary, there should be more than one costs accountant on the staff.  That should be the position in regard to all these public corporations to which the science of costs accountancy can be applied.  In fact there are very few businesses now where it cannot be applied.</P>
    <P>The obligation might also be put on these corporations of having an efficiency audit.  I asked the Minister to accept that principle on the Railways Bill, but he tried to make out that it would not be practicable; that it would mean the keeping of a lot of files. There was no good in arguing the matter across the floor of the House. I may say, however, that I had no such idea as that in mind.  What I had in mind was that there should be a periodical examination by persons of acknowledged ability with an intimate knowledge of the work who would give a general report as to how a particular concern was being run, and so that members of this House would have an opportunity of appraising all the circumstances relating to it in the interests of the public.  Some people seem to believe that profits are the test of efficiency.  As a matter of fact, the dividend that is paid is a mere nothing on the turnover of any successful enterprise.  Efficiency is really what counts.  In many cases profits are only the reserves kept back for repairs and equipment.  Senator Kyle does not <Col N="1569" /> seem to agree with me.  That is probably due to his old bad upbringing. Senator Duffy spoke about directors going out to lunch at one o'clock.  I know that on any board on which I sit we very often sit on until two o'clock. I urge that we should get efficiency in the case of all these public utilities.</P>
    <P>A person asked me not long ago if I believed that a politician would ever be wholeheartedly ruthless on the side of efficiency if it cut across Party interests or political interests.  I said that I did not hold such a depressing view as that.  I believe that the Minister could be ruthless, and I hope he will assure me that he will be ruthless in searching for efficiency in the case of public corporations.  I hope, too, that not for one moment will he allow political interests or the possible reactions of an election to interfere with methods calculated to ensure the highest possible service for the consumer. He should see to it that these public utilities give as good a service as private enterprise.  If he does that, I shall be satisfied.</P>
    <P>Here again we must have an educated democracy.  I claim to be a fairly well-educated democrat.  If I saw the Minister setting his face for efficiency and disregarding all political interests, that would make me a member of Fianna Fáil to-morrow.  If the Minister found that a concern was not being run on the right lines and sacked the lot, that would be the very best advertisement that modern democracy could get.  It is because I fear that the dead hand of political pressure will influence decisions and that concerns will go bad &mdash;we shall never know that they have gone bad until it is too late&mdash;that I ask the Minister to give an assurance against any outlook of that kind.  I ask him to do everything in his power to find out what are the conditions that make for efficiency, and that, having found them, he will apply them ruthlessly, irrespective of political consequences.</P>

      <P>In seconding Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, I would like to say that I agree with the wording of it but would not like to say that I agree by any means with <Col N="1570" /> everything which the Senator has just been saying.  I, at the same time, find myself in substantial sympathy with the wording of Senator Duffy's amendment, with the same caveat, that I would not like to be associated with much of what he has said.  I am strongly opposed to the wording of the principal motion, but yet in the speech which he made, Senator Sweetman made use of many arguments which appealed to me very strongly.  Of the three speakers, I find myself more substantially in agreement with him than with either of the other two. There is some danger of the debate degenerating into a discussion of the abstract virtues of public enterprise versus private enterprise.  I am not going to take up the time of the House in discussing that endless topic, except to say that if anybody is interested in my personal views on it he should read the column and a half which appears in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Times</i> in which I give expression to them. Senator Sweetman suggested that the more of these Government companies that can be sold, and the quicker they can be sold, to private ownership the better.  He suggested in particular, I think, that the Industrial Credit Company should be sold to private interests.  I completely disagree with that suggestion because I think that the Industrial Credit Company has a useful function to perform in providing financial assistance, of Government origin, for private enterprise of the right kind, which is able, and expected to be able, to stand on its own feet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has mentioned that point.  I must have misapprehended what he said.  I thoroughly agree with the further point he made, that, if the Industrial Credit Company has been going out of its way to acquire the shares of companies which do not need additional finance from any such <Col N="1571" /> source, merely to gain control of those privately-owned companies for its own purposes, nefarious or otherwise, then I say that the Industrial Credit Company is not minding the business it was put there by the Oireachtas to perform and ought to be severely reprimanded by the Minister responsible.  I do not see why Senator Duffy should boggle at the term &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; when applied to a State concern such as the Irish Sugar Company.  There are, of course, private monopolies and public monopolies. If a State-owned concern is a monopoly, why not call it a monopoly? It would, certainly, be most undesirable that a State concern, such as the sugar monopoly, should, under any conceivable circumstances, be sold to private ownership.  As a matter of fact, the Banking Commission commented very severely on the fact that there are private financial interests concerned in the capitalisation of the Irish Sugar Company and, I think, recommended that, if it must exist at all, it is emphatically the kind of concern that ought to be organised financially as a public utility, with no privately-owned finance concerned in it, good, bad or indifferent &mdash;that, in fact, its financial organisation should be modified as soon as possible in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain economic activities which, obviously, are of the kind which should be publicly-owned and are suitable for public enterprise.  One outstanding example of those is the provision of electric current.  That is an outstanding and brilliantly successful example of public enterprise to which we, in this community, owe a great deal&mdash;especially during the past ten years.  There are other activities, such as transport, which it is becoming more and more recognised should be public enterprises, though perhaps not so generally admitted as in the case of the electric supply.  We have now got a virtually publicly-owned&mdash;certainly, a publicly-controlled&mdash;system of transport and nobody questions the necessity of that development.  At the same time, most economic activities in this economy are likely to be examples of private enterprise and there is no question of the State attempting to <Col N="1572" /> dominate the whole of our economy&mdash; both what is now private and what is now public.</P>
    <P>Between those economic activities which most people admit should be examples of private enterprise and those few large, economic activities which most people admit are suitable objects of public enterprise, there is a kind of debatable margin&mdash;certain activities in which it seems the State should be able to play a part.  That debatable margin has been cluttered up by a whole series of hybrid and spurious companies in which public and private interests are mixed up in the most extraordinary way.  No adequate thought has been given to the proper organisation of those various companies. Various abuses have arisen in connection with some of them which have given rise to a good deal of local comment and even to a certain amount of public scandal.  It was not part of the intention of Government that this should happen but it is part of the duty of Government to secure that, if the State is to interfere in certain economic activities, its interference will take place in such a way as to safeguard the public interest, as well as further the national interest, generally. There is a whole series of hybrid activities &mdash; for example, the Sea Fisheries Association.  I think that Bord na Móna used to be one but it has now become more definitely a publicly-owned utility.  Roscrea meat factory is one and a great many others were mentioned in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>According to information published in the Banking Commission report, certain of these companies, which have been financed partly by the State, have important, private, shareholding interests connected with them.  So inefficiently and inadequately are the limits between private and public interest defined that it is conceivable that, in certain circumstances, the Sea Fisheries Association, for example, could be wound up and the whole of the available assets become the property of the private, shareholding interest, regardless of the fact that by far the greater part of the finance of that association has been provided by <Col N="1573" /> the State.  In other words, the objection is to the form of a private company being used as a means by which concealed subsidies can be given from public funds to private enterprise in a way which escapes the knowledge of the public and completely escapes Parliamentary control.  That is why I particularly sympathise with the wording of the amendment in the name of Senator Duffy.  The important thing is to secure that in no circumstances should public money be given in such a way as to escape Parliamentary control. At the same time, I sympathise with the point of view of Senator Sir John Keane that there is a problem how to secure the best and most appropriate organisation for each of those hybrid activities&mdash;an organisation of a kind that will ensure confidence and efficiency and a spirit of public service. If anybody is interested in the literature of this matter, he will find quite a lot about it in pages 447-449 of the report of the Banking Commission and, in particular, in the addendum by Professor Duncan following on that section of the report.  I shall merely briefly refer to the points contained in these recommendations.</P>
    <P>There should be for each economic activity in which the State wishes to give a helping hand, while nevertheless retaining the private character of the activity, a special enabling Act, laying down the kind of constitution that is most appropriate for that particular kind of activity and, in particular, defining the limit of public financial responsibility and distinguishing the interests of the public from those of private persons.  Further, if in such relationship there is involved an element of subsidy from public funds, this element of subsidy should be under the most open and clearly defined Parliamentary control and in no circumstances should what are called &ldquo;loans&rdquo; be made to any kind of company that cannot be repaid.  If they cannot be repaid, it means that they are subsidies.  Further, there should be adequate provisions to ensure that their accounts are presented in an intelligible form and, in particular, a distinction made between their capital account and their income account. <Col N="1574" /> Above all things these companies which derive money in any form from the State should not be allowed to form any kind of debt without the specific permission of Parliament, without Parliamentary approval.  If they have this power, and if they use it, they are in fact adding to the total national debt without the knowledge and consent of the Oireachtas.  Finally, the accounts of such companies should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and presented in a form approved by him and published in the form of a Government paper or made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this matter I am critical, but I am critical not only of the present Government but of its predecessor. The previous Government committed very much the same crimes as the present Government in connection with this matter but not on so large a scale.  The original establishment of the Dairy Disposal Company called for very severe comment on the part of the authors of the report of the Banking Commission.  Approval for the expenditure of £500,000 was not subject to review by the other half of the Oireachtas but they tried to put that right later on.</P>
    <P>The company has been going now for 20 years in accordance with an Act which intended it only as a transitional organisation.  It exercises an important part in the total dairy industry. It is especially concerned with the manufacture of condensed milk and milk powder which are the more modern ways of using milk and are likely to be of importance in the future. A student working under my supervision attempted to determine the way that the total rise in the output of milk since the war began was used.  He had no difficulty in getting the statistics on butter and cheese production but when he tried to get the amount of milk turned into milk powder and condensed milk he was up against the flat refusal of the Dairy Disposal Company to supply the necessary information.  I suggest that it is of the utmost importance that we should know what happens to the milk produced here and to what extent less butter is being made and more milk powder is <Col N="1575" /> made.  If the Dairy Disposal Company are going to adopt this ostrich-like attitude, Parliament should take note of it.  Finally it was recommended in the report of the Banking Commission and also in Professor Duncan's addendum that in any case where the public money is transferred to a private company for any purpose of this kind there should be some one Minister designated as responsible to Parliament for the general policy involved in the expenditure of this public money and that in no circumstances should the Minister be able to say that it was a committee set up to run this concern that was responsible.  It is of the utmost importance that the Oireachtas should not lose sight of the spending of public money and it is important that some Minister should be responsible for the general behaviour of any company that has the use of public money.</P>
    <P>Sir John Keane's amendment suggests that the Government should set up an appropriate body to examine and recommend what principles should govern the establishment of public corporations in order to secure the best services possible to the community. The Banking Commission recommended that a debt and investment council should be set up to consider the whole problem of the provision of capital for various public purposes, not from the narrow, Departmental point of view but from the wider, national point of view and which would advise the Government as to how capital could be most properly used and what methods could be employed.  It seems to me that this council would be suitable for what Sir John Keane has in view.  I think you will find the recommendation at paragraph 544 of the report of the Banking Commission.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our suggestion for the constitution of the council is that it should have as chairman the head of the monetary authority for the time being, and that it should have four other members, namely, an official of the Department of Finance, an official of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, <Col N="1576" /> and a nominee of the Minister for Finance who would not, presumably, be a civil servant and who might or might not be a member of the Oireachtas.  It might be convenient to permit each member to have an alternative to represent him during any unavoidable absence.  It is unlikely that the council would require the services of whole-time staff, at least for some time to come, and we think that its secretarial needs should be met by part-time assistance from the staff of the Department of Finance, supplemented if necessary by the staff of the monetary authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think if at any time we proceed to the point of carrying out this recommendation of the Banking Commission we might consider the new council from the point of view of its possible usefulness in this kind of function as well as for the functions for which it was originally proposed.  Having said that, I formally second the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a great pity that the Seanad should occupy its time and waste mine, at a period when the country is passing through exceptional difficulties and facing problems of unprecedented magnitude, discussing what are little more than abstract issues.  Senator Johnston said that the debate had degenerated to abstract issues.  You cannot fall lower than the bottom and the debate started at the bottom.  We were condemned to that fate from the moment Senator Sweetman put his pen to paper to draft the motion and induce his colleagues Senator Duffy and Sir John Keane to draft their amendments.  I do not know of any useful purpose to be served by discussing an abstract issue like this. Let me say at the outset, so that the Government's position will be understood, that when we decided upon the establishment of statutory corporations, of semi-State companies, to conduct commercial enterprises we were concerned only with the best way of getting a particular job well done.  In most cases circumstances arose which made the course adopted by the Government inevitable and in <Col N="1577" /> every case the course adopted was the best of the various alternatives.  Senator Sweetman wants us to decide that commercial enterprises in which the State is involved are an abomination and should be done away with regardless of the consequences.  But in the course of his remarks he modified his proposals and offered to spare public utilities, but he did not define or attempt to define public utilities and, as I followed him, he limited his definition of public utilities to the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  The other concerns were to be disposed of to private enterprise, if private enterprise could be induced to buy them, as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I have said that we were concerned and will, I hope, only be concerned in deciding upon these matters with the method of getting a particular task well done.  If there are commercial activities which, in the special circumstances of this country, can be carried on only on a monopoly basis, is there any particular reason to assume that a privately-owned monopoly is going to be better managed, more efficient, more considerate of public interests, than a publicly-owned monopoly?  If we cannot get a privately-owned monopoly organisation established, are we not to do the job at all?  That is the issue which the Government had to decide when it set up the Sugar Company or a number of the other concerns to which reference was made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say also that I am not convinced that, when industry has to be carried on under monopoly conditions, private ownership makes for efficiency and public ownership the contrary.  I do not think that has been our experience.  It is true that any monopoly undertaking is in danger of becoming, not inefficient, but less interested in new technical developments, the scrapping of old equipment and its replacement by better equipment and the general tuning up of its enterprise to the point of maximum effectiveness.  That is true whether the enterprise is publicly owned or privately owned and there is a problem there which the Government here <Col N="1578" /> and Governments in other countries are considering, as to how we can, in relation to the publicly-owned monopolies for which we have taken responsibility, apply the necessary incentives to secure enterprise and efficiency in all circumstances.  That problem exists whether we are dealing with privately-owned monopolies or publicly-owned monopolies.  It is much easier to handle in relation to publicly-owned monopolies.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make comparisons and put the Electricity Supply Board against the Dublin Gas Company, or the Cork Gas Company against a Limerick municipal undertaking, or the Industrial Credit Company against the Bank of Ireland, or make any other comparisons that might be possible, since we have not and could not have here the information which would enable us to give a considered judgment on the merits of these respective undertakings.  If it is true that there is a danger of publicly-owned companies being staffed by persons who are appointed because of political affiliations and who are not necessarily the most suitable persons for the posts, we have at least the safeguard that these matters can be discussed here under the protection of the privileges of the House.  Names can be mentioned and specific allegations against individuals can be advanced, and the whole thing can be thrashed out here.  I am not going to be told that the privately-owned monopolies in this country never appointed people because of political, racial or religious reasons. We know they did, and we have no assurance that any privately-owned concern will be always interested only in appointing people of the highest technical or professional qualifications to their offices, not caring whether they happen to be relations of the directors or not.  But if shareholders of privately-owned monopolies suspect these things are happening, they have not the same freedom to discuss them, to direct public attention to them or get remedies brought into operation, as members of the Dáil and Seanad have in discussing enterprises for which the Government is responsible.</P>
    <P>A number of concerns has been <Col N="1579" /> mentioned here, and I want to be clear as to what is the point of the criticism that has been advanced.  The Dairy Disposal Company was one of the concerns.  That company was set up 20 years ago to buy out a number of proprietary creameries and dispose of them to co-operative societies.  It was an excellent idea of which most people approved.  If, in the course of its activities, it found that it had creameries on its hands which no co-operative societies could be formed to purchase, if it found that some co-operative societies were running creameries so badly that they had to take back the creameries again, if there were circumstances in which new creameries had to be built, should they have done nothing about it, should they have just come to the Minister and said: &ldquo;Let us call the whole thing off, regardless of the consequences&rdquo;? That, I take it, is the idea which some Senators have.  In fact, the Dairy Disposal Company is trying to find a solution of the difficulties into which it ran, difficulties which were not foreseen by those who were responsible for its establishment.  The company is still there and still has some of those difficulties. There are still creamery undertakings in its possession which it could not sell to co-operative societies which do not exist.  There are other problems of another kind which have resulted largely from the emergency and which may make some such organisation a permanent necessity, but it is no solution for the difficulties of that situation merely to drop the whole business because it happened to be running counter to some theory which Senator Sweetman judged important.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Credit Company was mentioned.  Reference was made here to some court proceedings in which it was revealed that the company had bought the shares of an undertaking which required no financial assistance from it, merely for the purpose of getting its own nominee on the board.  I have no recollection of <Col N="1580" /> any such incident and I do not believe it happened.  I think Senator Sweetman is making a mistake and mixing it up with another company of some similar title that ante-dated it.  The practice of the Industrial Credit Company has never been to put its nominees even on the boards of companies in which it has a controlling interest.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator is making a mistake.  From my experience, even where the company, in my view, should have put nominees on the boards of undertakings in which it has a substantial interest and which I thought were not properly managed, they were reluctant to do so and ordinarily refused to do so.  It has never been its policy to have nominees on the boards of companies.  The State holds a majority of the shares in that company solely because private people did not subscribe for them.  The State only underwrote and subscribed for such of the shares as the public did not apply for.  There are private shareholders and when Senator Sweetman says they should sell all their investments, regardless of whether they are making a loss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They must run their enterprise in a manner which would be fair to the private shareholders, as well as in the interests of the State. Irish Shipping, Limited, was formed during the war.  The Government here never wanted to go into the shipping business, but went in because no one else was going in, at a time when it <Col N="1581" /> was essential that someone should take the initiative and provide a shipping organisation to operate a deepsea shipping service.  It was a most successful enterprise.</P>
      <P>But in the midst of its operations it found itself up against the difficulty that it was being fleeced in the matter of war risk insurance.  Simultaneously the Government, which was trying to induce private importers to bring goods into this country via Lisbon, the only port on the Continent open, found that they were refusing to do so because they could not get the war risk insurance for goods at Lisbon for a period longer than 14 days.  No privately-owned insurance company would take the risk.  So far as the risks upon our ships went, Irish Shipping, Limited, was insuring them at the rate of 25 per cent. for three months' cover.  That was a fairly hefty premium to have to pay.  The various insurance interests in the country were consulted as to the possibility of these war risk and marine insurance risks being carried here. Most of them felt that it would be too gigantic an enterprise for any of the existing Irish concerns to contemplate. Irish Shipping, Limited, went into the business.  It did it so successfully that not merely did it bring down the rate of war risk insurance from 25 per cent. for three months to 6 per cent. per annum and not merely did it cover all the risk involved in bringing goods via Lisbon and in making trade through that country possible, but it made millions of pounds of a profit on the undertaking, and at no time did it sell insurance to the owners of ships or cargoes at a cost higher than those people would have to pay on the open market or if they had insured their risks at Lloyds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the war it was obviously desirable that the marine insurance business which it had built up should be established on a more permanent and regular basis. That involved reinsurance contracts with companies doing similar business in other countries so that the risks would be properly spread.  These contracts were negotiated with some of the most important of Lloyds' underwriters who, however, had a reasonable <Col N="1582" /> and proper objection to entering into any such arrangement with a shipping company.  At that stage it was considered desirable to transfer the marine insurance business of Irish Shipping, Limited, to an insurance organisation.  I am sorry to have to disillusion Senator Sweetman on one matter.  The Industrial Insurance Corporation has never been a purely private enterprise.  The great majority of the shares were owned by the Industrial Credit Company.  Irish Shipping, Limited, did the negotiations which led to the transfer of the shares held in the Industrial Credit Company to Irish Shipping, Limited, in consideration of the transfer of the marine insurance business to the insurance corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The corporation prepared a new issue, and it was the shares of that new issue that were allotted to Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The Secretary to the Department of Industry and Commerce is chairman of that enterprise only as a temporary arrangement.  It was he as an individual who had undertaken all the negotiations relating to the reinsurance contracts.  He was personally familiar with all the obligations which had been incurred, and it was considered desirable that he should be associated with the company until it had built up its own marine insurance department.  He receives no fee for acting as a director of the company. The arrangement under which he is chairman will terminate as soon as the company feels that it no longer needs his assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the suggestions made by Senator Sweetman was that Irish Shipping, Limited, should be disposed of because it is a profitable enterprise. Let us consider all the implications of any such decision.  We started that company during the war for the purpose of operating the number of ships <Col N="1583" /> which would constitute the minimum service on which the life of this community could be kept going.  In the circumstances in the future it is equally essential that we should have in this country a shipping organisation of such magnitude that we can feel assured it will have at its disposal the equipment necessary to maintain the essential trade of this country in circumstances in which ships of other nationalities might not be available. If we are to dispose of that company to private enterprise we can have no assurance that private enterprise will in fact maintain the organisation upon that scale, and it is because it is a necessary safeguard that the organisation should be maintained on that scale that I think the public control of it should continue.</P>
    <P>May I inform Senator Sweetman that Irish Shipping, Limited, not merely has the interests which it recently acquired in the Industrial Insurance Corporation but also the majority of the shareholding in another commercial enterprise to which he did not refer, namely, the Cork Dockyard Company, the reopening of which was due almost entirely to the instrumentality of Irish Shipping, Limited, which was naturally interested in promoting the enterprise and in keeping it going?  One could go through the whole list of these statutory corporations or State-owned companies and give in every case the precise reason why the State decided to establish it and why its maintenance is necessary in the public interest&mdash; either because there was no alternative to State enterprise in the particular field, or because, of the various alternatives, State enterprise offered the least number of objections.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we do not work on the basis of theory.  We work always on the basis of the best method of getting a particular job done.  There is, however, in the operation of these concerns a problem of importance. Senator Duffy's amendment refers to that problem, but it begs the question. We have got always to consider how we can ensure that there will be a sufficient degree of public interest and of public supervision of the activities <Col N="1584" /> of these concerns in such a manner that it will not interfere with their commercial efficiency.  Nobody, I think, is satisfied that we have found a complete answer to that problem, the problem of relating an adequate measure of Government and public supervision with the maintenance of commercial efficiency.  Senator Duffy contemplates, in relation to these commercial organisations, the same right of query and criticism that members of the Oireachtas have in relation to Government Departments.  That would not work.  It is not that there is objection to the giving of detailed information. It is that the right of a Deputy or a Senator to call for that information involves the creation of an organisation of an entirely different character from that which a commercial enterprise would institute.  The whole organisation of Government Departments&mdash;the great institution of the Departmental file, the Departmental registry which in many cases is the most numerously staffed section of a Department&mdash;these are all necessitated by the practice of the Parliamentary question.  It may be, and in fact it is true, that in relation to 99 per cent. of the matters with which a Department deals there never is and never will be a Parliamentary question, but the knowledge that on any day of any month a Deputy can put down a question in relation to any matter whatever and get a reply to that question in two or three days, involves the maintenance of a complete set of records so indexed and available that they can be produced at very short notice.  If we are going to have the same right of query and of investigation into the activities of commercial organisations, they also must maintain similar records and build up an organisation which will enable them to produce a particular reference at short notice whenever a question is raised in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the abolition of the Parliamentary question would mean the abolition of the Civil Service file?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say so but it would go a long way towards doing so. <Col N="1585" /> I speak with some experience.  I was in charge during the war not merely of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;an old established Department, committed to old methods of administration&mdash;but of a new Department in which I tried to abolish the Departmental file and to have the work of the Department done by verbal instruction and Departmental conference and consultation.  I think that we went a long way in that direction but I know that many of the replies to Parliamentary questions which were put to me had to be thought out on the spur of the moment.  Ordinarily, the paper records would be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not much trouble to the Minister to think out the replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that a Government Department should normally operate on that basis.  The recording of what it does is a very important part of its functions.  A commercial organisation will keep only the records necessary for commercial working.  It does not necessarily have to keep on paper not merely all the details which a Government Department records but all the reasons why particular decisions were taken at particular times or in particular circumstances.  There is a problem there.  It will be necessary, eventually, to devise some system which will be reasonably satisfactory, by which members of the Oireachtas will feel that they are getting sufficient information to know whether these organisations are being properly worked in the public interest or whether they are, in effect, the recipients of Government patronage appointments. That should be done in a manner which would not, at the same time, involve undue interference with their proper operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy recognises that a problem exists there, but his amendment merely begs the question.  He does not offer any solution of the question in his amendment, nor did he do so in the course of his speech.  Senator Sir John Keane begs another question. If there is to be consideration of the principles which govern the establishment of public corporations or of the manner in which persons should be <Col N="1586" /> appointed to the boards of those corporations or of the interests of consumers in their operations or their responsibilities to the taxpayers, is it not in the Houses of the Oireachtas that consideration should be given?  If there is to be a transfer of the functions of the Dáil and Seanad, in relation to these matters, to some appropriate body, the issue for decision is: what is the appropriate body? Senator Sir John Keane dodges that question.  He refers to &ldquo;an appropriate body&rdquo;.  I do not think you could get a more appropriate body for the consideration of these matters than the Oireachtas itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Parliament could not deal with technical matters involving the examination of witnesses. A commission could produce a report on these matters for consideration by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has something in mind which he would never contemplate inflicting on a privately-owned concern.  I have no recollection of the Bank of Ireland or any other commercial enterprise having an investigation into its business carried out by outside experts and having the report published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, but, in one case, you are dealing with public money and, in the other case, with shareholders' money.  If shareholders ask for a report, they will, doubtless, get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is merely a question of what happens to public money, I can assure the Senator that the Houses of the Oireachtas will get all the information they require.  He was referring to a method which would serve the public interest, serve the consumers' interest and the taxpayers' interest and which would show the efficiency with which a concern was being run from the technical point of view.  I know that boards of public utility concerns, acting under the auspices of the Department of Industry and Commerce, have taken, from time to time, all the measures which any privately-owned concern might adopt <Col N="1587" /> to supervise and check the efficiency of their organisation.  But they have not done so publicly.  They have not done so because of any public obligation to produce a report to the Oireachtas.  The Electricity Supply Board has, I think, at the moment, a number of foreign technicians supervising different aspects of its organisation for the purpose of advising the board whether changes are practicable or advisable.  The air companies have different foreign experts continuously employed on the overhaul of their organisation.  Other public utilities have adopted the same device from time to time.  They do that in the same way as a privately-owned organisation would do it.  The experts produce a report, which is confidential, for the information of the directors.  The report may even name individual members of the staff and criticise them.  It is that type of report which is of benefit to an executive body and that type of report would never be produced for publication.</P>

The policy of the present Government is to proceed not on the basis of any theory but on the basis of practical need as it arises.  It is because we have to proceed solely on the basis of practical need that we have in the list of such organisations a great variety of constitutions and methods of establishment. In almost every case that I can bring to mind at the moment the decision to set up a statutory organisation or State-owned company was arrived at as a selection of the best of various alternative courses and not <Col N="1588" /> because we had any theoretical adherence to the idea of State-ownership or any objection to the principle of private ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senator Sir John Keane that the managers of the State-owned organisations are as ruthless in stripping their staffs of inefficient or surplus personnel as any privately-owned concern&mdash;even privately-owned concerns which are working solely for profit.  In the case of many of those concerns, there are reasons why the profit motive should be eliminated or, at least, minimised. There are social and economic considerations which must necessarily determine the policy to be followed. In many cases, as Senator Duffy mentioned, social considerations over ride the purely financial motive.  Ordinarily speaking, the Government directs those concerned to carry on their undertakings in such a way as to produce a financial return and the great majority of them have succeeded in doing so. My advice to the Seanad on this motion and the amendments is to avoid coming to any decision on theory.  In this matter, it is far better to proceed on the basis of doing the common sense thing rather than determining a course of action on the basis of some theory arrived at in advance and following that theory even when it conflicts with common sense.</P>

      <P>We shall try.  Senator Sir John Keane talked about capitalism providing the wherewithal for the people down the centuries and he mentioned that they had all the initiative and inventiveness during that period. They had virtually a complete monopoly of everything during that period.  Compulsory education had not been introduced and there was a far lower standard of democratic intelligence than there is to-day.  I say to Senator Sir John Keane: &ldquo;Give democracy an opportunity.&rdquo;  We have compulsory education now but we had no such education for centuries.  The more education we have, the less there will be for the private capitalist to extract.</P>

      <P>You people took advantage of that state of affairs and so you are in the position you are in to-day. I do not want to enlarge on this matter but I should like to ask what would have happened the railways if they had been left in private hands.  What would have followed upon the collapse of the railways, which were down and almost out?  All phases of life in the country would have suffered.  The Government had to come to the aid of the railways in order to safeguard the other interests in the country.  We are hearing <Col N="1590" /> a great deal about private companies and public utilities.  My interpretation of a public utility is a concern in which there is a great risk of loss to the investor.  Where there is an opportunity to exploit the public and to enrich the capitalist, the concern is a private company.  That is the argument I have been listening to here. Turf is, of course, a public utility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not so profitable.  What condition would the country be in if it had been left to private enterprise to exploit the bogs?  If there was no profit to be derived, the community would have been involved in much suffering and hardship if the matter were depending on private enterprise. Therefore, turf must be the subject of a public utility and the Government must manage it.  The Minister has already dealt with Irish shipping.  It took a good deal of pressure from the Oireachtas to force the Government to go into Irish shipping.  Time and again the need for an Irish merchant navy was emphasised.  The Government were not too keen, so far as I remember, in taking up the idea.  It won certain great advantages for this country.  There was no private company to take over the shipping, which was so necessary to bring the needs of our people from countries abroad. There was a war on and that increased the definite risk to capital.  Private interest has always failed in a crisis, in an emergency or war.</P>

      <P>No, but we must safeguard ourselves.  We are always at war against poverty and exploitation and must fortify ourselves against those two enemies.  The best way we can do that is by having the means in the hands of the Government&mdash;in other words, in the hands of the people.</P>

    <P>Senator Sweetman thought it a great crime for a credit corporation to wangle <Col N="1591" /> and put their nominees on the boards of certain companies.  It is done every day by the banks.  I think Senator Sir John Keane will agree with that.  He agrees; he consents.</P>

      <P>Senator Sweetman would have us put all our good investments on the stock exchange and let us all have a chance to buy them in.  I do not think that would be a good thing. We could dispose of, say, the Tourist Board; we could put its shares on the stock exchange.  It is a pity Senator Sweetman did not develop that remark, as in my opinion the Tourist Board is one of the failures of State enterprise. As he was a member of the board at one time, he knows a great deal more about that than I do.</P>

The Minister has certainly debunked a lot of arguments this evening and I hope that, in all cases where the interests of the community are concerned, the Government will expand rather than contract.</P>
      <P>I would like to see them do something regarding the gas companies and regarding the nationalisation, to some extent, of milk.  We should ensure that the milk of the country is used to the best possible purpose in the best interests of the community and not exploited in the interests of capitalists. We have had a few failures in Government control and we have had some adverse criticism, but we have also had a good deal of successes of private monopolies here.  During the emergency the amount of corporation profits tax paid over by those corporations was an indication that they worked for profit and not for service.</P>

      <P>Many provocative statements have been made in the course of the debate with which I would like to deal, but it would take over half an hour to deal adequately with them.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Summerfield takes exception to certain statements. He said they were provocative statements and sat down, without indicating whether they were made by me, by Senator Foran or Senator Duffy or by the Minister, so I cannot deal with them.  I agree entirely with Senator Foran's comments in one respect&mdash; when he says the Minister is a socialist. In that sentence, he has described what was at the back of the Minister's speech.  I agree that the Minister, being a very good politician, did not like to say so.  We had to-night from the Minister one of the examples we have had on many other occasions. No one has greater admiration than I have for the Minister's skill in debate, the manner in which he always puts up a ninepin, that was never put up by anyone else, for the purpose of knocking it down with a wonderful clatter. That is an indication of skill which no one else possesses.  As a result, the broad principles involved are often forgotten in the sea of red herrings he has produced and swept away.  It is only right that I should pay that tribute to his speech this evening.</P>
      <P>He started by telling us he objected to coming here when he was busy, to discuss a problem, and then finished by saying that the Dáil and Seanad were the proper places to discuss this problem.  There was a ninepin put up and knocked down again.  He then discussed the relative merits of the monopoly under public ownership and under private ownership.  I do not think there was anything whatever in the motion, in the amendments or in the speeches of those concerned, which dealt with that subject.  He went on to give specific instances.  He said the Dairy Disposal Company found it had certain problems, but so far as I can find out in any of the State papers, that company never at any time sold to the parties to whom it was set up to sell a single one of the 113 creameries it operates and took over in 1927.  In addition, it built creameries in competition with private creameries and has also a condensed milk factory and even a toffee factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the specific charge I made against the Industrial <Col N="1594" /> Credit Company regarding the court case.  That was since 1936 and, therefore, it must have been the new company. It is peculiar&mdash;to put it no stronger&mdash;that, in the only case where the operations of that company have come to light in court, that tendency and practice has been found, if that was the only instance in which the company carried on that practice.  It would be surprising that there was a 100 per cent. bull, if the one single case in which the practice was operated by the company was the one single case that came into court.  It may be so, but the odds are very much against it and most people will find it very hard to believe.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister put up another ninepin to knock it down himself, in regard to the merits of Irish Shipping, Limited.  There was no discussion on the merits of Irish Shipping, Limited, except in respect of one action, namely, the acquisition of shares in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  The Minister's information, which he gave to the House, was not correct.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland, Limited, when it took over the marine insurance business of Irish Shipping, Limited, increased its capital by the addition of further £1 shares of equal value, ranking <i>pari passu</i> with the original issue.  It was a majority holding of that new issue that was allotted to Irish Shipping, Limited, a holding that had been held by nobody else, not even by the Industrial Credit Company.  It was brought into existence for the sole and specific purpose of having additional capital allotted to Irish Shipping, Limited, to give it control.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the position in regard to the chairman of that company is a temporary one.  I wonder is it as temporary as the disposal by the Dairy Disposal Company of the 113 creameries taken over from the Newmarket and Condensed Milk Companies of Ireland in 1927?  That is a question that we cannot answer to-night. The Minister completely omitted to deal with my most rooted objection to these companies.  The fact is that you have a person, a civil <Col N="1595" /> servant, as the regulator, so to speak, at one moment, while at the next moment that same person is a private individual trading for a commercial concern in rivalry with many other commercial concerns which he will be regulating the next day.  That is not a satisfactory position.  It is not satisfactory that certain people should be the people who are really controlling the public life of the country at the present time, and yet are not responsible, in the way that Ministers are, to the Dáil.  The plain fact of the matter is that the secretary to the Minister's Department&mdash;again, I want to repeat that I am not casting any personal aspersions or strictures on his ability&mdash; is, by reason of his position as secretary to that Department, and because of the fact that he is a member of so many boards and individual companies, perhaps one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, man in the State, aided and flanked by certain other individuals who are not responsible to Parliament, yet who wield a good deal more power even than Ministers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into individual names.  As I said before, anybody who reads the Dáil Report for last October, to which I referred earlier, will find the same names cropping up again and again.  There are three people particularly&mdash;a triumvirate perhaps of people&mdash;who control all these nominal companies by means of being directors. That leaves the nation open to direction and dictation of a type that is particularly obnoxious.  The Minister did not deal with that aspect of the situation at all.  He tried, as I said before, to ride off on another road. Quite candidly, I have every sympathy with him for refusing to deal with it, because there is not an answer.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy seems to think that a necessary definition of public utility is a concern that is not profit-making.  I do not think that is a correct definition at all.  I think the correct definition of a public utility is that of a concern which primarily must consider things <Col N="1596" /> always from the consumer's angle because of certain facilities that have been given to it rather than from the angle of its own interest.</P>
    <P>I said earlier, in regard to Senator Duffy's amendment, that I would be prepared to accept certain of the principles underlying it in regard to public utilities.  I put it in juxtaposition with my own motion.  Still, I think his amendment must be regarded as a sort of inducement for further State intervention.  For that reason, I could not accept it when put in juxtaposition with mine.  With regard to Senator Sir John Keane's amendment, perhaps there may be another opportunity of discussing it.  In regard to my own motion, as I understand these matters, a commercial enterprise is not a public utility.  It seems to me, therefore, that it is desirable that State intervention should not be increased.</P>
    <P>I think the debate this evening has been of use.  We got the admission from the Minister that this whole problem as one picture has not been considered, but rather each individual case as it came along.  I think it was well worth while to consider the issues that underlie this whole question of public control which necessarily drives us along the road to the point where we consider the State to be of more importance than the individuals who comprise it.  I want to say that is a conclusion to which I shall never be prepared to agree.  I think it is a point with which none of us should agree. The ultimate end of such a policy must be Socialism.  You can call it Socialism or any other &ldquo;ism&rdquo;, but that is how it will end.  On the whole, I think the debate has been of very great use.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy's amendment put and negatived.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane's amendment put and negatived.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman's motion put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.20 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
