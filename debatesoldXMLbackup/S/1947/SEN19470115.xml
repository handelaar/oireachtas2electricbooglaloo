    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what might be termed the operative section of the Bill in so far as the existing powers under the Principal Act and the extension of them are concerned.  The objects of the company are covered in the Schedule to the Principal Act but those objects are extended by paragraph (c) of this section.  It is dealt with by way of deletion of paragraph (c) in the Schedule to the Principal Act and the insertion instead of the paragraph that is now before us.  There is in respect of this considerable uneasiness in certain circles.  It has been rumoured&mdash;I do not know with what truth, but I think it is absolutely essential that the truth or falsehood of the rumour should be cleared up beyond question&mdash;that one of the things that Ceimicí Teoranta propose to do is to manufacture potable spirit, that is to say, spirit for drinking purposes.  It is very desirable and essential that the House should know what is intended in that regard.  I go further and say that it is essential that the House should determine that the company that is being set up here should not produce potable spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to distilling in Ireland is far too well known to every member of the House for me to discuss it at any length.  It is divisible into two aspects.  There is first of all <Col N="466" /> the aspect of the export trade.  The distilling industry is one of the ways in which we get very considerable currencies from abroad by export, particularly hard currency.  It is an export business which has been brought up and nurtured and has thrived on the fact that Irish spirit sold abroad is pot-still whiskey of a certain well-known class and perfection.  It is entirely on that basis that the good name of Irish whiskey has become known abroad.  The company that will be set up under this Bill is not going to produce spirit by pot-distillation, and it is by pot-distillation that Irish whiskey has built its name.  It will manufacture spirit by a synthetic process.  It would be absolutely disastrous to the good name of one of our principal industries abroad if there could be any possibility of doubt that any spirit, even though it would not be under the name of Irish whiskey, would be exported which might run the slightest risk of damaging the reputation of Irish pot-still spirits as sold abroad.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of export, there is the home market.  I am a babe in matters of the distillation of spirits, without going into the question of whether I have any knowledge of certain other aspects of the product. So far as I understand, the situation in regard to the home market, pre-war &mdash;it is not fair to take emergency years&mdash;was that all our needs of the home market of potable spirit were adequately met by existing private enterprises, and there was only a very small importation, comparatively, of other drinks and spirits.  The other drinkable spirits that were imported were brought in in a manufactured state and there was no raw patent still spirit imported for the purpose of being manufactured into drink in Ireland.  If there had been, I would be quite prepared to agree that we should make patent still spirit here rather than import it but, in fact, there was not.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that in so far as the home market is concerned, if this company is, in any circumstances, to produce spirits for drinking purposes, it can only do so at the risk of displacing the product of the existing <Col N="467" /> industry in the home market.  The existing industry was quite well able, prior to the emergency, to cope with the demand here.  The existing industry is not able at the present moment to cope with the demand, not because of any defect in itself but because Government controls have not allowed it to produce as much as it would wish to produce.  I am not attacking Government control for one moment. It is perfectly obvious, in the circumstances that exist at present, that barley must be diverted to purposes other than distillation but I do suggest that, if it were not for that control, the existing industry would be well able to cope with the home demands. If any other spirit is introduced to meet that home demand, it can only achieve one of two things.  It can only take a certain portion of the market from the existing industry, or in the alternative, mean that it will increase our spirit-drinking capacity as a people.  Quite frankly, I think that capacity is high enough already.  I do not think for a moment the Minister intends to do that.</P>
    <P>Seeing that there is this feeling of uneasiness in the country at the present time because of the rumour that it is intended by this company to engage in this trade, I think it would be very undesirable, either for the home or export market, that these rumours should go uncontradicted.  As it is so desirable I think it would be wise to put, as an express instruction in the terms of the Bill, a proviso that this company should not sell any spirit for drinking purposes.  I go a little further and say that it should use its best endeavours to see that any spirit which it does sell shall not be used by somebody else for drinking purposes.  That is quite a common method of legal expression&mdash;that a company shall not do something and that it will do its best endeavours to see that somebody else will not do it, otherwise I could come along, buy the spirit from the company and sell it for drinking purposes afterwards.</P>
    <P>I think this matter affects very vitally a major industry, and I think that major industry is entitled to be <Col N="468" /> assured, as I am reasonably confident that it will be assured by the Minister, that there is no intention of doing what these rumours suggest.  As these statements have been made in several quarters in the last week in the city, I think it essential that there should be something specific on this point in the Bill.  If it had been clear to me earlier that the rumour was as current as I since have heard it is, I would have put down specific amendments for the Committee Stage.  Having regard to all the circumstances I would ask the Minister to clear the matter up, not only to clear it up by his own assurance here but to clear it up for future Ministers and for the future working and direction of this company by inserting in the Bill a specific proviso preventing the company from carrying on in the way that I do not think the Minister intended it to carry on, in a way that might give rise to a great danger in the future and that would be absolutely disastrous to the existing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know on what my friend's fears are founded.  Is it on the reading of the sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;the manufacture, refining and sale of industrial alcohol and products and derivatives thereof&rdquo;?  Surely industrial alcohol could not be called potable alcohol?  I take it to mean alcohol for industrial purposes.  As regards the term &ldquo;derivatives thereof&rdquo;, supposing in the manufacture of industrial alcohol a product was obtained in the nature of pot-still whiskey&mdash;I do not say that it could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If it could not, there is no ground for the fear my friend has expressed.  Then it could not be a chemical product.  If it is a chemical product, a licence must be granted by the Minister for its production.  Before he grants that licence he must publish a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and other papers of his intention to do so.  If such a notice were published, I presume there would be an outcry from the whiskey trade to the effect that there should be some method by which they would get the benefit of the product. On the other hand, if such a product <Col N="469" /> can be derived from industrial alcohol is it suggested that it should be thrown away?  If so, that would be a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any widespread uneasiness of the kind suggested by Senator Sweetman; in fact I am quite sure there is not.  I want to make it quite clear, however, that under the Industrial Alcohol Act of 1938, the company was fully empowered to make potable spirit and the new company which will emerge on the passage of this Bill, Ceimící Teoranta, will have the same power as the Industrial Alcohol Company in that regard.  Industrial alcohol, undenatured, is used in the manufacture of certain liqueurs and, I think, also in the manufacture of gin.  If any firms in this country manufacturing liqueurs or gin want to purchase industrial alcohol, there is no reason on earth why they should not purchase it from Ceimící Teoranta instead of from some industrial alcohol distiller outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the manufacture of potable spirit is concerned, I want to make it quite clear that the company will be empowered to manufacture potable spirit and will do so if there is a market for the spirit in the future.  There is no intention that the company should go into the distillation of whiskey.  If there is uneasiness amongst whiskey distillers, as suggested by Senator Sweetman, I do not know on what it is based.  It is not merely correct that, before the company can go into any new form of manufacture, notice of intention to license it to do so must be published in the Press: it is also a fact that the Minister cannot give a licence to the company to undertake any new form of manufacture unless he is of opinion that the commodity is not being manufactured in the State by private enterprise. We know that whiskey is being manufactured here by private enterprise and so the Minister could not give a licence to the company to engage in the distillation of whiskey, <Col N="470" /> even if there were any intention of doing so.</P>
      <P>On the point, however, of the manufacture of potable spirit, the company has that power at present; and it will have that power in the future.  It will undoubtedly be quite willing to sell potable industrial alcohol to other manufacturers who may require it as an industrial raw material for the production of liqueurs, gin or any other alcoholic beverage.  There is no advantage being given to other manufacturers by reason of that situation. There is no inducement to people to engage in the production of any alcoholic beverage to a greater extent. The only difference that may develop is that they will obtain their supplies of industrial alcohol from this company rather than from some other company outside the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said gin.  The Minister is aware that gin has been produced in Cork&mdash;by the Cork Distillers, for example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For home-produced gin.  It is either going to take the existing market from them or else <Col N="471" /> there is going to be an anxiety to increase our spirit-drinking capacity as a people, and I think the Minister will agree with me that that is undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator misunderstands. There is no intention that this company should produce alcohol except industrial alcohol and while industrial alcohol may be produced as a raw material for manufacturers of gin or other liqueurs, the company itself will not manufacture gin or other liqueurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be nothing to prevent them from continuing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be nothing to prevent them from continuing to do so, but the Minister has already an existing private enterprise and, in spite of the lip service which is paid to private enterprise, he is now going to promote another such company with State resources, to go into competition with existing private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I see now where the Senator has misunderstood.  So far as the company set up under the 1938 Act is concerned, it was given the right to make industrial alcohol not on a monopoly basis but certainly in competition with any firm which wanted to go into the business of manufacturing the commodity So far as this new company is concerned, it can continue to manufacture industrial alcohol or the products and derivatives of industrial alcohol, even in competition with private enterprise.  Anyone who goes into that business knows that this company exists and has distilleries working and will have to consider his prospects in the light of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bar upon the expansion of the scope of manufacture by this company, to prevent the granting of licences for that purpose, applies only to chemicals which are being manufactured in the <Col N="472" /> State by private enterprise.  The manufacture of industrial alcohol, its products and derivatives, is on a different basis from the manufacture of other chemicals.  So far as the first is concerned the company has power to manufacture them now and has power to continue to manufacture them, no matter who else comes into the business.  So far as the other products are concerned, the company cannot get a licence to manufacture unless private enterprise is not doing so and is not likely to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us when the old company, set up under the previous Act, put in plant for the purpose of making potable spirit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that when introducing the Bill.  The company did not do so before the war at all. During the war, they put up a makeshift plant to produce certain quantities of pure alcohol mainly for the use of hospitals and laboratories.  They are now installing a plant of more modern and more efficient design, which will enable them to continue producing undenatured spirit for sale as an industrial raw material, for use in hospitals and laboratories or to any person who wishes to have that type of spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Section 4, I wonder if the objects of the company are set out in the right order. I think a certain amount of confusion and delay in debate can arise from the order they are in at present.  Section 4, sub-paragraph (i), says that the first principal object of the company shall be &ldquo;the manufacture, refining and sale of industrial alcohol and products and derivatives thereof&rdquo;.  The second principal object, in sub-paragraph (ii), is &ldquo;the making, aiding or subsidising of experiments&rdquo;.  Then, to my mind, the most important part of the whole business comes in at the tail, in sub-paragraph (iii), &ldquo;the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be by far the most important proposal in the Bill. In that provision, I see really the control of essential industrial chemicals, <Col N="473" /> the most important step towards socialisation of the State that has come to my notice since I was elected to the Seanad.  It is very much as if the Labour Government in England were proposing to take over Imperial Chemicals.  That is a very big undertaking and should go forward as the first object of the company.  It should read that &ldquo;the principal object of the company shall include the manufacture and sale of any substance&rdquo;, and so on, &ldquo;including industrial alcohol&rdquo;.  The present method of putting industrial alcohol first among the objects has had the effect of delaying the debate, by a kind of post-mortem, an alcoholic post-mortem, on the old company.  It has diverted attention from the very wide powers set out in sub-paragraph (iii).  I suggest it would be more logical if the principal object were set out specifically, as it is in (iii), &ldquo;the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process, including industrial alcohol&rdquo;, and the second object could be research for the carrying out of those purposes.</P>
    <P>In connection with what has been said just previously, I assumed from my reading of the Bill that the industrial alcohol produced could be used for any of these potable purposes.  I think the only safeguard the brewers have is by having an exact definition of whiskey as a potable fluid, producing a certificate that it is made in a certain way, as in the case of the basic grape used for manufacturing those extraordinary wines we used to find in confectioners and in the many flavourings and cordials.  There are a dozen ways in which potable alcohol is used in medicines prepared by chemists and in sterilising.  If we concentrate too much on the alcohol question, it will tend to divert attention from the more important part, the setting up of this chemical company, which can control almost everything that concerns us from the moment we are born until we are embalmed.  If not properly used, it will be a tremendous factor in the development of the company that might threaten some of the small concerns. Perhaps some of my Labour colleagues will develop that point. <Col N="474" /> That is a thing which I think was rather overlooked in the alcoholic haze which hung over the Bill in its progress through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right in one important respect&mdash;as to the main purpose of this Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to empower this company to manufacture products other than industrial alcohol.  We have an organisation for the manufacture of industrial alcohol and it was decided to have an organisation which could spend money on experimentation in respect of, or undertake the manufacture of, other chemicals.  It was purely a fortuitous decision that the Industrial Alcohol Company should be used for that purpose instead of creating a fresh and separate organisation.  I want to make quite clear that there is nothing in this Bill which proposes to give to Ceimící Teoranta a monopoly in any form.  The analogy with nationalisation in Great Britain does not, therefore, apply.  The intention is that the company shall not be licensed to undertake chemical manufacture unless that particular form of manufacture is not being done, and is not likely to be done, here by private enterprise.  If after the issue of a licence to the company, a private company wishes to go into the business, it is perfectly free to do so.</P>
      <P>There is no question of undue advantage to Ceimicí Teoranta as compared with any privately-owned undertaking working on similar lines.  It is quite correct to say that the main purpose of this Bill is to give to the existing alcohol company, under a new name, the powers set out in sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of lettered paragraph (c) of this section but it would be incorrect to assume that that is equivalent to the nationalisation of chemical industries elsewhere.  It is not intended to be nationalisation and it is not intended that the company should carry on any enterprise on a monopoly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of coming back to the alcoholic discussion, I think that we have brought out into the open exactly what is in the mind of the Minister.  It is perfectly clear from what he has said that the apprehension which is felt has justification <Col N="475" />&mdash;that, in fact, this company will get into competition with private enterprise. That is what it amounts to.  It will get into competition with private enterprise and it does not matter much whether that enterprise existed in 1938 or was started since.  The House is fully aware, without my boring it with my views, of the type of governmental company which is to be incorporated here.  The House is aware of the views on that subject on these benches and it is also aware of the Minister's view. The only justification of such governmental companies, put forward in debates here, was that such companies were not going to get into competition with private enterprise, that they were only going to do a job which private enterprise was not doing and was not able to do.  The best example of that was Bord na Móna.  There, the situation was quite clear.  There would be no wholesale production of turf except under governmental auspices. That was accepted here.  In this case, there has been quite sufficient enterprise to meet the existing demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Demand for what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The demand for potable spirits pre-war was met to an overwhelming degree by private enterprise. The Minister was not aware of the view I was going to take and, therefore, had not the available figures as to the spirit consumption here pre-war and how much of that was met by native industry, as distinguished from importation.  It must be quite clear to everybody that there are only two possibilities.  Since the existing demand was already met, that demand will be met in a different way in future; that will take away from the existing production or consumption will have to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having stated his view quite clearly. As we have had the Minister's view stated so explicitly&mdash;not the view which I had hoped he would express&mdash; I should seek your permission, A Chathaoirligh, on Report Stage, to table an amendment which would mean that we would have this discussion on a net point.  My proposal would be to <Col N="476" /> add to Section 4 a proviso: &ldquo;that the company shall not sell, and will use its best endeavours to prevent the sale of, any potable spirit distilled by it.&rdquo;  I submit that, in view of the declaration of policy by the Minister which it was not possible to anticipate, that rather wide amendment would be in order on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable difficulty in following the Senator's reasoning.  If he proposes to raise this matter on Report Stage, he should clarify his own mind, so that he may clarify ours.  I think that he is under some misapprehension and, if I could ascertain where the misapprehension lies, it might be of help to the House. I understand that he objects to people drinking gin because there are other people producing whiskey.</P>

      <P>If people want to buy gin manufactured by the Dutch, the Swiss or the Portuguese, there is no question of putting any pressure on them to drink Irish whiskey instead. If manufacturers do not want to buy the product of Ceimící Teoranta, they can buy from somebody else.  There will be no question of a duty or tariff or preference which would require a native manufacturer to buy the product of this company.  So far as the manufacture of industrial alcohol as an industrial raw material is concerned, a person requiring such alcohol for the manufacture of gin, liqueurs, perfumes or any other industrial product can buy from this company or from outside the country as he prefers.</P>

      <P>Some of these commodities are not being manufactured in the State.  For instance, ordinary table salt is refined in Dublin and packed in Dublin but is not made in Dublin and it can be a chemical process.  Iodised table salt for people suffering from goitre is produced by a chemical process, so, as I read this, the Minister could issue a licence to enable this company to manufacture these commodities and, for that reason, I welcome the defining of the principal objects of the company as they have been defined, because, as I say, there is all the raw material for tanning and for what we hope will be the development of plastics in the country.  All these are chemical processes and without this power which the Minister seeks now it would be more difficult for manufacturers to establish business in these lines, so that, far from limiting the power, I rather think the House should welcome proposals for development even on the basis of State enterprise. I have none of these predilections for private enterprise that some of my colleagues here have.  I do not know that it has shown the great desire to furnish the needs of the community at a reasonable price which some of my colleagues think it has, <Col N="478" /> and, from that point of view, if the State is prepared to set up a company for the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process which will be for the benefit of the nation, the Seanad should welcome it.</P>

      <P>Increased responsibility will undoubtedly be thrown on the Minister in the administration of this Act and in deciding very technical points as to what is an established industry in relation to some development of a product which that industry is already making.  I have in mind plastics, an industry which is expanding and changing every day.  We might reach a stage at which the company would say: &ldquo;This new development in plastics is not being made by an existing private organisation&rdquo; and the Minister would be in a very difficult position in coming to a just decision on points of that kind.  In view of all that, will he consider reviving the advisory body he took powers to create under the Principal Act?  Has that body ever come into existence at all?  If the Minister had in mind at that time that it might become useful, surely it should be of increasing utility now, and would he now say that he intends to constitute, or to reconstitute, that body and to put on it persons who are in a position to advise him on the difficult and rather technical points with which he will be faced in the future?</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that I ought to make my mind clear.  The trouble is that my mind is clear, but, with great respect, the Minister's mind is not.  The Minister made considerable reference to Section 7.  Possibly Senator Foran has read it and may be in a position to comment on the interpretation of it, but we will hear that in a minute.  The Minister refers to his powers under Section 7. If we look at Section 5 in Part III, we find that the expression &ldquo;manufacturing (chemical product) licence&rdquo;, means a licence granted under Section 7.  Does the Minister suggest that those words cover not only the third paragraph of clause (c) in Section 4 but also the first two?</P>

      <P>The point raised by <Col N="480" /> Senator Sweetman is one on which the House has very little information and I am trying to get clear in my mind what exactly are the powers of the Minister under this section and what are Senator Sweetman's fears.  I should like to know whether I am correct or not in my interpretation.  It seems to me that the position at present is that certain alcoholic beverages are being manufactured here, the basis of these finished products apparently being a raw material which the Industrial Alcohol Company can produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Alcoholic beverages being produced here, such as whiskey, stout, and beer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of gin. The company can produce the basis of it and apparently somebody else can produce it because it is being produced at present.  Whether we are able to produce all the raw material necessary for the production of the quantity of gin or such like beverages that we require or not is something on which I am not clear; but if at the moment we are able to produce the raw alcohol which is the basis of this product, it does seem that there is point in what Senator Sweetman is pressing on the Minister, because it does seem unfair that a new State company, financed by all the taxpayers, is to be put into a position to produce a raw material which is already being produced by somebody else in the country.  If the position is that the Cork Distilling Company&mdash;and I know nothing about them&mdash;are, for their own purposes, producing this alcohol in sufficient quantities&mdash;if they are producing for somebody else or if anybody is producing some for himself and some for somebody else&mdash;and are to come into competition with this new State enterprise, there is, in my opinion, point in Senator Sweetman's case.  If that is not the position, then we are confronted with something different from that.  I take the view&mdash;and I am not very narrow or intolerant about the efforts of the State&mdash;that nobody else will make the effort.  At the same time I am not anything like as enthusiastic as Senator Kyle might perhaps be.  We will have to wait until we see what the coal miners are going to do, and <Col N="481" /> whether they will give us more coal than our own people have been able to give us in the matter of turf.  All these things are governed by circumstances over which men have no control. I think myself that if we have small industries producing the raw materials necessary for themselves, as well as for some others engaged in the same industry, that it is not justifiable for the State to come in and wipe them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Senator's argument.  If, before the war, anybody had engaged in the manufacture of gin or liqueurs or perfumes, or certain other industrial products, they would have required industrial alcohol and would have imported it.  There were, in fact, no such manufactures carried on on any large scale and, consequently, it is a purely hypothetical situation that we are dealing with.  The Industrial Alcohol Company was started in 1938.  Since the outbreak of the war, some firms here have engaged in the production of gin which requires industrial alcohol.  Its manufacture was begun here by firms who were fully aware of the existence of the Industrial Alcohol Company. They would, presumably, have purchased the undenatured alcohol made by that company if the company was in a position to sell it.  The company was not in a position to sell it.  I do not know if the suggestion is that the Cork company should have a monopoly in gin production.  What is certain is that no injury is being done to that company or to anybody else.  The company will require the undenatured spirit for the manufacture of gin and it can either buy it from this company or import it.  If people engage in the production of liqueurs they also will be in the position that will require industrial alcohol.  They also can produce it themselves, subject to the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners, or they can buy it from this company or import it.  Anybody else engaged in any other form of manufacture for which industrial alcohol is required will be in the same position.  No injury is being done to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only possibility of injury arising <Col N="482" /> would be if this company itself were to engage in the business of manufacturing consumers' goods which other firms may produce.  It is not intended that the company should do that.  The company will produce industrial alcohol and certain derivatives of industrial alcohol and sell it for industrial purposes to people who are going to use that industrial raw material to producers of other goods, whether those people are in this country or outside of it.  The users of industrial alcohol will not be confined to this company for their supplies from it.  Neither will this company be confined to this country in seeking customers.  I hope it will be able to produce a very much better and cheaper alcohol than other firms can do, and that it will be the ordinary practice for other firms to buy their supplies from this company rather than make it themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) is very wide.  I want to suggest that perhaps the two points of view that have been expressed in regard to the interpretation of it might be reconciled. The Minister says that if something is being already manufactured this company will not, and cannot, undertake the manufacture of a similar substance, but it is characteristic of the present day, in view of the rapid advances that we are witnessing, that new substances may be required.  The Minister may notice that one or more of these are not being made here and he may authorise the company to make them.  My suggestion is that the Minister might see his way to give an undertaking&mdash;the undertaking to be included in the Bill&mdash;that before the company undertakes the manufacture of a particular substance that some form of reasonable notice will be given, because it might conceivably happen that a group of people will be contemplating its manufacture.  Their plans for its manufacture might not have matured, but certainly the Minister could precipitate matters by authorising this company to go ahead with its manufacture.  If that happened it would mean that private enterprise was not getting a reasonable chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> Naturally, there is a difference between Senator Kyle and Senator Sweetman on the matter of different ideologies.  One naturally favours State enterprise in its fullest degree. The other favours private enterprise, and, of course, the Minister himself, on a recent occasion, seemed to suggest that private enterprise was the sounder policy of the two.  Therefore I suggest that the two points of view might be reconciled in the way that I have mentioned, namely, that the Minister would give an undertaking that the company, before it entered on the manufacture of a new substance, would give reasonable public notice to all concerned.  Of course, if the people contemplating its manufacture did not go ahead with their plans, then the Minister would be at liberty to allow this company to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House further on this.  The matter can be cleared up on the amendment which I intend to submit for the Report Stage.  The Minister, on an earlier Stage suggested, that before a company could manufacture potable spirit it would have to get a licence, and that it could not do that if, under the licence, it was competing with private enterprise.  I take it the Minister agrees that, in fact, would not be a chemical process at all, and that the licence only refers to chemical processes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get the issue between myself and the Minister knit.  If the Minister's view be that the company is only empowered to undertake chemical processes, then it is easy to see where he and I differ. In my view the company under paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) is entitled to undertake chemical processes.  That entitlement is exclusive of the first two paragraphs in the sub-section.  The Minister will have ample opportunity between now and the Report Stage of consulting his legal advisers as to whether his determination of the procedure is correct, or whether the doubt <Col N="484" /> that I throw on it has any justification or not.</P>
      <P>So far as the other difficulty that was raised is concerned, that is a matter that can be dealt with more fully on the Report Stage.  I want to put this danger before the Minister.  If this company is going to produce potable spirit and is going to sell it to anybody that wants to buy it, there is the gravest danger that potable spirit will be manufactured and sold abroad as Irish whiskey.</P>

I feel that, in a progressive community, if any people like to start a distillery in order to make whiskey by the pot-still method, there should be no objection.  The pot-still method is well known.  It would be wrong to restrict any form of enterprise of that character.  If anyone wants to make <Col N="485" /> whiskey, it would be wrong for the Government or anybody else to prevent him.</P>
      <P>I wish to make some brief remarks with reference to what Senator Foran said.  It might, perhaps, be more dignified to let his remarks pass in scornful silence, but I strongly resent any Senator attributing motives of self-interest in this matter.  I never mentioned the Cement Company, but the Senator dragged it in presumably because I may be a director or a shareholder. I suggest it is against Parliamentary good taste to make insinuations which imply that people are not actuated by motives of public interest in these matters, but are influenced by some special interest they may have in certain enterprises.</P>

    <P>the Minister then may grant to the company a licence authorising the company to manufacture such chemical product.  I think paragraph (i) is very wide.  &ldquo;Is not being manufactured in the State by means of private enterprise&rdquo;&mdash;does that mean that if it is manufactured at all by a private person, even to a very small extent, it will prevent the Minister granting a licence?  I suggest the Minister should leave out paragraph (i).  He is tying himself down very much by that paragraph. <Col N="486" /> If anyone is manufacturing a particular chemical product, if he has only one room in his house and one employee, then the Minister cannot grant a licence.

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (4) the following words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall under the terms of this sub-section issue a licence for the import free of duty of any chemical product which is used as an agricultural raw material in all cases where the corresponding product of domestic manufacture is available only at a higher price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is based on the fact that all our industrial development is directly or indirectly based on agricultural productive and export capacity. I hope to illustrate that point in various ways by way of providing a background leading up to the putting of this amendment.  In doing so, I may refer briefly to some of the things that were said by the Minister and myself in the course of the Second Reading debate.  I think the Minister said that there were some people who had learned nothing and, presumably, forgotten nothing in the last 25 years.  I do not know whether he included me in that category or not.  I assure the Minister that I have learned a good deal in the course of the last 25 years. I readily admit that I learned quite a lot even from the Minister, not only from his words, but from his actions. It is quite possible that, to some extent, I have moved somewhat nearer his position in matters economic, and I should like to be assured that he has moved a little bit nearer to mine.  On that point, I think the evidence is not by any means conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I illustrate my contention that our industrial development can only proceed on a sure and sound basis if it is based on agricultural productive and export capacity by some reference both to the past and to the present? I agree with the Minister that our agriculture of the 'thirties suffered very serious blows, in the first instance, from the effects of the world economic depression and, in the second place, from the effects of the economic war. I myself was terribly worried at the time about the possible effects of that disaster on our whole economy.  I think <Col N="489" /> it was certainly regrettable from every point of view that the Minister had to initiate his industrial development at a time when our agriculture was suffering severe depression and I am sure he would agree that it would have been better in every respect if agriculture had been flourishing in 1932, when it was depressed, at the time when he introduced his new industrial policy.</P>
    <P>If I might speak in a somewhat picturesque way, I thought that 15 years ago, when the cold waters of the economic war closed over Kathleen Ni Houlihan, that she had found a watery grave and that if there had been a coroner's inquest it would probably have returned a verdict of economic asphyxia due to prolonged immersion in the economic war.  Things turned out to be not so bad as I had feared. I readily admit that the energetic manner in which the Minister threw himself heart and soul into a policy of vigorous industrial development did something to alleviate the misfortunes which otherwise our national economy as a whole must have suffered. I have nothing but admiration for the dynamic energy he displayed in that capacity.  But it was an awful pity that it was necessary to throw Kathleen Ni Houlihan into the water in order that the Minister should effect an heroic rescue.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is what I might call a P.G. Wodehouse fan or not.  At all events, they share a common interest in the royal and ancient game of golf, or should I say the republican and ancient game of golf.  But there is a Wodehouse story in which the hero desired to make contact with a rather attractive girl.  The difficulty was that her father had no use for this fellow.  It occurred to the hero that it would be a good idea if he could do something heroic which would win the good graces of the girl's father. The girl's father was in the habit of sea fishing every day in a boat propelled by a somewhat alcoholic boatman. Our hero proceeded to bribe the boatman to upset the boat while he himself stood by and was able to effect <Col N="490" /> a most heroic rescue of the old man after he had been dipped in the sea. That worked out all right for the time being, but only for the time being, because the boatman in his cups &ldquo;blew the gaff&rdquo; and the story came round to the old man who was very indignant and the hero was thoroughly discredited.  The Minister has gone several degrees better than that Wodehouse hero, because he and his Party have been living successfully on the prestige of that rescue of Kathleen Ni Houlihan for the last 15 years and, so far as I can see, are likely to continue doing so for another 10 or 15 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that a reference to the economic war is like a red rag to a bull to some people.  I do not enjoy raking over the embers of dead controversies, but there are some things that ought to be said, even if certain people are annoyed by having to listen to them.  Even the economic war illustrated the dependence of industrial development on our agricultural productive and export capacity. I remember having some conversation with one of the more distinguished foreign members of our Banking Commission and he stated that the one thing that saved Ireland during the economic war was the fact that Ireland alone among European countries was a country in which the farmers kept the profits that they made during the first world war.  These profits took the form of a large accumulation of sterling balances, and the industrial development which proceeded during the 'thirties was based financially on withdrawing a lot of the sterling balances, which could not have been withdrawn if they had not been there, and they would not have been there but for the former productive and export capacity of our agriculture.  To that extent, it is true to say that industrial development must fundamentally depend on agricultural productive and export capacity; otherwise our fate would <Col N="491" /> have been similar to that of other less financially sound countries, like New Zealand and Australia, who differed from us inasmuch as they owed a lot of sterling and owned very little.  They had to let go their monetary standard and to reduce the value of their national monetary unit because of the financial difficulty in which they found themselves during the 'thirties, while we carried on without any monetary shocks or disturbances precisely because of the strong monetary and currency position which we enjoyed.  That was due ultimately to the strength of our agricultural export capacity.</P>
      <P>I should not like the House or the Minister to think that I am utterly opposed to any form of industrial development.  On the contrary, I think many of the new industries which have been successfully established during the present régime were well established and are likely to become a prominent and desirable part of our national economy, but I should like to put it to the Minister and to the House that the right point of view in all these matters is not either industry or agriculture but the welfare of the national economy as a whole, and that our principal aim should be to increase the national income in every legitimate way, whether that takes the form of technically agricultural or technically industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of all the forms of industrial development, the ones that most command my sympathy are those which have the effect of complementing and completing our existing agricultural structure.  The manufacture of bacon is an industrial process but it is also a processing of an agricultural product.  Even the textile industry, in so far as it is based on native wool or native flax, is a processing of available agricultural products. All that tends to strengthen the national economy as a whole and to create a close relationship between agriculture and industry.  That kind of industrial development commands my utmost sympathy.  Even the cement industry might be approved of from that point of view because it is based largely on native raw materials and it has got a constructive relationship to our main agricultural structure because <Col N="492" /> cement is so useful in many ways to any progressive farmer.  It has been a matter of great satisfaction that cement was available all through the recent war period when so many other things were almost unobtainable.  It was a curious phenomenon, in fact, that when coal could be obtained for no other purpose, coal was nevertheless available for the cement works and it was not without the knowledge of local people that a high proportion of the cement produced during the last six years was exported to Northern Ireland, thereby making a benevolently neutral contribution to Britain's war effort.  However, one suspected that there was some relationship of cause and effect between the fact that the cement industry could import coal and the fact that the cement industry exported cement during those years.</P>
    <P>Another industry which is based on native raw materials is, of course, electric current and I think we ought to realise that the Minister's industrial programme has been as successful as it has been largely because there was this very well thought out and comprehensive system of electric current available throughout the whole country.  To give credit where credit is due, I am sure the Minister will admit that in that respect his predecessors in office laid the foundation which his Party in office were very willing to build on and, to that extent, our industrial development is on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House too long on this part but I should like to say that there are other industries which are not quite so well founded. They belong to the category of what are vulgarly known as &ldquo;spit and polish&rdquo; industries and are objectionable to me in so far as they tend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it.  They tend either to add to the cost of living or to the cost of production of other industries.  In a sense, even this kind of industry is based on agricultural export capacity because they often depend on imported raw materials and unless we can export <Col N="493" /> agricultural produce we cannot afford in the long run to import these necessary industrial raw materials.  In so far as any such industry has the effect of increasing agricultural costs, it diminishes agricultural productive capacity and, therefore, agricultural export capacity and, therefore, since they depend so much on being able to import raw materials that only agricultural exports can buy, such industries have the effect of sawing off the branch of the tree on which they themselves are sitting.</P>
      <P>This particular amendment is related to the possibility that there might be under this Bill something in the nature of a sulphate of ammonia factory established in Ireland.  I should like to see something of the kind established and successfully working, but I would not like to see sulphate of ammonia being produced and sold to Irish farmers at a price substantially higher than that at which sulphate of ammonia could be obtained by import, because that would have the direct effect of increasing the cost of production in our major industry.  Consequently, this amendment is drawn up in such a way that if any such factory&mdash;and I merely take sulphate of ammonia as an example&mdash; can only produce and sell its product, an agricultural raw material, at a price higher than the imported product, the Minister should necessarily issue a licence for the import free of duty of the corresponding product from abroad. In other words, do what you like within limits about industrial development but do not encourage any form of industrial development that would make any serious addition to the cost of agricultural production.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not far out of order yet.  I come to the net point covered by Senator Johnston's amendment to which, if I may say so, Senator Hawkins made no allusion whatever and who, accordingly, was completely out of order.  I support the general principles embodied in Senator Johnston's amendment, for this reason: in the first place, I am sure somebody else will get up and say: Why would not the farmers be enthusiastic about the creation of a chemical industry here which would supply them with raw materials of agricultural production? I say: Why would not they? As far as I am concerned, I do not <Col N="495" /> take the point of view that such an industry should not be created here. In fact, I believe it should be.  I am quite definite in saying that we must make the best effort we can to provide ourselves with the necessary raw materials for our existence.  In so far as the Minister is doing that by this Bill, he is getting the powers, but this point has to be considered and this is the point that Senator Johnston was attempting to make.  Farmers here dispose of their products in various ways. The people here consume many of the products and they sell the balance. We will go on doing that in future, I presume.  Over the price the farmer gets for the commodities consumed at home we have some control, but when it comes to the export of agricultural goods, unless our Government can make satisfactory bargains with the people to whom we have to sell, apparently, the ordinary law of supply and demand, about which some people are very enthusiastic but about which I am not too enthusiastic, is the deciding factor in the price the farmer gets in the outside market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A chemical industry can supply a commodity which will have the effect of increasing the farmer's productivity but the Irish farmer is not the only farmer in the world availing of supplies of chemical industries.  If we have to get into the outside market with beef, butter, eggs or anything else that, to a certain extent, are the results of the application of chemical fertilisers to our land, we have to remember that the costs of production are a determining factor in the price at which we can sell and if the chemical fertilisers of the Dane, the Canadian, the New Zealander or the Australian are sold at a lower price than those which the Irish farmer can buy, the Irish farmer is going to be handicapped in the sale of his butter, bacon, beef or whatever the product may be in the sale of which he comes into competition with the other fellow. Senator Johnston wants to ensure that where any of these chemical fertilisers are available outside at a price lower than the price of chemical fertilisers at home, a licence shall be issued to enable the commodity to be imported <Col N="496" /> duty free here.  What he wants to get an assurance on is that the Irish farmer will not have to pay more for his chemical fertiliser, if we have a chemical industry here, than the farmer elsewhere against whom he has to compete.  If we are placed in that position, a definite handicap is put on our export effort.</P>
    <P>On the other hand I see this aspect. What is the point of our establishing a chemical industry here unless the farmers of the country avail of the product of that industry and buy it? We shall have to face that situation and we ought to face it now.  I think it is an aspect of the problem on which the Minister should be quite clear and definite.  In so far as we have to pay a higher price for the chemical product manufactured at home than we should have to pay for the imported product, we are going to be at a disadvantage in meeting our competitors in the outside market.  What Senator Johnston wants is to be able to import fertilisers duty free in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one other way of dealing with the matter and it is this.  The whole purpose of our exports is to maintain a balance in our national life. The export of agricultural products enables us to import certain industrial products.  It would probably be the means of providing us with the exchange to import certain raw materials that might be essential for utilisation in a chemical industry.  So it seems to me the Minister is up against this: he must ensure, if agricultural products in future are to be the medium by which we are to procure exchange, that the farmer gets a fair deal and that the internal industrial revival is not going unnecessarily to handicap the Irish farmer in his productive effort.</P>
    <P>If we are to buy the products of the home industry at a higher price than that at which we could procure the foreign product, there is one other way in which the account could be balanced. That is by the Minister recognising that, in so far as the price of the home product is much higher than the price of the foreign product, when we come to export our agricultural products <Col N="497" /> there will be a necessity, in order to help us to compete against outsiders, to subsidise exports.  That is the position in which the Minister is going to be placed in so far as he is the person organising the manufacture of industrial fertilisers.  I think, however anxious farmers may be to procure chemical fertilisers&mdash;and I know they are anxious; I am very anxious about it myself&mdash;the time will come when it will be the desire of farmers everywhere to get their raw materials at the lowest possible price.  If the price of Irish raw materials is higher than the price of the product of say Imperial Chemicals in the Twenty-Six Counties, there will be a continuance of this smuggling in which we are so terribly interested.  I think, on principle, the Minister should accept this amendment. The least we can expect from the Minister is a definite assurance that whatever may be the outcome of the effort to organise a chemical fertiliser industry here, it is not going to be any handicap whatever on the productive effort of the farmer by increasing his costs above what they would be if he had a free market to procure fertilisers on the most advantageous terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long.  I should like to say at once that I consider the amendment moved by Senator Johnston as one of a very sinister type. Senator Johnston's speech on the amendment itself might be described as amusing but it will be admitted that by the amendment and the speech of the Senator, an opportunity has been provided for a discussion of a very wide character, if we cared to indulge in it. For myself, I may say that I do not intend to indulge in any such discussion. It seems to me that Senator Johnston drafted this amendment very hurriedly, handed it in and left it at that because it is clear that the effect of the amendment would be that this company could not engage in any branch of production and continue in it for any length of time.  The amendment declares, that whenever the price of the foreign product is lower than the price of a similar product made available by Ceimící Teoranta, the Minister must allow the foreign product in free <Col N="498" /> of duty.  The effect of the amendment would be that if any outside company desired to smash any undertaking engaged in by Ceimící Teoranta, it has nothing to do but to reduce its prices for a certain period.</P>
      <P>Senator Johnston and Senator Baxter must be aware of the attempts made by outside companies ten or 12 years ago, when this country started its industrial revival.  They must be aware of the attempts, made through the process known as dumping, to prevent these Irish industries ever getting under way at all.  Is it not clear from the wording of this amendment, that if any outside company desires to check the development of industry engaged in by Ceimící Teoranta, it has nothing to do but adopt the policy adopted ten or 12 years ago by those outside companies, in other words, reduce the prices for three or four months and in that way drive this company out of production altogether?  The Senator has given the Minister no chance.  He says: &ldquo;The Minister shall&rdquo;, under the terms of this sub-section, issue the licence.  That is the objection to the amendment.  It would make it impossible for this company to function.  It would make it impossible for Ceimící Teoranta to do any one of the things we hope it will do, and do successfully.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that Senator Johnston also was hardly fair in putting down this amendment.  If he had read the section, and especially sub-sections (4) and (5), he would have seen that the powers to protect the agricultural industry or any other industry are there given specifically to the Minister and to the House.  In sub-section (4), it is clear that the Minister has the power to apply a brake to the activities of Ceimící Teoranta, if he thinks they are not working efficiently or that their prices are unduly high and likely to affect unfairly the agricultural industry&mdash;or any other industry, for that matter.</P>

Again, under sub-section (5), it is clear that whenever <Col N="499" /> the Minister makes an Order under this section, the Order must come before the House for discussion.  In view of these two sub-sections, it seems to me that Senator Johnston did not render the House or render agriculture any service whatever by putting down this amendment and by delaying us in the way he did delay us in discussing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>When I listened to Senator Johnston introducing this amendment, I could not help feeling that the lessons of the recent emergency period are rapidly being forgotten. We have dangled up before us a certain bogey&mdash;he quoted a golf one, but I will quote another one&mdash;it is: &ldquo;As good, and as cheap also&rdquo;.  The object of the amendment is clearly that anything in this country shall not be used unless it is so made that it is as cheap as anything which can be brought in from anywhere outside.  Surely a man of Senator Johnston's calibre knows that, in the past as it will be in the future, if imports are allowed in duty free there is no guarantee that the goods will be sold here&mdash;whether fertilisers or anything else&mdash;on an economic basis.  They will be sold at the prices dictated by the domestic policies arranged abroad by those larger concerns under which these manufacturers operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I want to stress is that, when an article is made in this country, if the price has to be a little bit higher than that of a similar article imported, the labour content is made up by Irish people.  If the factory or series of factories proposed under this Bill engage in this work here, then work will be found for farmers' sons who otherwise would have no outlet but the emigrant ship.  Another of the lessons of the economic war period is that price was not always the most important factor, it was the availability of supplies at any price.  I have never rushed in on agricultural problems&mdash; although I notice that the farmers do not hesitate to discuss industrial ones &mdash;but I am wondering whether the well-known impoverishment of our land today would be the degree of impoverishment that it is, if there had been healthy fertiliser factories in the country <Col N="500" /> producing all the chemical fertilisers this country would need.  I think that is a fairly pertinent question.</P>
    <P>There is something sinister in an amendment of this kind, by reason of its implication.  The wording is clear: it is a long time since anything was so clear.  We must not buy anything Irish if the cost is, in no matter what degree, higher than that of the imported article.  We have heard people say that Cathleen Ní Houliháin has been for 25 years floundering in the waters of her industrial rebirth.  We are told that she has not yet reached the shore.  I am one of the many who feel that she has long ago reached the shore and is well dried now.  I am looking forward to an expansion of our industrial programme, but it still seems to worry certain people.  I hope the amendment will be rejected.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Senator Johnston read the first sub-section of Section 8.  It provides that the Minister may make an Order prohibiting the importation of an article save under licence.  The first question we have to ask ourselves is this: is the Minister likely to make an Order prohibiting the importation of fertilisers used by agriculturists, while at the present moment he is engaged, and has been for a long time engaged, in endeavouring to get in certain allowances of sulphate of ammonia, nitrogen and other component parts of the manures for agriculture?  He finds it very difficult to do so, as there are certain quotas given to different countries and he cannot exceed the quota allowed to this country.  He has a very difficult proposition, but now it is suggested, in face of that proposition, that this Minister or any Minister succeeding him will attempt to make an Order prohibiting the importation of a substance used for manuring the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that, if it was ever made, there was a very <Col N="501" /> good reason for it and that in 1932 the material was not required.  It is required now.  If it is required, as is the case at the moment, it is ridiculous to suggest that the Minister would make an Order prohibiting its importation. If he did make such an Order, it would have to be laid before both Houses, as Senator Ó Buachalla has said; and the very name of the Order would make people read it and inquire what it was about, so there would be an outcry if ever such an Order were made.  The whole idea is absurd and ridiculous.  Secondly, there is the idea that, even then, the Minister would not grant a licence.  Of course he would grant a licence.  However, the Order would not be made in the first place, so no licence would be necessary.</P>
      <P>This amendment uses the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is very seldom in legislation that that word is applied to a Minister.  You give a Minister power and put in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that he must do a certain thing, and here it is a presumption that this Minister, or any other Minister succeeding him, would be neglectful of the interests of the farmers.  The whole thing is ridiculous. I suggest that this amendment should not be accepted and that it should not be pressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of this amendment.  The Minister will agree that, for the purpose of a sound economy, it is important to keep the costs of agricultural production down to the lowest possible figure.  After all, it represents virtually the only export by which we can balance our trade. The Minister, while accepting that, urges that we must have due regard to a certain measure of industrial development. There, I agree.  There have been industrial developments here, based mainly on raw materials within the country, which are highly desirable. I should like to get nearer the question than the histrionics of Senator Summerfield, who argues that, if you did this, you would have nothing Irish. That sort of argument does not get you anywhere.  Take a specific case.  In our national economy, would it be better to put 5/- a time on sulphate of <Col N="502" /> ammonia or to deny the employment afforded to whatever the number of industrial workers is involved?  I would unhesitatingly say that keeping the costs of the farmers' raw material to the lowest possible level is all-important but every case has to be decided on its merits.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say that he has in mind, in the administration of the Act, some means of protecting the agricultural producer.  I cannot believe that, in his inmost thoughts, he is happy about the effect that a measure of this kind may have on our national economy.  Is Senator O'Dea or Senator Ó Buachalla serious in suggesting that the Order affords any protection? An Order is made, giving the company the right to produce, say, sulphate of ammonia.  At that stage, there is not knowledge of the cost.  It is not until the manufacture will have taken place that the burden to be placed on agriculture will be known. Then it is too late.</P>
      <P>That is the difficulty.  The position would be different if this were a private company which did not enjoy those special privileges.  There is no more assurance that every public institution will be managed efficiently than there is that every private concern will be managed inefficiently.  The difficulty is that the Government's prestige is involved in the case of an inefficiently-managed Government company and it is kept alive.  If it were a private concern, it would go into bankruptcy&mdash;the right place for it.  I hope the Minister will say that he is concerned regarding the effect of the price of chemical products used as the raw material for agriculture and that he has in mind some means to protect our primary producers.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope the House will reject this amendment.  We are very fortunate in having a very efficient fertiliser industry, which goes a long way towards meeting our agricultural requirements.  It is not an industry of yesterday.  It goes back for 100 years.  I have been fairly closely associated with it for over 50 years.  I remember when the industry was family owned.  During the British régime, it had to meet competition <Col N="503" /> from abroad and it weathered it.  The conditions of the people employed in it were not what they should be because of that competition from abroad.  With the advent of an Irish Government, this was rectified, and I think we owe some gratitude to this industry for the manner in which it served the people during the emergency.  Things would have been very much worse if we had not had this organisation already established.  Senator Johnston referred, on the Second Reading, to the employment of a &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; or &ldquo;beggarly&rdquo; 1,000 persons.  These 1,000 persons find lucrative employment in this industry.</P>

      <P>If the Senator cannot see the connection, I shall not try to convince him.  If we are to open the flood-gates and permit dumping, then the industry will go.  That is what Senator Johnston means by his amendment. He has already referred to what happened in 1932, when Belgium was over-producing fertilisers and had to find a dumping ground.  They were dumped here at less than the cost of production.  The local factories were not in a position to compete with that kind of thing and they got a small measure of protection from the Government to enable them to carry on.  If the industry had been put out of business then, we should have been in a very bad way during the emergency. Senator Baxter believes we should import everything possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Baxter advocates the importation of everything possible to cheapen the cost of production to the farmer.  At one time, we could have imported quite a number of things, including flour and wheat, at less than production cost.  We would have been in a nice predicament during the emergency if we had availed ourselves of those opportunities and imported materials which we could temporarily get at less than the cost of production.  As a short-term policy, that may seem all right but, in the long run, we have to secure ourselves against possible emergencies.  My interest in this matter is the employment of 1,000 persons at a lucrative wage.  If these people are not employed in industry, they will have to be maintained somehow&mdash;unless you export them, in the same way as the farmers' produce, which some people are so keen on exporting.  If this amendment be adopted, we shall open the gates to all kinds of dumping.  The industry we have here encountered competition from all parts in the past, and will, I am sure, continue to serve the farmers equally efficiently in the future.  But, apart from serving the farmers, they are producing sulphuric acid which is used in the gas works both in Dublin and in Cork.  I wonder if Senator Johnston's amendment is passed and this industry closes down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">

      <P>I also disagree with Senator Foran when he says that the employment of 1,000 men is as much <Col N="506" /> as we can aim at.  Far more employment can be given by an efficient system, which this Bill may bring about.  I have not started to advocate the founding of a sulphate of ammonia factory here and now; I have been using my best endeavours, privately and locally, for some very considerable time and it will take a good deal to convince me that we can readily cast such an industry aside.</P>
      <P>The speech which I would commend most to the Minister was that of Senator Sir John Keane.  I should be sorry to think that the country would be overtaxed for the benefit of a sulphate of ammonia factory in a country which could not consume its products and if the price was not in strict keeping with what farmers can pay.  Senator Sir John Keane's cement factory has not gone too far wrong as yet and perhaps we are better with it than without it.  I can by no means accept the theory that all is well with every factory we have or that all is well on every farm we have.  It will take the Minister all his time to balance the economy as between the two.  There is no use in our wrapping it up with economic wars as if the economic war were a matter of the past.  It is as much alive to-day as ever.  Its taxes and tariffs are there to be met, with their detriment to Irish crop production and we have to see whether we can give the same sustenance to our workers as is given across the water. No one should be permitted to stand in the way of that, whether he be a farmer or a manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will take the Minister all his time to get it through, but I say that we have suffered considerably in the last eight years through the absence of ammonia.  I am too old to be prejudiced by either political Parties or theories, and, taking a practical view, I liked the speech of Senator Sir John Keane.  I also liked the efforts of the Minister for some years to get the industry established, and I cannot come away from him too readily now; but I would prefer that common sense would prevail not only in his Department but in the Government.  In view of the difficulties existing, as I see them from my experience of the factories <Col N="507" /> in Dublin, and the wealth they can accumulate as against what we in the country can secure, I can only wish the Minister the best of luck in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>We will all agree with Senator Johnston and others who expressed the view that industrial development must be rooted in agricultural prosperity.  We will all agree that the steps we take to promote industrial development should not be of such a character as will undermine agricultural prosperity.  Agreement on these points, however, does not necessarily bring us to agreement with the amendment moved by Senator Johnston.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to discuss the matter at present, because both the section which Senator Johnston seeks to amend and his amendment relate to conditions which do not now exist, conditions in which people elsewhere will be willing to sell us stuff and will be trying to force us to take their materials and even cutting their prices in order to induce us to do so.  These conditions do not prevail now.  They may not prevail for many years.  They have not prevailed for so long that even to visualise them requires as great an effort of the imagination as inspired Senator Johnston's metaphors and parables.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We do, however, contemplate the possibility that at some stage these pre-war conditions will return, when production elsewhere will exceed demand elsewhere and people abroad will be anxious to sell their stuff and will be prepared to adopt the usual commercial devices in order to keep us buying their materials in preference to making similar materials for ourselves.  In such circumstances, we must have power to impose certain restrictions if production here is to be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is a fair test to apply to the efficiency of Irish industry that it must at all times be prepared to produce as cheaply as anybody <Col N="508" /> in some part of the world may at that time be prepared to sell goods here. No industry in the world could pass that test.  If over a period of years, in various international circumstances and despite fluctuations in price and the trading conditions that may prevail, our industries can maintain a level of prices comparable with those of similar concerns in countries where general conditions are somewhat similar, we will have done well enough.</P>
    <P>I fully agree that if we are to engage here in the more extensive production of agricultural fertilisers, or other agricultural raw materials, we must have as our aim their supply to farmers at prices which will not put them at a competitive disadvantage with farmers elsewhere.  It may not be possible to do that from the first day on which the wheels of the new concern will start to move, or it may not be possible to do that on occasion when fluctuating economic conditions impose difficulties or give advantages elsewhere; but if, over a reasonable period of time, it succeeds in doing that then it passes the test of efficiency which, I think, we should apply to it.</P>
    <P>There may be circumstances which would justify us in establishing and keeping in operation industries of special importance, even though the minimum cost of production here, assuming efficiency in the management and equipment, was still somewhat above the prices at which the products could be imported&mdash;industries which, because of their fundamental character, are essential to the maintenance of production in all international circumstances. I would regard the production of agricultural fertilisers as being in that category.  If we had fallen to the temptation of permitting the importation of very cheap superphosphate fertilisers from the Continent in 1932 and 1933 we would have had a temporary advantage in those years, but the existing superphosphate industry would have disappeared, and during the emergency years the capacity to manufacture phosphate rock into a superphosphate fertiliser would not have existed in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not <Col N="509" /> have been possible.  There were no raw materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were.  It is true that the supply of materials was curtailed by shipping difficulties and curtailed also by other practical problems, but in no year during the war did we fail to import substantial quantities of phosphate rock to supplement the quantities that were mined here for the manufacture of superphosphate fertilisers.  We could not have got, in any of those years, a supply of manufactured fertilisers.  We know that we suffered considerably in our productive efficiency during the war by the absence of supplies of sulphate of ammonia.  We might have had a sulphate of ammonia plant here before the war if we had been more energetic about the job of establishing it than we were.  It is, I think, possible to apply theory to practical problems far too rigorously and to arrive at ridiculous conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the war&mdash;I have told the story before&mdash;the lowest price at which we could see sulphate of ammonia manufactured in an efficient plant here was about 10/- per cwt. higher than the price at which sulphate of ammonia was then being sold here.  If that plant had been established, in so far as the main item in determining the selling price of sulphate of ammonia is concerned&mdash;the capital charge&mdash;we would now have sulphate of ammonia at a price far below that at which we can import it.  We were taking a short term view before the war.  I do not say that we would have adhered to that view, but we delayed action towards the encouragement of the establishment of the industry because of the consideration I have mentioned.  Who is going to say what prices will be, or what general conditions are going to be, in ten years' time or in 20 years' time, or what new international circumstances are going to upset any theories which we may hold to-day?  I say that safety lies in promoting productive capacity here with efficient management and trained and experienced workers.  These are the things that are essential to our welfare.  Therefore, I would not at all agree that rigid commercial principles should always be <Col N="510" /> applied to the decision as to whether or not we should have a sulphate of ammonia industry or any other chemical industry in which this company may at some stage engage.</P>
    <P>However, I am not going to dispute the main contention put forward by Senator Johnston and others that we must have regard at all times to the effect of the measures taken to promote industrial development on agricultural efficiency and prosperity, because industrial development must be rooted in agricultural prosperity.  Without a healthy and prosperous agriculture, industrial development will always be a stunted growth.  I would, therefore, while resisting the amendment, be prepared to give the House the firmest assurance that before deciding to issue a licence to the company to manufacture a chemical product which was the raw material of agriculture, the Government would give as careful consideration to the point expressed in the amendment as any Senator in this House would be likely to give to it, and it would certainly not give that licence unless it was prepared to come before the House to defend its action and to contend that, in the short term or long term aspect of our economic problems, the efficiency and welfare of agriculture would be promoted by the action that we took.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this debate has been of some value.  I know, of course, that certain sinister motives were attributed to me, motives which were far from being present to my consciousness. I do not know whether I should regard them as a compliment or otherwise, coming from the source that they did.  Perhaps I should take them as a compliment.  Certain misconceptions which arose in the course of the debate have been partly cleared up by the speech of the Minister.  When I drafted the amendment all that I had in view was a possible development under the terms of this measure.  I was not thinking at all of the existing phosphate fertiliser factories.  I did not at all conceive that my amendment could, in any way, affect their position. All that I wanted to emphasise was that it was essential, in all respects, that the cost of the production of chemical <Col N="511" /> manures should be kept as low as possible. The Minister has been pleasantly emphatic in agreeing that that is a desirable thing to keep in view.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the fact that in 1932 the importation of phosphates from the continent of Europe was forbidden.  It has been asserted that, if they had been allowed in at a dumping price, it would have had the effect of completely wiping out our existing phosphate factories.  I think it would have taken more than a few years of uneconomic competition to wipe out these factories.  They are solid, well-established and highly successful institutions financially, so that I think they could afford to fight a battle of competition for a year or two.  Assuming, however, that in the national interest it was considered desirable to prevent them from having to compete against the uneconomic price of imported phosphate, the right policy to adopt, in my view, would have been to say to the Belgian importers: &ldquo;By all means sell your stuff here below cost of production, but remember that as long as you continue to do this we are going to subsidise the price of our home-produced fertiliser to such an extent as will enable our manufacturers to sell their product at the same price level no matter how low you reduce your price.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that had been the policy of the Government during the 1930's, our farmers, instead of cutting to the bone the amount of fertiliser that they were able to use, would have used far more of it.  They would have done that even though the price might have been very uneconomic from the manufacturers' point of view.  As a result of the policy that was pursued, our agriculture has fallen short of phosphates since 1932 to the extent of 2,000,000 tons.  If what I say had been done, the shortage would be much less than 2,000,000 tons, so that the productive power of our agriculture all during the recent war period would have been greater.  The output of wheat per acre would have been much greater from land that had not been starved of fertilisers.  The cost of living, too, about which everyone has been complaining, would also have been much lower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> I suggest that if my amendment were incorporated in the Bill it would be quite possible for the Minister, through Government policy, to neutralise the effect of it in so far as it might have the effect of preventing production by an Irish-established factory.  Suppose a situation arose in which foreign sulphate of ammonia came in here and was being sold at, say, 10/- per cwt. cheaper than the Irish manufacturer could sell it.  Under the amendment the Minister would be technically liable to open the ports and allow the free import of this foreign sulphate of ammonia, but he could defeat that by persuading the Dáil to introduce a Bill subsidising the price of home-produced sulphate of ammonia to the extent of 10/- a ton, in which case the principle of this amendment would not apply, and he would be quite in order in continuing to forbid the import of the foreign produced sulphate of ammonia, and the Irish factory could sell its produce at an economic price with the help of the Government subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on the Second Reading:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether we produce it ourselves or import it, we can subsidise the price.  I should not at all disagree with the policy of subsidising fertilisers for farmers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome that.  Rather than add one iota to the cost of production of our farmers, we ought to accept the principle that the taxpayer and not the farmer should pay the additional price, if it is only possible to produce agricultural requisites at a higher price than the price at which they could be imported.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of dumping competition, I did not take into account that kind of unfair competition in drafting this amendment. It would be possible to redraft the amendment in such a way as to take account of the fact that short-term dumping competition is not something which should operate so as to bring into effect the principle of the amendment. Consequently with the permission of the House, I shall withdraw the amendment and reintroduce it in a modified form on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 11 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) No issue of debentures under Section 14 of the Principal Act shall be made by Ceimící Teoranta in respect of its operations under this Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when he was introducing the Bill in the Dáil, said it was only a tentative measure, experimental in character, and if it was established that the chemical industry was suitable for this country, there would have to be fresh legislation.  I will quote his words.  Referring to the protection that the Oireachtas had against any too precipitate or too hasty action on the part of this company, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not proposed to alter the capital of the company by this Bill or to make any additional financial provision for extending its activities. Under the original Act, the maximum amount which the Minister for Finance can invest in the shares of the company is £500,000.  The issued capital of the company is £275,763. The granting of a licence to the company to undertake a new form of manufacture, if it should require that additional capital above the limit now fixed in the Principal Act must be provided from the Exchequer, must also involve fresh legislation so that the Dáil will have a full opportunity of discussing the proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred on the Second Reading to the power to borrow on debentures.  I think that if the Minister really wishes to carry out his assurance that there will be no fresh funds beyond the issued capital placed at the disposal of this experimental company, he will deny the company the right to borrow on debentures.  You give this company power, through borrowing on debentures apparently without limit, to advance on activities far beyond what the Minister contemplated when introducing this measure.  For that reason, I put down this amendment to limit, as the Minister had in mind when he <Col N="514" /> introduced the measure, the financial resources of this company; the company must be satisfied, for the time being, to obtain additional finance from the unissued capital, and when the time comes for fresh legislation, it can ask for any further capital that might be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct that the company can raise money without limit by the issue of debentures. Under the Principal Act, it cannot raise money by the issue of debentures in excess of the paid-up share capital or without the consent of the Minister for Finance, given after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I think I can give the Senator any assurance he requires that the company will not finance a new manufacturing enterprise by loan capital.  It would be a most undesirable step for the company to contemplate.  I cannot conceive that in any circumstances the Minister for Finance would approve of the company financing a new manufacturing development entirely out of loan capital.  It would be unwise to impose the statutory bar proposed by the Senator which would prohibit the company raising any money by the issue of debentures for the purpose of new manufacturing enterprises at any time.  I do not know whether circumstances may arise which would require that the company should temporarily borrow money by the issue of debentures in connection with new manufacturing enterprise, but, if the need was there, I see no reason why the company should not have the power to issue debentures for the purpose of securing the temporary loan it might require.  The power to issue debentures was exercised only once by the company and that was at the beginning, when the undertaking was transferred to the company by the Minister for Finance.  Debentures were issued to the Minister for Finance in respect of a debt due to him by the company at the time.  That debt has since been paid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My observations on the Senator's amendment are that I agree with him that new manufacturing activities should be financed by share capital <Col N="515" /> advanced by the Minister for Finance under the authority of the existing Bill or new legislation in the ordinary way and not by loan capital secured by the issue of debentures.  At the same time I think the power of the company with regard to the issue of debentures in respect of such new manufacturing enterprises should not be removed, because this undertaking, like any other commercial undertaking, might find itself in the position at some stage where it would require a temporary loan of money and it should be entitled to effect it within the limits set down in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>These limits are two-fold.  They cannot issue debentures to a value greater than the paid-up capital, and they cannot do it at all without the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this amendment will have some prospect of acceptance. A few moments ago the Minister was saying that we cannot accept the cost of production as the sole test of Irish efficiency.  What is his test of inefficiency?  I take it he is prepared to admit that there are occasions on which inefficiency may prevail in local manufacture.  I would be very much surprised if it had never arisen hitherto.  What means has the Minister got to deal with cases of inefficiency, which, of course, take the form of increased prices on the consumer? As I said before, inefficiency in private enterprise means bankruptcy; <Col N="516" /> inefficiency in Government enterprise means carrying on and placing the burden either on the taxpayer or on the consumer.</P>
    <P>The first point, as any business man will agree, in testing inefficiency is a proper system of accounting.  Here we are going to divide the activities of this industry roughly into two sections. Some of us have been rather staggered by the cost of production of industrial alcohol.  Now we are going into an entirely new venture, unforeseen and without limit, except for the financial provisions, and I think it is necessary, from an objective business point of view, to know the costs of manufacture other than those of industrial alcohol. This is to avoid the camouflage, perfectly legitimate purely from the point of view of accounting, of allowing an artificial cost of 7/6 for industrial alcohol, for which there can be always a market, to obscure the true cost of production of other products.  I do not see how that can be done unless you segregate the costs of production of industrial alcohol from the other products. I am not concerned to differentiate between all the other products at this stage.  No doubt they would have in their internal book-keeping, a system of costings in regard to the main products. What I want is that the Oireachtas and the country should know what is going on.  There is very considerable concern at the growing activities of these semi-Government or nominal capital companies, as to which nothing comes out until the annual accounts are published, and the annual accounts are not always as clear as we should like them to be, where, as I say, the factor of bankruptcy does not enter.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment in principle&mdash;it may want a bit of touching up before the Report Stage &mdash;to separate the costs in the two cases.</P>

      <P>I agree fully with Senator Sir John Keane that it is desirable that the particulars he has mentioned should be given.  My criticism of the amendment would be that it does not go far enough in that regard.  I think he contemplates the company getting a licence to manufacture chemical products; but that is not what is intended. <Col N="517" /> They will get a separate licence for each separate form of manufacture in which they may engage, and in my view they should distinguish in their accounts between every business for which a separate licence has been issued.</P>
      <P>The Principal Act as it stands does, however, give ample power to ensure that the company will present its accounts in that way.  The Act requires that they shall set out certain particulars, in any event, and that the accounts shall also be drawn up in such a manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.  I think I can give, without any hesitation whatsoever, an assurance to the Senator and the House that the company, if it is licensed under this Bill to engage in any form of chemical manufacture or a number of forms of chemical manufacture, will be required to distinguish in its accounts, which are published to the Oireachtas, between each of the separate businesses for which it holds a licence, as well as the business of manufacturing industrial alcohol.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 11 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>( ) This Act shall not come into force until a report has been obtained from high expert authority on the prospects of establishing a chemical industry in Éire and such report has been considered by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> I am sorry to inflict all these amendments on the House, but I feel that these are matters of importance.  I hope no one will call this an obstructive amendment.  Some people may be inclined to think it is, but that is not so.  I have, and I think other Senators have, very considerable apprehension as to the possibilities or prospects of a chemical industry in this country on an economic basis.  We differ as to what we mean by an economic basis. I would say that it means producing near the cost of production on a big scale, like we would expect, say, from Imperial Chemicals.  I feel that the House should want something more than that there is a prospect of establishing an industry on a lasting basis which only places a comparatively small burden on the consumer.  The basis that justifies such an industry is that it should not unduly burden our primary industries.</P>
    <P>I feel that, as in the case of the electricity undertaking, we should have had, before embarking on this measure, a report from a body of experts as to the long-term prospects.  I agree that at present everything is out of gear and that we have to project our minds over the next two or three years. When I made the suggestion on the Second Reading the Minister said that I was very naïve.  He asked did I seriously think that any big firm would come in here and give us an honest report, or that it would not come in here with an eye on its own interests. I do not believe that for a moment.  I do not believe that a firm with the standing of Imperial Chemicals would for a moment give any report which they did not believe to be true and honest.  They would be paid for the report and they would give the best opinion they could.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another aspect. If I were starting a chemical industry, I should be very glad to give a licence to Imperial Chemicals to come and do the job.  With their experience, without casting any disrespect on local talent, it would be a far better job than if it were done by persons in this country with limited experience.  So far as our own internal wealth is concerned, <Col N="519" /> every safeguard should be provided; the capital should be provided locally, but you would have the very highest experience behind the business.</P>
    <P>It is because I feel so strongly that it is necessary to start this industry with every prospect of success, or not start it at all unless there is such a prospect, that I think such a report should be made before the Bill comes into operation.  It would not take long. If the report said that you can make chemicals here at a cost of 10 per cent. higher on an average than it would be in a larger market with more local raw material available, well and good, the directors can go on with their eyes open.  Now we are taking a plunge in the dark, which I feel is very dangerous. That is the reason why I put down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">

      <P>There is a lot to be said for the principle of inviting expert opinion to report on the matter, in much the same way as was done before the Shannon scheme was established, but I am not at all enthusiastic about inviting I.C.I. to be the experts in question because I.C.I. is a somewhat monopolistic concern who have doubtless an axe of their own to grind in a matter of this kind.  If you ask the financial interests or the governing body of I.C.I. to make a report, I am not at all certain that you will get a straightforward or objective report. On the other hand, I.C.I. employ numerous university graduates in chemistry, and such, who are experts in their particular subject.  I am quite certain that you could get from among the personnel of such people, chemical experts employed abroad and who perhaps feel their exile rather acutely, a perfectly objective opinion as to whether or not we could establish a chemical industry on an economic basis here.  So, while I would be all in favour of consulting expert opinion, I would not like these experts to be in any way influenced, consciously or otherwise, by their own financial interests but I would like them to be essentially of the type of chemical experts who would view the matter from an objective point of view and who would not be financially <Col N="520" /> interested in the fortunes of I.C.I.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane's amendment indicates a failure on his part to understand precisely what the Bill attempts to do.  The enactment of this measure will not authorise Ceimící Teoranta to engage in any form of chemical manufacture. We are not taking, as he described it, a plunge in the dark.  We are not taking a plunge at all, even in daylight. The company will be authorised to finance investigations and experiments with a view to arriving at a decision as to the practicability of various forms of chemical manufacture. In the course of its investigations it will employ experts.  It presumably will utilise the services of the best experts it can establish contact with. It is as a result of the consultations and investigations of the company, associated with the advice given them by the experts they employ, that decisions will be made, decisions which cannot be implemented until due notice of the intention to do so has been given to the public at large, because the provisions of the Bill require that, before a licence is given to the company to undertake any form of manufacture, there must be public notice of the intention to give that licence given through the Press.  If there is a capital sum involved in the manufacture contemplated in excess of the unissued capital of the company then there must be legislation as well.  At this stage, the members of the Seanad, like the members of the Dáil, will be fully entitled to request from the Minister responsible for the measure assurance that expert advice has been secured and that that expert advice supports the undertaking which the company proposes to engage in.  I do not think, however, that we should impose the limitation which the Senator suggests, because that really belongs to a different type of investigation.  We are only starting the investigation with the passage of this Bill and we cannot get the investigation undertaken at all unless the Bill is brought into force. The Senator says the Bill must not come into force until we have the expert report.  The process of getting <Col N="521" /> the expert advice cannot begin until the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>I notice also that the Senator, in his amendment, refers again to a chemical industry.  I want to make it quite clear that we have not in contemplation a chemical industry of the type Imperial Chemicals operates in Great Britain where almost any chemical process is undertaken and any chemical product will be manufactured.  We contemplate that the board of the company will investigate various possibilities in the chemical industry and will propose to the Government the granting to it of a licence to undertake only where they are satisfied that there is good ground for believing that the industry is one worth establishing and which can be made to operate successfully here.  Within the whole of the chemical field there will be some products which we can contemplate manufacturing satisfactorily here; there will be many which we will not be able to undertake at all.  We do not contemplate giving the company a general authority to go into any chemical industry which might be conceived.  We will give it only specific authority to undertake the manufacture of named articles when the practicability of that course appears to be established.</P>

      <P>It is because I find the method proposed in the Bill so utterly unconvincing that I should like this report.  It depends on the terms of reference what the report would say. It may be as limited or as wide as would be permitted under the terms of reference.  I should like a report by a body of experts saying, &ldquo;We think there is a prospect of this being a success&rdquo; or, &ldquo;With our experience, we are sure as far as world markets and world prices can be forecast, that this is all right&rdquo;.  But here we are going to experiment in matters which have been already fully investigated by people who have been in the business for years.  I do not wish to cast any slur on anybody but we are taking a number of people who have been engaged in producing industrial alcohol and we are asking them to explore the field of certain chemical production. What are they going to find out?  Has not the whole thing been thoroughly <Col N="522" /> explored for years?  What is the object of spending this money?</P>

      <P>I may have misled the Senator.  The investigation which the company will undertake will not be of a scientific character.  Scientific research will be undertaken by the Industrial Research Institute.  The company will be concerned only to investigate the commercial possibilities of established scientific processes in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Commercial possibility&mdash;does that mean simply selling, assuming a price, and seeing whether there is likely to be a market for it? I do not see how they are going to work.  Are they going to make some product on a small scale, not entirely a laboratory scale, but a limited scale and then decide whether or not that product can be made here?  Surely that has been explored for years in other places.  There is no mystery about these things.  They are ordinary trade products.  If the Minister were to tell us that they were going to experiment in plastics to see if they could be manufactured here, I would be more convinced, because that is a new product.  I am very apprehensive. I feel that this money is simply going to be wasted in an experiment to discover things that are already known and that have been known for years. That is why I should like to have expert opinion as to whether this thing is worth doing or not.  The Minister has told us already that he has figures about sulphate of ammonia production that would justify a local industry.  If these figures are available, and if they are put before Parliament, let us cut out the interim period and get down to the production of sulphate ammonia if the Minister is satisfied on the figures.  It is because I am not convinced that this money will be spent wisely that I put down the amendment.  I have no doubt I will not get support and I will be satisfied to leave it there.</P>

      <P>Of course, unless my consent is obtained also, the amendment cannot be withdrawn.  I do not know where these experts could be found.  I agree with Senator Johnston that I.C.I. would be rather suspect, and I have experience of a different type from that which Senator Johnston may be thinking of.  I have known some of the work of Imperial Chemicals in a particular line in relation to agriculture and certainly it did not raise them in my estimation. I take it that when the Minister gets his Bill the responsibility will be placed on those people to get on with the job. Suppose, as Senator Sir John Keane suggests, we had a report from experts, I do not know that Parliament would like to have that experts' report put before it and to have Deputies and Senators charged with the responsibility of saying &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to this scheme.  I think it is better to put on the Minister and the people whom he has entrusted with the work the responsibility of carrying out the task he wishes to have accomplished. I presume that the Minister, in trying to get information which will determine whether, commercially, a particular industry should be established here will seek the advice of external experts if necessary.</P>
      <P>I presume also that if a decision be taken to establish a particular type of chemical industry here, he will have to go to the world outside for the advice of a particular type of expert in the management and working of the industry.  It will be interesting to hear from the Minister whether there is available here at home people who are competent to give an opinion upon which a decision can be taken as to whether a particular enterprise might be undertaken by this company, and also whether it will be necessary for him to draw on outside help and technical training to give advice in the management of the industry.</P>

      <P>There are many people in this country whose technical qualifications are such that I would unhesitatingly <Col N="524" /> rely on their judgment in the matters on which this board will have to decide.  It is true, as Senator Sir John Keane said, that the processes which will be investigated will be established processes.  There will be no technical or scientific secrets about them to be discovered.  The best illustration I can give is sulphate of ammonia itself.  I know enough about that to know that there are a number of different processes for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, all of which are protected by patents to a greater or lesser extent.  The question for the board to investigate and study is which of these various methods of manufacture is most suitable to our circumstances, from the point of view of the raw materials we possess or the costs of manufacture here by different methods.  These are the issues on which the board will seek advice and on which it will arrive at a decision. On many of these issues, they have available, either amongst themselves or in the country, persons who are fully competent to give an authoritative, really expert view for the guidance of their colleagues or the Government. It is on questions of that character, rather than on more scientific questions which would ordinarily be dealt with by the Industrial Research Bureau, that the board will carry out investigations and report to the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be appropriate on this section to make some observations upon the general policy pursued in vocational schools by the Minister. Section 2 invites us to agree to a proposal that the maximum rate which may be levied by local bodies for vocational education should be raised and it is to be noted that an increase in the rate also involves automatically, owing to the system, an increase in the central contribution.  Section 2, in effect, is a proposal that the local and the central expenditure upon vocational education should be increased or, at any rate, that it should be made possible, on the initiative of local bodies, to increase it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be general agreement that, if vocational education means an increase of education over the age of 14 years and an improvement in the equipment of our people, boys and girls, men and women, for their occupations and for their leisure, more money could be spent profitably and should be spent on it.  However, I would like to ask the Minister to tell us the purposes which he has in view in vocational schools, the spirit in which he thinks <Col N="526" /> the work should be carried out, what difficulties exist and what success he thinks has been achieved.  More particularly, I might be allowed to advert to something in which I take a peculiar interest and about which we have had some discussion on the Second Stage of this Bill, namely, the rôle which the Irish language and Irish language teaching is expected to play in vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely that every possible facility and inducement should be given for the study of Irish and for the realisation of what that study means and what there is behind it.  When I say that, I would like to make it clear that, particularly in vocational schools, where you are dealing with people who are to a great extent their own masters, Irish should certainly not be something which is a drag upon people but something which is of added interest, both in the school and in their lives outside the school.  I wonder whether that actually is the case.  My doubts are rather strengthened than dissipated by listening to the Minister on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Apparently, he refuses to discuss at all any question of the difficulties which surround the teaching of Irish and appears to fall back upon the abuse of people who suggest that certain things are wrong.</P>
    <P>Avoiding the personal issue altogether, I would suggest that what is wrong is that the Minister, by deliberate choice, which we are perfectly entitled to discuss, has placed the inspection of vocational schools in the hands of a person whose qualifications are in oral Irish and in scarcely anything else.  The Minister appears to think that the most important thing in the vocational schools is the spreading of a knowledge of oral Irish.  I stress the word &ldquo;oral&rdquo;, because there are a great many aspects of Irish, apart from the mere speech.  The Minister seems to me to have chosen, and to be supporting, a policy of pushing willy-nilly, by methods which are not the best and which are neither polite nor attractive, the Irish language in the vocational schools.  The Minister spoke of memoranda which are circulated to inspectors and which inspectors are expected to follow.  Those of us with <Col N="527" /> experience of administration and of life know that memoranda are very often deceptive things.  The individual and the individual's conduct are more important than memoranda issued from headquarters.  I should like to learn from the Minister whether he really believes what he appeared to say on the last occasion.  I do not want to advert to it from my own personal point of view.  I expressed certain doubts and the Minister's answer to me was that I was playing political tricks and that I had hoisted the white flag.</P>
    <P>I think that nothing is more dangerous to the progress of Irish in the vocational schools, and other schools, and in the country generally, than the attitude of smug complacency which seems to say: &ldquo;We are doing everything right and anybody who questions what we are doing is a coward and is showing the white flag.&rdquo; I take it that the &ldquo;white flag&rdquo; is really a euphemism to cover up a charge of cowardice.  It seems to me that that is not the position.  I should rather regard it in this fashion: a man finds his mother in danger of death; the doctor attending her is a man in whose skill, knowledge and past treatment he has no faith.  He thinks that another doctor should be called in and other measures taken. Surely a person in that position would not be accused of hoisting the white flag.  That is precisely the position as I see it.  A great many things are happening which show that the Minister is not prepared to face the difficulties of the situation.  He accused me on the last occasion of saying that we should &ldquo;speak English and be dacent&rdquo;.  That is just childish.  I do not know whether or not the Minister really believes that the reading of a dull, impersonal, official statement&mdash; perhaps a translation from English&mdash; is really furthering the cause of the Irish language.  Quite frankly, I do not believe it is.  I do not believe that, if such a performance were to be carried out every day and if others of us were to emulate it, it would have the slightest effect in retarding the accelerating decay which is overtaking Irish, for example, in the <Col N="528" /> Minister's County of Mayo, nor would it have any effect in exciting interest in the Irish language either in vocational schools or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke last day on a matter which is very relevant to this section and I wonder if he would give us some more information about it. The House may not be aware that Irish teachers in vocational schools are in a peculiar position.  It used to be necessary for them to have the Teastas Muinteóra Gaeilge&mdash;a certificate as teacher of Irish.  That is not now sufficient.  What you need now is the Teastas Timthire Gaeilge&mdash;a certificate as organiser of Irish.  Teachers of Irish in vocational schools are expected not only to teach Irish in the schools but also to organise what are called Irish activities outside the schools.  That is a very serious burden upon the teacher, for which he sometimes gets no extra pay and for which he may not be fitted.  We all know that a man or woman may be a very excellent teacher in a class-room but a very poor hand at organising things outside such as ceilidhthe, public meetings and feiseanna. It is my experience that a person who is extremely good at that out-of-door business may not be a good teacher at all.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister, we have deliberately embarked upon a policy which imposes a particular burden upon Irish teachers and which is endeavouring to mould that teacher of Irish in the vocational schools, no matter what his or her previous qualifications, in a particular way, by a particular course, done in the summer over a period.  Will the Minister tell us who are the people who conduct this course?  What is the aim of the course, and what are the subjects taught in it?  It should be understood that an honours university graduate of any college is not qualified to teach Irish in the vocational schools until he has done this particular course.</P>
    <P>In his extraordinary attitude on this particular matter on the last occasion, the Minister was good enough to misrepresent what I said about that matter.  I did not object to university graduates being improved.  Anybody who is a university teacher, like myself, is bound to say, if he is competent, <Col N="529" /> regularly to his class: &ldquo;When you get your degree, it is only tosach eolais&mdash;the beginning of knowledge; you are only beginning to educate yourself when you have got your degree.&rdquo;  I should be the last person to object to university graduates getting extra training or knowledge but they should get that extra training or knowledge from people who are capable of dealing with them and it should be possible to say precisely the kind of knowledge they are being given.  If a man&mdash;in this case, man, as it is said, embraces woman&mdash;is a native speaker of Irish and has a first class honours university degree, he is still not capable of teaching Irish in a vocational school.  He must get an extra qualification.  Would the Minister tell us what the nature of the extra qualification is?  If it is merely training in what is called the direct method, that is one thing but if it involves training in organising ceilidh the, it is a different thing.  I do not want to enter into the question but ceilidh dancing has no more to do with Irish than Morris dancing. There is a certain connection between the Gaeltacht and step-dancing but ceilidh dancing and Irish have no connection and except during the Gaelic League period, the two things were not allied.  I do not see why teachers should be committed to those two things.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell us what precisely the objects of this summer course are, what he hopes to achieve by it and why it is that, while a teacher of domestic economy or a teacher of French have only a particular job to do, a teacher of Irish is called upon to do a completely different job?  We may be told&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that the Irish language is in a peculiar position. According to the Minister, we must not damp down enthusiasm.  What the Minister is setting out to do is to create enthusiasm.  I said on the last occasion, and I should like to repeat, that officers of the State or officers of a local body cannot recreate the spirit behind the Irish language movement. The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Tá na múinteóirí seo ag cur spioraid nua san ghluaiseacht.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> I do not believe that.  I do not believe that this machinery is the right machinery for doing that.  If propaganda is to be done for the Irish language it should be done in an entirely different manner.  I hope to show that by some examples, if Senators bear with me.</P>
    <P>In the vocational schools, in particular, you are dealing with people who have left secondary schools and done a full Irish course.  If they have not had impressed upon them at their secondary course anything about the Irish language except that it is a school subject and that they ought to be rid of it as soon as they can, then there is something wrong with that system and it cannot be remedied by forcing, outside the system, in the vocational schools.  I think it was Senator Hawkins who expressed what is a very commonly held and very sincere but not a correct view, as those of us who are judges in the matter are well aware, when he said that people learned Irish in school until the age of 15 or 16 and should then be able to receive education through Irish.  That just is not so.  Perhaps it ought to be so, but it is not so.  Neither is it the case that a person who has passed the leaving certificate examination or who has got honours in that examination, or who has passed the matriculation examination, is able to receive instruction through Irish.  They need not necessarily be able to speak or to understand any Irish at all, as our system at present works, so that there is a good deal of difficulty in the matter.</P>
    <P>Surely the Irish language is like poetry.  It should be an enjoyment and you cannot force enjoyment on people.  You may help them to enjoy poetry and you may explain poetry to them and you may read poetry to them, but you cannot make them enjoy poetry, if they are not that kind.  The same thing exactly applies to Irish. There are two legs upon which the whole movement rests and the vocational schools have a unique opportunity of keeping in touch with both of them.  One of these is the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.  What is being done, for example, in Dungarvan that is any assistance to the <Col N="531" /> Irish language around the town of Dungarvan?  What is being done in Macroom that is of any assistance to the Irish in Ballyvourney and CulAodha, where I spent some time this autumn?  I do not think anything is being done.  The other is that you must have a sentimental interest in the language, and I use the word &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; advisedly.  No such thing as pursuing an examination, or a job, or a monetary reward will be a substitute for that spirit of love for the Irish language for a purely sentimental reason which a great many people had and still have.</P>
    <P>The Minister ignores certain difficulties. He refuses to talk about them. Take, for example, the invitation to speak Irish here.  It is all very fine if you bring in a prepared statement, read it out and hand it to the reporters, but if you speak Irish naturally and vigorously in this House, or in the other House, or anywhere else, it is very difficult to get that Irish reported, and that is no reflection upon the Official Reporters.  It is just an unpleasant fact.  I tried to grapple with it for a number of years.  Fifteen years have elapsed since I last grappled with it in 1932 and very little progress has been made.  There is no use in the Minister telling me that I am hoisting the white flag when I state the facts. Certain reporting can be done, but it is a matter of very great difficulty.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I do not know whether the Minister knows that an adaptation for Irish of Pitman's shorthand has been with the Gúm, which is part of his Department, for a couple of years and has not yet seen the light.  That, if it is by a practical person, and I think it is by a practical person who understands reporting, would be of great assistance.  It would be worth while considering what could be done about that situation.  If you make a speech in English, you are reported; if you make a speech in Irish, you are reported also but not so well, and there are great difficulties in the matter.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty about the Irish language is that it is a hard language and perhaps the greatest difficulty of <Col N="532" /> all is that the Irish language you want to teach in the vocational schools is the language of a rural population, and indeed was never anything else. The Irish language was never the dominant language of what we know nowadays as towns and cities, and what we are trying to do now&mdash;and it offers great difficulties but there are certain things we could do about it, particularly in the vocational schools&mdash;is endeavouring to revive that rural language in a country which is becoming less and less rural and more and more urban.  If you cannot excite interest in the rural way of life in the pupils who go into the vocational schools, you have no hope of exciting their interest in the Irish language itself, if it is merely a matter of verbs and nouns, syntax and grammar.</P>
    <P>One of the things which would be of great assistance, if it were available for vocational schools&mdash;it does not exist at all in this country in Irish or in English&mdash;is a book like a book I have before me at the moment in French called <i>Au Village de France:</i><i>la vie traditionelle des paysans.</i>  That is a book which shows the traditional life of the French peasantry.  It has any amount of illustrations and it begins with a map of the year showing that from November to the middle of March a great deal of time is spent indoors story-telling, singing, and so on, which is exactly the position here, Lá Samhna go dti Lá 'le Pádraig, showing the seasons, the work and, by illustrations, French interiors in various places, the tools they work with in the fields, the festivities they have, their costumes and their marriage and religious customs.  If we had a book of that kind in Irish, instead of a variety of indifferent translations, it would be an immense assistance in giving what people often talk about, a rural bias to our education.  That is what you call a real rural bias&mdash;to tell them something about Ireland and not about the heroes&mdash;not about Owen Roe O'Neill or Brian Boru, but about ordinary people and how they lived and how to a great extent they still live.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of book that might excite interest.  There is no such thing <Col N="533" /> available in Irish or in English. There is a book by a Belfast professor or lecturer, named Evans, called <i>Irish Heritage</i> and another book by a Harvard man, an American named Arnsberg, called <i>The Irish Countryman</i> which is good, but neither is so useful in schools as this book.  There are similar Welsh books and a whole series of French books.  If these things could be done in Irish or in English, they would incite an interest out of which the Irish language would certainly benefit, and I suggest it is the kind of thing that should be done.  It is much better than any scheme which involves embarrassing teachers because they do not know Irish&mdash;I want to be quite frank about it&mdash;I think that is foolish and bad&mdash;and much better than forcing people to teach through the medium of Irish, in spite of the Minister's memoranda, and when they are not willing to do it, because teaching, above all other things, is something you must be willing to do.  You must be willing to do it, and, if you are unwilling, it does not matter what you are supposed to be doing, you are not doing it right.  The whole thing will have to be based upon the notion that you must have excited an interest and not that you must bully or be bad-mannered.</P>
    <P>Our whole vocational system, particularly in rural areas and in all the towns, should have more to do with folklore and folk culture.  It would be much better if the teachers, university graduates or others, were given a summer course by people who are experts on folklore than by people who are experts on Irish dancing.  In other words, they should be told what the real Ireland is like and it is surprising how many people do not know what the real Ireland is like and surprising how many people, even from a country town close to the real Ireland, do not know about it.  Recently an American came over here to do a film on Ireland and he showed considerable intelligence by taking the traditional folk view and putting himself in the hands of people who understand that view and that position.</P>
    <P>There are two kinds of things we have not got in spite of the money we are <Col N="534" /> spending and in spite of the extra money we are now going to spend.  I was talking this summer, when down in Dunquin, to Peg Sayers, an old woman who is responsible for a book and responsible for the telling of a great number of Irish tales.  She is a very remarkable person.  She has a wonderful voice, yet in spite of all our talk about Irish you cannot bring a gramophone record of her voice into a class of Irish students and say: &ldquo;There is an example of real Irish, of a living, quite remarkable type.&rdquo;  The same thing applies to certain people in the parish of Ring, and the same thing applies to certain people I met in Cul-Aodha in West Cork this year.  These people will last a very short time more and no matter what kind of flag the Minister hoists or what kind I hoist, nothing will stop their going into the grave, and when they go into the grave nobody will have the language that they have.  Surely, it would pay, and would be well worth doing, to have a gramophone record, not an ediphone record, of those people's voices, so that the teacher could have it at his disposal and so that he could say beyond all doubt what was the real language.</P>
    <P>For example, a very great Irish scholar, an Englishman, was introduced to the Irish language by reading Amhráin Grádha&mdash;&ldquo;The love songs of Connacht&rdquo;, by Douglas Hyde, with the English on one side and Irish on the other.  A man came to me lately saying that he wanted to learn Irish, and I could not think of anything better for him to start with than that book, one of the earliest books published since the Irish revival started. That is another thing that we have wrong with us&mdash;the objection to the use of English as a weapon to improve Irish.  It should be used, and could be used, and, to my mind, you could easily have books graded with Irish and English.  We have nailed our colours to the mast without thinking.  I have not, but the Minister seems to me to have, and it is quite possible to be wilfully blind and to go on saying that you are doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>I understand well what the Minister is doing.  He is doing what his predecessors did, 25 years after the Treaty <Col N="535" /> which the Minister took occasion to sneer at on the Second Stage of this Bill.  The Minister is doing precisely what his predecessors decided should be done when civil war was raging in the country.  I do not think that any imagination has been shown about it or that any improvement has been effected.  Mind you, the Minister has been in office 15 years, and this thing has been going on for 25 years.  The Minister now blindly refuses to talk to anyone about it.  His attitude is that he is responsible and will answer to nobody for it.  But surely certain types of appointments indicate a certain attitude of mind on the part of the Minister, and my position is that that attitude of mind may be very harmful.  There are things on the Minister's side and on my side, too, and one is a friendly population. People are willing to have the revival of Irish.  You have great goodwill amongst parents and teachers, but you must have imagination and you must have something which will show the people a vision.  As the poet said: Gile na gile do chonnac ar shlíghe i n-uaigneas&mdash;&ldquo;the poet saw the brightness of brightness on the lonely path&rdquo;. A great many people ten, 20 and 50 years ago, and later still, saw a particular brightness in the path before them and it gave them solace and enjoyment: it gave them great joy indeed in their lives, but what is being done in a great many schools is that the vision is being obscured, so that the pupils cannot see the vision at all. What the Minister needs is to see whether he is on the right road, where he is travelling to&mdash;as we say in Irish: &ldquo;Dá mbeadh fios againn bheadh leigheas againn&rdquo;.  If we knew what was wrong we could effect a cure.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the Minister is that the moment anyone says a word to him about the whole business he thinks he is being personally attacked.  He is not being personally attacked, but people are entitled to doubt whether his policy is the right policy.  The Minister is foolish, to put it no further than that. Instead of discussing the matter to be discussed, he falls back on debating <Col N="536" /> points.  I would like the Minister to consider the whole matter from that point of view and to let us know something about the position of Irish teachers in vocational schools and what he expects them to do: whether he feels that there is any enthusiasm outside the paid teachers for the Irish language.  If there is not, the situation is very bad indeed.  I would like him also to tell us what kind of teaching there is at the summer courses for Irish teachers.  There are other points about the whole question generally that I could deal with, but I would like to have that particular point cleared up if I may.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether, in accordance with the etiquette of the House, I should intervene at all in this discussion.  Perhaps the proper thing would be to leave the matter entirely to Senator Hayes and to the Minister.  I, however, cannot help rising to make some comments on some of the remarks that have been made by Senator Hayes.  I admit, at once, that I do not know what the position is in Dublin.  Perhaps the picture that Senator Hayes has been painting for the last 20 or 25 minutes is the correct one with regard to Dublin, but I have no hesitation in saying that, as regards a great deal of the country outside Dublin, he has not represented the position as it really is.  One would gather from his remarks that Irish is somehow or another being forced down the necks of both teachers and students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I remarked on the Second Reading that not enough pressure was being exerted to bring Irish into its proper place in the vocational schools. I repeat that statement.  It is not that too much force is being used or that too much energy is being expended to get Irish into the schools, but that, in fact, not quite enough is being done to give the Irish language its place in these schools.  I happen to be a member, for a great many years now, of a county committee of vocational education.  Not alone am I a member of the committee, but I am fully aware of what goes on at the meetings and fully aware of what the committee desires in regard to the <Col N="537" /> language and in regard to vocational education generally.  I am familiar with the results achieved in the schools because, not that I wish to do it, but for many years past at the express desire of the committee I, in company with the colleague in the university&mdash;the lecturer in education &mdash;go around each year to every one of these schools.  In that way, I have an opportunity of judging the work done in them.  I have an opportunity each year of interviewing hundreds of the pupils who have been attending these schools.  I am expected to evaluate their work and their answering in what&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;is a rather stiff examination, and to report back to the committee on their work.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is any committee in Ireland that is more strongly in favour of the use of the Irish language than the committee of which I have the honour to be a member.  One thing I have no hesitation in saying is this: that the use of the Irish language for teaching purposes in the Gaeltacht, in the Breac-Ghaeltacht or in the Galltacht has not, by any means, interfered with the standard of education in these schools.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying that the boys and girls from schools like Ballinasloe, Mountbellew and Portumna, doing their work in the Irish language to whatever extent they do it, and doing their examinations wholly in the Irish language, can acquit themselves just as well as the boys and girls from the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  I do not think that the boys and girls of East Galway are particularly gifted, but they are very industrious and they attend to their work well.  It is clear that teachers and parents are interested in the students and in the work, but I think what is typical of East Galway is typical of the rest of the country, granted that the officials and the teachers take as much interest in the pupils as do the officials and the teachers in County Galway.</P>
    <P>One would think, if this campaign of forcing the language on teachers and pupils were such as Senator Hayes suggests, that it would be difficult for us to get teachers at all.  As a matter of fact, in County Galway we are in the <Col N="538" /> happy position that, generally speaking, we have no difficulty in getting teachers, except, perhaps, in one subject, and that subject is rural science. Anybody interested in the problem can easily see why there is a dearth of teachers in rural science.  It is because of the immense competition there is from various sources for the services of graduates in agriculture.  I can assure you, however, that the fact that these teachers will be expected to teach in Irish in the Gaeltacht or in the Galltacht, does not deter them from seeking employment with our committee. This year, in spite of difficult conditions obtaining during the harvest and well after the harvest season, we were in the happy position of knowing that the numbers of pupils registered in our schools and classes showed a considerable increase.  Surely, the new pupils coming in must have known of this tyranny of the Irish language, and it does seem strange that they have come into our schools and classes in such numbers.</P>
    <P>Sometimes one hears comments on the work done in the vocational schools.  People will have to remember this with regard to these schools, that there are two types of pupils attending. I have tried to designate these two types.  For want of better terminology, I described one set as being of the examination type and the other set as being of the non-examination type. You will get boys and girls who will show excellent results in penmanship, in spelling, in memorising poetry and prose, and you will get other boys and girls and, no matter what you do with them, you cannot get them to do much more than reasonably write and spell. But put the boys to the bench and they will acquit themselves most creditably.  The work they will do at the lathe, at the anvil, with the plane, is nothing less than astonishing after one or two years.  That same type of boy, if he goes out and is asked to write a letter or spell and does not acquit himself as one would like, will be immediately branded as being a dunderhead or, what is most unfair, it will be held that the school is not doing the work it ought to be doing; in other words, that the school is failing. More than likely the reason ultimately <Col N="539" /> will be that the pupil got most of his instruction in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the qualifications of teachers.  We discussed that the last day.  I have a pretty good idea of what a graduate in commerce is expected to know and is expected to do at the end of his course.  I have a pretty good idea what a graduate in arts is expected to know and to be able to do at the end of his course.  I know the value of the work.  I only wish that the public in general and the business community in particular would realise, just a little more than they do, the immense asset these graduates would be to them if they but used them.  But, whether in business or in teaching, I am satisfied that for this particular work of vocational education something more is required than we are able to get in the universities.  Senator Hayes indirectly indicated to us what he would consider the ideal teacher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a long story, would it not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, Senator Hayes indicated pretty clearly what he considered would be an ideal teacher and he went on to indicate what he would consider an ideal textbook. So far as I know, the efforts of the Department in the last five or six years have been directed to obtaining, as far as is humanly possible, that ideal teacher that Senator Hayes would wish us to have.  They have been given special courses&mdash;sometimes long courses, eight or nine months, while there were other courses lasting six or seven weeks&mdash;covering subjects such as rural economics, local history, archæology, how to study and evaluate local customs, the importance of folklore, the importance of collecting it and how to collect it.  They have been given instructions in the value of the drama, how to encourage it, how, even granted they are not all excellent producers, they may make a reasonably good job of producing a drama.  They <Col N="540" /> have been instructed as to the importance of a feis or an aeridheacht and how to set about organising one. Surely, these are most commendable activities, and surely any graduate coming out with a primary degree or with masters' degrees, intending to take up teaching in vocational schools or classes, must be the better for instruction and guidance in subjects of that kind.  Perhaps Senator Hayes's difficulty is that we have not gone far enough towards achieving the ideal, but at least we can say truthfully that a good deal has been done; a good deal has been attempted and achieved to make available as suitable a type of teacher as it is possible to procure, everything taken into consideration. It is not that we have not been trying to do it.  But the difficulty is that we have not achieved as much as we should like to achieve.  If that is Senator Hayes's difficulty, then I am at one with him.</P>
      <P>I should like to correct him on one point.  He says that these teachers are expected to go out and organise lectures. Part of their extra training is the organisation of lectures suitable to rural areas and also suitable to urban areas.  He indicated that the teachers did not get anything extra by way of remuneration for having to undertake these extra duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are entitled to some monetary encouragement, and the results of the encouragement held out to them are certainly something as to which I feel very happy.  I have attended many of these functions&mdash;exhibitions of arts and crafts and art exhibitions&mdash;organised by these teachers.  I have attended drama organised by them.  I have attended lectures organised by them. There is no doubt whatever but that they are entitled to our best thanks for what they have achieved and what they are achieving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes wonders whether these new teachers are really getting anywhere in their work.  I think it is true that, wherever the newly trained teachers &mdash; these specially selected teachers, men and women, who have <Col N="541" /> been selected and sent on for this special training&mdash;have gone to work, their classes are a success beyond all question.  If numbers indicate anything, certainly from the point of view of numbers they are a success.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes wonders what is being done in Dungarvan; what is being done in Ring.  I do not know.  But, if the areas with which I am familiar are typical of the country, this then is what is being done there in the schools and in the classes, and the classes are a very important aspect of the activities of vocational education committees. In the rural districts, Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht, such subjects are taught all over the year as knitting, wicker-work, spinning, dyeing, cookery, art, the drama, literature and rural science and, in many instances, woodwork.  What more would one wish to make available to the rural areas?  If there is anything wrong, if there is any deficiency, it is this&mdash;I think I said it on the last occasion&mdash; that the people do not half realise what is available to them.</P>
    <P>There is only one other comment I wish to make.  It is one which we cannot very well debate, but I wonder is it true: that the Irish language was not of significance in the days when crafts and industries reached a very high state of perfection and commercial importance in Ireland.  It seemed to me rather strange to hear the remark that the craftsmen, the tradesmen, in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were men who would have done their work through the medium of the English language.</P>

      <P>Craftsmen in particular. I cannot let it go, because I had taken it perhaps for granted always that Irish was the language of these craftsmen, and I refer to the craftsmen in particular.  What is important is this, that their technical skill was so great, their industrial efficiency was so great, that the only way to defeat them, the only way to destroy these craftsmen and their industries was by the promulgation of laws of the most severe kind forbidding them to practise their crafts and forbidding the country to take part in any export involving their products.  The only reason I have for referring to it is this&mdash;I would be glad to think that Senator Hayes never had intended it&mdash; that the Irish language was not a language suitable to discussion of matters in which craftsmen or technicians would be concerned.  I would say that the weight of history is against him on that.</P>

I did not speak about teaching through the medium of Irish doing anybody any harm.  I never said one word to-night which indicated that the teaching to anybody of anything through the medium of Irish was doing any harm.  It is a favourite device in debate to change step.  It is not a debate on teaching through the medium of Irish that I want, although I could play a very fair part in that kind of discussion if I chose.  Neither did I speak about the Irish language as a suitable or an unsuitable medium for the discussion of anything.  I did not say anything about it&mdash;not one word.

      <P>I did not suggest in any shape or form anything about the suitability of the Irish language for discussing certain things.  I did not say anything about that at all. What I did say was that the Irish language is the language of a rural civilisation, and so it is.  Of that there can be no doubt whatever.  That there were craftsmen, and excellent craftsmen, who spoke Irish, there can be no doubt and there are some excellent craftsmen who speak Irish yet.  I was in the house of one of them as late as September, 1946. He had a very fine house, which he had built himself and he had fixed up a miniature Shannon scheme behind it, <Col N="544" /> so that we had electric light&mdash;13 miles from Macroom.</P>

      <P>Not near a town or village.  He explained it to us, that is to General Mulcahy, myself and Cormac Ó Cuilleanáin of University College Cork, in the Irish language. So that I am not quite so foolish or inexperienced as Senator Ó Buachalla might desire to make me out.  I never said anything about the Irish language and craftsmen.  It is far easier to teach carpentry in the Irish language than to teach philosophy, for example, if we were going to discuss that, but I do not want to discuss it.  The Irish language was spoken in towns, of course.  There were complaints made &mdash;you can find them in the State papers&mdash;of the Irish language being gaggled by the good citizens of Dublin but the Irish-speaking people were never supreme in any town&mdash;that is true I think&mdash;and what we call urban civilisation to-day is something in which the Irish language never played a prominent part.  If you want to learn Irish to-day you must learn it in the country and if you are the kind of person who does not hit it off with country people you cannot learn Irish. Is not that true?</P>

      <P>That is my opinion. Senator Ó Buachalla, on the last occasion when he was discussing this matter, said, I think, &ldquo;Ní thuigeann Micheál Ó h-Aodha an scéal seo,&rdquo; which meant I did not understand this whole thing at all.  Perhaps I do not but I have used a few languages besides English as media for teaching. You can learn the French language anywhere.  You can learn it in the country.  You can learn it in the town. You can learn it in the parish priest's house, in a Jesuit's house, in an atheist's house, anywhere you like. You can pick your company.  If you want to be really good at the Irish language you must be the kind of man that can sit down in a country kitchen, and if you cannot do that, you cannot <Col N="545" /> learn Irish.  What is the good in telling me?  Do not I know?</P>

      <P>I desire to express my whole-hearted approval of the intelligent and intelligible analysis made by Senator Hayes of the whole system and to associate myself with the request he made for information as to the qualifications of the teachers who are considered qualified to give instruction even to such Irish-speaking university graduates as are not considered qualified to teach in vocational schools if they have not a Ceárd Teastas.</P>
      <P>While I have no doubt that instruction through the medium of Irish may be fruitful in many places there are cases that I know of where such instruction to the material that forms certain classes at vocational schools would be absolutely useless.  In some towns vocational school classes are made up partly of children, or adults, who never put in a complete year's attendance in a national school and very many of whom leave the national school without getting the primary certificate.  Some form of examination is held before these pupils are put into classes in the vocational schools but I do not know how they can be classified with the other pupils who are sufficiently advanced to receive the instruction that is provided for them in the curriculum of vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a point made by Senator Ó Buachalla, if I understood him correctly, that jogged my memory as to an incident that occurred in Co. Mayo many years ago during the term of office of the first National Government. Senator Ó Buachalla, stressing the efficacy of instruction through the medium of Irish, made the point that children who answered the papers in Irish, as a result of their answering, secured very high marks.  I hope I have not misunderstood him.  I was a member of a primary scholarship committee very many years ago.  We were analysing the results of an examination held for the purpose of awarding scholarships from primary to secondary schools and it was pointed out by the secretary that a large proportion of the failures were in geometry.  One member of the committee was a national <Col N="546" /> teacher who had three or four candidates in for the examination.  He pointed out that the candidates from his school answered the papers through the medium of Irish and that they all passed.  That observation made several members of the committee sceptical as to whether the marking had been <i>bona fide</i> or not and a resolution was passed asking that the papers, in English and in Irish, be submitted to a sub-committee set up to examine the marking and that pending the report of this sub-committee the matter would be left open.  The reason for that resolution was that many members of the committee were of opinion that the children who answered the geometry paper through the medium of Irish were passed even though in many cases they had not proved a proposition whereas those who answered through the medium of English were failed because perhaps they had omitted to quote authorities for their deductions. The reply received from the Department of Education was that they could not submit the markings.  The matter was left there and since that there are many people of the opinion that the marking was not fair.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of manual instruction by vocational teachers, I know cases where the instructors are capable of teaching through the medium of Irish but who do not do so because their pupils would not be able to profit by it.  In such cases a discretionary power should be left with the teacher who, after a short time in any particular centre, will be able to decide whether instruction through the medium of the Irish language or through Béarla would be more fruitful. It would appear that one of the essential qualifications of executive officers, and teachers especially, responsible for the administration of vocational schemes, is ability to organise social functions of an Irish-Ireland kind.  I thoroughly agree with Senator Hayes that there are very many people who are 100 per cent. effective in the organisation of such functions but not quite so effective as teachers, and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I have often to deplore that the enthusiasm for Irish study that was evident many years ago is not so <Col N="547" /> marked to-day.  Anything that can be done to restore enthusiasm would be worth any money spent on it.  I believe that much could be achieved by the expenditure of a little money. I think a splendid idea was put forward by Senator Hayes&mdash;and I am sure the Minister will give it very serious consideration&mdash;in suggesting that records should be made of the native tongue as spoken by many native speakers who are fast dying out.  These records will live whereas without them, there will be no evidence after these old people have died out, of how the language was spoken by people who naturally and habitually used it.  With the aid of such records it would be possible to instruct pupils, some of whom had never an opportunity of hearing a native Irish speaker, to speak the language as it was spoken when it was a living tongue.</P>

Rinne sé casaoid i dtaobh cáiliochta na ndaoine insna cúrsaí seo atá ar siúl do mhúinteóirí Gaeilge&mdash;cúrsaí samhraidh a thug sé orthu, ach do réir mar is éol domsa tá ceann acu ar siúl faoi láthair agus bhí ceann acu ar siúl ar feadh an chuid is mó den bliain, sé sin an príomhchúrsa a bhí ann chun daoine a oiliúint agus cáiliocht a thabhairt dóibh a theastódh uathu chun bheith ag múineadh sa cheardscoil.

Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an ceart aige in aon chor. Ní dóigh liom gur ionann múineadh Fraincise nó múineadh Gearmánaise i gceard scoil i nÉirinn agus múineadh Gaeilge i gceard scoil i nÉirinn.  Ní <Col N="548" /> hiad nithe céanna atá i gceist, ní h-iad na cuspóirí céanna a bhaineann leis an dá rud agus ní dóigh liom gur leor an múineadh céanna.</P>

    <P>Tá gearán ag an Seanadóir Ó hAodha gur ualach é sin ar mhúinteoirí na Gaeilge seachas na múinteóirí Fraincise.  Is ualach é, ach is rud ar leith múineadh na Gaeilge sa cheard scoil ná fuil i múineadh na Fraincise.  Sé mo mheas ar an scéal nach múinteoireacht amháin dualgas iomlán na ndaoine sin ins na ceard scoileanna, nach múinteoireacht Gaeilge mar abhar ar leith é agus gan bacaint le haon rud eile.  Caithfidh na múinteoirí dul i measc na ndaoine agus na rudaí is ciall agus is cionnfháth leis an obair ar fad a thaispeáint dóibh.  Raghadh sé sin i bhfeidhm ar an mac léinn agus bheadh an múinteoir <Col N="549" /> mar shaghas easbuig nó timire nó fear creidimh.

    <P>Thagair an Seanadóir do nithe eile agus is fírinne cuid de&mdash;ach bhréagnaigh sé é fhéin, nó sháraigh sé é féin sa chuid eile dá chuid cainte.  Do mhol sé teagasc béaloidis agus staire a bhaineann le nithe a mhíníonn gluaiseacht na Gaeilge agus na fáthanna atá le múineadh na Gaeilge, agus teagasc faoi ghnó agus saol na tuaite; ach ina dhiaidh sin dúirt sé arís go gcaithfear claoi leis an nuashaol agus go bhfuil deire leis an sean-shaol.  Táimid ag dul go mór i dtaithí, dúirt sé, ar shaol nach ionann agus sean-shaol na tuaithe é, le saol ná baineann le sean-oideas agus le sean-nós.  Is baol gurb í sin an fhírinne.  Do bheinn go mór i bhfábhar dul níos mó agus níos mó leis an nuachas agus leis na gluaiseachtaí nua atá ag pobal na tíre faoin dtuaith agus insna bailte móra.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin chomh soiléir dúinn nach foláir go dtuigfear sa Roinn é agus go ndéanfar beart dá réir.</P>
    <P>Maidir le héifeacht na Gaeilge agus úsáid na Gaeilge mar mheon teagaisc, sin seana-phort go bhfuilimid tuirseach de.  Is baolach liomsa go bhfuil ana-chuid daoine a chreideann go bhfuilimid ag ropadh na Gaeilge síos scórnaí na ndaoine.  Is truagh ná fuilimid.  Níl ann ach go bhfuilimid ag gabháil le leith-scéal ar bith chun múineadh na Gaeilge a chur ar leaththaoibh. Níl an tiomáint ann a bhaineann leis an mBéarla nó leis an Laidin.  Níl aon chuid den tiomáint sin laistiar den Ghaeilge.  Níl an tiomáint sin againn in aon phioc de shaol an phobail agus ní bhaineann sé le ceist an Oideachais amháin.  Tá sé i saol na nuachtán, i saol na hEaglaise, san saol sóisialta agus mar sin.  Is mar a chéile iad go léir.  Sin í an fhírinne agus is truagh gur mar sin atá.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teagasc a déantear trí Ghaeilg, tá rud ná tagartar dó, agus is rud é atá fíor i 90 faoin gcéad de na cásanna a luaitear.  Ní múintear Gaeilge ná ní múintear trí Ghaeilge, má tá cúis le luadh ina choinnibh sin <Col N="550" /> in aon chor.  Aon duine a dheineadh iarracht duine a theagas trí Ghaeilge nuair ná fuil an teanga san aige, bheadh sé ina amadán.  Níl mórán amadáin ins an Tigh seo&mdash;i gcursaí múinteóireachta, go háirithe.  Tá fhios againn ná bíonn an Ghaeilge á brú ar dhaoine nuair nach féidir a leithéid a dhéanamh agus ná bíonn teagasc trí Ghaeilge nuair nach féidir leo glacadh leis.  Níl a leithéid i gceist.  Ní féidir é dhéanamh agus ní déantar é, ach tá sé ina phaidir Domhnaigh ag a lán daoine gur mar sin atá an scéal.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an Roinn ar cearr insna nithe sin, do réir mar a thuigim-se na rialacha, agus níl aon mhi-réasúntacht na mí-thuisgint ag gabháil leo.  Má tharlaíonn go ndeineann duine amháin a bhotún, ní ceart an tigh ar fad ná an institiúid ar fad a cháineadh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>From a slightly different angle I should like to make a comment or two on this section.  The Minister is seeking under the section to increase the rate which may be levied for vocational education.  From anything I have heard the Minister say, he apparently is satisfied that the expenditure on vocational education is justified because local authorities are to be authorised to levy a higher rate for this purpose from the date of the passing of this Bill.  Such rate may be included in their estimates for the coming year. I expressed dissent from that point of view on the Second Reading.  I have considerable experience of the operation of the vocational scheme and I think that seven out of eight of the members of the committee with which I am associated have doubts about the efficacy of the scheme as it is, not that there is any want of enthusiasm on the part of the people entrusted with the operation of the scheme.  Why is that? I have heard other people with much <Col N="551" /> less experience, who are very enthusiastic in their advocacy of the scheme. I heard Senator Ó Buachalla to-day, enthusiastic, it not in voice, at least in language, as to what was being achieved in the county in which he is a member of a vocational committee. I do not think anybody in this country would grudge the spending of more money on education provided they are satisfied that we are going to get value for that money&mdash;that, in other words, we are going to improve the mind and the skill of the people who attend these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask Senator Ó Buachalla now, in view of what we heard from him about the success of the vocational scheme in Galway, not only in arts and crafts but in the efficiency of the teaching, from the point of view of the way it is imparted, through the medium, I take it, of Irish, is there any evidence in that area of an increased vitality in the language movement or in the general life of the community?  I have often tried to think out why it is that the thousands which we are spending in every county every year on vocational education is not showing better results.  I should like to ask any Senator who has the responsibility of being a member of a vocational education committee, why it is we cannot see more work as a result of what is being taught in our schools either in the woodwork and carpentry classes, the domestic science classes or the engineering classes?  Why is it that in the lives of our people there is not more evidence of the tuition which these students have received for the last 25 years?  Would anybody suggest that in any sense life is more virile or is growing more virile as a result of this teaching?  I do not think so.  There is, on the contrary, more evidence of decay and weakness.  I challenge Senator Ó Buachalla to deny that four-fifths of the boys and girls who passed through these schools in County Galway during the last 25 years have now left the country.  The same thing is happening in my own county.  That is really what is happening all over the country.  Because that is happening under our eyes, we see no evidence whatever of a greater <Col N="552" /> number of craftsmen in the community as a result of the teaching in these schools nor is there any evidence of an improvement in the general life of the community, as a result of the number of girls who have passed through the domestic science classes.</P>
    <P>Are we approaching the problem properly if we do not try to discover why we are without evidence of results from the hundreds of thousands of pounds we have been spending throughout the country?  That is the position in my own county and in the counties adjoining.  In my opinion, that is one of the great disabilities under which the revival of the language is labouring.  We are losing a great deal of our youth and vitality and there is not the enthusiasm left to go on with the job.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for finding fault with the teachers.  In my experience, they are sincere and earnest. Ninety-five per cent. of them put their backs into the job and give honest service.  If our plan of vocational education is as fitted to the needs of our people as we claim it to be, why is it that, in so many of the classes, half the pupils drop away when half the session is through and that some of the classes have to be closed before the end of the session?  Those who have experience of the administration of the vocational scheme must concern themselves with these problems. I do not propose to get into any discussion as to the effect of our methods regarding the Irish language in our classes, or on our classes, but recently it is becoming more difficult to secure the services of trained domestic science teachers.  That is the experience of vocational committees and I suggest that that is due to the standard recently set by the chief inspector in education.  I shall not pursue that topic further but I suggest that it is a matter which should be inquired into.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made to-day what I think was the finest contribution I have yet heard regarding the future of the language in the schools.  I find fault with Senator Ó Buachalla to this extent: I think that his attitude of mind is a much greater menace to the future of the language than the <Col N="553" /> attitude of Senator Hayes.  I do not say that in any personal way and I should like Senator Ó Buachalla to realise that.  I think that nothing goes further to defeat a cause than having people who espouse it trying to convince themselves that it is winning success all along the line when it is obvious that the contrary is the fact.</P>

      <P>If I had to accept a judgment as regards the right lines along which to proceed with regard to the future of the language, I should take Senator Hayes's judgment before that of Senator Ó Buachalla.  I do not think that Senator Hayes is any less enthusiastic for the language than Senator Ó Buachalla.  It is well that that should be remembered because the language movement will not succeed by dividing its forces.  I think that Senator Ó Buachalla does the cause an injustice by being too complacent. I have contact with national teachers and vocational teachers. Some of these national teachers went off at their own expense, when they were receiving very small salaries, in the early days of Sinn Féin, to <Col N="554" /> Connemara and other parts of the Gaeltacht for periods of two or three years in succession and, when they came back, were the standard bearers of the language movement.  All these teachers with whom I come in contact, although still enthusiastic, have their doubts about the future.  The greatest cause of their doubt is the attitude of persons like Senator Ó Buachalla who refuse to see facts, who will not recognise that, despite the years of endeavour and despite the fact that thousands of boys and girls have come out of the national and vocational schools with Irish, there is little evidence of the language in the lives of the people and less enthusiasm than there was 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the experience of Senator Ó Buachalla is in this connection but, in my county, we could fill a field with a feis 25 years ago whereas to-day you would not get as many people at a feis as you would have at an inter-parish football match. If you did not organise a football match or some similar attraction in conjunction with the feis, you would have nobody at it.  Senator Ó Buachalla cannot pretend not to observe these facts.  If you observe them and deny them to yourself, is not what I say true&mdash;that you are standing in your own light?  I do not want to introduce into this debate anything but the spirit introduced by Senator Hayes and continued by Senator Ó Buachalla, An Seabhac and other speakers.  I say that a very difficult and complicated psychological problem has to be faced by those who are enthusiastic about the language.  I do not think that the attitude the Minister has taken up here in previous debates on this subject will make for an increase of enthusiasm for the language or for a greater knowledge of it amongst the people.  I suggest to Senator Ó Buachalla that he take a lesson from Senator Hayes, have the courage to readjust his views, face the facts and get others who think like him to do likewise.  We should then be on the straight path for a new effort to revive the language.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to speak until I had heard Senator <Col N="555" /> Baxter.  He spoke about the number of people leaving the country.  Evidently, he thinks they will not come back.  Therefore, he thinks we should stop all education.</P>

      <P>That is the only meaning of his statement.  We should have no primary education, if that is so.  We should not educate people at all&mdash;all education must stop because there is a danger that people will go away and that the money spent on them and the teaching given to them will be lost to the country.  That argument applies equally to primary and technical education. A great deal of money is being spent on the teaching of Irish in the primary schools and it has to be admitted, I think, that many of the young people do not keep up their knowledge of the language when they leave these schools; but there is one class of people who do not lose what they have been taught in the primary schools&mdash;those who go to the technical schools.  I know a good many technical teachers and they are a very fine body of men.  Every one of them I have met is a most enthusiastic Irish speaker and they organise debates in Irish on various subjects and do everything in their power to spread a love of the language.  In that way, they do tremendous good for the language and I would say that these people must spread their enthusiasm amongst the young people whom they teach.  I am quite certain that they elevate these pupils and give them a love for the language and for their country, and it would be a great loss if we were to depart from the system which has been adopted.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Buachalla was puzzled by some of the statements made by Senator Hayes and I myself did think he said something like this, that it would be easier to teach a technical subject through French than through Irish.</P>

      <P>I may mention, as Senator Hayes has spoken of an excellent book in French, that a book has been written by Senator Ó Buachalla called &ldquo;Bun-eolas na Trachtála&rdquo;.  I do not know if Senator Hayes has read the first volume of it.  Five volumes have been completed, I believe, but only one has been published.  That book deals with banking, insurance, office work and all sorts of technical subjects, and if any teacher has any difficulty in teaching a subject in the technical school, all he has to do is to read that book.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a vocational committee for years, I was very much impressed by Senator Ó Buachalla's remarks, but was more or less saddened to hear of the great results achieved in his county because I thought the committee of which I am a member was the best in the country. I am not ashamed to say that the vocational committee in my county and the work achieved by it has been truly wonderful.  We have been so impressed by the value of these schools and the purposes they serve in bringing education to the youth of the country, so long neglected under the old régime, that we have built, in a few years, six or seven large schools in different centres.  The committee decided unanimously that, no matter what lengths they might have to go to in order to economise for the protection of the rural ratepayers who have to foot the bill, and who are finding it very difficult to do so, there must be no economies where the education of our people is concerned. I subscribe to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla may be surprised to hear, in view of his eulogies of the work done in his county, that of the scholarships offered to the pupils of vocational schools in this State a few months ago, two were secured by pupils in rural parts of my county.  Both the pupils got first place in all Ireland, one in arts and crafts and the other, a girl, in <Col N="557" /> domestic economy.  We have sent away quite a number of girls, giving them generous scholarships for instruction in domestic economy, and, before their term in the schools had been completed&mdash;I think it is a year &mdash;all these girls had secured remunerative employment for themselves.  We felt that we have been so successful in settling in decent employment so many of these young girls to whom many avenues of work were not open that we increased the number of scholarships.</P>
    <P>As a committee, appreciating the great services these schools render to the country and the advantage taken of them by the pupils and realising the good work done by them through the reports of inspectors, we decided at our last meeting&mdash;in a purely agricultural community, a purely dairying community, where the industry is rapidly declining&mdash;that, in spite of the severe hardship involved for those who have to provide the funds to maintain these schools, at a distance of six miles from each other so that the whole county would be studded with these magnificent schools with beneficial results to the rural community. I have been a strong supporter of that policy, because of the results achieved by the teachers and the pupils.  I do not expect the system to be the acme of perfection. Nothing human is and we have to look at things as they are.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I raised at the county council recently.  We have been giving a number of scholarships to farmers' sons, purely agricultural boys. These boys, having passed through the primary school and having secured their honours leaving certificate, won some of our scholarships.  Some of them went into Hospital and others went to a very great school in Cork, the name of which I cannot recall at the moment. A number of others went to Mountbellow. All of them did well in the national school and were able to do the leaving certificate examinations through our scheme of scholarships. The tragedy that I am up against is to try to find employment for many of <Col N="558" /> those boys who did an excellent course in our schools.  Within the last six months I had one of them with me.  He is a fine-looking lad, nearly six feet in height.  He is a great chap socially, quite typical of our race.  I should add that he did a course at the Albert College. He is at home now and can get nothing to do.  He has not the price of a packet of cigarettes.  I am trying, and I regret it, to get him away to join the Royal Air Force.  He asked me to do that for him.</P>
    <P>What I want to ask myself is this: Are we, as members of the county council, acting fairly to the ratepayers, and justly to those boys, by putting them, so to speak, on the rails, sending them a certain part of the journey with nothing ultimately at the end for them?  Would it not be better if the ratepayers' money could be used in some other way to produce more tangible results for those boys?  The point that I want to draw attention to is that many of those boys, when they get a technical training, go back to their homes.  We know that most farmers have large families.  Their aim is to educate their eldest sons, if possible with the help of scholarships, so that they may be equipped to go out into the world and earn a living for themselves. As I listened to Senator Hayes and Senator Ó Buachalla speak Irish, I felt almost ashamed that I am not able to speak the language as they can. Yet I think nobody here can deny that there is not that spirit of co-operation between the teachers and pupils for the spread of the Irish language that there was 25 years ago.  In spite of all that is being done for Irish in the schools, I am afraid it must be admitted that the standard of education amongst our boys and girls coming out of the primary schools to-day is not comparable to that which prevailed in our day in the national schools.</P>
    <P>I myself have reared a family of six. Three of them have got professions. One is a priest, and although they were taught Irish in school and, of course, had to do it for their matriculation examination, I have never heard one of them speak a word of Irish in the house.  The position was quite different 25 years ago.  There was great enthusiasm for the language then.  One <Col N="559" /> heard the children speak it on the streets coming from Mass in the mornings. We have a very good attendance at the domestic economy classes, the arts and crafts classes and the social science classes in our vocational schools, but there is one drag on the work of our committee and on our teachers, and that is the Irish class. That is the position in the County Limerick, a county in which we have one of the finest chief officials in the country.  We have on our committee a great enthusiast for the language&mdash; the Very Rev. Canon Thomas Wall, a clergyman who, as Senators know, received very special attention from General Maxwell about 30 years ago. The greater part of his sermon at Mass on Sundays is in Irish.  He, with other enthusiasts in the county, got together and planned a scheme for the promotion of Irish such as they thought would produce the results that Senator Hayes alluded to.  They got from amongst our teachers one who had the fine characteristics of being a good teacher and a good organiser.  After a great deal of effort and labour, that sub-committee hammered out a very good scheme. They submitted it to the committee. One of the suggestions was that one of the teachers should be set specially apart to do organisation work on behalf of the language throughout the county.  The idea was that the boys and girls in the different centres should be got to attend continuation classes in Irish in the hope that something of the spirit that prevailed 25 or 30 years ago for the spread of the language would be aroused.  The committee was prepared to contribute its quota from public funds for the carrying out of that work.  The scheme, which had been carefully thought out by Canon Wall and the other members of the sub-committee, was submitted to the Department of Education and was turned down by it.  I believe the information we got was that we were a little bit premature.  That sub-committee was of opinion that a scheme such as theirs was necessary if the language was to be saved.  Nobody can deny that interest in the language revival is on the wane.  There is condemnation for it on practically every <Col N="560" /> lip.  That particular scheme was submitted not once or twice but I think three times to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The members of the committee were very much disturbed because it was turned down, especially in view of the praise bestowed by the Department on the general work done by the committee throughout the county.  The committee has done magnificent work for vocational education in the County Limerick.  It is prepared to build not six schools but 26 schools so that we would have an educated and enlightened democracy able to stand up against the materialism and the Communism that is everywhere spreading throughout the world to-day.  I stand behind all the magnificent work that is being done by that committee.  As I have said, the one thing that is a drag and a failure so far as the work of the committee is concerned is the Irish language which is in rapid decay.  That is the position in our county despite the fact that the members of the committee are prepared to discharge their duties and that they recognise that education is necessary for the peace, prosperity and success of the whole nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that many points that have been raised by Senators could be more appropriately related to the Second Reading of the Bill.  In my opening statement I tried to give a brief history of the development of vocational education since the Principal Act was passed in 1930.  I made a comparison with the position before that and referred to the recommendations, and some of the observations, of the Commission on Vocational Education. I referred to the work that is being done in the schools under different headings.  In the case of continuation education, I pointed out that the Department had issued memorandum V.40 in 1942 to the committees, outlining the aims of continuation education and explaining the methods which should be adopted to further it.  I referred to rural education and the work in the rural schools and I pointed out that a memorandum had also been circulated in 1944, dealing with the teaching of rural science.  I also referred to the work in the rural centres and the <Col N="561" /> night classes and I mentioned that at the present time the great difficulty was to find accommodation.</P>
      <P>Apparently, the citizens of Dublin and Cork are not of the same opinion as some of the speakers in this debate who, I believe, are in a small minority, but whose opinions, since they are expressed here and are destined to find publicity in the Press, may give the impression that vocational education in this country is not succeeding as much as it ought to.  It is quite true that some of the points that Senator Baxter mentioned, such as the fact that the attendance is not compulsory and that parents apparently have not sufficient regard to the advantages of having pupils attending complete courses for periods of two or three years, operate against the success of the scheme in particular areas.  It is also a fact that what can be done is limited because, if we are to have permanent centres in school buildings, these are expensive and will be far more costly to erect in the future.  By the time they are equipped suitably for practical work&mdash; woodwork, metal work, domestic economy, rural science&mdash;and staffed with competent teachers who have to be paid good salaries, the costs will be high in proportion to the number of students who can be dealt with, since there is a limit to the number of pupils that a teacher can handle for practical work.</P>
      <P>I think sufficient has been said to show that there is another side to the picture.  But when I hear the veracity &mdash;because it seems to me that is really what is in question&mdash;of Senator Ó Buachalla questioned; when I hear it alleged that the Senator is obsessed with some particular fads or fancies; when people question an experienced educationist like himself, who has the advantage not alone of holding a university post, but who has gone right through the mill in the vocational education organisation, where he was teaching for a long number of years and gained a knowledge that few in this country can have; when I hear his <i>bona fides</i> questioned, I really do not know whether we are not absolutely wasting our time continuing a discussion of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to discuss vocational education <Col N="562" /> let us at least try to learn something about it.  Those who say they are members of committees have the advantage that they can visit the schools. They have some acquaintance with administration.  They attend the meetings, even if they do not visit the schools, and perhaps they have an opportunity of expressing an opinion. Sometimes one wonders whether they visit the schools and see the work carried on there and appreciate the difficulties. Everyone knows that in order to secure educational results, certain difficulties have to be surmounted. That is true of vocational education as well as of other types of education.</P>
    <P>Since Senator Ó Buachalla went on the staff of the University and became a prominent member of the Galway Vocational Education Committee, his colleagues in the Irish Technical Education Association, which represents committees throughout the country, thought sufficiently highly of him to make him president of that organisation. I know he was not merely president in name; I know he took an active part in dealing with such matters as how much more could be done for agricultural education through the medium of the vocational schools; I know he was interested in all these things.  It is unnecessary for me to refer to the work he has done for the Irish language.  Leaving that aside, on the economic side, on the side of training for business and industry, there, again, he had a special qualification.  During the time he was on the council of that association, he has been in frequent contact with the officers of my Department and with myself regarding the policy generally in vocational education &mdash;the different branches of the work, the qualifications of teachers and, in particular, the practical training for industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge the valuable advice and assistance I received from him and from his colleagues. If his opinion, or the opinions of others&mdash;or perhaps my own opinion, if I had the temerity to repeat what I said in my opening statement&mdash;would be questioned, as most likely it would be, as that of a person who closes his eyes to the facts and, when he visits schools, or interviews representatives <Col N="563" /> of vocational education, executive officers or teachers, he is so much occupied with one particular side of the matter that he cannot have regard to any other aspect, it might be no harm to quote the opinion of an outsider about our schools.  When I am asked by Senator Hayes to give, in addition to what I said in opening the Second Reading debate about the development of vocational education, the justification for and an account of the purpose of vocational education, I think it might be sufficient for the time being if I read this letter:&mdash;</P>

    <P>J. Dulanty, Esq.,</P>
    <P>High Commissioner for Ireland,</P>
    <P>33 Regent Street, S.W. 1.</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Dulanty,</P>
    <P>Over 30 years ago, I was an inspector of technical and secondary schools in Ireland (Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction) at a time when, apart from the County Boroughs of Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Limerick, technical education was just beginning in the urban areas and only known in the rural areas by the device of itinerant courses.</P>
    <P>I have lately returned from a sojourn in Éire where I was able to visit the technical schools in Dublin, eight urban centres and five rural centres, in Counties Dublin, Louth, Kildare, Wicklow, Carlow, Leix, Kilkenny and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Most of the ground which I covered was very familiar to me because I was in charge of the North Leinster district for some years between 1906-1913.  It may, therefore, be of interest to you, and (may I suggest it?) to Mr. de Valera, if I were to draw briefly a comparison between what was in operation in technical instruction in those days and the truly astonishing progress which is being made at the present time. (I may lay some claim to be in a position to do this because, until I retired from the service of the <Col N="564" /> L.C.C., I occupied the position of senior inspector of technology in London).</P>
    <P>The outstanding differences between the provision for &ldquo;further education&rdquo; in Éire in those days and now are first and foremost the vocational centres which have been built <i>ad hoc</i> all over Ireland (Éire). There are 150 of them at the present time; and, I understand, another 100 to be built; so that eventually the whole countryside will be so equipped that no student will have to travel more than five miles in order to avail himself or herself of this form of essential education.</P>
    <P>When this has been accomplished, I doubt whether you will have any superior in Europe in this respect, and I am sure that you will have few equals.  These centres are well designed for their purpose, admirably lighted both naturally and artificially, well heated; efficiently equipped and under the control of well qualified teachers.  The centres, too, have large plots attached in which instruction in vegetable growing, flower shrubs, trees and fruit growing is being followed, and there is room also for experimental plots for testing seeds, grasses, etc.  The instruction in the centres is well devised to meet all the needs of those who live and work in the country districts and cannot fail, when it is put into practice in the home, farm and field, to raise the standards of comfort and production everywhere; indeed, I noted a marked difference in the appearance of the countryside since I worked in Ireland&mdash;though I must add that I saw the beginnings of this during other visits which I have paid since I left your country.</P>
    <P>In the urban areas&mdash;large and small (e.g., Drogheda, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Enniscorthy, New Ross, Naas and Newbridge), the most significant change was the replacement of adapted buildings in which we worked in my time, by <i>ad hoc</i> schools, built to meet specifically the occupations in which the inhabitants are engaged.</P>
    <P>Here again the schools are well lighted and heated, well equipped and under effective control.  I got <Col N="565" /> the impression also that these places had become (or were in the process of becoming) the centres of civic, commercial and industrial activities and that they exhibited a progressive attitude towards possible expansions of their resources.  Clearly there is some wise and far-seeing leadership directing all their efforts.</P>
    <P>Dublin I knew well at one time from an educational angle, both the borough and the county; the School of Domestic Science and the Rathmines School of Commerce are both in the forefront of progressive technical education, and the improvement made at Bolton Street (an institute of which I was not proud in my own time) filled me with admiration.  The building of junior day schools (e.g., Cabra and Marino) appeals to me especially; they will relieve the congestion in the senior institutes and so enable these to meet the expansion in technological education which is becoming more and more insistent in every progressive country in the world.</P>
    <P>I am resisting the temptation of writing at greater length on the advances you have made in Éire, but I think that this must be of interest to you, coming as it does from an Englishman who can never be sufficiently grateful for the courtesy, kindness and consideration (and for the friendships he made) which he received while working amongst your countrymen.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) BERESFORD INGRAM.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As regards the question of courses for Irish teachers, the position, as those familiar with the vocational education schemes will know, is that a very large number of part-time teachers of Irish have been employed by vocational education committees.  The position during the old days was that these teachers were men who had been working in the Gaelic League as teachers or organisers.  They were native speakers and enthusiastic organisers and they came in under the vocational education scheme.  Some of them were better equipped educationally than others; but there could be no doubt about their knowledge of the Irish language, their <Col N="566" /> experience of the work, and their enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>With the development of Irish in the schools and the fact that the pupils now coming into the vocational schools have, of course, a knowledge of Irish, both spoken and written, that was not possible under the old régime, it is quite clear that these pupils must be dealt with in a different way from that which was common formerly.  The position then was that the Gaelic League classes, or classes like them, could cater very well for students who had little or no knowledge of Irish themselves. We are now in the position that students coming into the vocational schools are equipped from the primary and, in some cases, from the secondary schools, so that a higher standard is necessary and better qualifications from the teachers who are to deal with them.  It would have been unfair not to give these teachers, although they were only part-time, an opportunity of dealing with the new situation.  There was also the fact that the finances of our committees were limited.</P>
    <P>The object of this particular section is to enable the committees to raise sufficient finances to cover immediate developments.  Some of the committees, as I have explained, were not able to carry on.  A number of them had reached their maximum rating, but, nevertheless, they were unable to meet their obligations to our satisfaction.</P>
    <P>In order to utilise the teaching staff to the best advantage, the chief executive officer and the committee naturally have to try to find teachers who are capable of dealing with more than one subject.  It would have been an economy certainly and a concentration of teaching power if the Irish teachers were able to deal with some other subject as well as Irish.  That was not always the case.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the matter of making Irish as far as possible the spoken language in the schools and of encouraging it as a medium of intercourse and as the language of the pupils and staff meant that we should give as much attention as we possibly could to giving these part-time teachers necessary opportunities and facilities, if possible, of meeting that situation.  Therefore, <Col N="567" /> there were quite clearly a number of cogent reasons why we had to endeavour to provide facilities for these teachers, and it was with a view to enabling them to equip themselves better and to deal more satisfactorily with these issues that we organised these summer courses.  For those who were already teaching we had annual courses and, if we found, after these courses and after prolonged trial, that the teachers were still unable to satisfy the requirements of the inspectors, we had reluctantly to inform the committee that that was the case.  Where we felt that the teachers could adapt themselves to the new situation and could improve their qualifications and their methods, we tried to do everything possible to assist them.</P>
    <P>Finally, we reached the position that we decided to have a special course for Irish teachers to replace the older ones who were going out.  We advertised in the Press and invited university graduates in particular to apply, and we determined to appoint about 20 new teachers each year.  These teachers were not alone to teach Irish but to do as much as possible to help Irish within the school in intercourse with the pupils and to try to do the kind of work that the University College here in Dublin, for example, had in mind when it appointed a special officer to try to encourage the use of Irish amongst the students.  As Senator Ó Buachalla has stated, allowance is made and there is no question of putting an extra burden on the teacher. University graduates were free to attend that long course, and I think we had a number of them.  Later on, the university authorities intimated that in order to secure the certificate in Irish which is necessary for vocational teachers, they would be glad if their graduates were permitted to attend these summer courses and we allowed them to do so, although the response was not very great.  The subjects taught are Irish, the grammar and idiom, the sounds and structure of the language, and some knowledge of how to deal with drama, claisceadal, Irish music and Irish dancing.  In the longer courses, when we have to <Col N="568" /> train teachers from the beginning and are not dealing with those already in the service, there is a more extended syllabus in Irish, in the branches I have mentioned, as well as more specialised instruction in dealing with Irish classes, Irish music, organising debates or lectures in Irish, and social functions.  I feel strongly that, particularly in the rural vocational schools, it is necessary to have a social atmosphere, to make it the centre of rural life, if possible.  People complain that there is not sufficient social amenities in the country.  The rural school should provide, not only the ordinary continuation education and agricultural instruction as far as possible, for adolescents and adults, through rural science classes or discussion groups, but it should pay special attention to the cultural side.</P>
    <P>Folklore is dealt with in these extended courses and Irish history, and the teaching of Irish songs, Irish music, Irish dancing, Irish history is not divorced from the background of understanding and appreciating what way our people live and the way they lived in the past, and to all that that connotes.  But to deal with some of these matters requires a good deal of attention and advice from museum or folklore authorities and that advice is got when these courses are being given and specialists are brought in to deal with these special subjects.  When the teacher goes out to teach, if he wishes to give special attention to folklore or to archælogy, I am sure the Department of Education and the directors of our national institutions in Dublin will be prepared to co-operate with them in getting together libraries of books and specimens and, if necessary, show cases for the purpose.  I do not know whether I heard Senator Baxter aright or not when he seemed to suggest that there was some difficulty in getting domestic science teachers who are properly qualified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is hard enough to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand, he was inclined to blame the chief inspector of vocational education for this.  It may <Col N="569" /> be of interest to Senator Baxter to know that practically all the girls who attend the courses for domestic economy instructresses get honours in Irish in the leaving certificate before they enter these courses and before they are awarded places in the college they have to satisfy us on that point, and they also have to show that they have oral Irish of a very high standard.  There is not the slightest difficulty, from their point of view, in following instruction in Irish should such instruction be made available but in any case when the course is finished, practically every single one of these girls acquires the Ceard Teastas and has not the slightest difficulty in getting it.  It may be that they may not be quite as fluent in Irish at the end as they were coming in to the college direct from the secondary schools.  If they were native Irish speakers or practically native Irish speakers or had attended schools where they did all the work through Irish, they would naturally have been highly qualified but at any rate there is nothing whatever in the Senator's point, and no foundation for it.</P>
      <P>The Department is quite prepared to co-operate with committees like the Limerick or Galway committee that have schemes which they feel will foster and extend the use of Irish in their areas.  The scheme put up from County Limerick showed that the committee were taking an earnest interest in this matter.  We did not entirely agree with them but that does not mean that we do not realise that, with such splendid Gaels as An Canonach de Bhall responsible for the scheme, it had possibilities.  I hope the points of difference between us may be got over and that the scheme will ultimately be put into operation, or a scheme like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Galway has submitted a proposal that old Irish speakers, seanachaidhthe, could be brought more in touch with vocational schools and, of course, where there are centres in Gaeltacht areas or areas adjacent and where old Irish storytellers are available, who are native speakers and who have a certain reputation in this respect, we will be very glad if it is possible to work out a scheme by which we need not wait to hear them on gramophone records, which would <Col N="570" /> be a very good thing if it could be done but which is not very easy to accomplish. There are various difficulties in the way.  Wherever there is a vocational school in a position to have a seanchaidhe come in, who has a fund of Irish folklore and stories, we will be quite prepared to try to bring the scheme into operation.</P>
    <P>I have referred briefly to the main points that were raised.  The point mentioned by Senator Ruane, of which I have no knowledge, and of which I got no notice, seemed to refer to primary scholarships and I do not know that it was relevant at all, if I may say so, to this discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an extraordinary capacity for ignoring the simple facts.  He devoted quite a good part of his speech to praising Senator Ó Buachalla, Senator Ó Buachalla having already devoted a good part of his speech to praising the Minister. That is very interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit; it is very natural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very natural but I would like to say that nobody questions Senator Ó Buachalla's veracity and nobody questions Senator Ó Buachalla's <i>bona fides.</i>  I am quite sure Senator Ó Buachalla speaks in good faith, and I am sure Senator Baxter is satisfied that he is quite <i>bona fide</i> and quite veracious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is possible to look at the facts and not see them and it is possible, as everybody knows, to take a particular set of facts and to draw conclusions from them which are not justified and it is possible to deceive yourself.  Senator Ó Buachalla and the Minister know the Irish proverb that says: &ldquo;Is mairg an ní deimhin dod' dochais,&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;the man that thinks that what he hopes for is certain is to be pitied,&rdquo; in other words, that we should not indulge in wishful thinking.  We are indulging in a great amount of wishful thinking, and wishful thinking will not give us a good system of vocational education or restore the Irish language.  No amount of twisting of what people say so that <Col N="571" /> what Senator Baxter said is interpreted as a reflection on Senator Ó Buachalla's veracity or <i>bona fides</i> is going to be of any importance or going to make us a bit farther on than we are.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not tell us&mdash;I asked him; perhaps it was not fair to ask him off-hand&mdash;who the people were who teach in the longer courses or in the summer courses for teachers, the people who produce, according to Senator Ó Buachalla, the ideal teachers.  I do not know why it is that we should have such peculiar ideas about the Irish language, as a strange phenomenon, because it certainly is not that.  I have some experience of teaching French, while I am not one of the educational experts that the Minister recognises, and I have some experience of languages, and I know that the Minister is endeavouring to solve a problem, which is an educational problem, a problem of psychology, of the people's mentality, by methods which can never bring him to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>If what the Minister says and what Senator Ó Buachalla says were true&mdash; and Heaven knows I would like it to be true&mdash;then there would be no problem at all.  What struck me when I heard Senator Ó Buachalla speaking and when I heard the Minister speaking was that everything is for the best in the best possible of Irish-Ireland worlds.  Those of us who are adults, who have been living in this country for 25 years, who have seen our own families and the families of our friends reared up, who know what we hoped for in 1922 and what we see about us now, know that it is not true.</P>

      <P>No matter what marvellous results are supposed to be achieved in Galway or any other place, the truth is that the methods that are now being employed are unsuccessful and the attitude of mind that says you must have more pressure is a foolish attitude of mind.  I am casting no aspersions on anybody's <i>bona fides</i> or on the veracity of anybody but the Minister in thinking that all is for the  in the best of all possible worlds <Col N="572" /> is deceiving himself and you are not at liberty to deceive yourself about an important national matter.  There is no doubt at all that you cannot accomplish these things without taking certain steps.  The Minister told us, for example, that where a seanchaidhe is available he is brought into the schools.</P>

      <P>As they say in Irish, is it not a strange thing that it is only in 1947 we thought of that?  Is it not an extraordinary thing that there are such difficulties about making gramophone records?  I think a scheme for making gramophone records was put up 12 years ago&mdash;before the war&mdash;and I do not know what the difficulty at present can be.  If you have not money to do it, of course that is a great difficulty but I feel that certain of these people who deal in sound producing would do it and do it at a reasonable price.  I am perfectly certain that such a scheme would pay greater dividends than a great number of other schemes employed in connection with the language. The same remarks apply to the difference between the teaching of Irish and the teaching of French.  Anybody who wishes pupils to acquire a competent knowledge of French must teach them something more than the irregular verbs.  He must first interest his pupils by telling them something about the French people and the French outlook.  I recommended to the Minister as an instance of what might be done, a particular type of French book, which describes village life and country life in France, going the whole round of the year, with illustrations.  Would it not be possible to use the same type of book in connection with the teaching of Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We have that kind of book.  We have a rural reader in the senior classes in the primary schools which is published by Gills.  If we want to go further we have the excellent <Col N="573" /> pamphlet issued by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have seen the reader mentioned by the Minister but I do not think that reader approaches the book that I have in mind which is used in connection with the teaching of French.  What is really worse than any omissions of the Minister is the extraordinary attitude of mind of the Minister in which he persists in attributing to anybody, who does not praise or agree with him, a lack of <i>bona fides.</i> One would imagine that I was particularly interested in persecuting the Minister.  I am not interested in any such thing.  I am interested in this matter as a person who knows this subject, who has taught in every variety of school the Irish language and a Continental language, who has seen children growing up in his own house and in his friends' houses, and who is able to assess in 1947 what is the progress we have made.</P>
      <P>It is because I think we have not made sufficient progress that I want the Minister to take thought and see whether he could not get a better system or what seems to me to be a better system.  I have been challenged with showing the white flag, but who could show more of the white flag than the Minister by his attitude?  Senator Ó Siochfhradha said that if we could get new methods we ought to use them, but the Minister's attitude is that nobody can tell him anything about a new method, about the making of gramophone records or anything else. There could not be a more defeatist attitude than that, that we cannot get a better method&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister persist in treating me as an enemy? I do not know.  I am not an enemy of the Minister.  I am one of those people who have advocated all the time that the Department of Education should be regarded as something outside Party politics, but the Minister constantly adopts the attitude he has adopted to-day.  When a certain number of <Col N="574" /> national teachers put up a certain report to him he pretended first that it was not there and then he told us in this House that the people who framed it were either incompetent or unenthusiastic. If the national teachers are either incompetent or unenthusiastic, then again we are defeated.  It seems to me that the attitude of the Minister is an extraordinarily wrong-headed one.  He takes the attitude that nobody can advise him and that he will not take advice from anybody here.  That is certainly a defeatist attitude.  He says that the methods that were outlined before he was responsible for them are correct.  Remember he was not responsible for the Principal Act and, by implication, he has praised friends of mine who were responsible for the Principal Act.  I should like to see that Act worked to the best advantage. Senator Madden praised the Act and I am prepared to praise it, but with certain methods employed in the working of schemes under that Act I cannot agree.  While I cannot put myself on the same pedestal as Senator Ó Buachalla in this matter, I do meet teachers and inspectors and I do meet parents and the product of schools all over the place.</P>
      <P>I am able to talk to them and I am able to understand them and I certainly disagree with the Minister that all is for the best.  Apparently the Minister's attitude is that we cannot do anything about it.  If he is right, then the fight is lost.  Most emphatically, the fight is not won.  I do not object to any adjective the Minister may use in reference to me but I do tell him that he will have to take more thought and he will have to use other methods before he attains the success which he and I desire to achieve.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the exercise of his powers under Section 37 of the Principal Act and Section 3 of the Amending Act of 1944, the Minister shall not require <Col N="575" /> a committee to make provision for instruction in any particular subject or subjects until such committee has been given an opportunity of considering the reasons which in the opinion of the Minister make the provision of the subject or subjects appear to be desirable and necessary.</P>
    <P>This amendment was suggested by Section 3 of the 1944 Act which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The powers of the Minister under Section 37 (which relates to deficiency in supply of continuation education or technical education) of the Principal Act shall include and be deemed always to have included the power to require a vocational education committee to make such particular provision as is mentioned in the said section for the supply of continuation education or technical education in any subjects which he may think fit to specify and require, and such requisition shall be deemed to have been made under and in accordance with the said section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Without reading Section 37 of the Act of 1944, it may serve if I say that it simply gives a general power to provide for continuation or technical education. No objection was taken, and no objection is likely to be taken, to that general power given to the Minister, but this section, which gets away from the general and down to particular subjects, formed the subject of a debate at a meeting of the Standing Council of the Irish Technical Education Association at the time the Bill was passing through.  The following resolution was then unanimously adopted, on the proposition of Very Rev. Canon Feeley, seconded by Very Rev. Canon MacBranain: &ldquo;That the Minister be asked to give an assurance that, before an Order is made requiring a committee to make provision for instruction in any specified subject or subjects, the Minister will consult with the committee concerned.&rdquo;  That is a body representative of all shades of opinion and that resolution was unanimously adopted on the motion of two prominent members of the council.</P>
    <P>A feature of the whole system of vocational education which has always <Col N="576" /> been admired is that local initiative is invited and that the co-operation of local bodies with the Department of Education is always assumed to be necessary for its complete success.  This section provides that the Minister may himself, without any consultation, require a committee to provide for particular subjects.  That is a thing to which exception can reasonably be taken and it seems to be out of harmony with the spirit which is presumed to prevail in connection with the administration of the system.  For those reasons, which I think are sufficient, I ask the Minister to accept the proposals in the amendment which I have read.</P>
    <P>They will not interfere with the final power of the Minister.  The amendment simply asks that the body concerned be supplied with the reasons for requiring that provision be made for a subject.  It would follow that, if that body should take exception to a particular subject being specified, they would submit their own reasons to the Minister for urging that the subject was not necessary for local purposes. If the function of the local body is to have effect at all, the chief executive officer and the members of the committee should be in a position to state whether particular subjects are necessary or not in the interests of the locality.</P>
    <P>I am merely asking that some organised procedure be adopted so that, before action is taken under this section of the 1944 Act, the body concerned, which will have to bear the responsibility, financial and otherwise, of the carrying out of the Minister's Order, may be consulted and given an opportunity to state their objections, if any.  We might consider the case of a subject such as French being specified and the local body being of opinion that it was not necessary.  I do not say that that is likely to happen; I am taking it as an extreme case.  In my own recollection, there was a case where inspectors, without consulting even the chief executive officer, directed that certain subjects be included in the time-table for certain schools.  I do not want to particularise or localise but I ask the House to believe that that happened <Col N="577" /> not once but on several occasions. There is a theory that the inspector works in co-operative spirit with the local authority.  We find, generally, that the inspector has the final say in the long run and that, if you do not carry out his views, it subsequently leads to little difficulties and, perhaps, creates friction.  In order to avoid those things, the lover of peace will adopt the suggestions made, even though convinced that they are not desirable and may even be objectionable. This is merely a tactical sort of approach to the subject and one calculated to secure the goodwill of the local body concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the necessity for this amendment.  Under the Principal Act, the Minister has power, where he considers that a vocational education committee is not making adequate and suitable provision for the supply of technical education in its area, to require it to make provision for the supply of such education as he may think fit, having regard to the resources of the committee.  The case, therefore, which Senator O'Reilly makes against this provision can be made against the provision in the original Act.  The annual scheme drawn up by the chief executive officer, in consultation with his committee, is, generally, the subject of consultation with the inspector.  If any difficulty arises&mdash;I am not aware that any difficulties have arisen but Senator O'Reilly says difficulties have arisen&mdash; surely the proper course is to appeal to the Minister.  I assume that the Minister will not take action to compel a committee to provide either additional courses of instruction in particular subjects unless he has good reason.  He has regard to the resources of the committee and the work they are doing and he would not attempt to impose his will upon them without going into the matter very carefully with them in advance.  If the association felt that there was a point for consideration in the matter, I do not recollect that they brought it to my notice.  I do not think that it is necessary to repeal the provision of the Act in this regard.  It would be as logical to repeal the provision of the previous Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> It may be asked: Why is this power necessary?  It may happen that a particular subject, regarded as of educational importance, is not sufficiently provided for.  In that case, I think we ought to have power to ask the committee to examine the question and see whether they could not make provision for it.  I, certainly, would not compel the committee to take action unless I felt that there were very good reasons for doing so.</P>

      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is no question of the repeal of any section.  It is simply a question of an addition.  There is a suggestion that something should be put into the Bill exactly similar to what the Minister has stated would normally be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be quite certain that I understand the Minister's reply.  The Minister first objected that this amendment had the audacity to suggest altering the Principal Act.  Of course, it does.  It suggests altering it, as I understand from the mover, because there have been certain defects which time has shown. I understand from Senator O'Reilly that a body which is extremely representative passed a resolution in the form, or substantially in the form, of this amendment and I am willing to assume that a body of that nature would not have passed it unless it had been shown by the working of the Act that there had been occasions when subjects had been imposed upon a local committee without due consultation with them, of which they disapproved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that the problem is considered, as I understand, by him and his chief inspector and that, with the aid of their knowledge and a little extraneous inspiration from other sources, they come to a conclusion.  I understood the Minister to say, and I am sure it is so, that, in matters where they are not sure, they take some <Col N="579" /> trouble to communicate their views to the local committee.  But such a resolution as has been referred to would not have been passed unless there was a feeling that the local committees were not sufficiently consulted.</P>
    <P>If there is one thing of which I am perfectly certain it is that, in any form of education, and more especially vocational education, unless you consult the wishes, the needs and possibly even the unreasonable prejudices of the locality with which you are dealing, you will not get the best result out of the tools you are employing.  If the attitude is taken up, which one finds unfortunately so prevalent that everything must be decided by the Minister and his Civil Service, without going, and going humbly, to the people in the locality who know the needs, I think we are heading for a wrong system of education.  It is the people in the neighbourhood who know where the shoe pinches.  They may not know how to make the shoe right, but at least they should be consulted as to where the shoe pinches and what they want to be done in order to make the shoe easier.</P>
    <P>While I had an absolutely open mind when this amendment was being moved, I must confess that the reply of the Minister on this occasion, as indeed on others, made me feel he was not on very strong grounds, because he was taking the line that it should be decided by him and his inspectors, without adequate consideration of the individual needs of the individual locality and the individual committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator misconstrues what I said.  I said that so far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am sure any other Minister would be in the same position&mdash;I would not consider for a moment compelling a committee to provide either for their continuation education generally or for instruction in a particular subject, without consulting in the matter and having regard to the reasons they would put up against the step.  Surely the Senator heard me say that.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has not any great objection, I do not see why he should not accept the amendment. In my 26 or 27 years' experience as a member of a committee, I have no recollection of any conflict between a local committee and the Department's inspectors.  I must say that our experience has been that these consultations have taken place between the chief executive and the inspectors.  The inspectors attend the meetings and assist the committee in coming to decisions if the committee have difficulties with regard to the scheme, and it is only right that I should say so.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I have no knowledge of this decision.  I have been to some of these conferences, although I was not present at the meeting at which this resolution was passed, but apparently some county must have had a grievance.  I do not know the nature of it but, on the other hand, I see no fault with the amendment, and while I presume that what is in the amendment would be stated by his representative at the meeting of a committee and at discussions with the committee and the executive officer on a particular scheme, I do not know that the Minister should have any very strong objection to embodying it in the Bill.  I do not see that it would impose any hardship whatever because it is, in fact, what takes place to-day.</P>

      <P>It occurs to me that it would be only fair to explain to the House that generally, when the body referred to passes resolutions, they are passed mainly with the view that, in due course, when representatives of the association meet representatives of the Department, the matter in question must formally come up for discussion.  It would be unreasonable to say that the body in question had any fears that the Minister would attempt to impose his will on them.  I <Col N="581" /> think the idea behind the resolution was that it should be put down, dealt with and passed and automatically communicated then to the Department for discussion with the Department in order to get their views on it.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be reasonable to say that whenever that body passes a resolution it does so because it fears some tyranny of some kind or another, or feels that a particular item should be embodied in legislation.  It is only fair that the House should understand that that is the basis on which many of these motions come to be dealt with and come to be passed.</P>

      <P>The heading to this document is: &ldquo;A special meeting of the standing council was held at the Technical Schools, Parnell Square, on 1st January, 1944, to consider the Vocational Education (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1944.&rdquo;  The results of this meeting were definitely transmitted to the Department and it was a different type of meeting from the usual one to which Senator Ó Buachalla has referred.  At the annual congress each year, certain resolutions are adopted and arrangements are made some time after to discuss these with the Department concerned, but there could be no such discussion in this case because <Col N="582" /> they were simply transmitted as the decisions of that body.  I may say that, while I agree that in the normal course consultations of this kind are usual, there is always the possibility of an exception and certain very influential members of that body and of committees always felt that this arbitrary power&mdash;it has an ugly arbitrary appearance&mdash;should be modified in some way, even in the interest of the Department itself.  I have been careful in drafting the amendment to ensure that the Minister's powers are not clipped, but to give an assurance to the bodies with whom he is working that no arbitrary action would be taken.  Therefore, while ultimately it does not take away any power the Minister has at present, it would have the effect of reassuring many of these bodies.  There are certain very eminent and responsible members of committees&mdash;I could mention some on my own committee&mdash;men who occupy very influential and responsible positions who feel very uneasy about the powers in this section, particularly when set out without any qualification or modification whatever.</P>
