    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for this Bill arises because of the requirements of Article 16.2.4º of the Constitution which directs that the constituencies, as determined by law, shall be revised at least once in every 12 years.  The Constitution came into operation on 29th December, 1937, so that the 12-year period began to run from that date and is now drawing to its close.</P>
      <P>When asking the Dáil to give the Bill a Second Reading, I explained that it was desirable to implement the provisions of the Constitution in this regard without delay, because the enactment of the legislation to give effect to them would, of course, take some time, while the necessary administrative arrangements to give effect, in turn, to the Bill, would take still further time.  Since then, the by-elections have taken place and the Taoiseach has announced that a general election is to be expected early in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that the Dáil did divide on the Bill, but the desirability of holding the forthcoming election on the basis of the revised constituencies was not <Col N="1026" /> questioned at any time during the debate, and indeed a general desire, I think, was evinced that if the election were to come early next year it should be fought on the basis of the new constituencies.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the matter has, therefore, been greatly heightened, and I am asking the Seanad to help to meet the desire of the other House by making this Bill law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The principles underlying the proposed rearrangement of constituencies have been made very clear both to the Dáil, in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the text of the Bill and during the discussions on its various stages, and to the public through articles and correspondence appearing in the Press.  On the one hand, you have the requirements of the Constitution and, on the other, certain sensible rules dictated by common sense.</P>
    <P>These rules, naturally, have not the firm binding force of the constitutional directives.  As always in such matters, the claims of two or more practical criteria may conflict, and then, of course, one or more must yield to what wisdom tells us is the best.  That should not blind us, however, to the fact that these rules are dictated by the political experience of our time and the physical, social and administrative features of the State, and as a body, therefore, are almost as unavoidable as the fixed rules of the Constitution, that is, provided we accept the need for a stable but democratic Government.</P>
    <P>The first aspect of the scheme to which some criticism has been directed is the over-all number of Deputies fixed for the new Dáil.  The constitutional requirement in this respect will be found in Clause 2, Article 16, which prescribes that the total number of members of Dáil Eireann shall from time to time be fixed by law in such a way that there will be not less than one member for every 30,000 of the population nor more than one for every 20,000.</P>
    <P>The preliminary Report on the Census of Population, 1946, shows that the <Col N="1027" /> population of the State is 2,953,452.  I should say, in connection with that figure, that in the preface to the report it is stated that this figure is provisional and subject to amendment; nevertheless I think it is sufficiently definite when a unit of 20,000 or 30,000 is concerned.</P>
    <P>After full consideration, it was decided to apply the lower ratio of population in fixing the total membership of the Dáil and accordingly the membership of that House, as proposed in Section 2, was fixed at 147.  This proposal would give the next Dáil nine members more than the existing House.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this was one of the points on which criticism of the Bill was raised.  It was argued that extra expense was involved, and that the increase would go to the city areas rather than to the country.  I submit that the expense involved is inconsiderable and insignificant, having regard to the importance of the institution and of the principles involved.  In any event, it is unavoidable if the people are to be granted their fundamental right to proper and fair representation.</P>
    <P>The second argument against the increase rests, as I have sought to show the Dáil, on a misunderstanding of the true position.  The movement of the population from the country to the cities and towns, as revealed in the census preliminary return, involves that on the present basis of representation the urban dwellers are under-represented relative to the rural population. The Constitution requires that the ratio between the number of members for a constituency and its population shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If the size of the Dáil, therefore, were to be retained at its present level, or reduced, the only way to give effect to the Constitution would be to reduce the representation of the country districts, and that is a step that nobody, no matter how much he may have argued against the proposed increase, has felt able to advocate.</P>
    <P>I suggest there is no sound reason why it should be advocated or why it should be resorted to.  On the contrary, <Col N="1028" /> for the proper association of a Deputy with his constituents it is necessary that his constituency should be convenient in size, both from his point of view and the point of view of the electorate, and indeed this close association of a Deputy with his constituents is essential for the proper working of our system of representative democracy.  It is difficult enough to secure this at present and to make it more difficult in the future would.  I suggest, be indefensible.  The maintenance, therefore, of the present rural representation in the Dáil is essential.</P>
    <P>Once we accept that proposition, that is to say, that we cannot reduce the present rural representation, then, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution and indeed in accordance with the letter of the Constitution, the need to increase the size of the Dáil from 138 to 147 members becomes inescapable.</P>
    <P>The size of the new Dáil having been determined, the problem remained of dividing the country into constituencies so as to secure the best possible division.</P>
    <P>The Constitution sets two limits in this respect: Firstly, the member to population ratio is to be uniform as far as practicable; secondly, the number of members to be returned for any constituency shall not be less than three. But, of course, when we come to determine what is practicable, there are certain other factors to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>For instance, as I have already stressed, the area of the constituency must not be so large that effective representation of its inhabitants is not possible, nor should it be broken up by difficult physical features, so that sections of its population are virtually isolated from each other.  And last, but not least, the constituency should be as administratively convenient as possible. Coming to apply this last-mentioned principle to the existing system of constituencies, the first thing that emerges is that administrative convenience can hardly be claimed for quite a number of them.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the present constituencies of Wicklow and Wexford. Both of these include large portions of <Col N="1029" /> the administrative County of Carlow, so that the constituency which is at present called Carlow-Kildare only includes the remnant and not the whole of Carlow.  Other examples of such like anomalies will be found in the constituencies called Meath-Westmeath, Roscommon, Athlone-Longford, Clare, Leitrim, Waterford, and so on.</P>
    <P>The difficulties and confusion occasioned by these anomalies have moved several authorities in the administrative units concerned to protest against them and to request me by resolution to make the scheme of Dáil constituencies consistent with the existing local government administrative units.  These resolutions have been kept in mind in formulating the new scheme.  Therefore, the new constituencies have been delimited so as to be consistent, within reason and where practicable, with the boundaries of the administrative counties.  As is well known, of course, an administrative county is the functional area of a county council.  So far as the general public are concerned, there can be little doubt as to the constituency in which they are entitled to vote and so far as the officers are concerned there can be little difficulty in making the necessary arrangements to permit the taking of a poll in each constituency.</P>
    <P>In some instances because of the number of the population involved and the size of the constituency it has been necessary to sub-divide an administrative county.  In such cases the division has been made on the lines of well-defined smaller units and in rural areas invariably the district electoral division has been taken but the division has also been made in such a way that the population to member ratio will be reasonably uniform in the same county.</P>
    <P>As an example, we could have the case of County Cork, which has been divided into four three-member constituencies, in each of which the ratio is practically identical, ranging from 19,503 in Cork South to 19,936 persons per member in Cork East.  In applying this principle of uniformity within the county I did, however, advert to the position of existing constituencies and where these already existed and where they were convenient in size and there <Col N="1030" /> was no grave discrepancy between the population ratios, I did not consider it practicable or desirable to alter the boundaries of them merely in order to equalise the population ratios where the difference between them was not too great.  In making the revision, every effort has been made to keep the ratio of members to population, so far as is practicable, uniform throughout the country but it will be understood, I am sure, that this uniformity cannot be more than partial because of the wide diversities in the area, population and geographical characteristics of the different counties.  It is obvious that if the administrative county generally is to be taken as the fundamental unit, there must be variations of appreciable size between the constituencies found in one county and another.  As against this, if the constituencies were to be defined upon a purely mathematical basis so that the ratio of members to population was identical everywhere, the artificial areas so created would be difficult to clearly identify and define, and I think a great deal of confusion would be caused in the minds of the electors and a great deal of difficulty would be experienced by the officers who would be called upon to make provision for and to supervise the polling at the general election.  We would have this further consideration, that the people in the areas concerned would not be bound together by any of the affinities which constitute the essential feature of a real constituency.  I am glad to say that the Dáil fully appreciated the wisdom of adhering to the boundary of the administrative county and in this respect at any rate the scheme met with uniform approval.</P>
    <P>The final feature of the actual redistribution is the number of members allocated to each constituency.  In preparing the revision my aim was to secure as many three-member units as possible and to avoid four-member units wherever I could.  As I said before, other considerations also exist and have prevented exact uniformity of treatment in this respect as in others and, as a result, the Bill proposes that there should be 22 constituencies returning three members, nine returning four, and nine returning five, a total of 40 constituencies in all.  In no case does <Col N="1031" /> a constituency return more than five members.</P>
    <P>In the present scheme we have 34 constituencies in which 15 are three-member, 8 are four-member, 8 are five-member and three are seven-member. In the Dáil the point was made, although not pressed, that because the Bill created a large number of three-member constituencies and as few as possible constituencies of larger size, the principle of proportional representation was being abused and that even the Constitution itself was being violated.  That position is, I think, not tenable.  The single transferable vote and constituencies each returning not less than three members are what the Constitution stipulates, and these are amongst the electoral instruments which, should the Bill become law, will still be used in the general election. But we have got to remember that the Constitution has to be read as a whole and we have to have regard to the general purposes of the Constitution as well as the purpose of every Article of it.</P>
    <P>The Constitution does more than merely set up a Legislature.  It also sets up an executive organ, the Government, and for these two arms of the State to function properly something more than an Assembly which will be a mathematical replica of all shades of opinion in the country is necessary. That Assembly, besides being one of the legislative Houses, must be able to provide the country with a viable Government, one that will have the ability as well as the right to govern.  If we want to receive a sharp lesson on this we have only to look at the present condition of some continental countries where the principle of proportionalism in the Legislature has been carried to extremes.  Indeed, we do not have to go abroad for a lesson of this sort.  Our own recent history shows that on no less than four occasions since 1923 general elections have failed to give a decisive result and there has had to be a further recourse to the people for a firm answer.  The fact is that to enable it to act with authority, decision and leadership, a Government needs the support of an adequate majority in the <Col N="1032" /> Dáil.  The alternative to such a Government is coalition, which is a shifting, vulnerable and unstable body. Indeed, it may mean not only one coalition but a succession of coalitions in which ultimately the authority and prestige even of the Dáil would be dissipated by reason of the unseemly proceedings which generally accompany the formation of coalitions.  It is hoped, accordingly, that the new scheme of constituencies, with its emphasis upon the three-member constituency, will go far to secure a decisive result in favour of one or other of the parties seeking a mandate to govern.</P>
    <P>It will not have the effect of the British system of single-member constituencies and the majority vote, but at least it should avoid the excesses of proportional representation while at the same time adequately safeguarding the representative character of the Dáil.  The scheme, I readily admit, is not a perfect one, but it is the best that could have been devised, having regard to all the circumstances.  It was not possible to dispense with all four-member units, and though the five-member constituencies, of which there are nine, are not wholly desirable either, I will concede that they are less objectionable than the four-member constituencies are.</P>
    <P>The Dáil, although it formally divided on the Bill, paid a tacit tribute to it and to its fairness, in that very few amendments&mdash;and they related only to very minor adjustments&mdash;were moved. There was no amendment that proposed to alter in any serious way the boundaries of the constituencies which were included in the Schedule to the Bill and the only question of any gravity which did arise in the Dáil was the question as to whether one constituency rather than another should have four members instead of five.  So far as possible&mdash;and particularly where the major principles of the measure were not in danger&mdash;I yielded to the movers of those amendments.  Slight alterations were made, therefore, in Dublin City and County constituencies, at the suggestion of members of the Opposition, while a small adjustment was also unanimously accepted in the case of Kerry.  Again, on an open vote <Col N="1033" /> of the House, Mayo, as I have hinted, ceded one seat to Wexford.  The Seanad will, I hope, agree that I have shown that the new scheme of constituencies is fair and sound, based within the limits fixed by the Constitution and on the practical requirements of administration and of common sense.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 make the allocation of Deputies among the several constituencies in accordance with the particulars set out in the First Schedule, which also defines the new constituencies. Section 5 deems the constituency of South Galway to be the constituency corresponding to East Galway for which the Ceann Comhairle was deemed to have been elected in the Revision of Constituencies Act, 1935. Section 6 is a necessary consequential provision, whereby the register of electors will indicate the existing and new constituencies.  It also enables a new postal voters' list to be compiled in the case of a constituency not identical in name and area with an existing constituency.</P>
    <P>Section 7 defines the returning officers.  There is no real change here, but the sheriff for a county or county borough will be the returning officer where a sheriff is appointed.  In Dublin County, however, the under-sheriff will continue to be returning officer for the area approximate to the area for which he is under-sheriff.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Bill represents a consolidation of the law relating to the revision of constituencies.  In the Second Schedule, the provision of the 1923 Electoral Act dealing with the division of the country into Dáil constituencies and the entire of the amending Act of 1935 are repealed; their provisions are, where necessary, reenacted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the beginning, the passage of this Bill is very urgent, both from the point of view of the returning officers and of those who may have to make polling schemes for new areas and also from the point of view of the several Parties who may be seeking election under it.  I would be very grateful, therefore, if the Seanad could see its way to give me this Stage and, if I am not asking too much, all the remaining Stages either to-day or tomorrow, <Col N="1034" /> so that the existing uncertainties in regard to the present position may be cleared up and so that all those who will have responsibilities under the Bill may be able to take appropriate measures to fulfil them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>During one portion of the Minister's speech, when he discussed proportional representation and coalition governments, I thought that the general election had already begun, but when I considered his tone I felt that he was not on the hustings, as his tone was rather unusual for him on the hustings.  The Minister talks about the absurdity of some of the present arrangements.  The present arrangements, of course, were made by the Minister's predecessor in office and by the Minister's own Party.  In this Bill, he has reverted to the intelligent arrangements made by the previous Government.  For example, he is going back to Longford-Westmeath and removing the monstrous Longford-Athlone with ten miles of Roscommon in it.  He is also going back to Sligo-Leitrim and generally doing what his Government have done on so many occasions after a very expensive education&mdash;not at their own expense, but at public expense.  He is going back to the common sense, intelligent things done by his predecessors and for which his predecessors were covered with mud, slime and slander and told that they were callow and ignorant.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I heard the Minister aright when he said that the Constitution came into operation in . Surely it came into operation in 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is absolutely right. They were various amendments to the Constitution, one of which came into operation in 1937 by virtue of the first Constitution of 1922.  That is absolutely correct and there can be no doubt whatever about it.  The Minister is wrong in his dates and does not understand simple words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, he talks about proportional representation, from which some general questions arise&mdash;one is whether we should or should not have proportional representation.  There are arguments to be made for and against it, but it is in the Constitution&mdash;or at <Col N="1035" /> least the principle of the transferable vote is in the Constitution.  Here we are doing our best to nullify its effects. There is an argument for the British system of single non-transferable vote, but the three-seat constituency has been increased enormously in this Bill. Out of 40 constituencies, 22 are three-member, nine are four-member and nine are five-member.  Ministers themselves seem to have a preference for proportional representation in its purer form in the five-member constituencies, as they all seem to be in such constituencies except the Minister himself, who is in a three-member constituency.  I suppose it will not make much difference, perhaps, after a bit.</P>
    <P>One point ought to be observed&mdash;if they were all three-seat constituencies, there might easily be a Dáil consisting of three even parts, with all the dreadful woes which the Minister feels when he has not a majority, but we might well have outside the Dáil another Party with nearly a quarter of the votes and no representation at all. Three-seat constituencies are not as good, from the point of view of representation and workability, as the British single non-transferable vote constituency.  We are doing what has been done so frequently, producing one principle and adopting a different practice.</P>
    <P>The system which gives a preponderance of three-seat constituencies is not good in principle or in practice, nor will it achieve the mathematical result of giving adequate representation to all Parties.  My first reaction to this Bill was that we ought to discuss the general principle, but that the particular matter of the constituencies was something which was peculiarly a matter for the Dáil.  We have a constitutional right to deal with it, but it is rather a matter for the Dáil to settle its own business than for us to endeavour to settle it for them.</P>
    <P>We are going back now to 147 members for a population of under 3,000,000, which seems almost exactly the same proportion as 153 was in 1922 for the population then.  Again, the Minister has gone back to his predecessors <Col N="1036" /> and is doing what they did and about which he ranted and made the welkin ring.  We are going back to the principle of 1922.</P>
    <P>I personally have no amendment to propose and it is not clear that it is easy to amend the Bill at all.  Dublin City and County&mdash;the place I know best&mdash;is divided in a very peculiar way. Dublin County is everything from Howth to Balbriggan but not including Rathfarnham, and to call it &ldquo;Dublin County&rdquo; is like calling the Twenty-Six Counties &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; or the Six Counties &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo;.  We have got into a position where geography and nomenclature have gone haywire. Between constituencies, names and labels we have got all mixed up. Dublin County is a most peculiar constituency. The Dún Laoghaire Borough extends not far from Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County is defined by exclusion as consisting of Beann Eadair and everything that is not in the borough, which seems to me, as a Dublin man, to be a rather peculiar arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Bill is good in so far as it reverts to certain more workable constituencies than were made in 1935, for what reason I do not know; and the Bill is bad in so far as it purports to keep the transferable vote but increases the number of three-seat constituencies, which might leave an even vote for each of three different Parties and leave a fourth with no representation at all.</P>
    <P>The case for an increase in membership of the Dáil is that any given Dáil at any given moment ought to contain not only one but two Governments and the smaller the Dáil the less likely you are to have two Governments.  That is the argument, but the Minister did not give it.  I think it is the classical argument and the sound one.  Some of the constituencies are more workable than before, but the three-seat constituencies are a grave mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Bill, I would like to say that if we are to accept the principle of the greatest number of three-member constituencies which can be carved out, the Bill is very satisfactory. For my part, I want to say that while I believe that three-member <Col N="1037" /> constituencies do not give free play to proportional representation, I concede this point, that in many of our rural areas they are very much more convenient to operate than the larger constituencies.  I remember that, prior to 1935, the County Galway was a nine-member constituency.  That of course is a tremendously large area.  It makes it very difficult for a Deputy with a sense of responsibility towards all sections of the people in the constituency to keep in touch with them.  Take Tipperary as it stands to-day.  It extends from the borders of County Waterford to the borders of the County Galway, a distance of 90 miles.  That, obviously, is a case in which there ought to be sub-divisions, as there are in this Bill, making two constituencies out of Tipperary, and three constituencies out of Galway.</P>
      <P>I would like, however, to contest the view that the three-member constituency is going to give you a strong Government.  It may or it may not. As the Minister was speaking, I was making some calculations as to how the present Bill, for instance, with so many three-member constituencies, would produce a new Parliament, assuming there were only two Parties.  What would apply to two Parties would apply to blocks of Parties.  I made the calculation that the 22 three-member constituencies in this Bill could easily give you for &ldquo;A&rdquo; Party or for &ldquo;A&rdquo; Group 30 members, leaving 36 for &ldquo;B&rdquo; Party or &ldquo;B&rdquo; Group; the nine four-member constituencies could give you 18 on each side; the nine five-member constituencies could give you 23 on one side and 19 on the other.  These totals would give &ldquo;A&rdquo; Group or &ldquo;A&rdquo; Party 71 and the &ldquo;B&rdquo; Group or &ldquo;B&rdquo; Party 73.  That is not going to make for a strong Government, so that unless you can foretell what the electors are going to do in the new constituencies it is impossible to say whether the system in which three-member constituencies predominate will give you a strong Government or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it should be the desire of this House or of the other House of the Oireachtas to set themselves out deliberately to create strong Governments. All kinds of people have been in favour of strong Governments at <Col N="1038" /> various times, from Oliver Cromwell down to our own day.  I do not think that strong Governments have conferred very great benefits on the European Continent.</P>
    <P>It is not the weak Government that does the bully: it is the strong Government that does the bully at home and abroad.  I feel, notwithstanding all that is said about the dangers of a coalition, that a coalition Government in Ireland, consisting of two or three parties willing to sacrifice their individual identity for the purpose of promoting the common good, is far preferable to the kind of Government that provides a personal dominating dictatorship. That is hardly an issue, but it is an issue that was raised by the Minister.  I was utterly surprised to see that in the Dáil&mdash;not in this House &mdash;he defended his theory of strong Government by appealing to the views of what might be described as the blue-shirt sociologist.  A case is weak that wants a defence of that kind.  If that is the best kind of prop that the Minister can provide for this Bill, then he should not proceed with it, and the Fianna Fáil Party should not vote for it.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of the Bill, already referred to by Senator Hayes, to which I want to refer, and that is the manner in which the constituency called the County Constituency of Dublin is divided.  Anybody who looks at the Schedule of the Bill will find set out a constituency, known as the constituency of County Dublin, which is only a very small part of Dublin so far as population is concerned, and less than half Dublin so far as the land area is concerned. When we come to the titles of the constituencies we find such monstrosities as &ldquo;Dublin North&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;east&rdquo; in brackets; &ldquo;Dublin North&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;central&rdquo; in brackets, and &ldquo;Dublin South&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;east&rdquo; in brackets, and so on.  We find six constituencies in Dublin in which there has not been a solitary name used that would remind one of the traditions of Dublin.  The Minister and myself are in this unfortunate position that neither of us is a Dublin man, but there are members of this House who are Dublin men.</P>
    <P>There are members of the Minister's <Col N="1039" /> Party who are Dublin men and Dublin women, too, and they must feel indignant at the disappearance of such titles as &ldquo;Clontarf&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fingal&rdquo;.  Would not &ldquo;Fingal&rdquo; be a better title for the constituency which is described as the constituency of the County Dublin than the present title?  What is wrong with the old division of St. Patrick's, the first division ever to return a woman to Parliament in these isles?  After all, St. Patrick's has great traditions.  It contains a famous cathedral.  It was the constituency which first elected Madame Markievicz to Parliament. Then we have St. Michan's on the north side of the city.  We have a long list of historical titles which might well have been introduced into this Bill when selecting names for the constituencies of the County and City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that even in Stormont they have not always forgotten the historic places in the Six Counties when selecting titles for their Parliamentary divisions.  Why should we forget them, and why should we insult the people of Dublin by these meaningless titles: &ldquo;Dublin North (East),&rdquo;&ldquo;Dublin North (Central),&rdquo;&ldquo;Dublin South (West),&rdquo; when we have glorious traditions that we ought to write into this Bill, and which in that way would induce our schoolchildren to look with pride on the traditions perpetuated in our legislation?  I would appeal to the House to recast the titles, the nomenclature for the Dublin County and City constituencies.  I should prefer that the Minister would introduce amendments for the purpose rather than that any member of the House should have to do it, but if nobody else does it I undertake to move amendments for that purpose.  I am saying that with a good deal of regret, because I do not think this House ought to interfere unduly with an electoral Bill which relates solely to the other House.  I would be very slow to do anything to delay the passage of this Bill or to alter its framework if it were not for the fact that I feel very keenly that we should not allow another 12 years to elapse before making use of the opportunity that presents itself to us now of inserting proper titles in the case of the Dublin constituencies.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Senator Duffy talk about traditions and about the old names of places. Quite recently, in the case of the County Dublin by-election the main theme in the speeches of Senator Duffy and of every other group was to forget the past.  That was the main theme in the speeches of all the Opposition Parties&mdash;forget the past, forget traditions, forget services and records, and forget everything such as decency, effort and self-sacrifice.  That was the policy of the Opposition Parties in all the by-elections.</P>

      <P>In any case, I want to tell Senator Hayes, who has interrupted with his usual arrogance, that the principal theme with some of the principal Opposition Parties was to forget the past.  I do not think it makes a whole lot of difference whether the old <Col N="1041" /> names of these constituencies are retained or not.  It is a good thing, however, to remember that a very big number of the Irish people do stand for their traditions.  The future will be all the safer by doing so.  I do not know that at a time like this, when a general election is so near, that reason or sanity prevails amongst politicians in any arguments that are made when a Bill like this comes up.  A constituencies Bill, such as this, is, I suppose, accepted by all Parties because it is admitted that there are certain defects that have got to be corrected.  In the framework of the Bill we have a number of three-member constituencies, four-member constituencies and five-member constituencies.  That is done for the purpose of getting round proportional representation.  I would like to say that in my opinion proportional representation is not going to lay the foundation for this country's security in the future because it can lead to the frustration of Parties and of the people's intentions.  We have had the results of it over the last 25 years.  We have seen by experience the difficulties that proportional representation may create.</P>

      <P>We are debating the principle of three-member constituencies. That, naturally, brings in the system of voting, and the effects of that system.  It naturally brings us to what people in other countries have done in the matter of reorganising constituencies. Quite recently, in England, there was such a reorganisation and a commission was established there to study the system of voting which, after serious consideration, reported definitely in favour of the simple vote.  England is a country with hundreds of years of tradition in government.</P>

      <P>I do not care what system of voting obtains here in future, but the period is overdue in which all groups should have a common principle and should decide on a national policy which will enable the people to give the country a team, or, if you like, teams, which will be able to work together and stand firm in times of crisis, from either the internal or external point of view.  That is the fundamental to be secured and that is what the people want in casting their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that in this Bill there is an alteration so far as the legislation dealing with local Government elections is concerned in relation to the areas for which people are elected and for which they are responsible after election.  If such a principle were embodied in this Bill, it would be a considerable step forward.  The system of having three or five members representing a large constituency area, none of them being responsible for any particular area, does not lead to the service which the people are entitled to get from their <Col N="1043" /> representatives.  It leads also to misunderstandings amongst colleagues because they are all depending on the one area.  That is what proportional representation does in the case of general elections.  Quite often, these misunderstandings are more misunderstandings between colleagues in a group than as between opposing Parties and anything which can be done to avoid misunderstandings of that kind should be done.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Mayo constituency, it will be remembered that South Mayo always had five seats.  That representation was reduced to four as a result of a free vote in the Dáil.  I am rather reluctant to deal with matters affecting Dáil constituencies, but I nevertheless feel it my duty to mention that South Mayo is the largest constituency in point of area.  It extends from Achill Island on the west coast to Sligo and Roscommon in the north and to Galway in the south.  It is a very large area to work and it is not easy even for five Deputies to cover the ground in any reasonable time.  The work and the correspondence in that constituency are very heavy, and I do not know if it was wise to scoop a seat as between that constituency and another and to reduce the South Mayo representation to four members.</P>
    <P>I believe the population there has gone down, but in that connection a great deal depends on the time at which the census is taken.  It is well known that there is a large outflow of population from that county in the late spring, an outflow which returns about Christmas week, and when the census is taken at any time between these periods, a big fall is naturally shown, but, if it were taken between December and mid-March, a substantial increase would be shown and that point should have been taken into consideration. However, there has been a reduction, and I am not a bit surprised, because it is a rather remarkable fact that the five Deputies for the constituency are bachelors.  It is no wonder that we have complaints so far as population is concerned.  Of these five, I am afraid that two are beyond redemption in the matter of bachelorhood.  The Minister <Col N="1044" /> wishes to get this Bill as soon as possible and I have no desire to hold it up, but I should like to hear members of the House supporting any proposal to give that constituency its full representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal made by the Minister that the House should discuss this Bill in the minimum time is a fair one and there might be general consent to put it through as quickly as possible.  There is also pretty general consent that our function in this matter is like our function in relation to a Money Bill&mdash;we may make recommendations which we think will be improvements, but it is not a matter on which we should seriously attempt to raise a political issue, even if any of us desired to do so.  I do not know whether Senator McEllin intends to recommend a provision with regard to celibacy in the case of Dáil members. It would be extremely interesting, and, if it were practicable, I, as a married man of considerable years, would have a lot of sympathy with him, but I am afraid that, even on a free vote, it would be a matter on which the team spirit which he is so anxious to achieve might not manifest itself so obviously. I remind the Senator that, when we speak of an all-Ireland team, whether it be in Gaelic football, rugby or any other sport, we refer to a team on which there are people from all over Ireland, people representing different clubs with completely different points of view, who, when the interest of Ireland arises, play together and the man who does not join in and play the game, the man who is perhaps too individualistic, is unpopular.  I cannot see why the same team principle could not be applied as occasions require and, if necessary, to political issues, which may be somewhat more important even than winning football matches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we can possibly discuss the merits or otherwise of what is known as proportional representation. So far as my recollection serves me&mdash;I have not looked it up&mdash;the original Constitution provided for &ldquo;the principles of proportional representation&rdquo;.  Exactly what that means, it would be very difficult to argue before the Supreme <Col N="1045" /> Court.  I am sure lawyers could argue it, but I should not like to give any opinion on what the result would be. The present Constitution forgets about principles and provides that there shall be a single transferable vote and there may not be fewer than three members in a constituency.  That is a kind of concession to the principles of proportional representation, but, whatever it is, it provides that the British system cannot be put into operation here without amending the Constitution&mdash;and that would mean a two-thirds vote of the people&mdash;so that we are completely wasting out time in discussing whether the British system would or would not be a good system here.</P>
    <P>It is, however, in order and proper that we should express our view on whether it is a good thing to have a large number of three-member constituencies or to have constituencies with four or five members.  Everyone will agree that the difficulties for the individual Deputy are increased when the constituency is large.  That is one of the reasons why, so far as this Bill is concerned, the smaller constituency is not unpopular, but personally I believe it would have been very much better to have had as many five-member constituencies as possible, because, if you attempt to operate the single transferable vote, which is designed to achieve some measure of proportional representation, it can be really effective only in a five-member constituency, and when you come to four and three, and particularly three, you are definitely limiting its operation and you will not get a better result.</P>
    <P>By a better result, some people mean what they call a strong Government. When the Minister and Senator McEllin speak of a strong Government, they mean a Government which has a majority of people against which there is no danger they will vote, a Government which can, outside Parliament, decide a matter, knowing that, whereas it may occasionally make a change as a result of debate, it can force through Parliament exactly what it has decided outside.  That, I think, is what is commonly called a strong Government.  I do not want to put words into Senator McEllin's mouth with which he does not agree, but that is in many quarters regarded <Col N="1046" /> as a strong Government, that is, a safe majority.  I doubt very much if, from a democratic point of view, that is a strong Government.  It may work for a time but I am by no means convinced that it is superior to or stronger than systems which operate in some other countries.  Take the United States, which has a somewhat different system.  President Roosevelt, who was certainly a leader&mdash;I think nobody will dispute that&mdash;had to bring into consult ation, and did bring into consultation, the various Parties in Congress and made proposals, after discussion with them, proposals which he found met with general support.  To my mind, that was far stronger than if he had the British system and had been Prime Minister and Leader and had settled it outside knowing he could carry it through.  That is, of course, a matter of opinion.  President Truman has to do the same in peace time.  I think a Government which consults and reaches a more or less common agreement on important issues, particularly in times of crisis such as we have at the moment, may conceivably be a far stronger Government.  It is not as strong an Executive but it is a stronger Parliament.  I do not think that there should be undue worry as to what the result of this Bill will be.  The Dáil, for good or evil, has decided on trying three-member constituencies.  That can be attempted.  I do not believe there is anybody here, the Minister or anybody else, who really can prophesy how that is going to work.</P>

      <P>I could argue that it would work one way and someone else could argue that it would work another way.  Neither would know what he was talking about.  It would be pure conjecture. I do not know how it is going to work but I am convinced that it is not good for this country to hold out the idea that when a Dáil is elected it will not be able to govern unless some particular group, some particular team, or whatever you like to call it, is in a dominant position.  Other small countries, particularly the Scandinavian countries, from time to time have <Col N="1047" /> been governed with a very large measure of success without a dominant Government.  A Government with commonsense is not necessarily weaker because it has to consult with the members of Parliament and occasionally to give in on matters because it recognises that the elected representatives of the people are not prepared at the particular time to go with them.</P>
      <P>I am not a pessimist and even if it should transpire, as is possible and as Senator Hayes pointed out might be possible, that with so many three-member constituencies you may have no Party which has even near a majority, I would not be pessimistic about it.  I could imagine a number of things that might happen but I would not be pessimistic about it.  Sooner or later we will have to get down to the recognition that it is the elected representatives and Parliament, not the Executive, which should be the true Government of the country.  The Executive should only be carrying out, not what it forces on Parliament, but what are the wishes of Parliament taken as a whole.  In the Constitution we have provided for the transferable vote and, whether you have three-, four- or five-member constituencies, there will be a very fair measure of proportion.  As that was put into the Constitution, all Parties should face up to the fact that that will mean, sooner or later, a situation in which there will have to be a considerable measure of give and take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McEllin made some rather peculiar remarks about forgetting the past.  I do not know exactly what he meant but what I would say is, do not forget the past but do forget past differences.  It is a very different thing.  Forget the things that are not so good in the past, particularly in the recent past.  It was a pleasure to me to hear Senator Duffy, as a true Conservative, advocating that we should not forget our traditions and I would like, for that reason, to support him. Whether I shall like his names, when he does produce them, or not, of course, I do not know.  I did make the same remark, but not in public, about the Dublin constituencies.  Apart <Col N="1048" /> altogether from tradition and sentiment, people get hopelessly mixed up. South-east or north-east are not good or convenient names.  It would be very much better, even though not necessarily logically correct, to take names which are established and, unless public opinion in future went entirely against three-member constituencies, and it was necessary to increase them to five, I would rather hope that the divisions established now would not have to be very much changed. Already people are puzzled and several persons have asked me: &ldquo;Am I in south-east or where am I under this Bill?&rdquo;  It is not very easy, without a very large-scale map, to find out. Constituencies named in that way will create difficulties and I think candidates and canvassers will find it quite inconvenient.  There is a lot to be said for the names but I am afraid, at this time, it will be probably much more difficult to find names which will be accepted all round as being consistent with tradition and that in the long run we will have to leave these inconvenient, very modern and rather uninteresting names we have in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of increasing representation, I wish to point out that there is a number of people in this country who consider that there are too many representatives in the Dáil and that if representation there were considerably reduced, business would be at least as well done.  I am not saying whether I agree or disagree with that point of view but I do agree with Senator McEllin that in the present proposal to increase representation, Mayo is not being treated well, in losing one seat as a result of a free vote in the Dáil. As I think the Minister pointed out in introducing this Bill in the Dáil, in constituencies like South Mayo a big part of the population is migratory. There is no doubt that thousands of boys and girls leave Mayo periodically and return there.  They cannot be considered as exiles and it would certainly not be fair to those who left Mayo last April or May if they found on return for Christmas, and if there was a general election early in the new year, <Col N="1049" /> that they had not a vote.  I consider that the decision in the Dáil to reduce representation in one constituency and to increase it in another was rather ill-advised. Until such time as a Bill designed to reduce representation generally is introduced, I would not be in favour of reducing representation for South Mayo constituency.  It was Senator Meighan who drew my attention to that matter this evening and I think he intended to speak on it.  If anything could be done to reverse that decision before this Bill becomes law, it would be advisable to do it.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to Senator McEllin's exhortation about forgetting the past.  My views on that matter completely coincide with the views expressed by Senator Douglas but it would be too much to expect that we could forget instances where practices or customs that were considered vices under our particular Party suddenly became virtues under Senator McEllin's Party.  That would be too much to expect and I do not think Senator McEllin expects it.</P>
      <P>While I do not approve of increasing representation in the Dáil, I certainly disapprove of the reduction of the representation for South Mayo, for the reason I have given.  By the time the country decides the matter of a very much reduced Dáil I do not say that I will not be in favour of it, but, as things are, I consider that the decision by a free vote of the Dáil should be amended and I hope the Seanad will see fit to amend that particular section before this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words in relation to the Limerick Constituency. From a geographical point of view the proposed arrangement is grotesque and amounts to a mathematical absurdity.  It is unjust and inequitable.  Curly Wee and Gussie Goose would have made a better job of it.  The Minister told us that he wanted to keep the ratio of members to population as uniform as possible and also to have the thing administratively convenient.  It is proposed to give three seats to Limerick City and four to the county.  Consider that in relation to the urban area with a small added rural area and the total rural <Col N="1050" /> area called Limerick County.  The population of Limerick City is 44,000, approximately, and the population of the county is 130,000, mainly composed of an agricultural community.  Limerick County is one of the chief agricultural and dairy counties.  This division is considered equitable and in the interests of democracy, according to the Minister.  Where is the justice and equity in giving Limerick County, with a population of 130,000, three seats and giving Limerick City, with a population of 44,000, four seats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to explain to the Senator that he is entirely wrong.  There are two constituencies now in Limerick, one west and the other east.  East Limerick comprises four parts of the county of Limerick and the City of Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator told me that.  Some rural districts are about to be added.  One is Kilbeheny and one is Anglesborough.  These are 40 miles from Limerick City.  On the other hand, Ballycummin and other places, which are regarded as suburban areas, are included in west Limerick. There is grave hardship being inflicted on the people of Kilbeheny.  These people scarcely ever market their goods in Limerick City.  Their principal market is Mitchelstown, in the County Cork.  Even when a rural community of 20,000 is added to the 44,000 population of Limerick City, there is no justification for giving greater representation to the city than is given to the county.  It is not democratic.  It is scarcely equitable and I want to draw the Minister's attention to that point. If in the other House there was a proper identity of interests and a proper democratic arrangement, the ratio would be five to two.  Unless the Minister is willing to reconsider a rearrangement of these constituencies, I will be compelled, in the interests of justice and fair play and of the agricultural <Col N="1051" /> community of which I am a part, to hand in an amendment to this particular part.</P>

      <P>The Minister is anxious to get this Bill through and I have no desire to impede it.  However, I must express the general view held in Mayo over the taking of this seat.  I have no desire to challenge it in the Bill, but I believe it is wrong in principle and that a mistake has been made.  South Mayo is a very straggling mountainous constituency. It is hard for Deputies to get through it.  We have a large floating population, consisting of thousands of migratory workers and it depends on the date of the census as to whether the result will show a lower or a higher population than Wexford.</P>
      <P>I agree with the general principle, if it is carried out to the letter all over, that a certain population must have a certain number of representatives.  I accept that, if there is a general revision, but I think it has been a mistake to reduce South Mayo to three seats.  I have no desire to say anything against Wexford or any other constituency. It is a matter of principle and it is the general view I find amongst all parties.  I wish strongly to press an amendment on that point and have sent forward an amendment for the Committee Stage.</P>

Therefore, it is only right that we should discuss matters like this concerning the system of constituencies for election to the Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is amazing and amusing how we can circumvent the rule of the Chair in getting outside the matter before us.  Senator Hayes gave a bad example in some of his references.  It is not the first time I have heard him say that the Constitution enacted by the people in 1937 is not a new Constitution but an amendment of the old <Col N="1052" /> one.  Anyone down the country or anywhere else with much less intelligence than Senator Hayes will appreciate that the 1937 Constitution was not an amendment of the old one enacted by Dáil Eireann in 1922 and in which a Constitution was adopted as a Schedule to an Act.  Subsequently, it was amended 17 times by the Government which was in office up to 1931 and from 1932 to 1936 it was amended eight times.  These eight amendments were reversions of the amendments which had been passed by the previous Government in its period of office from 1922 to 1931.  In all, 25 amendments were passed to the Constitution up to 1936.  The 1937 Constitution was an entirely new document, without any reference whatsoever to what was in the Constitution previous to that.  Its Preamble concludes with the statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We ... do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no reference to anything else there.  We adopted, enacted and gave to ourselves the Constitution of 1937, independent of anything there before.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes, unfortunately, gave a bad example by reference to mud, slime and slander.  That was not a good lead to give on a Bill of this kind. Senator Duffy and Senator Douglas have difficulty regarding the compass. I have often thought and heard that to appreciate the compass and your directions in the city you have to come to the city from the country.  City people do not know the points of the compass as well as those reared in the country. Country people know the north, south, east and west, at any rate.  It seems that Senators Duffy and Douglas do not know where north-east and south-west are.  To me, coming from the country, it is quite easy.  I understand the north-east corner of Dublin just as I understand the north-east corner of Ireland.  I agree that in coming to a street you might not know exactly in which constituency the residents on either side were.  Boundaries generally run through the middle of the streets and, consequently, at the boundaries one side must be in one constituency <Col N="1053" /> and the other side in the other. It is necessary to draw a line somewhere and consequently those on one side of the street in one constituency must be in contiguity with a different section on the other side of the street.</P>
    <P>I do not see any difficulty in the definitions and I do not think that the application of historic names would bring us much further.  It might make us remember the past and the people and districts to which these names were attached, but if Clontarf were called the &ldquo;Constituency of Brian Boramha&rdquo; it would not bring us to any better understanding than when it is called &ldquo;North-East Dublin&rdquo; of which it is a portion.  Senators referred to the constituency of &ldquo;County Dublin&rdquo;, but I do not see any such constituency in the Bill.  On page 5 there is a constituency defined as &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; consisting of the Beann Eadair Ward and the administrative County of Dublin except Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  I believe it will cause confusion if you call &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; what is mainly a rural portion of Dublin with Beann Eadair, Howth and Sutton and the remainder of the rural portion of County Dublin, with the exclusion of the urban portion of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  That large portion is called &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;.  On page 4 we have several other constituencies with the prefix &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; attached&mdash;Dublin North (East), Dublin North (Central), Dublin North (West) and others.  I think the constituency I have mentioned would be far better described as &ldquo;County Dublin&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The heading says &ldquo;County Constituencies&rdquo;, but to my mind it does not make it satisfactory. If a person gets a register and sees &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; on the cover, he will not take it as referring to a county constituency but as referring to one in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the difference between the three-member and five-member constituencies means much to any Party. It gives proportional representation fairly satisfactorily.  If there are three Parties, it is easier to get one out of three than to get two out of five.  It <Col N="1054" /> does not make such an extraordinary difference and, where the boundaries are such that a three-member constituency is not appropriate, the fact of making it a five-member constituency does not make it a whole lot better, in the ideal of giving minorities satisfactory representation under the system of proportional representation as enacted in our Constitution and explained satisfactorily by Senator Douglas.</P>
    <P>The proportional representation system is embodied in our Constitution and cannot be altered without a reference to the people and a referendum. The Minister has done a satisfactory job in presenting this Bill and putting this scheme before us.  There are more three-member constituencies, but those of us interested in elections and election work will find it easier to work a three-member constituency than help in a big area, whether it be a city district or a county district.  The West Cork constituency, as it stood, went from one end of Cork to the other and was practically as far as from Cork to Dublin.  It is ridiculous to think that people would know some of the candidates from the other end of the constituency. When a district is too big, it does not give a coherence for the candidates, nor does it give such an opportunity to the electorate to know the candidates as it would in the case of smaller districts.  The greater number of three-member constituencies should appeal to most people, whether they be members seeking to be a majority or people recognising the fact that they will always be in the minority.</P>

      <Col N="1055" /> Ag tagairt don phointe a bhí ag an Seanadóir Ó Dubhthaigh, ní mór dhom a rá go bhfuilim ar aon aigne leis gur trua go bhfuiltear ag dul níos sia gach aon lá san obair phoiblí le comharthaí gan stair agus le hainmneacha gan stair a chur le teoranna na tíre.  Ní fada, is dóigh liom, go mbeidh an tír, i gcúrsaí áirithe, riartha amach faoi A.1, A.2 agus Z.16.  Mura stadfaimíd, is mar sin a bheidh ainmneacha na tíre ar deireadh.  Is trua, mar sin, ná fuil na sean-ainmneacha i gContae Bhaile Átha Cliath agus áiteanna eile á gcur i bhfeidhm san Bhille.  Bheadh &ldquo;Cluain Tairbh&rdquo; chomh maith le &ldquo;North East&rdquo;, mar shampla, nó Fingal nó Ráth Fearnain in ionad na téarmaí eile.  Ní raibh &ldquo;North East&rdquo; nó &ldquo;South East&rdquo; riamh ina n-ainmneacha ná ina gcomharthaí staire.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile a chur i bhfeidhm anseo ar leathanach a 6.  Ba mhaith liom fios d'fháil ón Aire, cad é an chúis ná fuil Contae Chiarraighe agus Contae Mhuigheó ag fáil na gcomharthaí céanna.

      <P>As we shall both very shortly, I presume, have the opportunity of speaking elsewhere I propose to reserve my reply for that opportunity and for a place where it would be more effective.  However, I can say this, that except for the few reservations which he made in relation to my remarks upon the desirability of applying proportional representation in a rational way, so that the main purpose of the Constitution will not be defeated &mdash;the main purpose being to provide the people with a Government which will be an effective Government and an efficient Government&mdash;I think the Senator was in general agreement with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy was not quite so clear in his exposition of his own position in relation to it.  He welcomed the Bill, I think, on the ground that he had no objection in principle to three-member constituencies, and then he proceeded to say that three-member constituencies would not invariably give us a strong Executive.  I do not differ with Senator <Col N="1057" /> Duffy in that regard.  I do not say that three-member constituencies will invariably give us a strong Executive.</P>
    <P>I do not think any person who is, generally, in favour of restricting the general application of the principle of proportional representation, so far as it may be done legitimately and judicially, by confining it to three-member constituencies, I do not think, I repeat, that any person who held that view contended for a moment that it would invariably result in a strong Government. We may have freak election results based on constituencies for which this Bill provides just as there have been freak election results elsewhere. But I do think that freak elections and freak results are less likely to occur with three-member constituencies than if we are going to have a Parliamentary system based on constituencies returning seven, nine or more members, or returning members for constituencies the representation of which is based on even numbers.  I do think a system of Parliamentary representation based upon three-member constituencies is more likely to get a definite decision at an election and that the country is more likely to have in consequence a stable and strong Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that experience has shown us that a stable and strong Government is necessary if the people are to have clear and decisive leadership and the country efficient and clean administration.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy said that he is against a strong Government.  He seems to regard such a Government as being something evil.  He is not alone in that view.  Totalitarians in Opposition are invariably against strong Government when that Government is democratic.</P>

      <P>We are even, now that Senator Hayes and myself have grown older and wiser.  I regret that Senator Duffy still retains the imprudence of perennial youth.  He is not in favour of anything except coalition. In fact, he said he was very strongly in favour of coalition, because he said that by coalition you have men prepared to sacrifice Party interests for the common good.  That raises a very interesting proposition indeed, because we must first ask ourselves, what are these Parties?  I take it that Parties are organisations of public-spirited men, with certain political principles and certain public aims who band themselves together to advance those aims and principles.  They band themselves in these organisations in order that they may persuade the people that their principles are sound, that the aims which they seek are for the public good and in order that they may secure the assent and authority of the people to give effect to them.  That I take it is what Parties are for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens when these Parties form a coalition?  Senator Duffy told us.  They throw their principles overboard. Having persuaded the people to vote for them on the ground of principle, then, when they succeed in securing election, they proceed, in <Col N="1059" /> order to secure themselves in office, to throw overboard the principles which they persuaded the people to accept. So that Senator Duffy's coalition might be more accurately described as a combination of men who are prepared to trade their principles for the sweets of office.</P>

      <P>I tried to point out what, in fact, is the character of the coalition which Senator Duffy and others who are a minority are so fond of.  What they are recommending to the people is that we should be governed by men who have forsaken their principles in order that they may enjoy office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Duffy and others took exception to the nomenclature in the Bill. He waxed indignant at the fact that so far as the County Borough of Dublin constituencies are concerned, we have given them the somewhat prosaic names of Dublin North (East), Dublin North (Central), Dublin North (West), Dublin South (East), Dublin South (West) and Dublin South (Central). May I say that these are practical <Col N="1060" /> names, which are as geographically accurate as it is possible to conceive them, and are not without certain local significance.  They are true and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>They relate to the great physical feature of our city, the great river which flows almost due east through it. A person looking at the constituences, as they are named in the Bill, will have no difficulty whatever in finding their approximate position.  He knows that the constituency called Dublin North will lie north of the Liffey, if it be Dublin South he knows it is south of the Liffey, if Dublin North (East) he knows that not only it is north of the Liffey, but that it is the easterly portion of the city.  Dublin North (West) is the westerly portion of the city north of the Liffey, and Dublin Central comes in between east and west.  The same applies to constituencies which are south of the Liffey.  A person, whether a voter or a citizen, who is an elector in a constituency, or even a person from the country, has no trouble in identifying a constituency by the name we have given it.  What would be the position if we were to adopt some of Senator Duffy's suggestions? He suggested that we should call that part of the administrative County of Dublin, which we have simply called Dublin, Fingal.  But surely Fingal is only one district in North County Dublin.  Why not call it &ldquo;Beann Eadair&rdquo; or any other name of equal historical interest?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But if we were to accept them I would have this objection that they would all be misleading, much more misleading than any names which we have applied to the constituencies in the Bill.  If any person reads the description of the area given in the Bill he can immediately identify it.  It will be &ldquo;the Beann Eadair Ward&rdquo;&mdash;that is perhaps something of an anomaly that we cannot cure in this Bill but which we may cure in another Bill dealing with another matter&mdash;&ldquo;and the administrative County of Dublin except the portion thereof which is comprised in the county constituency of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.&rdquo;<Col N="1061" /> At once a person who is familiar at all with Dublin knows where Dún Laoghaire is, and he knows where the old Rathdown rural district was, and he can picture for himself what is the constituency which is described as &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;.  What would be his position if we were to call that constituency &ldquo;Fingal&rdquo;, which is only a comparatively restricted area in North County Dublin?  What would spring to his mind if we were to call it &ldquo;Lucan&rdquo;, which might also be described as equally historic, or &ldquo;Tallaght&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that Dún Laoghaire is comprised in the old rural area of Rathdown?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is now, for good or ill, a definite local administrative unit there, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and it is of sufficient importance, I think, in view of the fact that it contains over 45,000 people, at least to identify the constituency of which it is going to be the major part by applying its name to it in association with the remainder of the rural district of Rathdown.</P>
      <P>Again, if we were to apply &ldquo;Clontarf&rdquo; to Dublin North (East), then why not apply &ldquo;Drumcondra&rdquo;?  When we come to the constituency which the Senator suggested might be described as St. Patrick's, what is wrong with St. Michan's, or what is wrong with Stephen's Green or with the Mansion House, or what is wrong with College Green or Trinity College?  Nothing except this, that they are not applicable to the constituency as a whole.  That is the only thing that is wrong with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I may say that we did give a great deal of consideration to this question of nomenclature.  We did try and see whether we could find suitable historical or geographical names which would not mislead people, because it is important that this Act of the Oireachtas should be clear and easily understood.  Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that, unless there was an historic name which was clearly applicable to an area, we should describe it in simple geographical terms which would be easily understood and <Col N="1062" /> apprehended by everybody and which would not mislead.  That was our problem, and that is why we have taken the four points of the compass as being directives which would be clearly understood by everyone.  I do not see that there is any reason why we should apologise, since the Almighty makes the sun rise in the east and set in the west.  We know where the sun rises and sets and we know fairly closely where we are.</P>
    <P>Senator Madden attacked the proposals in the Bill which related to County Limerick and described them as monstrosities.  He said they were monstrosities which were going to do some injustice, I think, to the rural population of Limerick.  He talked of the city as having a population of 40,000 and of the county as having a population of 130,000, and said that we were giving to the city four members and to the county only three.  Well, of course, there is not a word of truth in that.  Limerick county as a whole is divided&mdash;I hope Senators can see the map which I hold in my hand&mdash;on a line running as closely as possible due north and south through the county. On one side you have the constituency of East Limerick and on the other side the constituency of West Limerick.  It is true that the constituency of East Limerick includes Limerick City, which has a population of over 40,000.  There have been given to it four members, two of whom may be properly allocated to the city on the basis of 20,000 persons per member.  There are two to that portion of East Limerick which might be properly ascribed to the city and two to the remainder of East Limerick.</P>
    <P>In West Limerick there are three members.  What is the position in relation to the population of these constituencies? In East Limerick, including Limerick City, there is a total population of 84,000 people to whom it is proposed to give four members. That is a population ratio of about 21,100 per member.  West Limerick has a population of 58,000 to whom we propose to give three members representing a population ration of 19,344 per member, so that in fact so far from operating to the disadvantage of West Limerick as compared with East Limerick, <Col N="1063" /> we are giving West Limerick a larger representation on the basis of population than we are according to East Limerick.  The fact of the matter is that it may properly be said that out of the seven members which are to be given to the two constituencies in the administrative County of Limerick, only two can be properly ascribed to the City of Limerick while the other five may be ascribed to the rural area. As I have said, there is no foundation whatever for the criticism which Senator Madden has made himself responsible for.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that contention.  It was advanced in the Dáil but it did not appeal to the general body of the members there because <Col N="1064" /> a motion to amend these proposals in the Bill was defeated and it was defeated on good grounds.  Senators will see here on this map a black spot built around the City of Limerick and also this huge white expanse.  It was proposed to make a three-seat constituency around the City of Limerick and to leave the present constituency of Limerick virtually untouched.  That proposal did not appeal to the commonsense of the majority of the members of the Dáil.  It was defeated and I trust the proposal will not be revived here in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha agreed with some of the criticisms expressed by Senator Duffy in regard to the names of certain of the constituencies.  Well, I suppose we might have proceeded to name them with more uniformity but there was this in mind.  We could have referred to the Cork constituencies as West Cork, East Cork, North Cork and South Cork but it just did not happen that way.  We had Cork North East there already and we took it as we found it without changing it. After all, does it matter very much if we cannot find a territorial name which we can apply uniformly to the whole of these constituencies without misleading the people or creating a wrong impression in their minds as to exactly what their particular territory is?  Does it matter whether we call it Cork North or North Cork?  Possibly the latter might be associated with an old militia and for that reason it might be as well to abandon it.</P>
      <P>We have North Kerry and South Kerry.  The County of Kerry is divided into north and south by a line running from east to west.  Except we work on the principle by which Donegal was once referred to as being in Southern Ireland I do not see how we can refer to the existing constituencies of North and South Kerry as East Kerry and West Kerry.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator is under a misapprehension as far as Kerry is concerned because we are not <Col N="1065" /> altering in any way the existing constituencies there.  The administrative County of Kerry was divided into two constituencies by the 1935 Act and is divided into the same two constituencies by this Bill.  The constituencies were called North Kerry and South Kerry in the 1935 Act and we are not changing that.  We have endeavoured to do nothing that might confuse the people or make it more difficult for them to understand where they were entitled to vote and that is the reason why you will find existing names retained throughout this Bill where possible.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made that the Seanad should alter the names of some of these constituencies.  I appeal to the Seanad not to put down amendments of this sort.  In view of the fact that a general election is imminent a great many things are being done upon the assumption that this Bill will go through substantially without amendment. A great many arrangements have to be made for the over-printing of the register in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 and everything that has been done up to the present in regard to this matter will have to be scrapped and abandoned if mere changes in nomenclature and nothing else were to be made by the Seanad. In view of this consideration particularly, I am afraid I would have to go back to the Dáil and ask it to reject any amendment of this sort.</P>
      <P>Indeed I suggest that unless the Seanad feels that a great injustice is being done to the electors of any part of the country by some of the provisions of this Bill, it should not amend it at all.  On this point I would say that Senator Douglas and Senator Hayes took what might be described as the correct attitude, namely, that this was more or less on the lines of a Money Bill, which is of more concern to the Dáil.  Therefore, as the Dáil has seen fit to send it up to the Seanad in this form, the Seanad, unless it feels that some momentous proposal violating the principles of the Constitution or doing an injustice to the electors is involved, should not make any amendment of any significance.</P>

      <P>The next Order is the Superannuation Bill, 1947, in Committee.</P>
      <P>There is a recommendation to this Bill which has caused the Cathaoirleach some anxiety.  He was given to understand that it is the first case of a recommendation to a Money Bill proposing an increased charge on State funds since the Seanad was reconstituted in 1938.  While there is a discretion given to the Chair under a Minute of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in regard to amendments to non-Money Bills proposing increased charges, there is no provision either in the Standing Orders or in the Minute of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in regard to recommendations on similar lines in respect of certified Money Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach, accordingly, decided he would summon a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider the matter and that meeting was held this morning. The matter was very fully discussed <Col N="1067" /> but, unfortunately, owing to the time available, a decision was not reached. While the matter is, therefore, in a sense <i>sub judice</i>, he will not avail of the discretion which has been given to the Chair in regard to &ldquo;money&rdquo; amendments&mdash;under the Standing Orders &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo; and &ldquo;amendments&rdquo; are, apparently, interchangeable terms&mdash;and he is accordingly allowing this Recommendation to be discussed by the House.  As was clearly understood by the Committee, his action in doing so is not to be regarded as a precedent and the matter will come forward for further discussion and decision before a similar case arises.</P>

      <P>(2)  For the purpose of this section the index number shall be deemed to be not greater than an index number of 270.</P>
      <P>(3)  The provisions of this section shall have effect in relation to the payment of any allowance to which this section applies in respect of any period commencing on or after the 1st day of November, 1946.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1068" /> I should like to say that, following the discussion that took place at the meeting of the Committee to-day and the statement made from the Chair, I quite accept the view that, whatever is finally decided, this should not be regarded as a precedent, and, in moving the amendment and arguing for it, I think it right to say that I do not propose to divide the House on it.  The main reasons for the amendment were set forth fairly clearly by me a week ago. Before giving a brief resumé of these arguments, I should like to clear up the question as to what is the nature of a Civil Service pension and why it is paid. When speaking on this matter last Wednesday, I stated that, for income-tax purposes, a Civil Service pension was treated as earned income by the Revenue Commissioners, and the Minister alleged that it was so treated simply because pensioners had pressed to have it regarded as such and had obtained a concession on the point.  I am at a loss to understand where the Minister got his information.  I can assure him that it is quite incorrect.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Bill in the Dáil on the 30th October (Parliamentary Debates, column 1214) the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not a social service.  They can draw the pensions whether they are rich or poor.  We have small pensioners who have other means of income and we have large pensioners who have no other means of income.  I do not believe anybody wants us to establish a means test for ex-State servants, seeing the violent objections there are to a means test in relation to the ordinary social service payments that we make.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would seem that the Minister had no clear idea in his mind as to what is the nature of a pension or why it is paid.</P>
    <P>The principle of differentiation between earned and unearned income was not introduced into the income-tax code until 1907.  Long before that time, it was the custom of many large concerns to pay pensions to their retired employees, and it was necessary for the income-tax authorities to determine the nature of such payments. <Col N="1069" /> If they were made on philanthropic or charitable grounds they would not have been admissible as legitimate expenses in computing the profits of the concerns in question.  If, on the other hand, they were pay ments for services rendered they were, of course, legitimate business expenses, and as such admissible as proper deductions in determining the profits of the employers for the purpose of assessment.  In fact, they were always regarded as payments for services rendered and as falling into exactly the same category as wages and salaries.  How could it be otherwise? In effect, the employer said to each new entrant into his service: &ldquo;In return for your services you will get a salary of so much while you are working and a pension when you retire,&rdquo; and in this country to-day, when the Civil Service Commissioners advertise a competition for established posts in the Civil Service, the advertisement, having stated the scale of salary, invariably adds an intimation that the posts in question are pensionable under the Superannuation Acts.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Asquith introduced into the Finance Bill of 1907 a provision for granting a measure of relief in respect of income-tax on earned income there was never any question as to how pensions should be treated.  The relevant portion of the definition section in the Act was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of this section the expression &lsquo;earned income&rsquo; means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any income arising in respect of any remuneration from any office or employment of profit held by the individual, or in respect of any pension, superannuation, or other allowance, deferred pay, or compensation for loss of office, given in respect of the past services of the individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the House to note particularly that the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo; is linked up immediately with remuneration from an employment and that a pension is expressly recognised as&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;given in respect of the past services of the individual.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, a pension is a payment for <Col N="1070" /> past services and nothing else, and therefore no question of a means test arises.  When you are paying a man for services rendered you are concerned simply with the value of his services, not with the amount of his income from other sources.  The Minister himself will be legally entitled to a pension when he ceases to hold office, and quite properly entitled to it.  That is one of the ways in which the State remunerates him for his work as a Minister over a period of years.  There will be no means test attached to it, and it will quite properly be treated for income-tax purposes as earned income.  It will be earned income.  He is earning it here and now.  I hope I have established to the satisfaction of this House and of the Minister that a retired civil servant's pension is remuneration for services rendered, that it is of exactly the same nature as the salary he received during his service, and that in fact it is delayed salary and nothing else.</P>
    <P>It is clear, I think, that up to now the Minister has had no very clear conception as to what a Civil Service pension is and why it is paid.  The lack of clarity in the mind of the Minister on this point has led inevitably to a wrong outlook on the question of the Government's responsibility in relation to Civil Service pensioners.  In reply to Deputy Norton in the Dáil on the 30th October the Minister said (Parliamentary Debates, column 1212):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The position is that the State has not been able to guarantee the value of its currency in goods to any section of the community&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and later (column 1213) he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we were to step out of that particular class of civil servants (i.e., the pensioners to whom this Bill relates) and undertake to revise the basis of the pensions of civil servants who retired before July, 1940, there are lots of other classes of the community who say they have the same right to full compensation because of the increase in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He put forward the same type of argument in this House last Wednesday.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, emerges that, <Col N="1071" /> in the mind of the Minister, a civil servant who has retired on pension is aligned with the ordinary private citizen who has never been in the service of the State.  The State has certain responsibilities towards all its citizens.  Its responsibilities towards its own former employees is no greater and no less.  And so we find that whilst the Minister recognises the increased cost of living as a ground for increasing the remuneration of men still in the service, and quite rightly adjusts the salaries, he claims that the increased cost of living affords no ground for adjusting the pensions of men who retired before 1940.</P>
    <P>Last week I gave as an example the case of a pensioner who retired in June, 1940, on a pension of just over £3 a week, and pointed out that if an index figure of 270 were adopted in his case his pension would be about £4 4s. 0d. a week, an increase of a little over 30 per cent.  The Minister opposed any such increase.  But last June the Minister introduced the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Bill, now an Act, which, by reason of the increase in the cost of living, increased the remuneration of Parliamentary Secretaries by 30 per cent., i.e., from £1,200 to £1,560 a year.  In the mind of the Minister there is no inconsistency between the State's treatment of the Parliamentary Secretary and its treatment of the Civil Service pensioner.  The Minister's position, as I understand it, is that the State, as employer, has special responsibilities towards the former.  The latter is now just an ordinary private citizen, and, whilst the State must do what it can to maintain the value of its currency, if it fails it is entitled to pay his pension in depreciated currency and is not to be asked to make any adjustment.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make, however, is that the Minister's entire case collapses because it ignores the essential nature of the pension, or rather pensions, because in fact each pensioner gets two, one being a proportion of the salary, which is fixed, and the other being a proportion of the bonus, which is variable, to which the pensioner was entitled at the time <Col N="1072" /> when he retired.  I have established that what the pensioner is receiving from the State is simply further remuneration for past services.  The pension based on salary is delayed salary.  The pension based on bonus is delayed bonus.  This being so, the Government still has an obligation in justice towards the pensioners, which is precisely the same as its obligation towards civil servants still in active employment.</P>
    <P>Ministers are, of course, trustees for the general body of citizens.  In some sense, their position approximates to the position of the directors of a public company in relation to the shareholders or the position of the trustees of a charitable institution towards its beneficiaries.  But the directors may not inflict injustice on their employees for the benefit of the shareholders and the trustees may not inflict injustice on their employees for the advantage of the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The State should be a model employer, yet the pensions awarded to the men for whom I am pleading are subject to the utterly unjust condition that if the cost of living falls the pension will be reduced, but that, however much the cost of living rises, the pension will never go up, and this, although, as I have said, there are two elements in the pension and one of the two, called the &ldquo;additional annual allowance&rdquo;, is expressly related to a cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>Let me summarise very briefly what I said last week as to how this rather amazing position came into existence. A Superannuation Act passed nearly 90 years ago provided for the granting of fixed pensions related to length of service and made no provision for any variation in the amount of the pension as originally granted.  The completely stable economic conditions, which rendered it unnecessary to provide for any variation in the amount of a pension, came to an end with the 1914/18 war, and the bonus scheme was introduced.  In 1922, when the cost of living was very high, but was falling rapidly, it was felt that the granting of fixed pensions by reference to the existing high cost of living was unjust to the State and a new scheme was <Col N="1073" /> announced in the House of Commons which was to provide that all pensions granted for the future were to be revised both upwards and downwards from time to time by reference to rises and falls in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Superannuation Acts gave no authority for revision upwards.  No one at that time foresaw, or could be expected to foresee, the recent world war, and it was expected that the cost of living would continue to fall until stable conditions, at somewhere approximating to the cost of living as at July, 1914, were reached.  It was considered unnecessary, accordingly, to legislate to provide authority for any increase in pensions, and the scheme as finally announced by the Treasury provided only for decreases. No really serious hardship was suffered by pensioners until about 1938, when the recent world war began to cast its shadow before it, but very grave hardship has been suffered since through this evil feature of the pension scheme, which came into existence simply by accident, and which can now be eliminated if the opportunity which this Bill offers is taken.</P>
    <P>I want to put one final consideration to the Minister.  I suggest that, if it were his duty to prepare a completely new scheme for Civil Service pensions, and anyone proposed to him that he should bring forward a scheme to provide that pensions should be reduced when the cost of living fell, but should never be increased, however much the cost of living rose, he would reject the proposal without hesitation because it would offend his sense of justice, as it would offend the sense of justice of every member of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As I have shown, this utterly unjust provision has crept into the pension scheme in a purely fortuitous manner, and I suggest that, if the Minister feels that he would flatly refuse to be responsible for introducing such a provision, it is incumbent on him now to take the opportunity of removing it which this Bill affords.</P>
    <P>The form of the recommendation will probably need adjustment and if by any chance it was accepted I recognise that other consequential amendments <Col N="1074" /> would be necessary.  I do not think it necessary to go into all the details because I think this recommendation makes clear what I have in mind and is sufficient for the purposes of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. M.J. Ryan Mr. M.J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this recommendation. The recommendation is set out in rather involved language and may not be easily understood by the ordinary person but behind it lies a very important principle.  We can boast that we have in this State a most efficient Civil Service.  In my opinion, the best brains of this country are in the Civil Service.  Civil servants have had to pass highly competitive examinations and they are engaged by the State at rates of pay which might be described as cheap labour having regard to their qualifications, their training, their education and their efficiency. The State, therefore, owes a duty to its efficient servants.  When a young man is starting off in life and has to select a career for himself a career in the Civil Service appears a rather tempting one because there is held out the hope that at the end of a number of years' service he will have security in his old age.  I say security and by security I mean a pension that will keep him from penury when he is no longer able to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that there are men in the Civil Service to-day drawing moderate salaries from the State who, if they had embarked on professional or business careers, would have amassed a considerable amount of money to provide for the rainy day, and for their old age.  Therefore, the position of the civil servant must be regarded as a whole.  We cannot divorce his moderate remuneration from his pension.  I think it can be well said that the pension or superannuation is merely deferred pay.  As Senator Douglas pointed out, the question of fixed remuneration, and the question of a fixed pension, did not present any difficulty when economic conditions were stable.  But the cost-of-living figure was introduced when economic conditions became unstable.  That shows that the fixed salary and the fixed pension can no longer remain.  I cannot see why, if superannuation is <Col N="1075" /> regarded as deferred pay, and the pay continues until the civil servant dies, deferred pay should not be treated in the same way as pay received by a civil servant while actually serving the State.</P>
    <P>The idea of the introduction of what might be called the overriding maximum as regards bonus does not do justice to the person who is drawing deferred pay.  The cost-of-living figures published from year to year speak for themselves.  It is clear, once the principle was introduced of a bonus being added to the basic salary, that that principle must be carried to its logical conclusion.  I say that it is unjust and unfair to men who have served the State during their lives for very moderate remuneration that, in their old age, they should find themselves on the brink of penury, not through any fault of their own&mdash; because they had shown that during their lives&mdash;but because economic conditions have changed; that the State, having reaped the benefit of their services, should refuse to do the right thing.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whether this recommendation imposes a charge on the Exchequer, or whether it is not being pressed now, or the Government refuses to accept it, I think the principle embodied in it should be recognised as merely the essence of justice to civil servants who are now on pension, with a bonus on a cost-of-living of, say, 150 when the cost-of-living figure is over 300.  I cannot see any answer to this recommendation, except the answer which no doubt the Minister will give: &ldquo;Where am I going to get the money?&rdquo;  That is an answer he could give to many other proposals not half as worthy as this one.  He could say to an unworthy proposal: &ldquo;I have no money for it, I must reserve it for a worthy proposal.&rdquo;  This is a worthy proposal.</P>
    <P>Whatever the fate of this recommendation now, I trust the Government will reconsider the whole question of pensions for civil servants, that is, that they will regard the pension at all times as merely deferred pay, that a man <Col N="1076" /> who is on pension is really receiving pay, and that that pay should be commensurate with the cost of living at the time at which he receives it.  Most of the pensioners cannot live very long. The bonus on basic salaries has been consolidated.  This recommendation will apply only to a limited number of ex-civil servants but, at all events, it will perhaps lengthen their lives by providing them with more money to meet their needs.  It will lengthen their lives by causing them to cease to worry over the ingratitude of the State that had their services instead of finding themselves thrown on the scrap heap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my support to the very able case that Senator Douglas and other Senators have already made for this recommendation.  I do not suppose I will succeed in adding anything to the very complete factual and intellectual case made by my predecessors, but I do wish to add my moral support, for whatever it may be worth, to the case which they have made.  I think that if the Minister persists in going through with this Bill in its present form he will do a serious injustice to a number of very worthy citizens.  I think, moreover, that he will probably do that unintentionally and unwittingly, and in the result there will be a reflection not, perhaps, so much on the Minister himself as on the argumentative and persuasive powers of people like Senator Douglas and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to approach the consideration of this matter from the point of view that it is our duty to try and persuade the Minister to alter his view and to take a view more in accordance with what ordinary people like ourselves regard as the equities of the case.  As far as I can see, there is no distinction in logic, equity or reason as between the case of civil servants who retired after the 1st July and those who retired before the 1st July, 1940.  Therefore, whatever is applicable to those who retired after that date ought, equally, to be applicable to the others who retired before that date <Col N="1077" /> Further, the Bill could easily be rounded off so as to include this whole category of civil servants, namely, those who during their working lives have their pay partly determined by a variable element which reflects the cost of living.  Their pensions are also affected by the same consideration of that variable cost of living.  Therefore, that category of civil servants seems to me to be a rounded off category, and whatever decision is come to with reference to that category does not imply any commitment or in any way prejudice the case with reference to those other classes of public servants whose emoluments during their working lives, and their pensions when they retire, are not influenced in any way by this variable element based on the cost of living.  The Minister could safely extend the application of that principle contained in the Bill to those who retired before the 1st July, 1940, without necessarily prejudicing himself with reference to the other categories of public servants.</P>
    <P>The dominant fact that seems to me to govern this case is that the pensions received by civil servants are, in fact, deferred pay, a continuing payment by the State for services rendered during their working and active life. As the Bill now stands, there will be an obvious inequality, because people of the same grade and quality in the Civil Service who retired before a certain date in 1940 and those who retired after a certain date in 1940 for essentially the same services will, in the years of grace ahead of us, continue to be paid at entirely different rates.  It seems to be quite unreasonable and inequitable that people should be paid different rates for rendering the same quality and grade of service.  I would like to emphasise these points and also the fact that what I have said is mainly with the view of underlining what I regard as the outstanding points in the case that Senator Douglas and others have made much more effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to say a few words on this Bill I will endeavour not to travel over the ground already so well covered by previous speakers.  I want to say, at the outset, that I have <Col N="1078" /> sympathy with the Minister for Finance who is a constant target for all those who criticise the amount of taxation they are called upon to pay. In this debate he is being asked to increase the amount of State expenditure which inevitably must increase taxation.  It looks to me, on the other hand, that the basis of the case made for civil servants of the class described by Senator Douglas in his motion could be said to rest on an action that might be described as tossing with a double-headed penny.  The State in this case tossed the penny and no matter what way it came down the civil servants were bound to lose.  Their pension and bonus would decrease if the cost of living went down but it would not increase if the cost of living went up.  Without making a long speech I think that the average man will say that that is an unfair situation. The Minister indicated that for him it was not merely a matter of a few thousand pounds per annum, but that there were bigger issues involved.  If there is a big principle involved then the case now being made for the civil service pensioners is not unique, as I think it is.  I was very much impressed by the case made by Senator Douglas. He and the other speakers had one thought and that was that this is a case of injustice, and that an injustice is being done. If it is injustice and the Minister is convinced, then no matter what it costs, the injustice should be removed, but if the Minister can get rid of the idea that is in my mind at the moment, if he can show that he was not tossing with a double-headed penny and that, in fact, it was an ordinary penny, and that the toss was quite fair, I am prepared to be convinced.  We all know it is the general desire of all sections of the community to be no worse off than before the war.  The Minister has indicated he cannot restore to every member of the community the pre-war purchasing value of the £, but I think at the moment that something is expected of the Minister to clear away the doubt that exists that this particular class of civil service pensioner is labouring under an injustice and that it can be removed at a cost of £2,000.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this plea, and I agree with what Senator Summerfield has said. If it is a question of justice the cost should not count.  I do not want to make comparisons in expenditure at this stage, but I think the House will know that later on we will be asked to write off something like £500,000, money spent on mineral exploration. Similarly we have been asked in the past to write off substantial sums of all kinds lost on ill-starred commercial State enterprises.  When it comes to a question of human justice the cost should not count and that seems to be the view which comes from all quarters of both Houses.</P>

      <P>An cás atá ag an Aire i dtaobh rud éigin a dhéanamh ar son na ndaoine a chuaigh ar pinsean tar éis 1940, is é go ndearna an Rialtas de ghníomh cinnte díombáidh nó laghdú ar thuarastal nó ar chearta pinsin na ndaoine seo.  Tá sin ceart agus sáthach go leor ach ní hé sin an rud a gcuirfidh an pobal a n-aire air. Is é go cinnte an rud a d'airigh an pobal leis féin: má tá leasú le déanamh ar cheart pinsin daoine ón mbliain 1940 i leith, ná fuil an ceart céanna ag na daoine a fuair pinsean níos lú roimh 1940 agus de thairbhe na seirbhísí céanna?  Is dóigh liom go mbeidh sé an-deacair dúinn-ne a bheith sásta in ár n-aigne gur ceart dúinn an leasú a dhéanamh don dara cuid agus gan smaoineamh ar na daoine a chuaigh ar pinsean roimhe sin.</P>

      <P>Instead of my mind changing, Senator Ó Siochfhradha has <Col N="1080" /> made it more certain that I was doing the right thing in confining the benefits of this Bill to the civil servants who retired after 1940.  He pointed out that he would not be satisfied with dealing only with Civil Service pensioners whose condition is not improved by this Bill but would go on to deal with pensioned teachers, and there are a lot of other classes of State pensioners, in respect of whom the total pension bill amounts to about £2,400,000, whose pensions would have to be improved if we went any further than we are going in this Bill.  The reason that 1940 is set down in this Bill, that improvement is granted to civil servants who retired after 1940, is that it was only the civil servants who retired after 1940 who were injured by the standstill Order in regard to their pensions.  The State interfered with the contract it had with civil servants in regard to their pay, that their pay would rise in stated proportions to the cost of living and that their pensions, on retirement, would be fixed in relation to their salaries so based.  It was a question of justice in this case.  The State interfered because of the conditions of the emergency, breaking a contract with the civil servants and we are now taking this opportunity, immediately after the abolition of the standstill Order, to put the civil servants who retired since 1940 in no worse position than they would have been in, had it not been for the operation of that standstill Order.</P>
      <P>To go back to the civil servants who retired before 1940 for a moment, it is not true to say that their pension was subject always to a decrease and could never be increased again.  When a civil servant retired, his pension was fixed in relation to his salary at that date or the cost of living at that date. If the cost of living fell, the bonus portion of his pension fell, but if it fell 50 points and recovered 30 or 40 points again, his pension rose until it reached the point at which he retired. If it went up further than the point at which he retired, his pension would not increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Douglas and other Senators are very strongly of the view that pension is deferred pay.  I think it is a little more than deferred pay.  From <Col N="1081" /> one point of view, it is a payment toward an insurance annuity payable because both the State and the civil servant made a contribution each year during his pensionable service.  If the State 15 or 20 years ago had no scheme of pensions for civil servants, the State might have done as numerous business concerns do when they want to provide pension schemes for their servants.  They go to an insurance company and say: &ldquo;Each man in our employ is prepared to give you a certain contribution out of his wages and we are prepared to supplement that by an annual sum,&rdquo; and they bargain as to the pension to be obtained by employees on retirement for as long as they live.  If the State had made such an arrangement 20 years ago, the insurance company would be liable for any increase at present, and I have never heard of any insurance company guaranteeing its payments in relation to the cost of living, the price of gold, of wheat or of any other commodity.</P>
    <P>If you pay a premium, the insurance company undertakes to give you a certain number of legal tender notes each year from the year in which it contracts to pay.  What the Senators are asking the State to do in this case is, instead of undertaking to pay civil servants a certain number of legal tender notes each year after retirement, to give them a certain amount of wheat, of beef and of other commodities; in other words, to guarantee that their £ in relation to the cost of living will always represent the same amount. That could be done.  I am not saying it could not be done.  It can be done for a section of the community.  The smaller the section the easier it would be to do it.  If we take the civil servants, as Senator Douglas wants us to do, and concentrate altogether on the pre-1940 Civil Service pensioners, the Seabhac will come along and want to add the school teachers and someone else will want to add somebody else and we will get very quickly to the time when all State pensioners get the value in goods in the present year represented by the amount of money they were promised from the State in terms of legal tender notes and the value at the date on which they gave the service. No sooner would we have done that for <Col N="1082" /> State servants than a lot of insurance people will come along and say that they too should be guaranteed.</P>
    <P>If we leave pensioners for a while and take Senator Douglas's definition of a State pension as deferred pay, what about the civil servants who have no pensions, who gave service to the State, some of them, as long as and, in many cases, longer than, those who are awarded pensions?  Are we to go back to men who retired without pension 20 years ago and say: &ldquo;The State gave you £500 a year and now we want to give you another £100 in respect of each £150 that we gave you at that time in order to make up&rdquo;?  I do not see how this particular principle can be admitted as a question of justice in relation to any single section of the community because, if it is a question of justice in relation to one section, it is a question of justice in relation to all sections and the State cannot guarantee all.  They can guarantee to give them money because money is easy to make but it is what money represents, or should represent, that it is hard to provide, and the only way that we can guarantee the community as a whole as high a standard of living as they had in 1938 or any other year that you like to take is that we have the same production and, if we want to guarantee each section the same standard of living, not only have we to have the same production but, if we could manage it at all, the same distribution of that production.</P>
    <P>I cannot admit that there is a question of justice.  The State, as far as justice is concerned in this issue, is doing justice by restoring to civil servants who retired and with whom it broke contract the position they would otherwise have had.  In respect of other civil servants who retired pre-1940 the State is fulfilling its contract with them and I do not think we can go any further in regard to civil servants or teachers without dealing with the whole of the pensioners who are drawing pensions from the State, apart from old age and blind pensioners, whose total pensions amount to about £2,400,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to detain <Col N="1083" /> the House on this matter but the Minister has given us an excellent example of special pleading.  He began with the appeal made by Senator the Seabhac for the teachers and he mixed up the teachers and the civil servants. The Minister for Finance, of course, could not possibly be ignorant of the fact that the civil servants and teachers are on two entirely different footings.  He knows that extremely well.  Senator the Seabhac did not appreciate that in Committee on this Bill he had no longer an opportunity of arguing the teachers' case but the teachers' case is of a different nature from the case of these particular civil servants and the Minister, no doubt, knows that.  I am, of course, entirely in favour of the teachers but they have to be argued after an entirely different fashion from the argument you would apply to these particular people with whom Senator Douglas is concerned in this recommendation.</P>
      <P>This is not a case of how the State is going to treat pensioners generally, but of how the State is going to treat a very small and very diminishing number of pensioners who were its own employees and whose condition is not contrasted with teachers or with old-age pensioners or with anybody but with their own colleagues in the Civil Service whose pensions are now being fixed by this Bill, while a small section of them are being left out.  It concerns the position of the State as an employer.  It is not an excuse for me to say that I am prepared to settle everybody in my employment except a particular person and that I will not do him justice because I cannot get justice done all round in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister is arguing.  He may have a good case but he did not make it this evening.  The Minister's argument is that, because he cannot make everything right everywhere, he will not deal in a particular way with this very small number and very diminishing number of Civil Service pensioners.  The principle is, what responsibility has he to these pensioned officers?  He repeated to-day his point about making the value up in terms of goods, in terms of purchasing power <Col N="1084" /> of wheat, coal and butter.  Nobody is asking him to make these particular Civil Service pensioners' pension equal in purchasing power to what it was in 1939 or 1936 or whenever they went out.  In fact he is not doing it for the people who are dealt with in the Bill. He is not purporting to do that in the Bill for the people with whom he is dealing.  Nobody asked him to do that. What is suggested is that a certain small number of people who retired before 1940 should get the same treatment as those who retired later.  Is it not the case that if they were in England or Northern Ireland they would get the same treatment?</P>

      <P>The standstill Order of which the Minister speaks, in 1940 affected the salaries of existing civil servants, but the cost of living affected the pensioners and there was a standstill Order on them without any action of the Minister at all by the terms on which they went out.  The analogy of insurance companies is not sound either.  No insurance company insures a person and guarantees him a pension which will go down with the cost of living beyond a certain point but which can only come up to a certain point.  They do not do it at all. The Government made a particular kind of contract with these civil servants and they should fulfil it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, Sir, what strikes me about <Col N="1085" /> all this discussion is that it is doubtful if I am right in using the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; at all.  I do not think the civil servants have any contract.  It would appear to me that civil servants have no contract of any kind now with the Minister for Finance.  They are entirely at the mercy of the Minister himself or the Parliamentary majority of the moment and no principles of any kind apply either to their pay or pensions. That may be, perhaps, going too far.  These particular people of whom we are speaking now retired before 1940.  A person who retired then at the age of 65 is now 72.  Those who retired earlier are older.  They are a very small body and, obviously, a diminishing body and their case should be dealt with.  Their position when they were civil servants was that they suffered reduction in the bonus as the cost of living went down.  When the cost of living went down, their salary went down.  They retired with the bonus down.  Then the cost of living went up.  They suffered a reduction of their salaries but could not get an increase of their pensions.</P>
    <P>The number of people involved must be very small.  The amount of money involved must be very small, and it seems to me that there is no defence whatever for stopping at 1940.  If the Minister were being asked to bring in a large class of persons such as, for example, postmen or some large class of people, which would be very costly, and would be a continuing and perhaps an increasing burden on the State, that would be a different case.  What he is asked to do here is to meet the case of a small number of people in respect of whom the only thing they can be certain about is that they are going to die.  The charge the Minister would undertake would be a diminishing charge and it would have the effect, at any rate, of putting them all on the same level.</P>
    <P>That is the whole case, Sir, and to talk about the purchasing power of the £ and giving them wheat and meat and coal and sugar is quite irrelevant and, as a matter of fact, to treat them on the same basis as the teachers also, I think, is quite irrelevant.  It is a matter of dealing with a very small <Col N="1086" /> class of people and of putting them on the same level, not as the general public nor as a general class of pensioners but on the same level as the Minister is now putting their own colleagues.  While I do not hope to convince the Minister, I think that is the proper way in which the matter should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Until now, no one has told us the principle covered by this amendment or the possible cost to the State.  The Minister embraced all pensionable State employees in his reply, but I understand the amendment only applies in specific cases where people are subject to the downward trend in the cost of living where their pension would be reduced.  Surely it is only right and proper, if those people are subject to the downward trend, that they should get the advantage of an upward trend?  That is the amendment Senator Douglas has recommended.  To introduce teachers and the various other State employees is only complicating the issue.  If these people have to forego part of the pension when the cost of living goes down, surely their pension ought to be stabilised by increasing it when the cost of living goes up?  It is not very creditable to this or any other Government that takes advantage of a downward trend and ignores an upward rise.  If I can get from the Minister the amount involved and the numbers involved in this amendment by Senator Douglas, I am sure every member of this House would be in favour of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know we cannot change the Bill, but we can make a recommendation.  I do not think the Minister has convinced anyone that this is going to disturb the relationship between the whole body of pensioners and the State.  It is a very specific amendment and applies only to those who retired subject to the arrangement that their pension would be reduced.  I take it that that is a comparatively small number and applies to those who retired quite recently.  At any rate, I am sure it does not go back for a very long period and embraces only those who retired during the emergency.  Consequently, when the Minister talks about the cost <Col N="1087" /> on the pension list of £2,400,000, if there is an injustice there that could be removed for the expenditure of a comparatively small sum of money in relation to that, the injustice ought to be removed.  So long as these people are subject to a downward trend, they ought to get the advantage of the rise and while they do not get it they are labouring under an injustice.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to study this amendment and tell us the numbers and probable cost involved.  It does not affect pensioners who are not subject to these conditions.  I take it that teachers and various other State pensioners went out on a set amount according to the cost of living&mdash;which is entirely inadequate now&mdash;but no proviso was made that they would have to sacrifice some of that if the cost of living went down.  In their case, they have the advantage that their pension was stabilised, but in the case of these people it was not stabilised and was subject to reduction.  Considering all the circumstances, I am convinced that these people are suffering under an injustice and are entitled to an increase to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Foran is trying his blandishments on me to-night by saying: &ldquo;You need not do anything for the teachers, as they are getting what they contracted to get.&rdquo;  If I fell for that type of argument, well, I should not be let out.  The argument that other Senators here are putting up is that even though we are giving these civil servants what the State contracted to give them, it is not enough and we should give them more. Naturally, if we gave them more than the State contracted to give to civil servants because of their need, they would be followed by teachers' claims, very naturally and rightly, and as justly, in my opinion, and by all the other pensioners, whose total bill amounts to £2,400,000 a year.  Senator Hayes said that all the pensioners over in England are better off than the pensioners over here.  That is not a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, some of them would not.  When the British stabilised civil service salaries in 1935, the cost-of-living index figure in England was 145. There must be civil servants living in England who were pensioned at 145 and who have not got a single shilling extra.  Those who were pensioned off here prior to 1940 are on a pension at the appropriate figure prior to the standstill Order.  It might have gone even to 210.  Those in England were pensioned at 145 and some of them have remained there since.</P>
      <P>The scheme introduced in England to increase the pension had two legs.  One was a means test whereby, if a civil servant could prove that his means were very small, he might get an additional annual grant.  If he elected not to be subject to a means test and to stand on the other leg, he could get a 10 per cent. addition up to a certain amount, 7½ per cent. to a certain other amount, and then 5 per cent.; and over a certain amount, nothing.  There must be fair numbers of civil servants in England who retired at 145 and have got no addition since.  There is no breach of contract in not going back to the civil servants who retired before 1940. Before then there were retired civil servants living on different rates of pensions, who had the same salary and responsibilities.  It all depended on the height of the cost-of-living index figure at the date of their retirement.  That was the luck of the game.  It was there and the State did not undertake to even them all out.  It gave a certain undertaking when they became civil servants that grew up by tradition.  I do not see if we were to go any further than we are going in this Bill regarding civil servants why we would not have in justice to take all the other State pensioners and deal with them on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister and myself have a fundamentally different point of view. His attitude is, as expressed in his own words, that the position of men who retired before 1940 is what he calls &ldquo;the luck of the game&rdquo;.  To me it is a matter of right relations between <Col N="1089" /> employers and employees.  While it might be implied, I never said that there was a breach of contract.  I know perfectly well that what these men are receiving is what the law set out, but I say that the promise made at the time the law was passed, or immediately before it, and the conditions intended by the then British Government were that the pensions payable on that part of the remuneration called the bonus should be variable.  It might rise or might fall.  We have to take into consideration the circumstances of the time that the Bill was brought in.  As has happened in this country, it did not fulfil exactly the promise made by the then Minister because nobody at that time believed it would rise.</P>
      <P>Whereas legally the Minister is perfectly right in saying that these men have no legal claim, I say that the State as an employer should have regard to circumstances, apart from the question whether it is just or not.  I do not admit that civil servants being treated according to what to me seems justice but which the Minister calls &ldquo;the luck of the game&rdquo;, would in any way necessitate as of right a change in the pensions of other officers.  It would be the same as if I said I would not treat my employees properly unless I knew that everybody else was doing so. I cannot look upon the position of the State in relation to employees as being fundamentally different from others with the best and highest standards.  It is quite obvious from the Minister's remarks that we have a completely different point of view and I had better leave the matter there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His argument regarding insurance societies shows that he does not understand my case.  If the State as an employer chooses, as they sometimes do, to enter into an agreement with an insurance company providing for a retirement payment after a certain number of years the amount would not be reducible.  The Minister said it would not be increased.  It would not be increased, but it would never have been subject to such a condition. I dare say it would be possible to take out such a policy. Here we are dealing with normal cases. <Col N="1090" /> The Minister thinks that this recommendation would be on a par with such a case if conditions did not provide for a reduction.  Remember that during the period these men were working their bonus was greatly reduced as the cost of living went down.  When they retired the bonus was fixed on the basis of the then cost of living.</P>
    <P>I say that the whole system of paying anyone a pension which would go down, but could not go up, is a rotten one.  I do not believe the Minister would introduce such a system to-day.  The position is that you have a number of persons who retired at 65, whose ages must now be from 70 years upwards, and most employers, unless they were bankrupt, would try to deal with them.  Good employers would.  Others would refuse if they had no money.  The State is not in that position.  It is for that reason I put down the recommendation. We have had a debate, and as the Minister has no intention of moving, and as we have a fundamentally different point of view, I ask leave to withdraw the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I should like to explain to the House that I did not move any amendment similar in character to the recommendation that I moved to the Superannuation Bill.  This Bill is not a money Bill and I was under the impression, its character being different from the other one, that an amendment would be ruled out of order.  It is important that it should be made clear, if and when the Minister or his successor feels the justice of the case, that it will be necessary to introduce another Bill, which would deal with a class of persons not affected by the Superannuation Bill, but whose position, had it been amended, would be adjusted under the Civil Service Compensation Bill.  This Bill amends the Civil Service Compensation Act, 1929. According to my information a number of persons retired as transferred officers before 1940 because their conditions had been worsened.  If there was to be an adjustment there is no doubt but that they would have to be taken into consideration, because it seems to me their position is for all practical purposes the same as the others.  Where a transferred officer retired because it was accepted that his conditions had been worsened what he received was called compensation.  The lump sum payment and the pension were, according to my information, calculated in exactly the same way as if he had been a retired civil servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to redebate the matter.  I only want to make it clear that I was aware of the fact that this class of civil servant existed, and that if one was to be dealt with it was almost certain that the other would have to be dealt with at the same time, even though their positions might not have been identical.  It might have been that there was a difference in age at the time they retired, but the fundamental position would seem to be the same.  I did not deal with this on the <Col N="1092" /> Committee Stage, but I do want to make it clear that the arguments that I put forward on the Superannuation Bill would have applied if I had put down an amendment to this Bill.  I consider it sufficient to make that clear.</P>

Senators are already aware, <Col N="1093" /> I take it, of the main provisions of this Bill, as it is based on the Financial Resolutions, the subject of the Budget, and there is very little in the Bill that goes outside the Resolutions, as Senators will realise as I go through the Bill section by section, which I now propose to do.</P>
    <P>Part I&mdash;Income-Tax and Surtax&mdash; Section 1 provides that income-tax deductions in respect of the period from 6th April, 1948, to the date of the 1948 Budget will be made at the rate of 7/- in the £.  The section merely indicates in advance that a rate of 7/- will be imposed by the 1948 Finance Act and does not fix the rate of income-tax for the next financial year.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for a new scale of rates of surtax for the year 1946-47, that is, in respect of the surtax payable on 1st January, 1948.  The present margin of £1,500 has not been changed, but the tax payable on the excess over that amount is increased for each range of income.  In the highest rate of income (i.e., over £20,000) the combined rate of income-tax and surtax amounts to 15/- in the £ for the current year and 15/6 in the £ for next year.</P>
    <P>Part II.&mdash;Customs and Excise&mdash; Section 3 doubles the former rates of customs duty on toilet preparations so that duty is now chargeable at whichever of the following rates produces the greater amount of duty:&mdash;100 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> or 10/- the pound or £5 the gallon, as the case may be. Cosmetics are chargeable under this heading.</P>
    <P>Section 4 doubles the customs duty on fur clothing, so that the full rate is now 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> and the preferential rate 50 per cent.  Section 5 provides for an increase in the full rates of customs duty on wines to double the former rates.  The preferential rates are also doubled.  The ratio of the preferential rates to the full rates varies from 50 per cent. to 70 per cent.  Section 6 increases the rates of Customs and Excise duties on spirits.  The duty on home-made spirits is now £6 17s. 0d. per proof gallon, an increase of £2 2s. 0d. on the duty imposed in 1946.  The customs duties are similarly increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Section 7 provides for increases in the rates of Customs and Excise duties on tobacco, the basic increase being 6/8 per pound.  Section 8 raises the entertainments duty at present in force on cinematographic and other forms of entertainments by approximately 100 per cent.  The new scales will not come into force until 16th January next owing to the necessity for printing new stamps and tickets.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 raise the Customs and Excise duties on beer.  The increase in home-manufactured beer and the effective increase in ordinary imported beers is £4 19s. 0d. per standard barrel of 36 gallons.  A corresponding change is made in the drawback rate.</P>
    <P>Section 11 increases the rates of duty on private motor cars and motor cycles. The effect is to raise the duty on an 8 h.p. car from £8 to £12, on a 10 h.p. from £10 to £15 and on a 12 h.p. car from £12 to £20, with corresponding rates for cars of higher horse-power. The existing concession for Irish-assembled cars is being continued. Accordingly, Irish-assembled cars of over 16 h.p. will pay only the new duty appropriate to a 16 h.p. car, namely £28.  The duties on motor cycles are being doubled.  Commercial goods vehicles, agricultural tractors and public service vehicles of all kinds are exempt.  Express provisions are included in the section to exempt small public service vehicles (taxis and hackneys) and certain other types of vehicle (e.g., travelling creameries, mobile cranes) from the increased rates of duty.</P>
    <P>Section 12 extends to mechanically-propelled vehicles used solely for transporting equipment of any kind for saving life at sea the exemption from road tax already enjoyed by vehicles used solely for hauling lifeboats and their gear.  As a corollary it is provided that a vehicle not used <i>solely</i> for these purposes will not become liable to a higher rate of duty merely by reason of such user.  Thus, an agricultural tractor taxed at £6 per annum will not become liable to a tax of £21 per annum merely because it is used at times to haul life-saving equipment of the coast life-saving service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Part III&mdash;Stamp Duties&mdash;Section 13 provides for an increase in the stamp duty chargeable on conveyance and transfers of lands, tenements and hereditaments where the consideration exceeds £500.  The existing rate of £1 per cent. on such conveyances and transfers is increased gradually from £1 per cent. to £5 per cent. according as the value of the consideration rises from £500 to £950.  Where the consideration exceeds £950 a full rate of £5 per cent. will be charged.  The present rate of 10/- per cent., where the consideration does not exceed £500, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that unless the person on whose behalf the property is purchased is within some one of the six specified categories a higher rate equivalent to £25 per cent. of the purchase price will be chargeable in lieu of the normal stamp duty payable on the transfer or conveyance.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill was introduced two amendments have been made in this section.  Sub-section (4) has been amended so that the inclusion in the conveyance of the appropriate certificate is in itself sufficient evidence that the lower rate of £5 per cent. was applicable.  This amendment was made in order to meet the objection that, as the sub-section was originally drafted, all conveyances would require to be sent to the Revenue Commissioners for adjudication or otherwise a subsequent purchaser would have to inquire into the circumstances in which the lower rate was claimed.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is in sub-section (7) (c).  Where a conveyance liable to duty at the higher rate of £25 per cent. is not fully stamped within 30 days of execution there is a liability to the State amounting to double the duty chargeable.  In sub-section (7) (c) as introduced the Revenue Commissioners had power within three months of first execution of the conveyance to mitigate or remit this liability.  This time limit of three months has now been withdrawn giving the Revenue Commissioners the same powers in relation to this liability as they already possess in relation to existing penalties under the Stamp Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> Part IV&mdash;General&mdash;Section 14 provides that the increase in the moneys accruing in the current financial year from motor vehicle duties as a result of the increase in rate (and estimated at £200,000) shall be diverted from the Road Fund to the Exchequer. Section 15 is the usual care and management section and Section 16 the usual section relating to the short title and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have availed himself of this opportunity to give us something more than a brief survey of the implications of the proposals in his Budget. I think the House is entitled to have something more from him by way of justification for its introduction than it has received.  The Budget is something which the State must have produced for its consideration if its affairs are to be kept running smoothly. Sometimes people look forward to the introduction of the Budget with fear and trembling and frequently they breathe a sigh of relief when the document has seen the light.  But I think that there were no sighs of relief on this occasion.  From the contact I have had with people throughout the country I believe that no more unpopular document was ever introduced in the Oireachtas than this Supplementary Budget.  Ostensibly the reason for it was the desire of the Government to reduce the cost of living.  That is the cause given publicly to both Houses and to the country but I wonder if the Minister will seriously contend to-day that this additional £5,000,000 will reduce the cost of living in any home in the country. We are used to hearing the saying &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo;, but this Budget is truly accepted as robbing Peter to pay Peter.  I feel myself that there has been no justification for this Budget on the pretext of reducing the cost of living.  It is not going to do it and nobody believes it will do it. I can say that there were and are other reasons influencing the decision of the Government.  I would prefer that the Minister and the Government would be frank in this matter and say boldly why they have been compelled <Col N="1097" /> to take this step.  Some of the things taxed in this Budget are now regarded as the essentials of every-day existence for the people of this country.  Tobacco, the bottle of stout and the pictures are all taxed.  We are being forced into conditions of austerity and asceticism due to reasons of which the Minister has not spoken but which I think should be revealed to the country.  Let the country know where it stands and why it is standing where it is.  It is true that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in some of the debates, gave expression to the point of view that we have reached a position when it is undesirable that we should continue to spend money on the importation of foreign pictures and spend so much on purchasing foreign tobacco. There are many people, many members of the Oireachtas who for a long period have seen this stage being reached. Many times in this House and in the other House the position of our falling production was stressed, and it was pointed out that we would face adversity as a consequence.  It was urged, time and time again, that action should be taken to guard against this day when it should come.  Now it has come and the Minister and his colleagues are not prepared to face the fact and to do something to rally the country because it is quite clear that we are now facing a position where our foreign purchases will have to be cut to the bone.  The first indication we had of this was in the Budget.  No doubt it came upon the House and the country quite unexpectedly.  Whether the Minister and his colleagues anticipated it we do not know but it is rather interesting to follow the sequence of events that preceded it.  It was introduced following some of the discussions that had taken place in London between the representatives of this country and the British Ministries. Was it only then revealed to the Minister that we were coming to the end of our tether?  What preparations were being made to meet this situation? This piecemeal method of enforcing austerity upon us, in the blind belief that we will not appreciate the fact that we have to put up with it, is all wrong.  The British fought a bloody <Col N="1098" /> war in which they wasted all their foreign resources and much of their internal resources and they have to accept conditions which are very unpalatable.  We did not fight such a bloody war&mdash;we kept out of it. Apparently we, too, must pay the penalty of that war which was fought, but, if that be so, let us measure what the future holds for us.  Let us be told about it, and let us be called upon to face it courageously and let the Government not try to put their fingers in the eyes not only of the members of the Oireachtas but of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to deal with all the implications of this Budget and I have no desire to attempt to go over the whole field, but we have some figures, given to us recently, which show the perils we have to face.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in Cork, told us that our total imports amounted to £90,000,000 and our total physical exports to £30,000,000.  There was a gap of £60,000,000 to be bridged, and he asked how we were to do it. Elsewhere he has given an estimate of our exports for the present year which indicates that he anticipates a further drop of £8,000,000 in the value of our exports.  I do not know what the Government hope we are to purchase from the hard currency area; I do not know what they hope to be able to pay for in that area; but, taking these figures as they have been given to us, we are expecting to bridge the gap of £60,000,000 by very peculiar processes: (1) by emigrants' remittances; (2) by the earnings on our foreign investments, and (3) by drawing on capital. Curiously enough, when the Minister came to that point, he was warning us of the dangers of drawing on capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of interest to know that we can draw on capital, and, if we can translate it into anything of value to the nation in its difficulties, it will be welcome news; but is it not an extraordinary position we find ourselves in that we are dependent for our living on the earnings of the people whom we have sent to England or who have had to leave this country to find work in England?  Surely this low figure <Col N="1099" /> of £30,000,000 for exports must be to some extent influenced by the fact that hundreds of thousands of our people have left the country and have gone to England.  The Minister may deny that that is the result of Government policy, but that is what has been going on and I have no doubt whatever that the capacity of this country to produce has been gravely influenced by the dimensions of that flow of our young people out of the country.</P>
    <P>I want to know what policy the Government intend to pursue in future in order to bring the country up to the position in which the amount of physical goods it will be able to export will go some distance towards paying for our physical imports.  How is that to be achieved?  There is no light in any statement of Government policy that I can lay my hands on which will brighten our way towards that goal.  I see other figures of purchases in the hard currency area for 1946, and we have also from the Minister for Industry and Commerce the statement that for 1947 up to date our total purchases amount to £65,538,000, and of that we have spent £26,379,000 in the hard currency area.  How long can we go on doing that?  What plans have we for developing or improving our capacity to pay for these goods which we are buying in that area?</P>
    <P>Let me look at another aspect of Government policy as I see it.  People have to work to live and we have to sell in order to be able to buy.  In the last analysis, we shall have to fall back here on our agricultural production and exports.  What has the Government done, right along all through its period of office, to encourage exports? I do not want to go back over the bad period, but the Minister can, like his Leader, look into his own heart and find the answer there.  The fruits we are gathering now are the result of the neglect of the past.  Let us look to the future and let us see what are the possibilities of an increase in agricultural production which will go any distance towards paying for our foreign imports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> Again, I suggest that the Government have a very peculiar way of implementing this policy of austerity.  Our Ministers recently had discussions with British Ministers and we had in the Dáil last week an indication of the results.  One examines these to see whether or not there is anything which will encourage us to believe that we can hope for greater agricultural production and export.  I cannot see much hope, but I do see that, so far as I have been able to examine these proposals side by side with other things which have been happening at home, it is quite clear that our Government are implementing a policy of rationing of meat for the people of this country in order to be able to export more to Britain.  Similarly, I suggest that the proposal contained in this Budget for an increase in the tax on beer has exactly the same policy and purpose behind it.  If that be the fact, why not say so?  It is very desirable, and in fact essential, that there shall be greater exports in respect of the products of our distilleries and breweries to the hard currency area, but why not say so? Why not tell the people that, in order to be able to buy more from abroad, they will have to buy less of these at home?</P>
    <P>Let us consider the policy with regard to beef and the export of cattle. We have had indications of the price that has been agreed upon with the British.  Apparently we have agreed to sell at a given price.  One way to narrow the gap between the cost of imports and the value of our exports is to push up the price at which we sell our exports.  When we apply that test to the most important commodity we have to export the impression is obtained that in that respect our Government have definitely fallen down. One way to narrow this gap is to push up the price of beef being sold abroad. In the recent discussions we have definitely pushed up the price from a very bad price paid to us all during the war, with the consent of the Government, but we have not pushed it up as far as we might or ought to push it.  We have something that can be sold in any country in the world.  It is the scarcest food.  Why should the people <Col N="1101" /> representing this country agree to sell a fat beast to Britain at £4 or £5 less than the price paid for a beast of equal quality and weight out of the Six Counties?  I do not understand why such a decision should be taken.  The Argentinian Government does not do that.  The American farmer does not do it.  It is true that the Government are paying for foreign wheat more than they are paying their own farmers.  It is a very strange position for the Irish farmer that he will get less for his wheat from the home Government than that Government will pay the farmers or the Government of any other country and that, when he sells his cattle, his Government will accept a price from a foreign Government lower than that Government will pay their own farmers or foreign farmers.  It seems to me that we have fallen down on that.  The Government had the chance of a lifetime and it is beyond me to understand why they did not avail of it.</P>
    <P>I see that in these discussions the Government have agreed to discuss with the British the numbers of fat cattle that may be sent to the Continent. The Government, who talked so much about foreign markets, are now going to sit down with the British to limit the quantity of food they will send to foreign markets.  I am all for selling all I can and sending all I can to Britain at any time, but I want some security about it, and I do not understand why the Government should limit sales to the Continent when they have no security as to how long this arrangement with Britain will last. Britain can break it in six months. Britain, apparently, is not prepared to make an arrangement with us that will last into the years when beef becomes more plentiful.  She will pay us less than we can get elsewhere at the present time and, in three years' time, when it is available elsewhere, she will buy somewhere else.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much in that, but let us consider another aspect.  I have had discussions with butchers in Cavan and I am told that from now on they will not be able to pay more than 77/-, 76/- or 78/- per cwt. for cattle.  Some have told me that they <Col N="1102" /> have cattle bought and that when they are sold out they will not be able to compete with Britain in the market. They can buy cattle of inferior quality, but will not be able to purchase the first-grade beef that they have been accustomed to sell to the consumer.  I do not know if that is a fact, but if it is, it is quite clear that in that decision of the Minister for Industry and Commerce he is imposing a policy of rationing on our people and putting the home butcher in a position that he cannot compete with the foreigner and will have to buy inferior stuff, and, probably, will have to buy less of it. As a result, more will go to the foreigner and the people at home will be less well-fed.</P>
    <P>If that has to be done, let us say it frankly and let us face it, but let us not do it in this particular peculiar way.  If you want to send more to Britain, be courageous about it and say you are doing it and let the British know that you are imposing difficulties, hardships, and austerities on your own people in order that they may be better fed.  Let us at least get some credit for sending them more to eat.</P>
    <P>There are other problems that concern us arising out of these discussions. I notice that the Government have made undertakings with regard to the export of seed potatoes.  The Minister will recall that months ago, on another debate here, I pointed to what I regarded as the serious situation which would confront us when the potato crop of this year was gathered. I have no reason to change my view. Personal experience and information that I have obtained have confirmed me in that view.  I think we are humbugging the British when we tell them we will export seed potatoes to them this year at all or, if we do export them, we will leave ourselves short. That is something on which I would like the opinion of other members of the House who come from country districts.  How is our production of potatoes to be increased next year as it ought to be unless we ensure supplies of seed for our farmers this year?  The prices as fixed here, if the price be the <Col N="1103" /> determinant, mean that there will not be any seed potatoes exported to Britain because the prices listed are not equal to the prices that people are paying at present throughout the country for potatoes.  In the markets in Cavan the price paid in any week is higher than the price fixed with the British.  I do suggest that some effort should be made to get some estimate of home requirements and stocks available for export before one cwt. leaves the country.  The whole position in regard to our foodstuffs requires further elucidation and much more information than has been vouchsafed so far.</P>
    <P>In the 1946 expenditure in the dollar area, you have £3,625,000 in the Argentine.  I would like to hear from the Minister what contribution that is going to make towards our export policy.  The production of more pigs and poultry is essential to the balancing of our Budget, both at home and abroad.  Some months ago, we had a statement from some member of Grain Importers, Limited, or Irish Shipping, Limited, whom we sent to the Argentine, that hundreds of thousands of tons of maize were purchased in that country.  We have not seen very much maize since, but it is a matter of considerable concern to the farmer producers, and especially small farmers, and it is something on which we should have full information.  What has been spent on the purchase of maize or wheat, or where is it held? Is it in the Argentine or in this country? What are the stocks we can draw on for the future?  This can considerably influence pig and poultry production. You cannot produce pigs out of a hat, and men will not produce pigs unless they feel there is a possibility of the pigs being fed when produced. We have not been given information on this point, though it is a very important one.</P>
    <P>The price at which we sell is a determining factor in our capacity to purchase. I see that the price at which it is proposed to sell flax as agreed in these discussions, is fixed for the 1948 crop at a considerably higher figure <Col N="1104" /> than for 1947.  May I ask if no effort was made to get that price for the 1947 crop, two-thirds of which is still in the hands of the producers?  If it be value for that in 1948, why is it not possible to secure that price for 1947?  These are the problems that confront the producers and the considerations that influence their line of conduct.  Farmers are under a great disability when none of us know what type of agriculture we are to pursue in the future.</P>
    <P>Figures were made available to the committee which sat in Paris on the Marshall Plan which have never been revealed or discussed in this country at all, as far as I know.  These figures indicate a complete change of Government policy in regard to wheat production. I have not got the figures here, but the Minister must have them somewhere.  They show a reduction from 600,000 to 250,000 acres of wheat. Is not that a complete reversal of Government policy?  If that be the view of the Government, why is it not stated publicly, even though it be a change of policy, even though it be an acceptance on their part now, rather belatedly, that there is a better scheme to pursue and that there are ways by which our land can be utilised more fruitfully and more productively than the method which they regarded as most successful in the past?  If that be so, why do they not tell us and let us be prepared?  We get this from Paris, in an international document, never revealed to us here at all, never discussed with any group of farmers, not even introduced to the Oireachtas. That sort of thing makes it impossible for intelligent farming to be carried on here, as intelligent organisation of our industry is beyound us when we do not know for what we are to organise. Is it not clear now that there has to be a considerable adjustment from the Government's angle of the things which they have stood for and preached and practised in the past?</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister about the possible imports of maize meal.  Does he recall the days when he would not let a sack of maize into the country and was a great antagonist of the policy of maize importation?  He played more <Col N="1105" /> than a man's part in the propagation of the policy and doctrine that played the dickens with pig production.  His Leader and himself now subscribe to the thing for which we stood when we argued that, in order to have a balanced economy, these imports were essential.  I did not&mdash;because there was a new Minister for Agriculture&mdash; attempt before to demand from the Government some indication of what reorganisation was to take place in our industry that would make us better prepared to meet these commitments by way of payment for imports in the future than we were in the past.  The day is past when we should have had a statement of Government policy on that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, ought to know.  He had some farming experience and must have views of his own, and he should be in a position to enlighten the House and the country.  The position is grave and is made more grave because the facts are not revealed by the Government. It comes in in this oblique way in this Budget, introduced, mar dheadh, to reduce the cost of living, when, in fact, the whole purpose is to increase the conditions of austerity arising out of discussion with Britain which apparently only then revealed our dependence on her economy.</P>
    <P>From every angle, the Budget is unpopular.  The burdens it imposes on every section are unwelcome and hit the poor people hardest, many of whom go out of their cheerless homes to the warmth of a picture house.  It will be much more expensive for them to have that little bit of comfort in future.  The man who takes a bottle of stout will be badly hit.  The poor fellow out in the hills in my county, perhaps to-day, in his potato furrow, with his spade, trying to get out the last of his potato crop, finds that his pipe is put practically beyond his means.  This is all done to reduce the cost of living.  It really is robbing Peter to pay Peter&mdash; and Peter is not grateful for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in thorough agreement with Senator Baxter when he refers to this Bill as the most unpopular <Col N="1106" /> one that the Government has yet been responsible for introducing. While I do not wish to under-estimate certain concessions given in the reduction of the cost of essential foods, namely tea, sugar and bread, I respectfully suggest that the manner in which these concessions are given entirely defeats their objective.  There are other essential articles that every householder must purchase, such as clothing, boots, shoes and meat.  These are just as essential as the three subsidised commodities.  While the cost of these articles remains as high as it is I cannot see how this Budget makes the lot of the wage-earner easier to bear.  It is all very well to subsidise these foodstuffs ostensibly with a view to the lowering of the cost of living but in reality just lowering the cost-of-living index figure which is a different thing.  The manner in which money is got to subsidise the reduction is certainly most unpopular with the vast majority of the people.  Any imposition that makes the lot of the wage-earner more difficult to bear should be vigorously resisted by Parliament. Any imposition that makes the enjoyment of the very few luxuries that wage-earners have is certainly not popular and not one that any representative of the people would care to justify.  The cheapest kind of tobacco costs about 2/- per ounce and the cheapest cigarettes cost 1d. each while a bottle of stout which is just as essential for many workers as food is increased by 1½d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if many people were asked they would prefer the stout which they take after a hard day's work or perhaps at meal time, or a smoke, to tea and sugar.  I have no doubt that amongst a very large proportion of people who could not by any means be regarded as intemperate their selection would be these few alleged luxuries. Really they are not luxuries.  They are essentials.  I cannot see why money could not be got to subsidise the reduction in the cost of tea, sugar and flour by means other than imposing extra taxation on the people.  As a matter of fact, of the £5,000,000 increase about £3,000,000 will be collected from people who can least afford it.  I am not concerned with those who drink whiskey, <Col N="1107" /> although I know that from time to time the poorer people need it as a medicine. It is a very expensive medicine at present and it is difficult to get.  When there is an epidemic there is a rush on it and not by the better-off class but by the very poor, who take it in moderation and regard it in certain conditions as being the best cure for influenza.  These people can no longer look to that cure if they are affected with the influenza.  When it was considered necessary to reduce the cost of three articles of food, I think the Minister could have done so by taking into consideration other items of expenditure that were dealt with in the ordinary Budget last May.  I respectfully suggest that the defence of the country would be in no way impaired if the cost of the Defence Forces was reduced by at least £2,000,000.  Another item that appeared in the Budget last May concerned the reconstruction of Dublin Castle in order to provide accommodation for civil servants working there.  That Estimate of £2,000,000 could be deferred.  I also submit that the purchase of Constellation aircraft, which were recently procured, might be deferred to a more appropriate time.</P>
    <P>When reasons were being advanced for the flight of the young people from the land to the large towns and cities I recollect that one of the outstanding reasons given was the absence of certain amenities in rural districts.  A cinema in a rural district is an amenity that is appreciated by the boys and girls after a hard week's work.  They do not rush into cinemas every night. On Sunday nights the majority of the patrons of the cinema in the town where I live are the people from the country districts.  I am credibly informed that the people directly concerned with the running of that particular cinema will be faced with the possibility of closing it down after January because of increased amusements tax.  Taking all these things into consideration, this Bill is a most unpopular one.  I have had an opportunity of hearing the views of others without advancing my own and I say that it is one of the most unpopular measures ever introduced by the <Col N="1108" /> present Government, and I therefore will have no hesitation in voting against the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>When one attempts to speak on such a very unpopular Budget as this has been described by Opposition speakers, it is difficult to deal with it.  Since this Budget was introduced, both in this House and in the Dáil, and through the country, I never remember hearing so many advocates of intoxicating drink and films.  We have been told that the flight from the land was due to the attraction of cinemas in the cities, and that it was because of such attractions young people were leaving country districts.  We are told that there are cinemas in each town and village, and that on account of recent Budget taxation they are going to close down. Even though we have the films now we are still told that we are going to have the flight from the land. Senator Baxter, as usual, painted a very gloomy picture of the future.  He referred to the price paid to our farmers for the growing of wheat and asked why they would not get the price that is paid for imported wheat.  I think we all remember the time when Senator Baxter and the members on the Opposition Benches in this House and in the other House told the people that the soil of this country was not fit for the growing of wheat, and that its growing should not be undertaken by our farmers under any consideration. He also drew attention to the fact that from figures made available at an international conference it is proposed that the acreage under wheat grown in this country in the future is to be between 200,000 and 300,000 acres. We remember that in 1931 the total acreage under wheat here was about 20,000 acres, while during the war years that figure went up to 600,000 acres.  We hope to be able to maintain our acreage under wheat when normal conditions return to the world.  I do not think we should go back on the Fianna Fáil policy of wheat growing.  We should still pursue that policy so as to safeguard food supplies for our people in the future.</P>

      <Col N="1109" /> Senator Ruane said this was a very unpopular Budget, that it conferred no benefits on the people and that the country, as a whole, was opposed to it. Let us examine the position.  Is there any member of this House, or of the other House, going to tell me that the father of a family who has to purchase a sack of flour which has been reduced in price from 63/6 to 44/3 does not regard that as a great concession?  We must remember, too, that the subsidies paid in order to keep down the price of bread and flour amount to about £6,500,000.  Is it no concession to the head of a household to have the price of tea reduced from 4/10 per lb. to 2/8? If we make a comparison between the prices charged here and the prices charged in the Six Counties and in England what do we find?  The price of bread here is 4d. compared to 5d. in the Six Counties; tea is 2/8 here as compared to 5/- outside; cigarettes are 2/- for 20 here as compared to 3/4 in the Six Counties or in England; whiskey is 2/4 here as compared to 5/- outside this State, while the important bottle of stout is 8d. here as compared to 1/- outside.  These are some facts which are to be got from the Budget.  Butter at the present time is 2/8 per lb., but it is being subsidised at a cost of £1,250,000.  All that has been done in order to keep the prices of essentials down.  I think that the Senators who have spoken already missed that point.</P>
    <P>I remember reading last month a publication issued by the main Opposition Party.  There was a statement in it to the effect that the Budget was introduced as a slick electioneering trick, but now it turns out to be, according to them, the most unpopular Budget ever introduced.  It is hard to reconcile both statements.  The purpose of introducing the Budget was to prevent prices and wages chasing one another.  The Budget is an attempt to stabilise both.  It think it is right that we in this House should give credit to that section of labour organisations which has already put forward its acceptance of this scheme for the stabilisation of both prices and wages.  It is because it was in the national interest to bring about that position that the Budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>I think I have never heard so many <Col N="1110" /> advocates of what one may call intemperance, and, if you like, advocates of the cinema and of the necessity of the pint.  There is one suggestion that I would like to make and it is in connection with films. There is a tax of about 3d. per foot on films entering this country.  The tax is at a uniform rate.  It has been suggested to me that, instead of that being the case, the tax should be related to the value of the film, no matter what type of film it may be or what its earning capacity might be.  I make the suggestion that the tax should be related to the value of the particular film rather than that there should be a tax at the uniform rate of so much per foot.</P>

      <P>The fact that the Budget is an unpopular Budget is to me its chief merit.  I am afraid I will find myself in the rather unusual situation of being quite laudatory to the Minister with regard to the general aspects of this Budget.  Before I get on to that there are one or two minor points that I want to deal with. The Budget does increase the tax on motor cars for all users.  There is a very worthy class of people up and down the country who must use motor cars for professional reasons.  They happen to be the clergy of the Protestant churches, and their flocks are very scattered.  They often have to cover from 20 to 30 miles on a Sunday, so that a motor car is an absolute necessity to enable them to do their work.  Many of them are in the unfortunate position that they have not had any real increase in income in the last 20 years, and they certainly are going to be rather hard hit by this special increase in what is a necessity of life to them.  If the Minister could, in any way, alleviate the position of that very worthy section of the community I, personally, would be very glad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget is certainly not an inflationary Budget as it certainly would have been if the Minister had set out to finance the reduction of the cost of living with money borrowed either in the capital market or from the banks.  He is rightly taking from <Col N="1111" /> the taxpayers the exact amount of money he is going to spend in reducing the cost of the necessities of life. Therefore it is not an inflationary Budget.  On the other hand, it is not disinflationary as it would have been if the Minister had set out to draw from the taxpayers what he proposes to spend in subsidising the cost of the necessities and, at the same time, produce a Budget surplus.  I am not suggesting that he should have done that, but if he had done it, it would have been disinflationary.  From that point we may regard his Budget as perfectly neutral.  It has been complained that the new taxes hit the poorer classes almost to the same extent as they are benefiting by the new subsidies.  First of all, I would like to say that in 1938 over 70 per cent. of the salaried classes had an income which did not exceed £250 per year.  In a country, therefore, like this, where the average income is low, it is quite impossible to spread the net of taxation without getting some of the lower income classes for the reason that you cannot get enough from the classes that might be described as well-to-do. But taking it all over, the poorer classes will profit more by the subsidisation of the necessities of life than they will lose by taxation.  I think that must be admitted, unless it happens to be the case that the poorer classes are very heavy smokers and drinkers and great picture fans.  The taxation system here is known technically as progressive, whereby the wealthier classes pay a higher percentage, and the new Budget did not depart from the pattern of the taxation system as a whole.  Therefore, it is obvious that the well-to-do are going to pay more, from which it follows that the poorer classes must profit more by the subsidies than they lose by the taxation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in certain irresponsible quarters and in quarters that is is hoped will be responsible that it should be possible to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. by the method of subsidising essentials at the expense of the people who live by profits, or if you like, whose annual <Col N="1112" /> incomes are £1,000 per year or more. Now, in 1934, according to information contained in the White Paper, the total amount of money spent on food in this country was something of the order of £55,000,000 and at the present time it seems reasonable to suppose that the total expenditure on food is something over £60,000,000 per year. A 30 per cent. reduction on this expenditure would mean something of the order of £20,000,000 which would have to be found by the taxation of some other sections of the community. If you look for this £20,000,000 from the people with incomes of £1,000 or more, who according to the White Paper represent 9 per cent. of the aggregate of £260,000,000, you will have to tax people with an aggregate income of £25,000,000.  The net result would be that to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. you would have to find £20,000,000 and get it by taxing people with an aggregate income of £25,000,000.  I do not think that even the new Party would stand for that.</P>

      <P>We are suffering from inflation and while the wind is blowing from the east it is not blowing from Russia but from countries that are much nearer than Russia and there is very little we can do about it, because it is more an external than a domestic problem.  This Budget is an honest and competent method of reducing the effects of inflation.  As the Minister has undoubtedly insisted the only remedy is increased production, an increase of goods whether produced at home or imported, and to secure an increase in production in our own agricultural output we need more phosphates.  There is no more phosphate-starved country than ours and no country that would yield more in output to an increased application of phosphates than our country.  Therefore I welcome the new agreement with Britain both in general and particular for it provides for an addition in the amount of phosphates that we can reasonably hope to import or produce from imported rock; an increase from 15,000 tons of imported phosphates <Col N="1113" /> presumably of British origin.  I take this opportunity of saying that I welcome the terms of this new agreement. No doubt it is open to criticism in detail and such criticism has certainly been lavishly afforded it by Senator Baxter.  In a way, I suppose, it is rather disappointing that the price agreed upon for beef is not quite so high as Britain is going to pay her own farmers and the farmers in Northern Ireland.  But to me the advantage in the price of beef cattle appears to be in the fact that for the first time in 15 years it brings the price of beef cattle into line with the price of store cattle. In due course, no doubt, this will lead to the stall-feeding of our own cattle at home instead of our exporting them all as stores.  There is another aspect of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that the increases guaranteed to the British farmers for beef and other agricultural products will raise the price of these commodities so high that it is extremely doubtful whether in the course of the next five or ten years the British Government will be able to go on paying them, especially if it becomes possible to import agricultural products cheaper than the prices they have promised to pay their own farmers. The temptation, therefore, for the British Government to reduce these prices to their own farmers will be great.  I would like to see a price agreement with Britain covering a number of years at 8/- or 10/- per cwt. less than at what Britain is committed for the time being.  One aspect of this Budget is that it has as its principal object the subsidisation of the cost of living, especially for the poorer classes. In this respect, the Minister is following in the footsteps of British war-time practice which carried out the principle of subsidisation to a very marked degree indeed, but I hope the Minister will not go anything like the distance in subsidising the price of food that the British have gone.  In that country, as you probably know, they spend nearly £400,000,000 a year of the taxpayers' money in cheapening the price of a certain range of the necessities of life for the general consumer and in the opinion of some that is the principal <Col N="1114" /> cause of the fundamentally inflationary condition which is threatening to ruin the whole British economy.  If the Minister had been at the elbow of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain and suggested to him a Budget analogous to the one we now have before us, I think it probably would have contained a provision for wiping out the most of those subsidies in the case of the British Budget and, if it had, it would have put the British economy on a much sounder basis than it still remains on.  But, unfortunately, we gave the British Home Rule some years ago.</P>
    <P>Now, it is tempting to make certain comparisons between our economy and the economy of Britain and, if you like, perhaps glance from certain points of view.  We have heard over and over again the fact that in our country, while wages have gone up since 1939 by less than 50 per cent. the cost of living has gone up by more than 70 per cent. whereas the direct opposite has taken place in the case of Britain.  The cost of living, at all events as measured by the cost-of-living index, has gone up by something like 30 per cent. whereas the level of wage rates has gone up by more than 70 per cent. and in fact the level of wage earnings in some cases approximates to 100 per cent. higher than it was in 1939.  So that there you have the exact opposite case to that in which we find ourselves and I personally am prepared to argue that if the British case was similar to ours, instead of being the exact opposite to it, that economy would be in a fundamentally healthier position than it now is because there has in fact taken place in Britain a most important social revolution in the course of the last seven years, the nature of which has been to redistribute money income.  I will not say purchasing power because one effect of the redistribution has been to deprive money income of its significance as purchasing power. Nevertheless, there has been a redistribution of money income in favour of the wage earning class in Britain and against the profit receiving classes to an extent which has been calculated in a recent article in the <Col N="1115" /><i>Economist</i> as something like 30 per cent.&mdash;30 per cent. more real income in a technical sense for the wage earning classes; 30 per cent. less real income in a technical sense for the classes that live on profits.</P>
    <P>Now, if there had been any adequate supply of useful and desirable goods for the workers to spend their additional income on in Britain that would have been altogether admirable but, as a matter of fact, after they had bought their limited rations, they found themselves with surplus money that they had literally nothing useful to do with and that money spilt over into all sorts of undesirable directions and forced up prices in the whole of the uncontrolled sector of the economy and especially attracted labour and other resources into all kinds of undesirable activities like football pools and the various activities with which the &ldquo;spiv&rdquo; classes are associated.  And, in fact, it is the principal reason that it is now impossible in Britain to get an adequate amount of labour for the most essential works in the country, so many people are making a profitable living by catering for the uneconomic expenditure by the over-wealthy wage-earning classes.</P>
    <P>That whole situation in Britain could have been ended by a stroke of the pen by the simple abolition of all or most of the subsidies on foodstuffs but, of course, it would have been politically unpopular and might have given rise to a demand for higher wages which would have defeated the original purpose. But, in theory, the solution was obvious&mdash;wipe out the subsidies&mdash;and in that case they would have made their whole problem of the international balance of payments much more soluble.  But I need not talk so much of their situation.  We are concerned with our own, but we are concerned also to point out how difficult it is for us to solve a problem like this inflationary problem which is of external origin when the centre and origin of that inflation is in a country over which we have no control and, I am afraid, very little influence.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House by discussing the situation in France except <Col N="1116" /> to say that in that country, apparently, the mistake was made of pegging the price of wheat at a fixed level while allowing other prices, especially the price of meat and poultry and eggs, to find their natural level while at the same time the Government facilitated, or at all events were unable to resist, a strong upward movement in the wages of industrial workers.  The effect of that was that it was much more profitable for the farmers to grow forage crops to produce beef and eggs rather than to grow wheat.  The farmers cut down their acreage under wheat and even the wheat they did produce they used for feeding animals rather than selling for human consumption and a country which normally and before 1939 had enough wheat of its own production to satisfy all its population finds itself in the year 1947 with only about 50 per cent. of its requirements by way of wheat.  That is the principal reason that France has been threatened by starvation unless the Marshall Plan comes to her aid.</P>
    <P>In fact, it would appear that you can do more harm than good by policies of restricting some prices if you do not restrict and control all the other prices wisely and in accordance with your restriction of some and there seems to be no permanently satisfactory half-way house between a completely controlled economy and a completely free economy.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat in Ireland is high. I think it is something like 55/- to 60/- a barrel but does the House realise that the price of wheat in Chicago is probably higher?  At all events, in August of this year it was 2 dollars 23 cents a bushel and, unless my arithmetic is wrong, that corresponds to a price of about 60/- a barrel over here and it is certainly three times as high as the price at which wheat was saleable in the United States of America in 1939. In fact, most of the prices which are reflected in the high cost of living that we all complain about and are all inclined to denounce the Government for are imposed on us by external circumstances for which the Government has got no responsibility whatever.  They are, in fact, a reflection of the fact that the world is passing through a crisis of acute scarcity.  That crisis was bound <Col N="1117" /> to reflect itself in suffering all round and the only problem for statesmanship is how to equalise the burden of suffering and prevent it falling unduly on any section of the community.</P>
    <P>I think the Government realises the precarious world situation in which we find ourselves and has learned a lot lately, partly, perhaps, in consequence of its recent taking part in various world conferences, and it has shown a certain realism about this whole matter and a certain willingness to play the part of the good neighbour in the society of European nations and, God knows, many of them need good neighbours at present.  In consequence of that improvement in its whole outlook on things, it is going to be severely punished for its virtues at the next election.  I have considerable sympathy in anything like that, because I have often been punished for my virtues myself and that perhaps tempts me to develop a certain analogy which has occurred to me between the career of the Minister's Party and the career of the Prodigal Son.  During the past 15 years the Minister's Party has by no means been in the political wilderness&mdash;on the contrary, it has enjoyed the fruits of office&mdash;but perhaps during much of that time it was in a kind of moral wilderness, living on the husks of exploded political, economic and ideological fantasies.  But lately, and altogether to its credit, it has decided to come out of that moral wilderness and to return, so to speak, to its father.  The Irish people, the father in question, so unlike the father in the parable, has slaughtered the fatted calf and fed it to the greyhounds and is entirely disposed to send the Minister's Party back again into the political wilderness.  That is just not fair and the Minister's Party has my utmost sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Earl of Longford The Earl of Longford">
      <NameTxt>The Earl of Longford</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much left to say on this question, but there are certain points which I feel I ought to mention.  The first is the necessity for realising that it is undoubtedly the duty of the Government to see that the people are fed, clothed and housed.  I do not mean that the Government itself should <Col N="1118" /> feed, clothe or house them, but that they should give them a reasonable chance of doing it for themselves and nothing ought to be allowed to interfere with that first duty of the Government. We are told of the terrible times 100 years ago in the days of the Famine, when great quantities of food were exported from this country and hundreds of thousands of people died of starvation here.  I am not saying that that is likely to happen again, but it is something which could happen, and, under no circumstances, for no reason whatever, should the Government neglect its duty of seeing that the people are placed in a position in which they will be able to get the necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>These, however, are abnormal times and measures may have to be taken which may seem perhaps to interfere with that supply of the necessaries of life.  These necessaries must be provided and no amount of exports is any good, if they are paid for in all kinds of commodities and if as a result the people go hungry or have not sufficient clothing.  We must remember particularly that the children represent the future of the nation, and that, unless there is sufficient food to bring up these children in decent healthy conditions, the country has and deserves no future.  As I say, these are very abnormal times and in order to ensure that the necessaries of life will be available to the citizens the most drastic measures must sometimes be taken.  These drastic measures in this Budget are necessary in order that the men, women and children of Ireland may be able to buy food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that further measures may be necessary and we may have to consider further food subsidies.  There are economic objections to subsidies, but they are probably the only way at present, as an emergency measure, of getting food cheaper.  There is a great deal of irresponsible talk on this matter.  A great many people who want these subsidies do not want to pay for them.  We must all pay for them and they are impossible without being paid for.  If we borrow, we merely pay in the future, and there is <Col N="1119" /> no way of getting the money except, apparently, by taking it from the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It is regarded as a grievance that, in order to get food, our drink, or our cinemas must be taxed.  I am, perhaps, not entirely impartial on the question of cinemas.  I think the cinema is something which can very well afford to be taxed.  It is an industry which is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners and which, to my mind, does very little good to this country.  I am all for providing people with entertainment, and if the cinemas were Irish-owned and provided Irish films, I would not object in the least, but, in the meantime, would it not be possible to provide some other form of entertainment which would not involve the expenditure of large quantities of dollars?  Drink may be a necessity and cigarettes also be a necessity, although I am a non-smoker and, perhaps, do not drink as much as some people do, but I cannot see that we need all these cinemas.  They are spreading around the country and appearing in smaller and smaller places, one result of which is the complete destruction of the theatrical companies which used to tour the country and the throwing out of work of live actors and actresses.</P>
    <P>I would much rather see a revival of the theatre all over the country&mdash;not necessarily highbrow.  Let it be lowbrow, if you like&mdash;variety, music hall, or any other type&mdash;but let it be some form of entertainment which is native-owned and employing live Irish actors and actresses and providing a form of entertainment which the people will enjoy just as much as these miserable films which, I cannot believe, from a national or any other point of view, are any good for the country. They may be a pleasant thing to have if we can afford them, but I am not sure we can.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tax on drink, I wonder whether it will very much reduce consumption, but I think that no man will resent a slight extra tax on drink if it means that his children will be decently fed.  I cannot believe that the whole nation is so addicted to drink <Col N="1120" /> as some people seem to think.  There seems to be a great deal of irresponsible talk with regard to this matter of drink.  I would not like to suggest that it had anything to do with the forthcoming elections, but one hears it all over the country amongst all classes of people.  A great deal of it is due to ignorance.  It is very hard for people who are not in Government circles&mdash; and perhaps the people in Government circles are partly to blame&mdash;to realise what the position is, to realise the international situation and the effect it has on us, an effect which we cannot understand and which, at the same time, we seek to avoid.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to find any method of taxation which will not hit the poor man eventually.  If there was a system which would hit only the rich and not the poor, I would say that it should be tried first, but I do not believe there is any such system.  Certainly the methods employed in England seem to have brought that country to the verge of disaster.  There is a great tendency amongst some people to regard England as the promised land, flowing with milk and honey, when it is flowing with nothing but paper money, and I do not see that we should want to copy what England has done.  Senator Johnston has made that very clear and has given a very reasoned account of the position there.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I quite appreciate the difficulties under which the Government are labouring in this matter, and one thing which these taxes will make us realise is the enormous amount of money which the slightest reduction in the cost of living involves. That cost, however, must be reduced, and, of course, the only way to reduce it is by making the essentials of life more plentiful.  More goods is the way to get cheaper goods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see much of an objectionable nature in this Budget.  My criticism of it is that it does not go far enough.  I feel that it makes a very inadequate contribution to the whole of the inflationary pressure. I am not popular with many people I meet in daily life for saying <Col N="1121" /> it, but again I say that I regret that the Minister has abandoned the principle of excess profits tax&mdash;I do not say necessarily in the form it took during the war, but in some modified form.  It would have produced some £4,000,000, and if that sum had been applied to the reduction of the cost of living, it would have meant a very substantial contribution.  I cannot see any indication that the abandonment of that tax has stimulated production or local enterprise.  If I am wrong, the Minister can give instances to the contrary. Naturally, I would not like to see a tax of that kind in our permanent code, but while the conditions of scarcity continue the reasons for it are just as strong after the war as they were during the war.</P>
      <P>The need for some tax of that kind is also influenced by the whole of our national economy.  We say&mdash;rightly so &mdash;that the best protection to the customer is free enterprise, with full production and a consumer protected by competition; but in the artificial conditions of sheltered industry, as we have under our tariff policy, industries which spring up very often with no knowledge among the manufacturers themselves, industries that may tax the raw material of secondary industries, I feel that you have not got the protection which, under a freer economy, competition would provide.  I know it is a difficult question and one that needs examination.  I hope the Minister is going to be in the position to introduce our next Budget and, in the meantime, that he will consider whether the ordinary system of economy under free enterprise does provide the protection to the consumers which it would under conditions where our whole economy was not so artificially protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to other taxes which the Government might consider, I come back to the betting tax.  The Government has a moral responsibility in the authority it gives to betting and if I had the responsibility of the Minister&mdash;which Heaven forbid &mdash;I would tax betting as much as it could bear.  I suppose it might drive betting underground, but I would almost rather that than have it <Col N="1122" /> blatantly practised as it is to-day.  It is an immoral blight on the community. I would tax betting as much as it would stand.  I would give a certain portion of the proceeds, as is done now, to the racing and horse-breeding industries, but I would take every penny I could beyond that.  It is nonproductive and makes no contribution to our national wealth.  It merely encourages a very undesirable form of activity.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider before the next Budget&mdash;I think he said he would do so on the last Budget&mdash;the taxation of the capital portion of an annuity.  It is very unjust that a person who spends his own capital is not taxed except on the income, but if he buys an annuity he is taxed on the whole capital and income.  As a matter of elementary justice that should be considered.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider also for the next Budget the increased property stamp duty on charities.  I know that in the Church it is sometimes necessary to buy properties purely for charitable purposes.  The increase hits them very hard and I do not think that the very heavy subsidiary tax of 5 per cent. should apply to purchases of that kind.  If provident societies or building societies are exempted, charities have an equal claim.  This tax also seems very hard on people who are looking for houses. One item of our national economy which bears hardest on our people is the housing difficulty and the Minister is doing it a disservice by increasing the stamp duty to this extent.  I would be in favour of taxing people who are merely speculating in house property. The worst aspect of the present inflation is that people are buying houses with a view to selling them, adding nothing to productivity and not helping to solve the problem.  That is going on and is very deplorable.  I have seen houses changing hands twice a year, at increased prices.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the poor person who wants to buy his own house, as he cannot get one to rent.  It seems hard that a person, genuinely buying his own house for himself and his <Col N="1123" /> family, should have to pay not only an enormous profit to the builder&mdash;the Minister knows that better than I do&mdash; but also this heavy stamp duty.  I hope that, before the main Budget, the Minister will consider whether some means could not be devised whereby people buying their own houses would not have to pay this increase.  I know the administration is difficult, but in the interests of equity it should be done. The Minister should consider whether something cannot be done to limit the profits made by these building speculators. There again, it is a new approach and a departure from free enterprise.  Material is scarce and the Government is licensing material, yet these fortunate people are able to get it&mdash;some get it easier than others, one does not know how that is done&mdash;and then they are able to charge 40 or 50 per cent. profit on the cost.  It is very wrong, in view of the housing scarcity. I know it is not easy to control, but some attempt should be made.  This is merely a suggestion and is a matter for close inquiry by experts.  I cannot see the difficulty of ascertaining the cost of a new house&mdash;I do not mean a very big, rich man's house&mdash;but a house for which a person can afford at the very most £3,000.  He should be protected in some way against these enormous profits.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed not to see considered, in relation to the balance of payments, the possibility of a meat ration.  We can sell all the meat we can get and it only seems common sense that we should adopt some kind of meat ration, in order to help the very alarming balance of payments.  I see this morning there is a startling visible gap of £55,000,000 in our adverse balance of payments.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear Senator Johnston say that the Government had no responsibility for the increased cost of living.  I know that a lot of the circumstances are beyond their control, but I feel that they are not entirely free from responsibility because of their failure to get to close quarters with this question of inflation. I do give the Government a good character for not borrowing, which is <Col N="1124" /> certainly one of the causes of inflation, but not the only one.  In my opinion speculation in houses, not for sale, is certainly a form of inflation to which the Government might turn their attention. As I say, the Minister has a very difficult job at the present time since the whole economy of the world is in an awful mess.  I think really that, in spite of all our difficulties, we are very fortunate in this country compared to most countries in the world.</P>

      <P>I have very little comment to make on the Bill.  I think it is just one of those occasions when we just cannot feel, like the dog at its father's funeral, neither sorry nor glad.  I could not help feeling, when some of the critics of the Bill were speaking, that they did not feel glad that the Budget is as bad as it is, and were sorry that it is not worse than it is.  For myself, I feel both sorry and glad.  I feel sorry in this way, that the Budget brings home to us in a very realistic manner the fact that we have not got out of the difficulties brought about by the war.  The Budget has brought home to us very forcibly that, not only do these difficulties continue, but that they are very likely to continue for a very considerable time ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel glad, at the same time, that the Government have faced the issue in the way that they have, and have decided that the prices of essential commodities must be held to a reasonable level.  I was glad to hear more than one Senator express dissatisfaction at the efforts that have been <Col N="1125" /> made by certain elements in the community to try to convince the community that this Budget is a serious blow at the community.  I think this House is doing a good turn to itself and to the nation in drawing attention to the fact that the Government have done the only thing that it was possible for them to do in bringing in the Budget in the way they did, and are doing a good turn to the nation and to the House itself in drawing the attention of the community to the fact that it must do something to help itself out of the difficulties that unfortunately have been forced upon us.</P>
    <P>For myself, I feel very annoyed at the efforts that have been made to play on the weakness of certain elements in the community who feel that they ought to have more freedom to spend money on certain commodities and that much more of these commodities ought to be made available to them.  I draw attention to this: that, according to the White Paper on national income published some time ago, the figures there indicate that whereas the community is paying £92.8 millions for its foodstuffs, that same community is paying £35.4 millions for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, and is paying for amusements just £3,000,000.  I think, everything considered, the mere pittance which the community is asked to save on things of this kind is a very small contribution towards bringing about something like recovery in the national economy.</P>
    <P>The figure is not as significant as it might be, but it will become more significant if one looks at the figures for production, which are given in thousands, in the last issue of the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  I notice there that in the case of beer, home-made and imported, retained for home consumption, there has been a continual steep <Col N="1126" /> rise from 1944.  The figures may be interesting.  In 1944 they were 61.16; in 1945, 67.79, and in 1946, 76.23.  Again, in the case of potable spirits, home made and imported, retained for home consumption, we have the same trend: 37.51, 61.97 and 69.82.  We have the same again in regard to unmanufactured tobacco, home-grown and imported and retained for home consumption. The figure for 1944 is 789 lbs.; for. 1945, 819 lbs., and in 1946, 971 lbs.  Surely, in view of the expansion in the consumption of these commodities, and in view of the enormous amount of national income that is being spent on them, it is no hardship to ask the consumers of these commodities to make some contribution towards stabilisation and the lowering of prices of essential commodities.  I think that is the only way in which this matter ought to be looked at, and I think it is the bounden duty of everyone in public life to bring these facts home to the community.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say, because we have to adjourn now.  Again, I want to say that we all regret, as has been so well expressed by Senator the Earl of Longford, that the necessity for this Budget has arisen.  At the same time, I think we have to pay a compliment to the Government that they took their courage in their hands in the way they did and faced the issue in the way they did.  I believe myself that when the community gets the chance it will express its appreciation in the same way.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 20th November, 1947.</P>
