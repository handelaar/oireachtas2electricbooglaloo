      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, this is an outrageous performance by the Leader of the House.  He puts down an amendment to finish the debate after one day and he does not deign to give one single word of explanation to the House.  We are asked to decide the Order of Business but how can we do that if we do not know what he is at? He displays a degree of arrogance that even this Government have never exceeded.</P>

      <P>The question before the House is whether the Order of Business should or should not be the taking of items 1, 2 and 3.  We are concerned with whether No. 1 should be discussed and not whether it should be agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it is a bit more than that.  The question is whether the Government are going to put an end to the debate on the Finance Bill, something which has never happened before.  It is rather more than just an Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my few initial remarks, this is the major <Col N="222" /> annual debate by the Seanad on the major piece of legislation that comes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Finance Bill.  We have had one day at it and have not even completed Second Stage.  We were proceeding in a very orderly manner yesterday and adjourned in a very orderly manner last night with a view to proceeding with the debate, hopefully in an orderly manner. today when without any indication&mdash; although indication was obviously given to some Senators&mdash;we find this morning a crude guillotine motion put down to end proceedings at 5 o'clock today.</P>
      <P>I understand fully that finance legislation must be signed by the President within four months of the budget proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I do not like interrupting Senator Lenihan but I was under the impression that the discussion on the Order of Business had concluded.  I waited for other contributions and it would seem to me, with respect, that we can either discuss this on the Order of Business or we can discuss it on the motion.  I suggest that we should not have a repetition of arguments both on the Order of Business and on the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point of order that Senator O'Higgins has raised is one that had begun to exercise the mind of the Chair.  It must be quite clear that what is before us now is the question of what business will be taken today.  If Senators exhaust the topic of the merits of Motion No. 1 now they may be in danger of precluding themselves from having a substantial debate on when it is ordered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that anything I say in regard to the Order of Business does not prejudice or preclude me or any of my colleagues from discussing subsequently the motion proper?  We can have two debates then, a debate on the Order of Business and a debate on the motion.  Is that quite clear?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>If I might say, the Senator is perfectly entitled to discuss the appearance of Motion No. 1 on the Order Paper and the manner of its appearance on the Order Paper but should avoid the merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself entirely to that aspect and we will discuss the merits of the motion and the reasons for it at a later stage.  That is the area I was about to go into and I bow to the ruling of the Chair on that aspect being removed to a further debate.  The actual appearance of the motion comes genuinely to Senators on this side of the House&mdash;and I hope to all Senators who believe in the democratic process&mdash;as something of a shock. It obviously is not a shock to the collected ranks of Senators on the other side who have been drummed in here this morning to function with their feet&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that we have here a crude guillotine motion which is designed, in effect, to chop debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a type of parliamentary device that is used only in the most exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Finance Bill is the annual major debate in which the Dáil and Seanad have an opportunity to examine the entire economic progress.  The Seanad spent yesterday discussing the Second Stage of the Bill and were preceding in an orderly fashion.  Indeed, I had the <Col N="224" /> pleasure of a fruitful exchange of views between Senator Alexis FitzGerald and myself in which he made a very constructive contribution in reply to what I considered was a constructive contribution. The debate proceeded, with contributions from my colleague, Senator Yeats, and other Senators, in an orderly and responsible manner until the adjournment last night.</P>
    <P>This debate would have proceeded in an orderly fashion, as is the custom with this House, with Committee and Report Stages today in time for the President's signature on Thursday evening or Friday, whichever is the appropriate day.  The debate could have continued today and tomorrow and when the House was given a firm indication as to time-limit, having regard to the exigencies of the four-months' deadline for the Presidential signature, this side would not have been found wanting in reaching a constructive solution to the problem.  As the debate was finishing last night there was no indication that anything other than a responsible attitude by all Senators towards the Bill was being adopted last night.  Yet, the debate on this major Finance Bill is curtailed to two half day sittings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senator to keep to the point that there is a proposition to curtail and not to stray into the area of the merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposition is to curtail the debate in this manner.  The point I wish to make is that we commenced this debate yesterday at 2.30 p.m. and we finished last night at 8.30 p.m.  This represented one half-day's debate.  It is now proposed to start at 10.30 a.m. and to finish at 5 o'clock.  Therefore, two half-day's debate are proposed for this major financial measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this curtailment escapes me.  Everybody who has participated in parliamentary proceedings will be aware that a guillotine motion such as this is only brought in when there is an absolute need for the Government to get a measure through to beat a deadline and when the Opposition are behaving in an irresponsible manner and preventing the deadline being <Col N="225" /> reached.  There was no such indication last evening.  The Senators opposite are aware that, although we may be small in number, we have always sought to act in a co-operative manner in this House.</P>
    <P>In the interest of order, procedure and the democratic process of the House, I submit that this motion be withdrawn. It is an insult to the whole parliamentary process and to democracy.  It is an insult to those people who have interests, directly or indirectly, in the debate.  It is an insult to the people who have sent us here to legislate on their behalf.  The Government are not just throwing this in the face of the Opposition; they are regarding the Oireachtas as a charade and are telling the people that is what they think of them.  That is the contemptuous view of one of the House of Parliament as held by the Government.  We have an obligation to the people to ensure that this House carries out its constitutional function in a constructive and democratic manner. The Government are not insulting the Opposition, they are insulting themselves and are trying to insult the people, but the people will not respond to that type of treatment.  Instead they will respond by voting against the Government when the opportunity occurs, whether in a by-election or in the coming general election.  This type of treatment by the leader of the House on behalf of the Government will result in a demand for the Government to get out and make way for those who will govern in a responsible manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this question of whether the unprecedented guillotine of the Finance Bill is to go through, one of the problems we are faced with is that the Leader of the House has so far refused, in spite of being asked, to give any explanation for the guillotine.  The President must sign this Bill not later than four months after the passage of the General Resolution in the Dáil. That resolution was passed at approximately 7 p.m. on the 28th of January. This would appear to mean and I think it is the position that the President could sign this Bill within the legal regulations up to 7 p.m. on Friday next.  Therefore, there is no reason in the wide world why <Col N="226" /> we could not spend all day today, if necessary, debating the Finance Bill and again all day tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I would put to the Leader of the House that he should make some effort to be reasonable on this matter.  There are certain minor technical problems involved in presenting a Bill to the President for signature.  He must be presented with six vellum copies and so on, but I hardly think that anyone, least of all the Leader of the House, imagines this House is going to pass any recommendations in the course of this debate.  Indeed, we have already said on this side that we do not propose to put down any recommendations and therefore I should have thought that any intelligent civil servant would already be preparing the vellum copies needed.</P>
      <P>I propose, therefore, to put down an amendment to this Order of Business. The amendment being in regard to the guillotine motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is foreshadowing an amendment to Motion No. 1 and this should be moved after the Order of Business has been agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it this way: would he accept an amendment in line 7 to take out the word &ldquo;today&rdquo; and put in the word &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; so that we could debate this in the ordinary way until 5 p.m. tomorrow&mdash;I do not know whether it would run that long&mdash;but this would give as much time as one can expect under the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would put it to the Leader of the House that this is a sensible suggestion and if he is willing to accept it we can just get on with the business now.  Is he willing to accept it?  Apparently, he is not so willing.  We have then the position that the Leader of the House comes in here this morning, proposes this unprecedented motion on the Finance Bill and in spite of requests from this side of the House he refuses point blank to give any explanation.  He said he would give an explanation at the end when everybody else has spoken and nobody else can deal with the matter. He refuses point blank to give any explanation.  One can only describe this as a complete display of heedless arrogance.  It is a display of contempt for <Col N="227" /> the House, contempt for the Parliamentary process, contempt indeed for his own colleagues on that side of the House.  They tell us that they did not expect to see this motion on the Order Paper.  Does Senator FitzGerald know why this motion is being put down? Does he consider it necessary?  Does he know why it is necessary?  Has he or any other Senator on that side of the House any idea?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>He came in avidly, willingly and enthusiastically to prevent any further debate on this Bill.  I should have thought that he of all people would recognise the enormity of this step.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is wandering now into what should be a second debate and his own words are betraying him.  He is talking about voting on the motion to do so and so. The motion before the House is that the Order of Business be items 1, 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>On this motion, I am perfectly entitled to comment on the attitude of the Leader of the House and, of course, of the Government and the Senators opposite bringing in a motion of this kind without any explanation of any sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I must warn Senators against straying.  The fundamental question here is that there cannot be two debates of what is essentially the same matter.  If there are to be two debates there must be a distinction made between what is the fundamental matter of the first debate and what is the fundamental matter of the second. The Senator has been talking quite properly on the question of the appearance on the Order Paper of Motion No. 1, but he should beware of the dangers of crossing over into the discussion of the merits of Motion No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Col N="228" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do think I am perfectly in order in discussing the attitude of the Leader of the House in refusing to explain why he has brought in this motion&mdash;a motion which after all, is unprecedented, because in 50 years of Irish political and constitutional history there has never been a motion to guillotine debate on the Finance Bill in either House.  It is, in other words, an unprecedented unique occasion.  For this reason it seems incredible that it should be done in this way without any single word of explanation, with an explanation actually refused by the Leader of the House. When I suggested that what we propose is a very reasonable compromise with regard to the timing of this debate, the Leader of the House refused point blank to react in any way.</P>
      <P>Now one wonders what is the point of the parliamentary process.  What point is there in even discussing the Order of Business under these circumstances. The proposal I made was a reasonable one.  It has been refused. We will therefore in due course have to discuss this motion in full.  Senators will come in determined to be used as cannon fodder to push this motion through.  We will perhaps get an explanation from the Leader of the House at the end of this discussion, but the discussion must take place in the absence of any kind of explanation. One can only regret that the Leader of this House should have behaved in this fashion, a fashion which can only damage the reputation of the House.  It certainly will not happen under a Fianna Fáil Government and one can only hope that, even under this Government, it will never happen again.</P>

      <P>As one of the two longest serving Members in this House, having been here for almost 20 years, I regret very much the situation that has arisen in regard to the Finance Bill this year.  In the circumstances I suggest that the amendment proposed by Senator Yeats be considered seriously.  I will have a further amendment requesting an adjournment debate at the end of this Seanad session to make up for the lack of debate on the central issues that we have had in this session.  It would be regrettable that this occasion should <Col N="229" /> degenerate into a political football across the House.  I suggest that we pass the motion for the Order of Business as it is but since we have not been given proper time to discuss the Bill let us make the maximum use of the time available before the Bill must be signed. Let us, too, have an adequate adjournment debate before the summer recess. With those reservations I suggest we proceed to deal with the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure what I am replying to.  If I am to follow Senator Lenihan, it would be probably to a final rally at a by-election.  I do not intend to follow Senator Lenihan, nor do I resent Senator Yeats' charges.  On reflection the Senator will probably regret having made them&mdash; whatever reflection he is capable of&mdash;in the heat of the moment and he will begin to appreciate that the sole reason I did not give any full explanation as regards No. 1 was the reason which I tendered to the Chair.  I understood that I was concluding the discussion on the Order of Business on the previous occasion I was on my feet and I explained I would go fully into the question of the motion when it was being moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any point in following all the hares that have been raised.  Senator Lenihan referred to a charade.  Anything more resembling a charade than the performance we have witnessed in the last half hour would be difficult to find.  We are all conscious of the fact that there is a limited time available to us for discussion.  Senators opposite deliberately chose&mdash;acquit Senator Quinlan from this&mdash;to further reduce that time by the performance we have witnessed in the last half hour. I fully sympathise with Senator Quinlan's view on this.  I do not know whether it will be possible to arrange that additional time might be provided to the Seanad for a debate of a general nature by way of an adjournment <Col N="230" /> debate.  If that could be done it would be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>I do not want to fall into the error of justifying by detailed argument the appearance of Motion No. 1 on the Order Paper.  I may say in general at this stage that we are all conscious of the fact that we are up against a time limit.  We are conscious of the fact, if we have done any research into it, that the time provided for discussion of the Finance Bill this year is the average time that has been permitted to the Seanad for many years past.  The usual time taken in the Seanad for the Finance Bill is two days.  That is what we were aiming at this year.  I do not want to be charged with breaking confidences, but in view of Senator Lenihan's remarks and the remarks of Senator Yeats, I am entitled to say that I discussed the timing of this debate with the Leader of the Opposition.  I made every effort to secure agreement from the Opposition both as regards the conclusion of the Second Stage of the debate and as regards finalising the debate in this House.  I did not get it from them and I did not get any return from Senator Lenihan&mdash;</P>

I failed to get agreement and it is because of that and only because of that that I felt it was necessary to proceed in this way in order to bring matters to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>One would imagine, listening to the debate this morning, that there were only a few Senators in the House, namely the Leader of the House and the few gentlemen sitting in front of me.  I am sure I am entitled to speak here as equally as any of those three.  I know quite well that the Cathaoirleach does not want to hear me.  I am prepared to accept that.  Even to the point of my being put out of the House, I will make my views known. Last evening when we were finishing at 8.30 o'clock, there were two Senators on the Government side of the House and the Leader of the House inquired how many more wished to speak on this side of the House.  Senator Uí Eachthéirn was speaking, Senator Cowan offered, Senator Garrett offered and I offered.  But when we come in here this morning we find that instead of having Senator Uí Eachthéirn continuing the debate the Order Paper has been changed.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Brennan that contributions of Senators on the Order of Business are always welcome but the contributions should be made before the Leader of the House is called on to conclude the debate.  The Chair is always careful to look in all directions in the House to make sure no Senator is offering.  Even if someone rises simultaneously with the Leader of the House the custom is to allow the Senator to contribute.  It is not in order to make a contribution after the Leader of the House has concluded the debate.  It has been proposed that the Order of Business be Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive.  An amendment has been moved that No. 1 be deleted.  The question before the House is: &ldquo;That No. 1 stand part.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on the four stages of the Finance Bill, 1976, and on the motion of concurrence with the earlier signature of the Bill by the President, if not previously brought to a conclusion, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. today by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the Questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion: and that the Question to be put from the Chair to bring the proceedings on the Committee Stage, Report Stage and Fifth Stage to a conclusion shall be &ldquo;That the Committee Stage and Report Stage are hereby completed and the Bill is hereby returned to Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear, notwithstanding the discussion we have had, that this motion is definitely not moved in any spirit of acrimony.  The position is that in the absence of an agreed timetable for the conclusion of the discussion of the Finance Bill today, it is necessary to have this motion in order to ensure completion of discussion of the Bill today.  As far as I am concerned acceptance of this motion will not necessarily rule out agreement on a timetable provided that timetable provides for finishing the discussion on the Finance Bill today.  The motion is deliberately drafted in the manner in which it appears on the Order Paper in order to allow the Opposition the option of deciding whether they wish to continue the Second Reading discussion of the measure or to bring the Second Reading discussion to a conclusion and to devote most of the day to detailed Committee consideration of the Bill. The necessity for this motion arises by reason of the fact that under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, Financial Resolutions lapse unless they are approved by legislation within four months.  I recognise that some people might see a desirable object in allowing them to lapse.  Talking seriously from a financial point of view and from the point of view of the State, obviously that would be an insufferable position.</P>
      <P>When the Bill has been passed, as will be known in particular to Senator Lenihan as an ex-Minister, it is necessary to have the Bill engrossed and to have it presented to the President for his signature.  So far as the actual time is concerned, the budget resolutions were passed in the Dáil on 28th January.  The absolute time limit for them becoming law under the provisions which exist at the moment would be Friday next.</P>

      <P>If the result of the debate in this House were to produce any recommendations it would be necessary for the Dáil to consider those recommendations and it would be quite impossible in those circumstances to have the Bill presented to the President for signature by Friday.  Senator Yeats or any other Senator may scoff at that possibility.  Possibly he is correct in his assessment that no recommendations would be passed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those recommendations would have to be considered by the Dáil and it would then become virtually impossible to have this Bill signed by the President on Friday.  Quite apart from that, we were accused of contempt and arrogance this morning.  We have to recognise that there is a third part of the Oireachtas in addition to the two Houses&mdash;the President.  The President is entitled to a certain amount of courtesy and consideration from both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would show very little consideration or courtesy to the President if he were expected to receive this Bill and sign it blindfolded without getting any opportunity even of reading the Bill.  That would be a demonstration of contempt for the office of the President that I have no intention of engaging in.</P>

      <P>I dislike this situation.  The Minister for Finance dislikes it.  It has percolated through to us that the Opposition dislike this situation.  Yesterday Senator Yeats, in opening his contribution on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill, protested at the fact that the House was only receiving the Bill at this stage.  May I say that, apart from the phrase he used about the Bill being flung at the House, I would accept the protest which Senator Yeats made yesterday as being a valid one and representing a reasonable view?  It is a point of view that was expressed last year from this side of the House by my colleague, Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  It has been expressed by Opposition speakers down through the years.  I regard it as a valid protest representing a perfectly reasonable point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to remember that our quarrel is not with the Minister and the <Col N="236" /> Government.  It is essentially a matter of regulating the position between the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would not be allowed to indulge in any criticism of the procedures of the other House, but I am entitled to say that what is involved here is not something that is brought about by the Minister, not something brought about by the Government but something which has occurred by reason of the length of time which was required by the Dáil for consideration of the Finance Bill.  I would personally welcome a united appeal from this House to the other House&mdash;I am sure this would have the endorsement of the Minister for Finance &mdash;to let us have the Finance Bill in time to enable the Seanad to give it some reasonable consideration.</P>
    <P>I said earlier this morning, and I want to put this fact on record here, that for several years past the Seanad has had only two days discussion of the Finance Bill.  In each of the last five years, with the exception of one, 1974, there have been only two days occupied by the Seanad in consideration of the Finance Bill.  In 1971 when Fianna Fáil were in Government the Seanad had two days on the Finance Bill; in 1972 when Fianna Fáil were in Government the Seanad had two days on the Finance Bill; in 1973 the Seanad had two days on the Finance Bill; in 1974 the Seanad had four days on the Finance Bill; last year the Seanad had two days on the Finance Bill, and this year, if this motion is accepted, the Seanad will have two days on the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>Two half days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In contrast with that, the Dáil consideration given to the Finance Bill in those years was in 1971, 11 weeks; in 1972, 12 weeks; in 1973, ten weeks, in 1974, 16 weeks; in 1975, 16 weeks; and in 1976, 16 weeks. The Minister when he was in office for a comparatively short period of time took a step in order to try to relieve the situation which was developing.  In 1974, in section 85 of the Finance Bill of that year, he amended the provisions of the 1927 Act so as to allow an additional month.  Up to that the period of time between the proposal of the budget resolutions in the Dáil and the time <Col N="237" /> when they had to become law was only three months.</P>
      <P>The hope was expressed that the Seanad would benefit from the additional month, that we would be able to give genuine, serious and proper consideration to the Finance Bill.  But what has happened?  When he was speaking on this matter last year, Senator Yeats made a forecast which, I am afraid, has proved to be correct.  When the Senator was speaking on the Finance Bill on 8th May last year he had some disagreement with Senator Lenihan and I quote from column 1291 of the Official Report of 8th May, 1975:</P>
      <P>I hesitate to make any contradictory remarks at this stage when both the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition appear to be in agreement on something, but I am very doubtful whether adding a couple of more months to the time would make any difference.  I do not believe for a moment&mdash;and I do not wish to criticise the other House&mdash; that this Bill would have reached us today if it were not for the fact that the deadline was against us.  If you add two months, it merely means we will get the Bill two months later. That is my personal view, based on some experience as to what happens to this Bill when it reaches this House.</P>
      <P>The Senator concluded, referring to the fact that the Bill was being discussed while the Dáil was still sitting:</P>
      <P>There is that advantage but I doubt if playing around with dates would make any practical difference. I am afraid we are always likely to get this type of Bill at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats' view has proved to be quite justified.  From the figures I have given it is quite clear that when the Minister for Finance went to the trouble of allowing an additional four weeks for discussion the entire length of time allowed has been taken up by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will analyse the figures.  In 1974, when the change first came about, the additional four weeks were granted.  The Dáil took <Col N="238" /> 16 weeks that year instead of ten, as in 1973; 12 in 1972; and 11 in 1971.  In other words, the entire additional four weeks in 1974 were taken up by the Dáil. In 1975 the entire additional four weeks were taken up by the Dáil, and this year the entire additional time has been taken up by the Dáil because a period of 16 weeks, once allowance is made for the Easter recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was circulated with figures.  While I am on this&mdash; and I say this not as a criticism because I regard it as quite valid and quite natural&mdash;I understand that in the Dáil discussion something like 95 per cent of the time was occupied by Opposition speakers.  The budget was introduced on 28th January this year and the budget debate concluded six weeks later on the 10th March.  That was six weeks. The Finance Bill was circulated on 31st March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the period allowed from the time of the proposal of the financial resolutions. I have tried to make that clear. The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill commenced in the Dáil on the 11th of this month and did not conclude until the 20th.  It was passed by the Dáil on that day.  The point I am making is that the additional four weeks which the present Minister allowed have in <Col N="239" /> fact and in practice been absorbed completely by Dáil consideration of financial proposals and we have not received the benefit of it here.  The Minister for Finance would welcome and fully endorse any arrangement which could be made between this House and the Dáil which would enable us to get the Finance Bill a fortnight or so earlier than we are getting it now so that proper consideration could be given to the discussions here.  That is the position in relation to this motion.  From one point of view, if there were recommendations from this House it would be impossible to have the legislation completed within the time limit.  Apart from that, it would be a grave discourtesy to the President if we were to present a Bill of this nature to him for signature without reading on Friday next.</P>
      <P>This motion is drafted in such a way that it is entirely open to the Opposition to decide how they want to divide up the time, whether they want to carry on the Second Stage or whether they want to get into a Committee discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is entirely a matter for themselves.  I think it is regrettable that so much time has been taken out of the limited time available for consideration of the Finance Bill, but I am not the political adviser of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In an atmosphere of two by-elections I suppose they will advise themselves as they think best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get this whole matter into perspective.  First of all, the delay is not caused by the Dáil. The delay is caused by the ineptitude of the Government in producing the Finance Bill at a late stage.  The Finance Bill that we have here now was only circulated at the start of April.  Taking two weeks out of that, Easter week and Holy week, that means that there have been five weeks' parliamentary time for consideration of the Finance Bill between the Dáil and Seanad.  In my view it is outrageous that, when the budget is introduced in January after careful preparation of the various measures announced in the budget and <Col N="240" /> incorporated in the Finance Bill, the Houses of the Oireachtas, both Deputies and Senators, have to wait until early April for the actual production of the Bill.  This curtails parliamentary consideration of it to five weeks.  This point has already been made in the Dáil.  I want to make it quite clear that that is the reason for the truncated debate.  The Government's incompetence in producing the measure and circulating it at a very late stage curtailed the debate in both Houses.</P>
      <P>An important point to remember is that the four-months' period written into the statue does not expire until 7 p.m. on Friday.  There is no point in bringing the President into this discussion. This is a Money Bill and the President has no function with regard to referring it to the Supreme Court. He has functions in regard to other legislation.  He has a constitutional obligation to consider them.  If he doubts the constitutionality of any Bill he has the right to refer it to the Supreme Court.  But that does not obtain in regard to a Money Bill.  The President has no function in regard to the Finance Bill except to sign it.  That is the constitutional reality.  So we can get that one out of the way.  That means then that we could have had an orderly and constructive debate on this matter continuing through today and into tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House is well aware that he would not have found me at all wanting in accommodating him in arranging time between the Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Indeed, I am constantly getting into trouble with my colleagues here for being too accommodating to the Leader of the House.  There is no reason in the wide earthly world why we could not have reached an accommodation at some stage during today instead of bringing in this clumsy, crude guillotine motion after a half day's discussion of the Second Stage, which is all we had yesterday.  It was quite evident that a number of my colleagues were rising to speak last night.  They would have made their contributions during the morning, we would have progressed to Committee Stage some time this afternoon or this evening, would have <Col N="241" /> discussed Report Stage tomorrow and would probably have completed the Bill some time tomorrow afternoon.  That was the pace of the debate last night.</P>
    <P>I am long enough in both Houses to realise that this was not a contentious debate in the sense of any irresponsible or negative approach being adopted. There was controversy.  We were being rightly critical.  The debate was proceeding at a normal parliamentary pace when we adjourned last night at half past eight as Senator Kit Ahern was making her contribution.  We had several other contributors on this side of the House.  The debate would have proceeded accordingly this morning and this afternoon and we would have reached a conclusion either later this evening or some time early tomorrow, giving well over 24 hours for consideration of the Bill by the President.</P>
    <P>That is the sequence of events for the record.  That is exactly as it appeared last night to me.  I did not come back to Senator O'Higgins last night.  I intended to speak to him this morning about how we would divide the day.  Then we are presented with this motion which effectively curtails debate on the Finance Bill and tells us that we cannot, in effect, organise for ourselves a constructive and responsible debate in this House.  In doing that Senator O'Higgins, as Leader of the House, does a grave disservice to the House as a whole and insults the democratic process, the Constitution and the Senators who voted for this motion on the Order of Business some minutes ago.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise one other point. This is a very important Finance Bill debate.  We are now at a crisis situation in regard to the management of our economy.  Everybody recognises that.  I thought Senator FitzGerald and I made reasonably constructive contributions yesterday as to how the Government might stimulate the economy by way of tax incentives at worker, management and investment level, by way of low interest loans and credit for the private building sector and greater finance for public authorities to build the infrastructure which is so badly needed such as roads, houses, water and sewerage and to get the construction industry going.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> That is the type of debate we had yesterday, a debate directly related to the serious state of our economy.  We also had constructive contributions from Senator Yeats and Senator Russell.  Other Senators from the Labour side spoke.  The debate was proceeding at an even level.  I want to emphasise that.  I am not easily appalled.  I am long enough around this place not to be. But I am genuinely and sincerely appalled by the approach adopted in this matter, that when a serious debate was taking place it could be truncated in this ruthless and brutal form.  I appreciate the need in parliamentary procedure for such a closure motion. It has never been adopted by the Government with a majority in either House except after a protracted debate, a filibuster type debate, or an irresponsible debate pushed to an extreme level by an Opposition.  It is only in that situation that I have ever seen any Government take a closure motion into either House and move it so as to curtail debate.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear other views on that.  I have been in such debates over very contentious issues where the need for this arose.  I do not have to refer to these debates because they are on the record in each House of the Oireachtas. Whether the motion was brought in rightly or wrongly, it has always been brought in in a highly contentious debate which went on for a long period of time, where a particular measure was being pursued so hard by the Opposition that they were obviously talking the debate out, obviously prolonging the debate where it was necessary to get legislation through.  It has been traditional&mdash;and rightly so, because the Government should not lightly decide on a closure motion&mdash;that such a motion was only introduced by the Government after what they regarded as a lengthy or contentious debate and where the Government wanted to get legislation through and had taken the view that every aspect of the matter had been fully aired and the debate was taking a repetitious turn.  In debates such as that it was necessary, in the view of the Government, rightly or wrongly, to bring in such a closure motion.</P>
    <P>Everybody here would agree that that is the purpose of a closure motion. <Col N="243" /> It is also essential, because of the very nature of a closure motion, that it should only be used sparingly by the Government and in circumstances such as I have mentioned.  I know of no instance where a closure motion has been introduced by the Government after only a half day's debate in either House on an important matter such as the Finance Bill, a debate which was proceeding without heat, with plenty of constructive criticism and objective comment.  It was quite open during today to so ordain our business that we would facilitate the President in signing this Bill at 7 o'clock on Friday evening.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear an answer to the argument I have just put forward. The Leader of the House has not given an explanation for this motion.  First of all, it is quite evident that the Bill could have been presented to the President on time.  Secondly, there is no argument that the debate was developing in a repetitive, contentious or irresponsible manner.  Anybody who was present here yesterday would testify that the debate was proceeding in a highly responsible, constructively critical and objective manner.  Therefore the only possible explanation is that the Government at this stage are resenting any criticism from any forum about their economic performance and their handling of the general economic situation.  Surely this is one of the democratic forums and is the place for comment on the major matter on everybody's mind at the moment&mdash;the state of the economy and the disastrous course on which we are being set by the mismanagement of our finances and the economy over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The unemployment rate was between 115,000 to 120,000 during the past few months.  There is lack of opportunity for school-leavers.  Over 20,000 jobs have been lost over the past two years.  During the previous six years of prudent management 20,000 jobs were created and these have been lost between 1974 and 1976.</P>

      <P>All our economic forecasters say&mdash;the Chairman of the <Col N="244" /> Industrial Development Authority among them&mdash;that each year until 1986 the Government will have to provide 20,000 new jobs to cater for the growth in population.  Is it to curtail the debate on these vital issues that the closure motion has been introduced?  Is it to curtail democratic expression?  If so, it can be expressed elsewhere.</P>
      <P>This is the appropriate forum for the expression of constructive and responsible views in regard to the management of the economy.  Apparently the Government resent any such criticism, although offered in a constructive manner.  I would defy anyone to say that yesterday's Seanad debate was anything but a constructive one.  The economy is suffering from a malaise which is rendering social progress impossible. My contribution yesterday offered constructive suggestions to cure the malaise. If we did this, more wealth could be created, which in turn would provide for the social developments we all desire.  The Government representative should be listening to this debate, a debate which is being denied to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Seanad is being denied this right by a closure motion which will ensure that by 5 o'clock discussion on the matter will be finished despite the fact that we have until tomorrow night to discuss it.  The President will have all day on Friday to peruse it.  The President does not have any function in regard to the Bill because it is a Money Bill. Under the Constitution he must sign it; he is under no obligation to send it to the Supreme Court, as he is in the case of ordinary legislation.  It defies comprehension why the Government should insult not only the democratic process but themselves and the people who have elected this Parliament.  Obviously they have reached a high degree of sensitivity to any form of constructive criticism from either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I wish to move the following amendment to the motion: On line 7 to delete &ldquo;today&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of that amendment would be to try to meet in a responsible manner the point of view expressed regarding the exigencies of the time limit.  We would agree to this closure motion if it is expressed as being <Col N="245" /> 5 o'clock tomorrow evening.  The President then has 26 hours, from 5 p.m. tomorrow evening until 7 p.m. on Friday 28th, to examine the Bill and append his signature.  This is a reasonable <i>modus vivendi</i> coming from an Opposition.  I should like to hear the Leader of the House's views on what might be termed an olive branch in order to stop this contentious debate, proceed with the constructive consideration of the Finance Bill, and by agreement, finish at 5 p.m. tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I wish to deal with some of Senator O'Higgins's remarks in this respect.  He suggested that he had made it clear that there would be a motion of this kind put down.  I want to make it absolutely clear that that is simply not so.  At one stage yesterday, Senator Sanfey spoke to Senator Lenihan and myself and asked if we could agree to finishing by 5 p.m. tomorrow.  We told him we could not possibly agree to that as we did not know how the debate would go; that we had no intention of holding it up, but we would see how the debate would proceed.  As far as I am concerned, that is the last anyone said about this matter.  I heard rumours yesterday that the Government would bring in a guillotine motion but I said that it was nonsense as there was no reason for it.  Then last night at 8.30 p.m., just before the House adjourned, Senator O'Higgins, the Leader of the House, came over to find out how many Senators wished to speak.  Three Senators wished to speak so he said that we would adjourn until today.  He did not propose sitting late last night. There was no mention of the impending guillotine motion, although I understand he had spent several hours arranging for its drafting at that stage. However he did not condescend to mention it to us when we were discussing the future conduct of the Bill. It is a mystery why the Leader of the House has brought in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now put down an amendment that the motion should be changed to read &ldquo;5 p.m. tomorrow&rdquo;.  On that basis, although it is quite unprecedented to have such a motion on a Finance Bill, we are willing to agree to the <Col N="246" /> motion going through.  The Leader of the House has accepted that it is constitutionally and legally practicable to debate this matter all day today and all day tomorrow up to 5 p.m.  We could debate it even later, but we are willing to compromise in this matter and to finish by 5 p.m. tomorrow.  The Leader of the House has conceded that this is possible.  As Senator Lenihan has pointed out, since the President has no power in this matter to refer the Finance Bill to the Supreme Court, he is not entitled under the Constitution to do anything but sign the Bill.  While, as a matter of courtesy, one would wish him to have adequate time to read the Bill before signing it&mdash;everyone likes to know what they are signing before they do so&mdash;7 p.m. on Friday would appear to be adequate in view of the fact that its constitutionality does not arise.</P>
    <P>However, for whatever reason, and I cannot conceive what this reason is, the Leader of the House and indeed Senators on that side of the House have decided to do this.  I notice for example, Senator Alexis FitzGerald sitting there festooned, as is his wont, with learned volumes of all kinds, ready no doubt to indulge in intelligent and, as always, articulate and extremely useful discussion on the Committee Stage of this Finance Bill.  By the action of his own leader and by the action of his own feet, in voting as he voted he is making sure that this cannot happen in any kind of adequate way.</P>
    <P>I would put it to Senator FitzGerald that there is no reason in the wide world why the Leader of the House could not accept our amendment to defer the end of this debate until 5 p.m. tomorrow. There is absolutely no legal reason, no constitutional reason, no problem of any kind.  I put it to Senator FitzGerald that he could make his usual valuable use of his expertise and the volumes of various kinds that he has surrounding him if he would persuade his leader to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>As I already mentioned, this is the first time in 54 years of financial legislation in this country that a motion of this kind has been brought in.  For 54 years the Dáil and Seanad had been debating <Col N="247" /> the annual Finance Bill, the most important single piece of legislation that comes before either house in the course of the year.  On no single occasion in these 54 years was a guillotine motion of this kind moved in either House.  This is a precedent, is unique, and is moved, so far as one can see, without any adequate reason at all. Without any reason it has not been explained.  The Leader of the House has not denied that in effect it is not necessary, to the extent that certainly 5 p.m. tomorrow rather than 5 p.m. today would be entirely adequate from the point of view of getting the Bill to the President, with all due regard both to courtesy and to the legalities and the provisions of the Constitution.  It could be done; it should be done.</P>
    <P>There is no conceivable possibility of recommendations being passed in this House.  The Leader of the House knows perfectly well he has enough votes to prevent any such thing.  I said yesterday in the course of this debate that we did not propose on this side of the House to put down any recommendations.  We can give him an assurance again that we do not propose to put down any recommendation, and even if we put down 100 recommendations the Leader of the House knows perfectly well that he has enough votes to prevent them being accepted.</P>
    <P>Indeed we do not have the Minister for Finance in this House which, of course is a habit from the last budget which came before us last summer.  For the so-called mini budget, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, the Minister for Finance again was absent for a greater part of the debate.  We appreciate that the Minister has many claims on his time but I should have thought that the claims of the Parliament of this country were perhaps paramount.  While much as we are happy to see the Minister for the Gaeltacht in the House, I do not think that even he would suggest he would be in a position to accept recommendations on behalf of his Minister for Finance were they put down.</P>
    <P>We are debating the Bill without the remotest conceivable possibility of it emerging from this House other than <Col N="248" /> in the form in which it now is.  Therefore this so-called excuse of preparing vellum copies and so on and so forth for the President to sign simply will not wash.  Indeed, in my own memory and in the memory of the Leader of the House we have had really urgent Bills going through this House, when the House was called together by telegram and so on, where the Bill had been signed by the President within minutes of its leaving this House.  The Bill had been given to him through a member of the motor-cycle corps who had instantly brought it up to Aras an Uachtaráin to be signed on the spot.  Therefore it is perfectly possible to do these things.  In any event the suggestion we have made of continuing this debate until 5 p.m. does not require any of those heroic steps.  The whole process could be gone through with all due courtesy and deliberation.  Now, the result of this display of what could be described as arrogance on the part of the Leader of the House and the Government and Senators opposite is that it is not possible to debate in any adequate way this most important legislation.</P>
    <P>Out of the kindness of his beneficient heart the Leader of the House says, &ldquo;Well, after all I gave every opportunity to the Opposition.  They could either have a Second Stage debate or they could have a Committee Stage debate. It is up to them to decide, and what could be fairer?&rdquo;  Could there ever have been a more outrageous pronouncement from the Leader of this or any other House?  He would put it up to the Opposition.  We could either debate the Second Stage or we could debate the Committee Stage.  It is up to us.  It is not up to us.  We are entitled &mdash;not merely we, but Senator FitzGerald and every Senator in this House is entitled to debate this financial legislation in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is not for any Leader of the House to stand up here in his arrogance and say to the Opposition: &ldquo;You decide whether you will debate one Stage or another.&rdquo;  We are entitled to debate every Stage of this Bill in a way in which every single Finance Bill before either House of the Oireachtas has been debated in each of the last 54 years.  We are entitled to do that, <Col N="249" /> not because of whatever dignity we as Senators may possess, but because of the people of this country who are entitled to have this vital legislation debated by their representatives in Parliament in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>After all, we are discussing this Bill in the context of a very grave national crisis.  It is not just an ordinary Finance Bill, if any Finance Bill can be described as ordinary.  It is not just a routine Finance Bill that comes in in normal times and perhaps puts a penny on one thing and takes a penny off another, brings in a few proposals for tax, dealing with tax evasion and so on. This is not that kind of situation.  We are debating this Bill in a period of grave national crisis, a period when what Senator FitzGerald yesterday described as &ldquo;a psychology of defeat&rdquo; is gaining more and more ground, when people are really despairing of seeing any improvement in conditions; a period when we have well over 100,000 unemployed with no real prospect in the next 12 or 18 months of any reduction to even below 100,000 in that number; a period when we have, perhaps today, a complete breakdown in the entire wage negotiations position with the appalling prospect that that suggests, a breakdown brought about apparently in the last two days by the deliberate action of the Government; in the longer run a breakdown brought about by the deliberate action of the Government in the type of budget that they have put before us and which is before us today in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We have the situation where our national transport concern has made it clear they may simply have to cease operations in the autumn, simply because they are running out of money. Owing to the inflationary situation, the general economic depression that exists, the psychology of defeat that exists, to quote Senator FitzGerald&mdash;because of this situation our national transport concern is likely to break down.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of context in which this Finance Bill in this year of 1976 is being discussed.  It is in this context that the Government, the Leader of the House and Senators opposite have decided that there is to be no discussion in this House.  We have had one halfday's <Col N="250" /> discussion.  Part of the Second Reading took place.  We still have to finish the Second Reading.  We have to go through the numerous sections of this Bill.  There are 83 sections in this Bill.  There are many matters of great importance in this Bill.  There are the kind of detailed technical matters that one had hoped to hear Senator FitzGerald dealing with.  I always listen to him with pleasure and enlightenment. Apart from these there are a wide variety of matters which affect many people in this country.  We have the vast range of taxes that have been imposed in this Bill, the huge increases in the rate of VAT, the 13p on petrol, huge increases in car tax and on drink and tobacco, the consequent increases in CIE fares, increases in ESB rates. All these are governed by the budget. There is the imposition of some £15 million on industry in the Finance Bill through social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that Senator FitzGerald would rise.  I would be fascinated to hear Senator FitzGerald defending this outrageously arrogant proposition.  I would be delighted, in view of his long and honourable career as a financial expert in this House, as a defender of the rights of this House to consider legislation adequately, particularly financial legislation; in view of that long and honourable record, I would be interested to hear him defending this motion.</P>

      <P>There have been interruptions from both sides. Senator Yeats must make his contribution on the amendment to the motion that is before us.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that under this section I have referred to 100,000 people who will have to pay three years' tax on two years' income.  That one section would justify it being discussed between now and 5 p.m. without referring to any other section of the Bill.  There are many sections of great importance in the Bill.  There is the question of personal reliefs.  One would be entitled to point out that the personal reliefs given in the budget are in no way adequate to deal with the increasing cost of living and the fall in the value of money.  Hundreds of thousands of income tax payers will have to pay more tax this year because of the constant fall in the value of money.  There is the question of tax on co-operative societies.  How are they to be debated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a variety of questions later on in the Bill dealing with the licensing of motor vehicles, revolutionary and in many ways exceedingly undesirable provisions&mdash;that even not using a car one must pay tax.  Even if we had started at 10.30 this morning without any discussion on this motion and had finished the Second Reading and gone on to Committee Stage we would not have got to section 60.  I can assure Senator FitzGerald that if the sections <Col N="252" /> in which he is interested come to about 20, on the motion before the House there would be no remote chance of getting that far a Bill of this nature.  All these matters towards the end of the Bill will go without discussion.  They will be shot through by this motion.</P>
    <P>I earlier put it to the Leader of the House that this whole matter could be settled in 30 seconds if he would agree to saying 5 p.m. tomorrow instead of 5 p.m. today.  There is no legal problem, no constitutional problem, even no problem of courtesy to the President, no mythical problem of preparing vellum copies and so on.  All this could all be solved and the House could discuss this Bill.  I do not know what the reason is, but the Leader of the House will not agree to this.  That is the problem that we all face.  There are a vast number of matters dealt with in this Bill of the greatest importance which ought to be discussed and which, even had we started at 10.30 this morning, could not possibly have been discussed in the time available.</P>
    <P>There is the problem one has to face with regard to the amount of taxation taken in, that public spending, which was 42 per cent in 1972 is now 58 per cent, 4 per cent up on GNP on last year. Despite all the imposts in this budget the position is worsening.  We had the so-called temporary surcharge of 10 per cent in income tax which is again perpetuated in this budget.  How long will it last?  It is supposed to be temporary, but we know how temporary income tax was for the first six years or so of its life until Deputy Colley, in a fit of realism, made it permanent.  But this temporary surcharge is re-incarnated in one of the earlier sections of this Bill.  It is an intolerable position that a Bill of this importance, outstanding importance both for what it contains and surrounding circumstances, should be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>When somebody mentioned to me yesterday a rumour about this I laughed at it.  I said no Leader of the House could do such a thing.  When I heard last night after the House had adjourned that this motion was coming through I still did not believe it.  It was only this morning when I read the Order Paper that the full enormity of what was <Col N="253" /> happening dawned on me, that this motion was being brought in.  It is inconceivable to me why the Leader of the House will not budget to the extent of fixing it at 5 p.m. tomorrow instead of today.  It means that this Bill will not get any consideration in this House. That in itself is not so important, but it completely flies in the face of all that parliamentary democracy ought to mean.  It is completely dictatorial.  It shows a contempt for the entire parliamentary process, a contempt which the Government have shown before, because as I pointed out yesterday, I find the Earlier Signature Motion which appears on this Order Paper at No. 3 is the sixth since last December.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, apparently, the Government are treating legislative process, at least as regards this House, with complete contempt.  They are not even making any further effort to process legislation in any kind of orderly way.</P>
    <P>When I spoke yesterday complaining about the way in which this Bill had come to us my complaint was based on the proposition, which I then believed, that we were going to have the greater part of this week and that we would have at least three days debate on this vital Bill.  It never occurred to me at that time what was in the mind of the Leader of the House.  I would even now suggest to him that he ought to accept our amendment, and perhaps Senator FitzGerald could persuade his leader, if I cannot, to show some sense of reason and to agree to make this 5 p.m. tomorrow rather than today.  In spite of its unique reprehensible nature we would be willing to accept this guillotine motion on the basis that it is 5 p.m. tomorrow.</P>

      <P>Could I say to Senator Yeats that there might be a certain amount of misunderstanding here?  I did indicate when I was moving this motion that acceptance of the motion would not rule out the agreed timetable provided the timetable agreed meant that we finished today.  In other words, if any proposition was made that we might possibly sit later I would certainly consider that and see if we could accept.  I tried to give that signal to the Opposition when I was introducing <Col N="254" /> it but the question of going on until tomorrow would, I am afraid, be out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Following what the Leader of the House has said, I deplore the tendency over the last four or five years to present Bills to this Seanad without adequate time for discussion.  Both Governments are responsible for this.  The position of the discussion on both the Finance and Appropriation Bills has been totally unsatisfactory for the last six or seven years.  Previous to that there was always a very worth-while discussion on both the Bills in June.  The Finance Bill took up two to three days and the Appropriation Bill, which was really a discussion of the whole budget, followed in July. Six to seven years ago the then Government changed the procedure and we reached the Cinderella position where the budget was always discussed in Christmas week&mdash;it was already in being for almost nine months at that stage and there was little point in discussing it.</P>
      <P>The position is totally unsatisfactory and it is time the Government faced up to either abolishing Seanad Éireann or reforming it and using it.  But the present position is untenable and doing a disservice to democracy.  Seanad Éireann is not being used, as it should be as an aid to rational policy discussion by means of Committees and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest as an amendment to that proposed that we substitute 12 midnight tonight for the 5 p.m. as put.  Perhaps we could get agreement on that, provided the Leader of the House would give an assurance that, before we adjourn, he would do everything possible to arrange a two-day adjournment debate which will enable us to have a constructive look at the problems which are facing us today, not merely the financial ones but the general problems. If we could get that assurance, the charade of an Appropriation debate in Christmas week could be abolished and we could agree to accept the Appropriation Bill as a formality without discussion in Christmas week and would be contributing to the formation of public opinion and Government policy when needed, and that is now. <Col N="255" /> Provided the Leader of the House would agree, which he seems to have indicated earlier on, to do his best to arrange for an adjournment debate before we adjourn for the summer recess, we would all agree to substitute 12 midnight tonight instead of 5 p.m. as listed.  I know the constraints.  The Leader has not been responsible for this&mdash;it is largely due to the other House and we suffer for it, but if we reached this compromise we could get on with the discussion of the Finance Bill and especially of the very important Committee points that are likely to arise on it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the other two Senators, I want to protest strongly at the introduction of this motion by the Leader of the House.  It is completely wrong.  On this side of the House our numbers are small, and an effort is now being made to prevent us from expressing our views on so important a matter as the Finance Bill.  This is the Bill that provides the necessary finances to keep services going and one that should reflect the policy of the Government. Yesterday four or five of us on this side of the House spoke on it and, on the other side on one occasion, there was only one person present.  Many of them did not like the contributions that were being made.  I would say they were not very palatable to them because they were stating bald facts.  We had three or four speakers lined up and in the <Col N="256" /> ordinary course of events it would not have taken too long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I try to be constructive in my approach.  I do not want to be personal.  When Senator FitzGerald interrupted me, I handled him in a very cool manner.  I just expressed the opinion that I was surprised that a man of his culture was unable to listen to the salient and important facts I was stating.  I am not in any way trying to indulge in personal remarks about the Leader of the House.  I was merely adverting to the fact that he was not in the House when this happened.  In my opinion, he was outside arranging to have this motion put down on the Order Paper while, at the same time, he had been speaking to some of our members and he never mentioned it. That is the type of deal, I respectfully suggest, which was going on at that time.</P>
      <P>The essence of this motion is to try to ensure that Senators on this side of the House will be gagged on the Finance Bill and to try to prevent them from making their comments which would affect themselves and their respective areas.  I was surprised yesterday during the debate to note the absence of Senator Butler who has now arrived.  I am interested in the new measures in the Finance Bill to tax co-ops which we are now being prevented from discussing.</P>

    <P>I come from a co-operative area and I feel the co-ops are giving a tremendous service.  I was not at all impressed by Senator Ferris who came into the House with a printed prepared document and read it out in schoolboy fashion.  It was great laudable stuff&mdash;and will appear probably in a local paper&mdash;trying to <Col N="257" /> defend the taxing of co-ops.  Perhaps Senator Butler, as their nominee, might make his contribution and try to justify this penal tax which we are being prevented from discussing and which will affect everyone engaged in agriculture and thousands of people engaged in ancillary industries, and industries springing from agriculture&mdash;milk powder, chocolate crumb and various other things.</P>
    <P>We are being prevented from discussing this co-operative tax.  The Opposition are committed to its complete removal to allow farmers to expand and reap the full benefits they should enjoy since we are a member of the EEC.  It is very wrong that we are being prevented from discussing such important legislation&mdash;something that affects each and everyone of us in our own lives and our own areas.</P>
    <P>The real reason for this is that naturally the Government know things are in a very bad way.  Not alone have we told this to them for the past two or three years at every opportunity we got, but we have put forward constructive criticism which they should have heeded. They laughed and scoffed and pretended everything in the garden was rosy.  The salient facts are that these great men of all the talents who, as individuals, may be very nice people but as a Government are a complete fiasco, have been in office for three years.  They are now ashamed and afraid to hear spelled out here part of their dismal record. The first one that strikes them straight in the face is the 120,000 people unemployed. Then we have the school leavers who have no hope whatever under this Coalition Government of getting a job.  We are not delighted about that on this side of the House. We are very sad.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Senator.  If we were to break for about ten minutes and discuss Senator Quinlan's suggestion we might find a solution.  The time involved in the two suggestions is roughtly equal, that is, sitting on this evening as against Senator Yeats' suggestion.  If we put our heads together for ten minutes possibly we could come to an amicable <Col N="258" /> solution which would enable discussion of the Finance Bill to continue.</P>

As there is agreement on that, I am prepared to withdraw the motion as it stands, on the understanding that we agree now, and that the Chair has the necessary authority, that if the Finance Bill and the Earlier Signature Motion are not concluded earlier, the Chair should put all necessary questions to bring both the Finance Bill and the Earlier Signature Motion to a conclusion not later than 12 midnight.</P>

Theastuigh Rialtas go mbeadh an toradh seo leis an rún agus ná beadh seans ag Fianna Fáil droch staid na tíre a chur ós comhair an phobail.</P>
      <P>With all the discussions and arguments this morning our thoughts are somewhat scattered.  I am not surprised this motion was put down.  It seemed to us when we read it that it was an attempt to stifle debate.  Many of the things we had to say were very unpalatable and what will be said for the rest of the day will be equally unpalatable. It is not surprising that we, on this side of the House, were infuriated.  Indeed, if we had been allowed to continue in the ordinary fashion the Second Stage would be almost completed by now.</P>
      <P>Before I moved the adjournment last night I tried to highlight the main points of the Finance Bill and to show that most of them were to the detriment of the economy and to the employment situation.  One of the main points I tried to make was that the Government have failed dismally to keep any of their promises, mainly the promise to reduce prices and to create more employment.  Many people have put the question to us in Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;If you were in Government would you have done better or done differently?&rdquo; We have stated many times that, if we were in office, this problem would not have arisen because we would not have handled the affairs of the nation in the reckless manner in which this Government have handled affairs to date.  As a housewife would say, if we were making the cake we would have a completely different mix, completely different ingredients.  We would not have forgotten to put in the soda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, on many occasions, been most constructive.  Two years ago we brought to the attention of the Government that a big housing crisis was looming on the horizon.  We were laughed at when we drew attention to this.  Now the crisis is there and it will take us a long time to get out of the predicament in the building industry. <Col N="260" /> Many of our tradesmen who have built up good businesses have left us and we will, once more, have to get these teams together when the wheels of the economy start moving again.</P>
    <P>We also advised the Government about two years ago that unless they were in on the first pay negotiations and unless they subsidised food before the budget, the mix would be different.  We were once again treated with contempt when we highlighted those two very important issues.  On the motion it was said that the Government seem to be so full of their own importance that they do not want to listen to anybody.  It is very foolish not to listen to people who have long years of experience in Government, 16 years of running the State, and experience of pulling the country out of, not only the two crises left behind by the two Coalition Governments, but previous crises such as the economic war and steering the ship of State through the World War. In all those difficult situations Fianna Fáil were not found wanting.  It is most unwise of inexperienced people such as we have in the Government now, in spite of their so-called talents, not to have the courtesy or the common sense to listen to suggestions made by experienced people.</P>
    <P>During Senator Hanafin's contribution the Minister, who is now with us, almost reprimanded the Senator for his remarks and suggested he was making an unfair criticism.  I have here a cutting from <i>The Irish Press,</i> January 29th, 1976.  It substantiates everything Senator Hanafin said.  I should like to quote what was said by the foreign editor Julien de Kassel, in reference to what an EEC official said <i>á propos</i> the state of the economy and the budget:</P>
    <P>The nearest thing to direct criticism came from one official who drew attention to Article 104 of the Treaty of Rome which says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Each member state shall pursue the economic policy needed to ensure the equilibrium of its overall balance of payments and to maintain confidence in its currency, while taking care to ensure a high level of employment and a stable level of prices.&rdquo;  Of this the official said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" />&ldquo;It would appear at first glance that Mr. Ryan is not pursuing at least some of these objectives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He certainly is not pursuing the objective of keeping prices stable, nor is he pursuing the objective of keeping down the level of unemployment.  There is far more in that article than I am quoting. It substantiates what Senator Hanafin said.  For the first time strings have been attached to a loan from the EEC. For the first time we are being dictated to by people who are lending us money because they have no confidence that the Minister or the Government are able to manage our affairs.</P>
    <P>Another economic review, the Confederation of Irish Industry's No. 1 of 1976, is well worth reading.  The same gloomy picture is painted there.  There is no point in saying Fianna Fáil are the only prophets of doom and gloom. Every writer is drawing people's attention to the sorry state and the desperate crisis in which we find ourselves.  There is no point in saying Fianna Fáil are imagining that.  Unfortunately, it is only too true.  There is no question of imagination at all.</P>
    <P>As there are other speakers and as the Government are anxious to finish the debate, I will conclude by saying what I said before.  We are living on borrowed money and on borrowed time. The Government have a hand-to-mouth policy and are guided only by expediency.  One thing is said today and is contradicted tomorrow.  This is happening not only in the different Departments but from day to day and from week to week.  Ní fheadar lámh amháin an Rialtais cad a dheineann an lámh eile.  As Senator Yeats said, it is high time the Government took note of the mess that has been made of our country and handed it over to Fianna Fáil who have proved themselves in many crises previously.  Unfortunately, it will take much longer to pull us out of the morass and the mess we are now in than it did after previous Coalition Governments left office.  I hope the Government will listen to the advice of many speakers on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I wish to make but, before making them, <Col N="262" /> I feel I must reply to Senator Aherne, from my native Kerry.  She spoke about the Government, about prices, and about the economic war.  She did not say, of course, that it was Fianna Fáil who brought about the Economic War. She did not contrast the Economic War with the present day.  At that time I was a boy in Castleisland.  A farmer came to the fair with his cow and an old itinerant woman was selling <i>Old Moore's Almanac</i> for fourpence.  She asked the man if he would buy <i>Old Moore's Almanac.</i> He asked how much it was and she said it was fourpence.  He said: &ldquo;Give me the almanac and I will give you the cow.&rdquo;  You can contrast that with today when a farmer gets £300 for his cow.</P>
      <P>Section 23 deals with minimum benefit in kind for use of a company car.  I should like to ask the Minister what is the position of an employee who is required, as a condition of the car being available for his private use, to pay weekly, monthly or annually an amount of money to his company.  Will such sum of money be deducted from the minimum benefit in kind?  If there is no provision for this in the Bill, I wish to ask the Minister to include such a provision.  There may be employees who do not have a company car for the full year.  In their case, there should be provision for only proportion of the minimum provision being charged.</P>
      <P>On section 26, the stock relief provisions of the Finance Bill should be extended to the retail motor trade. There has been a very substantial inflation of prices of cars and spare parts in recent years.  The provision is designed to assist the liquidity of firms. This is of particular interest to the motor trade who normally must pay for cars before they are released.  A further point is that the motor trade, more so than any other trade, collect and pass over a huge amount of tax to the Exchequer and it is unfair that they should be denied tax concessions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 79 deals with rates of vehicle excise duty.  I would ask the Minister to consult with the Society of the Irish Motor Industry before reaching any decision on the abolition of the existing system of road tax and its replacement <Col N="263" /> by a further duty on petrol.  The industry generally would appear to welcome such a proposal but it would create problems in Border counties where, already, there is such a wide gap between petrol prices there compared with the North of Ireland.  The industry would also want to have some assurance that the annual registration fee would be kept at a reasonable level and would not be treated as a means for raising revenue as in road tax.  Another problem is that petrol pumps will only register to 99p per gallon, and petrol pumps today cost in the region of £500 to £600 and this would mean a colossal expenditure for the motor trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Finance Bill because, in the first instance, it affords me an opportunity to say that, since the Coalition took office, the hallmark of their performance in the economic sector is their total lack of policy.  This has been highlighted by the Minister for Finance on numerous occasions, both in public and in Oireachtas declarations, when he said he did not believe in planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is, with due respect, the Minister has not made any plans, and there seem to be no plans available.  There have been promises galore since the general election 14-point programme but all that can be said now is that this Government will go down in history as the most promising Government of all time, promising in the sense that they make promises, they have made promises, they still make them but, of course, they never deliver the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basis for this abject, economic and financial failure is that, the Government, through their Minister for Finance, either do not believe in planning ahead at all or, on the other hand, are unable to plan.  Down through the years previous Fianna Fáil Governments planned ahead in a very significant manner.  We had our troubles when in office with regard to planning but we always set out to plan ahead. This total inability of the present <Col N="264" /> Administration to plan has brought about the present desperate economic situation in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have stated on numerous occasions that it is a simple fact of national life to plan ahead and we have been ignored by the Government.  As a constructive Opposition we have shown the Government parties how to construct a healthy economy which would stand up to pressures.  Many times the Central Bank has pointed out the folly of no planning but this seems to have been ignored by the Minister and the Government.  All rational advice has gone unheeded.  Now we have promises of White Papers and blueprints.  Nobody can blame us being sceptical about all this because it could turn out to be another Coalition promise.</P>
    <P>Stability in society depends on sound economic development.  This Finance Bill will not develop the economy since it is the product of haphazard financial moves of a Minister who never planned. The Minister has stated that planning would be useless.  He has directed the economy unthinkingly.  This Bill, far from placing the economy on the road to recovery and to an advantageous position in world trade, will not keep the ship of State afloat.</P>
    <P>We must judge the Government's ability on the basis of the situation.  A decline in revenue buoyancy rising taxes and unemployment are costing in the region of £100 million.  This all points to the simple principle every housewife knows to be of prime economic importance: we must return to a balanced budget.  Deputy Barry Desmond must have had this in mind when he was reported as saying that one would want to be blind and stupid not to be aware of the shortcomings of this Government.  He indicated where his remarks were directed when he continued that the Coalition's record in the economic management of the nation might not be too laudable.  Deputy Desmond was very lenient with the economic and financial mismanagement by the Government, as shown by this Finance Bill.  Very often we hear members of the Cabinet viciously blaming our financial woes on the <Col N="265" /> international recession.  At the same time, they appeal to our sense of patriotism regarding domestic recession.</P>
    <P>What I want to point out is that in 1973, when the National Coalition Government took office, the country had the second lowest rate of inflation among EEC countries but in 1975 we had the second highest rate of inflation of all those countries.  This all adds up to the fact that we have what must be the worst Government in Europe. Considering the economic mess in which we find ourselves, an appeal to patriotism is no substitute for well-defined policies which would create more employment.  In the past three years of the 57,000 workers in the manufacturing industries, one in every four of the labour force lost his job.  Due to the advance planning of the previous Fianna Fáil Government 50,000 new jobs were created but there is now a net loss of 6,500 jobs.  The Finance Bill will not bring us back to the position we were in three years ago.  This is the most lamentable deficiency of this Bill. The Bill does contain any measure that would create employment.  In any financial Bill there should be in-built plans and objectives to maintain existing employment and create further employment.  We can imagine how humilating it must be for a person to be unemployed, and how frustrating it is for that person to see the unemployment figures rising steadily and not be able to find employment.</P>
    <P>What about the young people who left school last year and who are unable to find employment?  What about those leaving school this year?  Where will they find employment?  What has the Minister done, in the Finance Bill, to ensure that this year's school leavers will find employment?  The provisions in the Bill will not create employment. It will add to the deteriorating economic climate of the country.  Indeed, a significant increase in the number of unemployed can be forecast for the future, if the Bill is any indication of the Government's planning.  People want work, not Government assistance.</P>
    <P>Why has there not been some effort made&mdash;as suggested by my party, to have the school leavers employed in hundreds of neglected national and <Col N="266" /> local projects?  There has been no effort on the part of the Government to ensure that these young people will find employment.  There must be many ways of creating employment, particularly in industries based on agricultural resources instead of exporting employment, which is what is happening by reason of beef being exported on the hoof.  There is no reason why those cattle could not be slaughtered and processed at home so as to ensure further employment at our meat industries. We are exporting jobs again with shiploads of ore to the smelter locations of Germany and there is no action by the Minister in this particular Bill to do anything about this.  Speaking of ore, the Government have quarried this Finance Bill and it is a monument to three years of mismanagement by the Government.  They have decided to dispense with the compilation of a census, a task which could have provided useful employment for some of our school leavers.</P>
    <P>A census at this stage would be of the utmost benefit to the nation because it would pinpoint population moves and the availability of skills, all of which information is of vital necessity in planning for employment.  But then we must remember that for three years the present Minister has not shown any indication of planning for employment. It is a deplorable decision even during an economic recession not to compile a census.  In this Bill there should have been enticement to all sides in industry to come together to help save the economy but no action was taken in that direction in this piece of legislation. I would imagine if those enticements were there, people on all sides would have come together in an effort to help the country in the economic recession and to protect employment.  For all concerned, mutual measures would be taken.</P>
    <P>The Government threatened a statutory pay pause, then a voluntary pay pause but after a quick double think dropped both of these draft proposals. Before the introduction of this Bill in the Dáil leading figures in the Government benches, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, were loud in their themes that <Col N="267" /> if there was not moderation this year we would have an economic shambles.  The fact is that after three years of Coalition mismanagement we have already reached the stage of an economic shambles.  Was it any wonder that a leading newspaper heading last week had the shocking headline that we are broke?  When does one know when a country is really broke?  The answer is when it is treated as a bad risk and when we can borrow no further abroad.  I wonder what efforts the Minister or the Government have taken in regard to those stringent strings which attach to the recent loan from the EEC?  I doubt very much if they have taken any. Consequently, any future loan that the Government might seek would not be likely to be made available.</P>
    <P>The sincerity of the Minister in the context of this Bill can be called into question because the Bill implies that there is a need for a pay pause and for the curbing of inflation while it does nothing to meet those needs.  We were told two years ago that it would be possible for the Government to spend all the money they got from the EEC and at the same time to stabilise prices. All the money was spent but the prices spiral and have continued to spiral. The Government have taken no action to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill will account for at least a 5 per cent increase in prices.  In another country direct taxation was increased by small amounts and in some cases was reduced substantially.  This strategy worked because last month Britain's inflation rate was slashed by more than 2 points.  It now stands at 18.9 per cent.  If the Minister had taken similar action in this Bill the desperate economic situation that we now find ourselves in might have been avoided but he had not the initiative to do this with the result that we now find ourselves on the brink of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>The situation in Britain was made possible by the unions being enticed to be moderate.  But in our Financial Bill there is no planning.  There is no recognition that in dealing with public and private sectors, in dealing with management and labour, we are dealing with people, people who have rights, <Col N="268" /> who have emotions and ambitions, but above all people who if cared for correctly would tackle with the Government the problem of inflation.  This Bill blatantly ignores all the sections which make up the economic entity of Ireland. This working together in harmony is not forthcoming.  The Minister is responsible for the scandalous state of affairs that exist.  The British rate of inflation will be much lower than it is here.  It is forecast that it will be one-half or one-third of the inflation that was forecast for this country.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this domestic escalation in prices is the frightening escalation of this Government's foreign borrowing.  A habitual borrower is a poor and near-sighted investor.  For instance, in the nine months ended March, 1976 the Government increased their foreign borrowing by bringing it to a total of £123 million.  That represents an increase of 52 per cent over a nine-month period or on an annual basis, an increase of almost 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>What does this mean here at home? It means that 18 per cent of the estimated 22 per cent total growth in the money supply in 1976 will be due to Government borrowing.  This adds inflationery pressures here at home and the Bill does nothing effectively to curb inflation.  For five years prices have risen at an annual rate of 14 per cent. In 1975 the rate of increase was 21 per cent.  In this Bill the Government have failed miserably to deal with the economic situation and we are left to float further towards complete economic disaster.</P>
    <P>Regarding the taxing of co-operatives I wish to state that I doubt very much if the Minister is aware of the functioning of those agricultural co-operatives. He has quoted instances of large co-operatives with large turnovers and which he has said have large profits.  My knowledge of the co-ops is that they are run on a very small margin of profit, that whatever profits are made are ploughed back into their further development.  They act as an incentive to the small farmer in that he gets fertilisers and feeds at the lowest possible cost.  Any introduction of taxes will hinder the further development of those many co-ops.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> The Minister stated that he knows a number of co-ops that are making a huge profit.  If that is true, I agree with him that the functioning of those individual co-ops should be investigated. But I can guarantee the Minister that this category are very much in the minority.  The co-ops have proved an incentive to agricultural development down through the years.  Let us never forget that we are not at an advanced stage in regard to agricultural development. There is a lot more which can be done in that direction.  I very strenuously ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal to tax co-operatives.  I would imagine he would be correct in investigating the functioning of the small number of co-ops that have showed a large profit but if he investigates all co-operatives he will come to the conclusion that it would be very wrong to levy taxes on them.  The big farmer, irrespective of whether an agricultural co-op is in his area or not, can buy fertilisers in large amounts at a low cost because he has the cash to pay down, and he will get large discounts.  But the co-operatives give the same facility to each farmer irrespective of the size of his farm.  It would be a hindrance to the development of small farmers to introduce this tax.</P>
    <P>Because of the severe increase that were imposed on spirits and beer in the last budget I am convinced that the revenue from that source will be reduced drastically this year because of a decrease in consumption.  During an economic recession any fair-minded person would say that if the Minister wished to raise extra money naturally spirits and beer should bear a fair share.</P>
    <P>Jobs have been lost right through the country on account of the amount of the increase involved here.  I would imagine that even with the big breweries there will be a loss of jobs due to the severity of the increases on spirits and beer.  I read recently that the Minister stated he expected the revenue from beer and spirits to be something the same as last year, but from one who is involved in the trade I doubt if he is correct in his forecast.  I know from a number of bottling firms in the Midland area that due to those drastic increases they had to let a lot of their workers go, bringing <Col N="270" /> about a situation of increasing unemployment figures.  I suppose nothing can be done about the situation now but I mention it to emphasise the effect it had on employment.  Very many publicans throughout the country find their incomes less on account of the reduced trade.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the basis that one can see in this Finance Bill evidence of the tug-of-war game in the Coalition Government.  Sadly we find that as a result of this pulling and tugging the nation is suffering.  What is needed in times of economic recession is a sure hand and, I would emphasise, a one-party Government, because decisions cannot be made when there are two political parties not agreeing on how the Government should tackle the desperate economic situation we now find ourselves in.  I feel quite certain that if the people were given the opportunity at this time they would ensure that this country would again be in the hands of a one-party Government, a Fianna Fáil Government, because we are the only party that can gain the confidence of the people, and can lift them from the economic plight in which they are, an economic plight brought about by a three-year period of total mismanagement of the financial affairs of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill gives an opportunity in this House to discuss the state of the country last year and what we expect it to be this year.  It is not the management of the country but its mismanagement that will have to be discussed because this Finance Bill is the result of mismanagement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that from about 40 Government Senators we have had about two contributions and the last one lasted about five minutes appealing to the Minister to give the motor industry some concessions.  If that Senator had anything to say in the way of praise or to thank the Minister for any benefits he had given them, I am sure he would be very vocal in his expression.  Instead Government Senators have been showing their dislike of the provisions by their total abstention from speaking and their absolute silence on the Finance Bill.  I think that <Col N="271" /> itself is a fine reflection of the attitude of the whole community.  Ordinary Government Members of Dáil Éireann during their discussion of the Finance Bill were very slow in coming forward and the majority were absent from all the discussions.  I cannot see how these Members could thank the Minister for anything considering he has looked for pay pauses and wage restraints while taxes and prices have been going up.</P>
    <P>The number of people out of work has been given as between 118,000 and 120,000.  We get this on our weekly ststistical document.  This is far from being the truth, because in reply to a Dáil question addressed to the Taoiseach a few days ago, he gave the figure of people receiving unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit as 147,000.  We got the information the same week in our statistical document that we had 117,000 people out of work. These two figures are not reconcilable. We are getting wrong figures and this should be put right.  The people should be given the facts.  While the Coalition are mismanaging our affairs we are going from bad to worse all the time and we will not improve in any way whatsoever.  We have had two periods before of Coalition Government and in each period they evacuated themselves. They were not beaten in any vote in any House of the Oireachtas: they evacuated when they were running short of money.  On both occasions it took the Fianna Fáil Government years to bring the country back on a sound, sane footing.  We ask the same concession this time: that the Government get out now before things get worse and give us an opportunity, because the longer they are in the longer it will take to get the country back on a sound financial basis.</P>
    <P>It is very sad to see how the country has been hit.  If we look at county councils we see that their road plans this year are far below, in money terms, what they were last year or any other year.  They may be above, as the Minister said, 1972-73; but they would need to be about 65 times what they were then in order to have the same amount of work done in 1976.  They have fallen a lot short of this and the <Col N="272" /> result is that we will not have the number of people employed by our local authorities as in previous years because the money is not available.  Our health boards are hit very badly.  Their services are curtailed.  Anybody who is in a temporary position and requires sanction for permanent employment will not be sanctioned.  The position is the same in all the health boards.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the people who will be very badly hit are the poor people on the medical card who have to go to those hospitals for treatment to keep themselves alive.</P>
    <P>Not alone in the road structure, but in the whole spectrum of county council affairs, people have been badly hit. In north Mayo and south Sligo where there is big industrial development taking place we are going from Pat to Tom, from Tom to Mike and from Mike to James to find out who is going to give us money to build houses for the working people.  Inside the next few months there is expected to be an influx of about 600 workers to Asahi.  The same thing is going to happen in Hollisters and in Shamrock Forge and Tool.  We in the Mayo County Council have not got one penny and we cannot get it from the Central Fund to erect houses in that area.  Last Thursday morning the new county manager in Mayo, the IDA, the NBA, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance met to see if they could do anything at all in order to give us money to build houses for the working people in that area and also to do something about the infrastructure. We have an estate of 93 houses going up outside Ballina.  We have no sewerage. We cannot extend the sewerage from the end of the town out to that estate because there is no money to do so.  We have applied for it and sent up documentation, but we cannot get it. We were told that eventually we will get money but when?</P>
    <P>The money that is being borrowed is put to bad use.  That is the downfall of this whole structure.  If I borrow money in the bank every second week to spend in a public house the bank manager would soon tell me to get out.  If I borrow money in the bank and put it to some capital development and if I make <Col N="273" /> an effort to pay back the interest and principal, they will accommodate me. You will not be allowed to borrow money to spend foolishly.  That is what is happening here.</P>
    <P>There is at least £104 million being paid out in unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit this year.  I should like to ask the Minister for Finance, his advisers and his Cabinet&mdash; they are supposed to be a Cabinet of collective responsibility and of consultation&mdash;if the £2 million a week that is being paid out in unemployment benefit were to be distributed among the 26 county councils and the county councils were to spend that on local improvement schemes where they get contributions from the people when the schemes are completed would that not put at least 75 per cent of the people out of work back into work.  You would stop this scrounging mentality that is in our youth at the present time.  That mentality has been forced into them from the day they leave school.  They know there is no work available for them so they sign on the dole and they have a few shillings for spending and a few shilling for a dance.  If they get married and have a few children they will get about three times as much and they are quite happy to exist on that.</P>
    <P>There are people entitled to unemployment assistance and people who need it very badly.  The majority of those people are in the west of Ireland.  If those people got the dole and the people who are well able to work went to work, their stamps alone would make a decent and respectable amount of money available for those who badly need unemployment assistance.  I do not know if it is much good putting any of these proposals to the Government because if that came before the Labour mentality in the Government they would not accept it.  They want to buy their way by handouts but they are not giving half enough to the people who badly need it.</P>
    <P>From mid-February, 1973, to mid-February this year the consumer price index increased by 62 per cent.  From mid-February to mid-May this year, which will be the quarter, the figure has not been officially published but it is accepted by economists that it will be <Col N="274" /> an increase of 65 per cent.  There if nobody here who has got an increase of 65 per cent in the last three years.  Any Government or Minister under the impression that they are going to get people to accept pay pauses and restrictions and at the same time increase their cost of living and taxation are making a big mistake.  They can see that mistake by the number of people of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union who marched to Leinster House today and held their meeting outside the gate about two hours ago.  They were quite justified in doing it.  Everything they are purchasing &mdash;they have to buy practically the daylight&mdash;has gone up to a fantastic extent.  Their wage packets are not sufficient to buy the same amount now as in 1972 or even in the first year of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>There was an increase last November or December, before the budget came in, of 15p per gallon on petrol.  Any man who has any spark of sense would know that that was going to be a very regressive step in many ways.  If anybody had told me that a Minister of State would put a 15p per gallon imposition on petrol in one sweep of his hand I would have said either he or the man who would do it was mad.  I would not believe it.  A week afterwards everything went up in price again.  Then we had the budget and the week after the budget we had more increases.  It is not a budget; this is not a Finance Bill but a continuation of the Finance Bills introduced in 1973 and 1974.  It is not even a monthly continuation of them but a weekly one.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's newspapers carried the heading &ldquo;Prices of Oil and Petrol to be Increased Again&rdquo;.  There is no consideration for the fact that a gallon of premium petrol is selling at 88.9p per gallon and the State takes 52.4p in taxes.  In the budget, petrol was taxed to the extent of £29 million between VAT and everything else.  It is unbelievable that people can see their way to do those things and laugh at the thought of getting away with it.  The excuse we got was that we were being brought into line with the price of petrol in Britain in case there would be cross-Border smuggling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> If you take butter, the motor car and various other things, we are not being brought into line at all with Britain and Northern Ireland.  Because we were some pence below Britain in the price of petrol we had to increase the price of petrol in order to bring ourselves up to the price that was being paid for petrol in the Six Counties and Britain. It was a very foolish and ridiculous excuse but the Minister got away with it.  There are many homes in my area where people have to commute 20, 25 and 30 miles to their work.  We have Bord na Móna, the ESB and we have people commuting more than 50 miles to work in the Asahi plant in Killala. They were taxed on their stamps.  They have to pay more in PAYE.  They were taxed on their petrol and they were doubled in regard to road tax.  Every man who had a 14-horse power car was paying something in the region of £44.50 for it, but since the budget came in he has been paying £84.  The tax he is paying on petrol is very high.  How can any man who is earning £50 to £60 per week afford to keep a wife and family and still pay all these increases? If the Government think they will get away with it they are mistaken because as soon as they go to the country they will be told that it is time for them to pack in because the people have had enough of them.  I think they will be soon told in a smaller way than in a general way.</P>
    <P>The situation is absolutely ridiculous. When petrol tax is increased it is not just the motorist who is affected; it is the housewife, the consumer, who will be hit, because it will affect the distribution of all products used in the household. If there is an increase in transport costs naturally the people who have to pay these increase will need more money.  It eventually boils down to the fact that the person who is paying the increase is the consumer and the housewife. They are the people who are paying more for everything through the extra taxation.  It is a vicious circles when prices go up there will be less consumed, when there is less consumption there will be less productivity, when there is less productivity there is less employment and more redundancy. <Col N="276" /> The higher the taxation the surer it will be that there will be more unemployment. When it is boiled down, if the housewife reduces her consumption the next thing which happens is that her husband or son or somebody related to her who is working is out of a job.</P>
    <P>We have mishandled our educational problem and nearly everything which the Government should be doing they are not.  They are using red tape.  Why have they not come into this House and told us that they will do something about unemployment and the economic state of the country and get it back on a straight footing?  Instead of that we have two Ministers talking about the pill, contraception, divorce and so on. They are trying to distract people's minds from the real things which are hitting hard, such as unemployment and the rising cost of living.  I wonder would anybody on the other side of the House blush if a leaflet was produced with the 14 promises made in January and February, 1973, that they would stabilise prices, reduce unemployment, curb emigration and so forth.  We were to have an Ireland flowing with milk and honey.  I ask the Minister or anybody who represents him was there one iota of any of those promises made in 1973 kept?  They were broken before the ink was dry on the paper.  That was a saying about the Treaty of Limerick, that the British had broken that treaty before the ink was dry.  The same thing has happened with this Government. As soon as they got their mandate on 14th March, 1973, all these promises were used in the smallest room in the house, for a peculiar purpose.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on the Government that they have brought this country to the state inside three years.  It is in a terrible state when you think of £150 million which we have borrowed from Saudi Arabia.  We could not get that loan without having certain people to go guarantors for us.  There were certain conditions written into the loan. I think it is written into this loan that it is only a five-year loan.  It is taking £20 million per year to service that loan plus £30 million a year that has to be paid back in capital in order to have the loan repaid in five years.  If anybody can tell me where we are going to get <Col N="277" /> that £50 million and the £104 million we are paying out in unemployment assistance benefits, he would be a magician.  The only way we can get that money is by higher taxation because our borrowing power is over, our credibility abroad is over and there is not a hope of us being able to get money. What we are trying to do is to keep our domestic troubles at their present level to keep the dole men satisfied, to keep the redundant men satisfied and keep the pay-related men satisfied.  I do not know where we are going to get the money.  It is sad but true that it is the first time in the history of this State that we have had to have guarantors to vouch for us when we went to borrow money from a foreign country.  In 1929, 1930 and 1931 we got money from America and we did not have to have guarantors for it.  But I am afraid that day is gone.  The bed of roses which the Government think they are lying on is gone also and the thorns are beginning to show.  The Coalition Government are going to feel the effects of all this before they are finished with the people.</P>
    <P>On the taxing of co-ops, the North Connacht Farmers' Co-op borrowed £1.25 million in order to continue their capital development programme.  They have to repay that loan, but if they have to pay taxes how are they going to pay? They are already paying taxes, as are all co-ops.  They are paying tax on groceries, hardware and household goods through high VAT rates.  Now the Government want to tax the agricultural produce they sell.  This is another effort to stifle the agricultural industry, which is the basic industry of this country.  Not alone have the Government taxed the co-ops but about a fortnight ago in the slaughter subsidy they put on an 800 per cent increase on the slaughter of an animal, cattle, sheep and pigs.  A fortnight before that a 12 per cent increase was put on the price of feeding stuffs on account of the skim milk that was ordered to be put into the mixture of feeding stuffs.  If the Government can tell me that that is not an effort to stifle the agricultural industry I say they are wrong.</P>
    <P>It is only in keeping with the attitude and the practices of the Government. <Col N="278" /> From 14th March, 1973 to the present time they have liquidated 1,081 industries. If the Minister spent as many days out closing down those factories as he spent opening them he would have spent three times more time closing than opening them and he would be well fed at all the functions, if they could be paid for at all.  Since March, 1973 1,081 factories have been closed down by the Coalition Government.  These were the industries which Fianna Fáil built up under the industrial leadership of the late Seán Lemass.  I do not see where these factories are to get the money to open up again.  If they look for loans they will be told that they have already got loans and that nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see the country in such a state of bankruptcy without any real effort on the part of the Cabinet to bring it back to a sane position.  It is even sadder to think that there were only three contributions to the Finance Bill from the Government side, and in none of them was a word of praise for the Finance Bill.  But there was only very slight criticism.  It reflects the true belief of the people in the country because I suppose these people talk to their constituents and neighbours and ask where they are going to from here.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the same question: where are we going to from here?  I guarantee that before Christmas, if this Government do not get out, there will be many a hungry mouth on Christmas Day in the homes in the west because this Government will not even have the money to pay unemployment benefit. Unemployment assistance has been paid with borrowed money.  The proper way to use it is to put it into capital development to help the economy of the country.  Every aspect of the economy has been hit by this Government.  As Senator Cowen said, there is no agricultural or economic policy.  The only one policy in industry is to close recently opened factories.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to come up with a policy or a plan.  As everyone knows, the Government will not give money to local authorities for roadworks unless they can produce a five-year plan.  Yet this Government are living from day to day, hoping that <Col N="279" /> some miracle will happen tomorrow, that there will be a flush of gas or oil to relieve the trouble they are in.  These miracles do not happen overnight. Unless we plan for the future, this country will have to wait&mdash;even for the full five years&mdash;for Fianna Fáil to take over again.  The people will have to go through hardship before we can improve the economy, because desperate ills need desperate cures.  If the Government last that long, good luck to them. If they do not, they should get out as soon as they can and give us a chance.  I guarantee we will cure the economy.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the contributions from this side of the House.  The speakers on the other side of the House have not made any worthwhile contributions.  They only juggled with figures&mdash;and figures can be juggled with.  When I was going to school there was a little green book in circulation.  In that book the first juggling of figures proved that one was equal to two.  Another one was an 18-inch square which, by cutting it up into certain triangles and so on, could be turned into a 65-inch or a 67-inch rectangle.  Figures can be juggled, and there are no better jugglers of figures than the Coalition Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the Government were getting more tax per gallon of petrol than they are getting now on a percentage basis. That is right on a percentage basis.  But the difference between the tax on a gallon of petrol in 1972 and 1973 and now is not a question of percentages at all but of actual monetary facts, hard currency.  On 88.9 pence per gallon of premium petrol today, 52.4 pence of that is going to the Government in taxes.  Let the Government make up their minds to get out as fast as they can and let us take over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I found Senator Garret's rhetorical question &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo; most hopeful.  A related series of asides indicated, perhaps hopefully, although I somewhat more dismally think that he might not have been so serious, a commitment by his party to the notion of economic planning.  Such a confusion has come to typify contributions from that side of <Col N="280" /> the House.  On the second last occasion on which I spoke here I said that it would be of great benefit to all of us if we had some points of clarification. Are the Opposition, who see the remedy to all our ills in their return to power, in favour of balancing the books or are they in favour of deficit budgeting?  Sometimes those Members suggest that we can reduce taxation and, at the same time, balance the books and reduce foreign borrowing.  I am at a loss to understand how one can claim to be consistent in an attack on borrowing to meet, for example, social welfare payments and at the same time suggest that living standards will be increased all round.</P>
      <P>When the Labour Party initiated a debate on the necessity for coherent economic planning it was attacked. Yet, later in the week the Government were attacked for not having an economic plan.  Are budgets to be deficit budgets or are they to create revenue surplus?  Are we to have planning or are we not to have planning?  As regards sections of the community which are not taxed already, they are not to be taxed.  Yet, without the plan and without new sources of revenue everybody is going to receive more.  I am trying to see some semblance of sanity in all of this confusion.  One thing occurs to me. Perhaps the Fianna Fáil Party are going to improve the quality of life, that is, that we will abandon traditional economic assumptions and will ask people to take less but to remember that in so far as we have removed the present Government all is really well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say some simple things about the issues raised under the Finance Bill.  First of all, I do not subscribe to the simplistic mentality that you can work your way out of an economic recession by changing personnel in charge of revenue distribution and redistribution in the same way as one changes the position of a footballer on the pitch.  It is interesting, when people have decried the lack of contributions on this side of the House, that the only recipe they have offered is, in the words of Senator Garrett: &ldquo;For God's sake, get out of power!  Let us back.&rdquo;  This was preceded by an onslaught&mdash;and I thought that that was going to be <Col N="281" /> somewhat encouraging in some respects&mdash;that the present Government had no policy on agriculture or finance and that they had a policy in industry of wrecking jobs.</P>
    <P>I thought the House was then going to hear what Fianna Fáil policy in agriculture, industry, science, technology and public expenditure would be. Being a person of long memory, I remembered what a Fianna Fáil politician told me on one occasion.  He said &ldquo;Your party is out of power and mine is in power because we don't need any of these ologies, isms, plans or policies.&rdquo; I knew, in fact, although I hoped the House would hear something new, that it was the old fox that was there after all; the fox that can say with one bark, &ldquo;Planning is good&rdquo;, and then when it suits &ldquo;Planning should be avoided&rdquo; and on another occasion &ldquo;We must reduce taxation but we should not increase revenue&rdquo;.  This apparent confusion need not delay the House too long.  While people have criticised decisions made by the Government, there is one thing clearly transparent, that is, that the lack of any alternative policy is probably the single greatest asset of the Government.</P>
    <P>If I might expand on Senator Garret's points, he suggested that &ldquo;It is ye who have done this and it is ye who have done that&rdquo;.  As somebody who has been involved in the teaching of economics for a brief period, I would make the point that these reductionist kind of arguments serve very little purpose.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil, in some of the mistakes they made, inflicted them on the people through any personal sense of malice.  Rather, I feel it is this&mdash;something which will not be agreed with by the majority of the people, as I am frequently reminded&mdash; that it is not the group of people who form the Cabinet of the day who inflict social or economic ills on an economy or on a society; it is forces, more precisely market forces, which dictate levels of investment and of employment.  This is because a system which links a particular kind of relationship between labour and investment has brought about the present economic crisis.</P>
    <P>The Irish economic crisis, let us be <Col N="282" /> clear on this, cannot be considered in isolation.  At present in Nairobi the fourth meeting of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is seeing one of the most interesting confrontations that has yet taken place: a confrontation between the world of the rich and the world of the poor. John Armstrong of <i>The Irish Times,</i> only two days ago could write a report which clearly stated that the 77 poorest countries paid over $1 billion annually to the developed countries for the use of patents and some developed technologies. When the amount of aid given by the developed world to underdeveloped countries, those 77 countries, is put into ratio, one can see that it is but a tiny fraction of what is being extracted from the Third World in terms of resources and real wealth.</P>
    <P>These principles which have brought about a world crisis and a world confrontation between people who believe in a certain kind of economic system and those who believe in an alternative are reflected in the economic crisis which affects this country.  It is a crisis between those countries which possess resources and those countries which have not only extracted&mdash; extracted at deep personal cost&mdash; resources from the Third World but have in their expenditure and their usage created a very vulgar and wasteful society in the western world.  Therefore, any consideration of the Irish economy &mdash;the last speaker invited the House to consider the economy generally&mdash;and the position in which it finds itself involves, inevitably, a consideration of the present state of the world economy. Here, as I have stated, the principles are basically the same.  To put it in more human terms, it has been the indiscriminate exploitative extraction by the industrialised countries, as we know them today, of basic raw materials and their employment in wasteful and undignified commodity products.</P>
    <P>That has brought about and is sustaining famine in the Third World. Inevitably, any of us who are participating in societies which sustain those economic systems are partners&mdash;we are not independent and we are not isolated.  Our consumption pattern and the greed of the western developed <Col N="283" /> nations is the primary source of the deprivation, the hunger and the famine of the other part of the world which has been gutted for its real wealth over centuries.  It is interesting, that it is in 1976, at the fourth conference of UNCTAD, that this confrontation has taken place.</P>
    <P>If the House needs further evidence that a single nation today is no longer in control of its economic instruments, I suggest this: my own reaction to the proceedings of the UNCTAD conference is that frequently Government initiatives have had to be tapered to take cognisance of the demands of multinational corporations.  In other words, even though nations meet, the greed of the multinational corporations cannot be curbed.  Therefore one might say that the international capitalist system, founded as it is on the expansion of such multinational corporations, has no political monitor or control.  The single greatest challenge facing all of us in the international community is to redress that position.</P>
    <P>Coming to Ireland's case, I want to reiterate some points.  I believe that the Finance Bill as such is a limited instrument in what it can do if we retain the traditional concept of economics.  What the Finance Bill can set out to do is to gather revenue and distribute it in a particular way.  One thing that is patently clear is that the pressure of Labour members of the Government is evident, for example, in the manner in which the living standards of those drawing social welfare payments have been protected to some extent.  There has been an increase in expenditure on social welfare from £91 million to £142 million.  I do not suggest that that is sufficient to either eliminate poverty in our society or to reduce genuine distress.  What I am saying, in so far as redistribution is being made, is that an attempt is being made to try and hold up that vulnerable section of the community, a vulnerable section of the community that is frequently treated with abuse by those who do not understand their plight.  It is often forgotten that those who, for example, find themselves unemployed have for the greater portion of their lives contributed <Col N="284" /> with their labour to our present society.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the Finance Bill and accepting the necessity for economic planning it is not sufficient&mdash;I wish Senator Garrett was here because I would grant him a point on this&mdash;for a person contributing to a debate on the economy to ask the House to believe that Fianna Fáil might do better.  On the other hand, to simply say: &ldquo;We are going better than when Fianna Fáil were in power&rdquo;, would be insufficient.</P>
    <P>In the last 12 months there has been public demand for the concept of planning.  The concept of planning&mdash; and future Finance Bills will reflect this, I hope&mdash;is the opposite of some of the principles upon which present economics is based.  For example, the economic base of power in the present system, as it works, is based on the ability through ownership and control over means of production to determine the distribution and disposition of the surplus that is generated in production itself.  That is, those who have power largely conferred through ownership of the means of production decide to exercise that power as if they were distributing the results of economic growth in the same way as they would distribute a residuum.  We should be more optimstic and constructive in the debate.  We should not only speak about the necessity for a plan but we should speak about the implications of having planning at all.</P>
    <P>There is, whether we like it or not, a direct contradiction between the concept of planning and the kind of <i>ad hoc</i> distribution of revenue surpluses which have gone on until now.  For example, budgets in the history of this State have been surrounded by mystery.  It was as if the Minister, having gathered a certain amount of revenue, could dispose of it in a number of ways and one would have to exercise guess-work as to where it was to be spent.  The minimal acceptance of the concept of planning means that one articulates social goals and stresses that the wealth generated in the community will go towards the relief of social distress, the answering of social needs and will serve social goals.  This eliminates the <Col N="285" /> element of mystery for the conscious purpose of creating a just society.  In that case production&mdash;manipulation of resources&mdash;is no longer dictated by the forces of the commodity market.  In that case, one is controlling, in so far as one is using the economy instrumentally, the kind of society one wants.  As the world economic crisis has begun to be analysed, we should realise that the economic order that is in crisis is an undignified order, an order at world level that provoked a massive confrontation between those in greatest need and those who accumulated resources through greed.  At a national level, we have to realise that the resources of this country must be used in the interests of the community in general.</P>
    <P>What happens if one wants to change a society?  Any socialist who believes in economic planning must be prepared to move forward to a structure of economic relationships in which money-market criteria are no longer dominant. The criteria must instead be direct satisfaction of social needs, and this implies a number of things, particularly the democratisation of decision-making. Let us consider, as we discuss the Finance Bill and the requirements of finance in general, what our financial instruments have to serve.  It has been pointed out to us in one document after another, particularly by Professor Brendan Walsh of the Economic and Social Research Institute, the magnitude of the task which faces us socially in the years ahead.  Ireland's population is likely to increase at a far greater rate than that of the other member countries of the European Community.  That population growth will take place among the younger age group.  Emigration having slowed up and the natural increase having stabilised, we can now look forward to a growth in the active population in Ireland in the next decade of 17 per cent.  The comparable percentages for the same period in other member countries would be: 16.1 per cent for the Netherlands, 11.3 per cent for Italy, 8.4 per cent in France, 6.6 per cent in Belgium, 3.2 per cent in the United Kingdom, 2.8 per cent in Denmark and 0.6 per cent in West Germany.  This huge increase in population will automatically bring with it the responsibilities and obligations of job <Col N="286" /> creation if people are to contribute to society.</P>
    <P>The necessity for a plan can be seen immediately It has been demonstrated again and again that whatever has been attempted in the past is markedly insufficient to make up the number of jobs that are required for these huge population increases.  This means that it is not financial measures as such that will require the greatest change but the introduction of new financial institutions.  In other words, the kind of relationship of production to capital acquisition which we allowed to dominate in the past and which created this vulgar waste-making society and still sustains it, will simply be not on.  We will have to ensure that revenue gathered from future resources will be used in such a way that it will answer the demands of social need.  One of the primary elements of social need is the right to work.</P>
    <P>A demand for economic planning in general for the purpose of the achievement of social goals, a social need that has been demonstrated by independent scholarship, means that we have to be serious about both our future financial institutional requirements and our financial measures.  It is markedly insufficient simply to stand up in a debate and say: &ldquo;If we were there we would do better&rdquo;.  That is no answer to anyone looking forward to the planning of our society, to answering social need as it will manifest itself in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator Garrett mentioned something which might unfortunately be a cultural characteristic of this island.  He drew on that great word &ldquo;Ye&rdquo;, whoever they might be&mdash;I am not sure whether it includes the Divinity or several divinities, or whether they are real people&mdash;and said: &ldquo;Ye closed down 1,081 factories since March, 1973&rdquo;.  I remind the House of my remarks at the beginning of this speech that it is not the individuals of the day who closes down factories and eliminates jobs but rather market forces which are linked to a private enterprise economy and which are participating in a world economic order that is dominated more and more by the profit motive and is falling under the <Col N="287" /> pressure of the multinationals rather than of national states.</P>
    <P>What then of the future?  This House would have done much better if it had bravely said something like this: The base from which revenue can be gathered in this country at present has definite limits to it.  There are limits as to the levels of taxation that one can put on that base itself.  I reject altogether the principles of collection that have dominated until now.  I have suggested that the economy be consciously managed around the attainment of social goals rather than the Minister of the day be distributing revenue from the residuum of growth.</P>
    <P>I should like to put some further questions to people who might want to participate in this debate concerning the financing of our country at present and economic head.  It is sometimes said that what is necessary is the return to economic growth, but I raise the point, quite unashamedly that there is a deeper question&mdash;economic growth for whom?  Does the demand, the simplistic demand &ldquo;Return to economic growth&rdquo; mean by those who make it that we are happy with the distribution of the existing products of growth?  Remember we could return to growth.  It is conceivable we could achieve a growth rate, and the disparities in our society between those who possess wealth and those who are poor could grow, and grow very much indeed.  Therefore we should be taking advantage of the economic crisis and seeing, as I have seen, the economy mismanagement as instrumental for the achievement of social purposes and socially debated goals, and within that notion of the management of the economic instrument, the notion of the attainment of growth as a minor instrument.  All of this is extremely important if we are to move forward.</P>
    <P>It is very well worth while in a time like this to look at the structure of our consumer behaviour.  I argue that there are many aspects of consumer demand at present time which might generate revenue in the short term but which in the long term are not to the benefit of the world community in general.  Many consumer practices that have grown up <Col N="288" /> and that have been sustained through advertising in our western society are directly inimical to the interests of the world community as a whole.  It is consumer vulgarity in the western world which is the other side of the coin of famine in the Third World.</P>
    <P>We might too look at the nature of our dependency.  In discussing, for example, income we need to ensure that there is quite a difference in a revenue measure which will affect the income of somebody who is an extremely wealthy person and a measure which will affect the income of somebody who is just buying the basic necessities of life. Quite a difference arises.  To move forward then at the invitation of Senator Garrett, I suggest that there is this merit in one of his suggestions.  He asked&mdash;I do not agree with him&mdash;that the money spent on social welfare be reallocated in the manner in which he suggests it could be done so easily.</P>
    <P>One thing we might look at in the short term&mdash;and I emphasise it is short term&mdash;is the manner in which savings have continued to accumulate while investment has not taken place at the same rate.  This has meant that surpluses have risen within the commercial banking sector.  At the same time we are aware of the level of unemployment wavering something around 118,000.  We are also aware that very many public infrastructural schemes have been planned and designed, particularly since the financing of a great proportion of them was removed to central funds.  These three terms taken together&mdash;the existence of worth-while social infrastructural projects, the accumulation of commercial banks' surplus and the high level of unemployment&mdash;would mean plans in the very short term, would probably result in the creation of sure jobs and would not in the short term have an inflationary effect.</P>
    <P>This would, however, not be an answer to the long-term reorientating of our economic structure which must be shifted from the idea of production for profit or, if a related corollary, production of commodities for market consumption which will generate profits. Rather must we speak about production for use by those who are in need.  It is <Col N="289" /> that kind of thinking which lies in the Labour Party's insistence on a debate at the present time on the future of the economy, on the necessity of economic planning.</P>
    <P>We might rather in simpler language say this.  We want to rescue future generations from the indiscriminate and harsh effects of market forces and enable the Government of the day, through their financial instruments and institutions, to answer social need and consciously to improve our society. Our demand for planning therefore implies advanced production techniques and answering of social need.</P>
    <P>In a speech which was given yesterday and reported the speaker said that one can answer some of our economic ills by increasing productivity and that an increase in productivity will bring about an increase in revenue.  But things are not as simple as that.  Productivity in the narrowest sense means pursuit of the production of exchange values without regard to the consequences. The guiding principle is not the social need of which I have been speaking, not the most effective use of resources to meet social needs and social aims, but the production of exchangeable, saleable and marketable commodities to create the greatest profit.</P>
    <P>Indeed many people, without realising what they are doing, tacitly support the politics of the market economy.  They do so not because they are forced but because tacitly they are induced through advertising and through the subtle operations of the market mechanism to scramble for commodities that do not answer their real needs in the best fashion.  This is an example of <i>ad hoc</i> consumption, an example of what happens where there is no social plan, where there has been no debate about the purposes of the use of resources in general.</P>
    <P>I doubt very much if we can expect reasonably to raise much more revenue from the structures we have at present in society.  It is obvious that if it is a primary social aim that one has the right to work one must also take Professor Walsh's figure, that thousands of young people will need employment. The private sector is not able to meet that demand.  Here again I opened with <Col N="290" /> the principles of confusion among the many spokesmen of Fianna Fáil.  I wish to goodness that they would make up their mind whether they believe that the private sector can&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">

      <P>The Senator should worry for himself and his own party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned for society which transcends both the immediate opportunities of the Senator's party or, in fact, the purpose of mine.  Is the private sector capable of generating the number of jobs that are required?  The obvious answer is that it is not.  If we were serious and if we were to have a worth-while debate in this House, all sides of the House would agree about the necessity of having a careful economic plan.  Where we would differ would be the emphasis we put on the means of implementing that plan or how social goals might be achieved.</P>
      <P>I very much share the concern of the Senators on all sides of the House who have spoken about loss of employment, but a time like this is an opportunity for us to look at the kind of employment we have generated.  Inevitably the way the private enterprise system has worked has meant that any commodity that has an exchange value that will generate profit finds itself justified and any job that is involved in the creation of such a commodity is justified.  Now, it is logical to assume that when one takes the other side, the planning of attainment of social aim, the jobs that will be most valuable in society will be those that will be addressed to the greatest needs of society.  It is necessary therefore not only to speak about how we are going to create numbers of jobs, but where those jobs are and what people will be doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is opportune now to advert to something else, and that is that the creation of industrial jobs and economic growth, as it is referred to frequently, from an external source has served us very badly.  We have, for example, people commenting on the state of the Irish economy, suggesting that things are so in Europe and Britain and therefore they are so in Ireland.  I have often referred to it as a kind of an influenza economic theory&mdash;things are bad and <Col N="291" /> this spreads around the world, and they get better and this spreads around the world.  We all know that this need not be so and those people who have tenaciously and with tremendous consistency attacked the notion of planning and the notion of the Government interfering in the economy as standing in the way of creating future jobs for the future population of this country are people who cannot have their cake and eat it.  We either bash the private enterprise system, which is bankrupt and inefficient, or decide to develop as much as possible the popular acceptance of the concept of public planning and public ownership.  If revenue in the present circumstances be gathered from the existing disposal of resources, it is of the utmost importance that future resources and the revenue which they will generate should be held by a State banking company rather than the commercial banking sector.  In other words, whatever will be generated from our new wealth, will be controlled by the State, thereby making it amenable for disposal and usage in job creation in a way that it is dignified and in accordance with an adequate social plan.  To do otherwise would be to allow profits and the benefits of the new resources to move to private hands in an indiscriminate fashion outside this country and around the world.</P>
    <P>It is an elementary form of political honesty to say whose side one is on. I believe that what we have seen in terms of world confrontation, politically between the resource-possessing and the resource-consuming countries, is no accident.  Its minor ramifications in our own economy, which are huge when we look at our own needs, show that we need an entirely new approach towards the financing of our needs.  Whether we like it or not, many people who are not convinced socialists for a number of reasons may feel the necessity of socialist planning pressed upon them.</P>
    <P>In other times when one compares this crisis with others which have occurred, historically different capital-possessing countries have been able to bail each other out through international fiscal movements.  The present crisis has a single characteristic which <Col N="292" /> sets it aside.  Many of the major economies are in crisis at the same time, and it is this kind of crisis which has called into question the very principles of economics upon which society has been based.  That is why it is such a healthy thing that one of the positive responses to the crisis would be the demand in public for a debate on economic planning.</P>
    <P>Regarding the disposal of existing revenue, where concessions have been allowed for research and development within existing industry.  If we were to set about the task of economic planning and if we had had a sufficiently wide-ranging debate on the kind of society we wanted, we would be faced with the positive implementation through measures of that plan.  I have said already how surpluses that might be generated from use of resources should be used so that they could be spun-off into other socially useful ways.  It is obvious too that even at the other level we have given tax concessions for certain development.</P>
    <P>Here we need to advert to an important point within the structure of science and research and development itself.  If people have been deluded into accepting the market mechanism and its justification through advertising, when we look at it in terms of the history of civilisation one of the enormous tragedies of our time is that people of immense talent have spent their lives in either propping up such parasitical activity as advertising or in creating the technology of a consciously despoiling nature.  Some people, even scientists, have lent themselves to the development of products which are in terms of the world community a danger not only to our own generation but a danger to other generations.  It might be useful to draw a distinction between a concession we might give towards technology which will be employed for its socially useful purpose and technology which will be applied for the production of a commodity which might perhaps be contributing merely to the degraded profile of society as it is.</P>
    <P>The nub of the argument I am making is that all of our financial measures should be not simply dealing with the narrow problem of restoring growth <Col N="293" /> but should be the expression of an instrument about which we had a social debate.  There should not be such a casual character about the transfer of public revenue.  It appears to me that there should be basic distributions of taxation and of wealth.  It would be taken as a matter of right that a person has a right to a certain level of living and certain basic necessities.</P>
    <P>Let us not be dishonest and suggest that, apart from a gesture, that has ever been stated in the history of Irish economic debate.  I remember reading with great care the <i>First Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which made no mention of social aim, the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which had a paragraph and the abandoned <i>Third Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which had a little more on the social purpose of economic growth. As we speak about how we are disposing of the finances of the nation, my lack of pleasure in speaking is not due to the immediate or present crisis; it is because we are discussing these measures in a society that has not set its face towards any great task, that frequently mouths something about economic growth without giving social expression to what it means by economic growth.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about the disposal of moneys by a society which has unconsciously, as regards the majority of the population and consciously at the level of Government, set itself against planning, decrying planning as an interference with private will and enterprise.  The choice is now clear to us all.  We can continue with this old game of hide-and-seek about the revenues of the State or we can put finance into its perspective.  Financial measures are an aspect of short-term economic management.</P>
    <P>Lord Keynes said he looked forward to the day when economics would take its place in the back seat of the car.  He was hardly a socialist.  Economics are not the real reason we meet in Parliament. We structure our economy to achieve a certain kind and quality of life.  What I have said has been very much helped by what has been said by Senator Garrett in his contribution.  I ask people that when they come to <Col N="294" /> speak on the state of the economy or on the Finance Bill in detail that they not speak merely in terms of this football imagery&mdash;&ldquo;Ye did it; we would do it better; if we were in we would do better&rdquo;, and so on.  We are as a society suffering from quite a sufficiency of simplistic thinking.  It would be extremely unfortunate if in the most important area of all&mdash;the area of social programming and economic planning&mdash; we fell to a level of imagery that used ye's and we's and they's in the same way as cargo cults arise and disappear in the Melanesian Islands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the previous speaker.  He would appear to me to show all the evidence of being a very frustrated person.  He spoke at length without making much mention of the real problems facing this country and the Irish people at present, or with scant references to the Finance Bill before this House.</P>
      <P>This is one of the biggest Finance Bills that has come before the Seanad for many years.  It is becoming bigger and bigger because of the far-reaching, more detailed and complicated implications which are being written into our financial structures in Government circles.  Therefore, I am not surprised that the previous speaker deliberately dodged the issues facing the people at present.  I wondered for a moment if I was listening to a lecture on socialism or Marxism or was it somebody trying to brainwash the House into new thinking in order to distract the people from the real problems of the day.  Has the west gone completely Marxist and socialist?  I do not believe they have. This is a Christian society, a society that believes in the principles of Christian democracy.  This is a society that has struggled hard over the years to preserve the freedom and democracy which we have.  Let us hope that the time will return when real progress and real democracy will be evident in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an example this morning of efforts being made to restrict debate in this assembly.  That was a retrograde step.  I am glad it was resolved by agreement, because our democratic institutions must be preserved and upheld no matter what emergencies we <Col N="295" /> may come through or what difficulties may arise from day to day.  Therefore I was pleased agreement was reached with regard to the extension of time to debate fully this Finance Bill because of its far-reaching implications and its effects on every section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House did say this morning that in the past it was the normal practice to allow two days of debate to a Finance Bill.  He mentioned that that was the case during the term of the Fianna Fáil Government.  There is no comparison between the Finance Bills of the past and the Finance Bills of today.  Taxation then was insignificant in comparison with today.  As the previous speaker said, there was no gutting process in operation then.  We heard about the gutted peoples of the Third World.  I think we have the gutted peoples of the Irish nation because they are being, not only gutted, but bled white by the penal taxation code which is being imposed upon them at present.  It is all happening in the name of socialism.  We have had three-and-a-half years of a socialist experiment in this country and we see the result.  We see the highest rate of taxation ever experienced in the country. We have the highest rate of borrowing ever experienced and the highest rate of unemployment.  We see money shortages everywhere.  Why is all this happening?  We have got a lecture on social reforms.  Why is it happening when we have all those intellectual people so close to Government?</P>
    <P>By and large the Irish people have lost confidence in those who are handling our economy.  They have lost confidence in investment procedures.  The private sector is no longer ready to experiment in job creation because of the way that sector has been handled over the past few years.  It is no longer profitable to work hard to make money to start a business enterprise or to give employment.  Therefore, I am not surprised or disappointed that so many people have decided to place their investments in other parts of the world. They have lost faith in our system in this country.  They have been described over the past few years as the idle <Col N="296" /> filthy rich.  Those statements have done a great deal of harm.  The people in this House who boast of the fact that they are socialists and talk about the filthy and the idle rich are now reaping the reward of their statements over the years.</P>
    <P>The money is gone and the people are unemployed.  No economy can be built up without financial resources. The financial resources must be there as also must confidence in the people; confidence in their ability to invest wisely and confidence in their ability to create the growth and development that is so necessary if this country is to be lifted out of the morass in which it is.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any member of this Government has the will, the determination or the capacity to save this country.  The Government seem to be content to let the nation drift and let things just happen without any long-term economic planning, without any financial programming or without any job creation prospects.  I could go on and on but there is little use.  The people have become frustrated.  They have reached the point of despair.  I have mentioned that investors have lost faith in our financial structures and in the ability of the Government to create job opportunities.  The lead must come from the Government.  They have been elected by the people through the democratic process.  We still have the democratic process with us no matter what our socialist friends might think. The Government were elected three-and-a-half years ago to do a job which they promised to do but, alas, the evidence of their failure is more apparent each day.</P>
    <P>In this budget we have new and increased taxation.  We have had a penal increase in motor taxation.  One would not have faulted the increase in motor taxation if there was some return to the local authorities in the form of road grants, but that has not happened.  Road grants have been reduced.  Local authorities are finding it difficult to maintain the road programmes they had embarked on over the years.  More money is being used at Government level and less is being made available to local authorities, despite the fact that there has been a huge increase in motor taxation, not to mention the steep <Col N="297" /> increase in petrol prices which occurred in recent times.</P>
    <P>Now we have a new dimension being added in the Finance Bill.  We have new penalties being imposed upon those who use red diesel oil in their trucks in preference to commercial diesel.  I see no provision in the Bill for error.  I know a lorry driver who was asked to fill up a tank and, through inexperience, he filled it with red diesel although the commercial diesel was in a tank nearby. He was new to the job and he did not know the difference.  The owner of the truck offered to pay the duty on the red diesel but it was no use.  He was brought to court and fined heavily.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion I can come to is that it is a grave mistake to give power to people who do not have to answer to the electorate.  I mean giving power to the Revenue Commissioners to impose stiff and severe penalties on people without offering some redress to the people who are the real victims.  This is wrong.  I said it here before.  I said it when Fianna Fáil were in power.  It is wrong to give additional powers to the Revenue Commissioners who are accountable to nobody.  They are in a sheltered position.  Some of them may be reasonable men.  Others may be bully boys who try to enforce the law and penalise people and collect revenue no matter how they get it.  I am anxious to hear what the Minister has to say with regard to allowing some hearing to people who are caught through no fault of their own.  I mentioned the person who was heavily fined.  This was a miscarriage of justice and it is something which needs to be rectified whenever the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>We have of course the new tax on gas units which were installed in motor cars in recent years.  It is extraordinary that, when somebody uses their genius to discover a new invention, there is always somebody else waiting to reap a reward in the form of taxation.  We see a new implication in this Bill in which liquid gas is being taxed in the same way as commercial diesel and petrol.  I am beginning to wonder if any motorist will be justified in installing this piece of expensive equipment in his car to try to provide himself with a cheaper method of transport.  I am convinced that it is <Col N="298" /> no longer profitable to do so and that these gas units will disappear eventually. This is a pity because we hoped to have available to us a supply of natural gas from our own resources which could be used to propel our vehicles in preference to imported expensive oil.  I hope this commodity will not be overpriced and placed beyond the reach of the motorist.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the motorist has been hit so heavily in this Finance Bill.  We know people have to travel to work.  We know people are engaged in activities which require them to travel to their work, people working on building sites, for Bord na Móna, the ESB, commercial travellers, and so on. The recent budget impositions imposed restrictions on those people and created many additional hardships for them because of the necessity for using a car to get to their place of work.</P>
    <P>It would have been reasonable to expect that some effort would have been made to give some tax remission to the man who must use his car to get to work.  When the Minister wants money he goes to the surest source. The surest way of getting additional taxation was to tax the motorist because a motor car is of little use to anybody when it is lying idle.  You must buy petrol, diesel or gas if you want to get to your place of work.  Many people had to decide whether it was more profitable to stay at home, leave the car in the shed, and draw the dole, the pay-related benefits, and so on.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the taxation of vehicles whether or not they are being used.  Many people have motor vehicles which they do not use and they will now be compelled to tax them irrespective of their use.  I do not know as yet what the real implications will be when the grim realities are faced up to.  I do not know if any reasonable excuse will be accepted for not taxing a car which is not being used.  I would hope sanity would prevail and that some effort would be made to ensure that invalids would be fully considered.  There are invalids who do not use their cars during the winter months.  It would be a severe imposition on those people to have to tax their mechanically propelled vehicles for a 12-month period instead of a three-month period as some of them <Col N="299" /> do at present.  They only move about during the summer months when the weather is warm.  I hope that some effort will be made to alleviate the hardship and distress on those people who really need to get out in order to break the monotony of their lives. They are invalids and they need a little relaxation.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed too that, in spite of the increased expenditure, no further allocations were made available to local authorities for housing grants, water and sewerage schemes, and for house construction in general.  In my county, we have had to accept a smaller allocation for house building this year than other years.  The allocation for County Westmeath for the provision of rural cottages for this year enables only six to be built.  That is a disastrous situation. It deserves to be highlighted because it is a really serious situation.  I always looked upon the housing industry as our greatest source of employment.  It creates spin-off jobs through the use of timber, concrete, slates, tiles, and so on, all of which are manufactured here.  All this helped to generate wealth because the money was retained within our shores.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed more money has not been made available for building because we still have a housing shortage. There is no doubt about that.  More and more houses deteriorate and fall into disrepair each year and, therefore, it is reasonable to expect that more money should be made available to local authorities to allow them to continue their programme of house building. Local authorities have made wonderful strides over the years in the provision of houses.  They have also made great strides with regard to the installation of water and sewerage schemes.  Their efforts this year have been hampered by lack of capital.  Water and sewerage schemes are top priorities.  Then the houses can be provided.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the new house grants was, in my opinion, a retrograde step.  Those grants had not been increased for a number of years.  They should have been increased to a more realistic figure because of the high cost involved in providing houses.  If a <Col N="300" /> reasonable effort was made to assist people to provide their own homes, we would be taking more and more people off the local authority housing lists. People want to provide their own homes and they know they can do so more speedily than the local authority.  If the incentives were there, people would build their own homes and fewer would be depending on the local authorities for housing.  We have a real crisis in that industry this year.  Many people will be disappointed when they discover they have little hope of being housed this year.  This was one industry that was able to absorb the unemployed.  It was one industry where people could be put to work quickly.  They did not have to wait for factories to be built.  They were employed in the initial construction. This opportunity has been missed.</P>
    <P>We also have the millstone hanging around our necks of foreign borrowing. We have now discovered it is costing the Irish taxpayer £355 million to service all the borrowing that has taken place in recent years.  The sum of £355 million would create many jobs at present.  It would create jobs in agriculture, in the building industry, in our road structure and in the provision of water and sewerage schemes.  It is a tragedy that all that money has to go to service foreign borrowing when it could be used to create jobs at home.  This should bring home to us the grim reality of borrowing on the scale that has been embarked upon in recent years.  Let us hope that sanity will be restored and that some effort will be made to reduce the rate of foreign borrowing.  What we need are schemes and incentives which will encourage more investment by our own people.</P>
    <P>If people feel they will be allowed a fair return on their investments, they will invest and will respond to the call to provide job opportunities.  When they are called the idle filthy rich, when they are taxed out of all proportion, they cannot be blamed for becoming disillusioned.  There are no really wealthy people here.  This is a young and poor nation out on the periphery of Europe.  We are a nation which had a long and hard struggle for our economic independence and, therefore, it is only natural that we have no real wealth. <Col N="301" /> We have been exploited by foreign powers for generation after generation and, so, it can be said that we are a comparatively young nation&mdash;in fact, one of the youngest nations in Europe&mdash; without a great deal of mineral wealth or a great deal of the expertise which was freely available to other countries.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of our natural resources.  Our greatest single natural resource is our agricultural industry, the soil of Ireland.  Not enough is being done at present to induce increased agricultural production. We have, for example, the farm modernisation scheme under which the bigger farmers receive higher grants and the smaller farmers receive smaller grants.  That may be socialism.  I do not know&mdash;thank God, I do not know&mdash; but our learned socialist friends are here and they will probably lecture to us later on whether that is a good system.  I believe it is a wrong system. The people who need the assistance are the small farmers.  The farm modernisation scheme should be revised at the earliest opportunity because &mdash;and let there be no doubt about it&mdash;agriculture and the land of Ireland will always be there.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about mineral wealth. In 25 or 30 years the mines will be exhausted but we will still have the land of Ireland and we should spare no effort to use the land to its fullest productive capacity.  An effort must be made now to ensure that we have increased agricultural production.  It can be done if we have long-term planning, if we have a proper marketing system. We have not got that at present.  We are dependent on the market situation in other countries.  We need long-term planning for agriculture because it is one of the best ways of securing permanent employment.  Every man working in agriculture is gainfully employed.  What he needs is an incentive.  If we gave agriculture as much attention as we gave to industry, we might have been more successful in halting the flight from the land.</P>
    <P>It was suggested some time ago that we should provide more off-farm jobs for people who are leaving the land each year.  We have now discovered that those job opportunities are not <Col N="302" /> available in rural Ireland.  Thousands of our men and women have come to Dublin to seek employment.  They emigrated in recent years but they have now discovered that the safety valve of emigration is no longer available.  They are becoming disillusioned and frustrated because there are no job opportunities.</P>
    <P>We have a fairly successful educational system.  Young people are now well educated.  They are equipped and geared to meet the challenge of the future but, when they have completed their education, they discover there are no job opportunities for them.  This happened because there was a lack of confidence on the part of the private sector.  They felt they were not getting the lead they should have been getting from the Government.  They felt the incentives were not there for further investment in this country.  Therefore, we should redraw our priorities, try to stabilise the numbers engaged in agriculture and then plan and gear ourselves towards providing employment for the thousands of school leavers each year.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about social welfare and the liberal increases in social welfare benefits recently.  Those increases have barely kept pace with the cost of living.  There is no point in anybody saying: &ldquo;Look at the liberal increases in social welfare and unemployment benefits.&rdquo;  All those increases were necessary because of our inflation rate over the past few years.  Nobody can say social welfare recipients are better off.  They are not better off because of our high inflation rate and the continuing price rises which seem to occur week by week and day by day.  A woman recently said to me our Ministers need not worry about family planning or contraception because rearing babies is now too expensive. Each week baby foods and other baby requisites top the price list.  We appear to hit hardest at the weakest sections of our community.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised people are becoming frustrated and disillusioned and that thousands of people are living on the point of despair.  Confidence is lacking.  We need to restore confidence. We will not restore it without a change <Col N="303" /> of Government.  The socialist experiment has failed.  I cannot understand the silence of Fine Gael members who seem to do the bidding of the Labour members all the time.  The result is high unemployment, low investment, and local authorities trying to operate on shoestring budgets.  We have all round chaos and the remedy will not be found without a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to address myself to the problems of the person described by the Minister for Finance in his opening speech as the hard-pressed taxpayer.  There is not a very good realisation on the part of the hard-pressed taxpayer of precisely why he is hard-pressed.  Some of the reasons for this have already been suggested by Senator Michael D. Higgins when he pointed to the population projections set out by Professor Brendan Walsh of the Economic and Social Research Institute.  It is true that, even though they are, I understand, in the process of being revised downwards, these projections for our population growth are very substantial for anybody paying taxes in Ireland at present.</P>
      <P>We have&mdash;and I do not apologise to Senator Alexis FitzGerald for saying this&mdash;a very high dependant ratio of very young people and very old people who are large consumers of the social services and who cannot contribute to the funds out of which they are paid. The indications are, even if Professor Brendan Walsh's population forecasts are revised downwards, that this dependant ratio, already very high by EEC standards, will further increase towards the end of the century.  The tax base, that relatively small middle ground, will become further and further under substantial pressure to produce the amount of money needed to keep the social services going even at their present level of availability and subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Michael D. Higgins that this underlines the need for planning.  I do not propose to go into this in any great detail.  I would argue, not just for planning in the long-term and for the explicit endorsement by the Government of a planning mechanism which would make sense of <Col N="304" /> our conflicting priorities, but for imaginative thinking in the short-term. There are many areas in which imaginative thinking can help, if not necessarily to reduce expenditure, at least to avoid wasteful duplication.</P>
    <P>I suspect there are many Government Departments which are spending money in the same areas, or in overlapping areas, in which some form of cost-benefit analysis or study could indicate how they could spend the same money to much greater effect.  I suspect there are substantial overlaps in some areas between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Education.  There are certainly overlaps in some areas between the Department of Defence and the Department of Education.  There are all sorts of areas like these in which we must try and co-ordinate things as much as possible. We are not privy to what goes on inside the Cabinet but, given that politicians are human, it seems almost inevitable that there is always a great stress, even within a system of collective Cabinet responsibility, on the rights, prerogatives and claims of individual Departments.  If we had effective planning, unnecessary rivalry and frictions between Government Departments would be substantially reduced and, with them, any degree of waste to which they may in the past have contributed.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I mean in the short-term, I want to make a few comments on the section of the Finance Bill which concerns motor cars and specifically on two items: the increase in the duty on petrol, and the measures aimed at catching people who avoid paying tax on their motor cars.  With regard to the increase in the price of petrol, it is arguable that the amount of discretionary spending on petrol is perhaps not as high as the Government thought when they framed this section. I hope it is and I hope the section will have the desired effect.  It is at least arguable&mdash;and it has been suggested on all sides of the House&mdash;that this discretionary element is not very large.</P>
    <P>There is almost a suggestion in the particular framework of the tax provisions relating to motorists, that what we have here is an attempt at formulating some sort of transport policy. <Col N="305" /> Even though this may be valid as far as it goes, I would argue that it can never take the place of an integrated transport policy which was desperately needed. We still have, after I do not know how many years, buses and trains competing against each other on the same route, neither of them being used by individuals who instead are in cars along roads parallel to the railways.  The fact that we have not got an integrated transport system is due to a lack of coordinated and coherent thinking over the past several decades.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to complain about the lack of a policy in the past; we must set out to create some form of integrated transport policy for the future. It will be a transport policy into which taxation elements like this can be fitted and in which they will find their natural place.  I am convinced we will have far more public acceptance of fairly stringent tax measures like this, especially as they affect individual motorists, if they are seen as part of an overall and integrated transport scheme from which people will, by and large, benefit, and which will improve the efficiency of the transport services and transport arrangements within the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to some of the other provisions dealing with taxation and more specifically those dealing with personal taxation.  As anybody who has ever tried to fill out his own income tax form knows, our tax system becomes more complicated by the hour. This has produced a phenomenon in which there is a considerable lack of understanding of the tax system both on the part of people who are beneficiaries of it, and on the part of people who are contributaries to it.  There is a lack of an overall picture of what the tax system is, what it is setting out to achieve, and how precisely it proposes to get there. I would argue, moreover, that this lack of a coherent picture is, perhaps, especially evident among people who are beneficiaries of the tax system.</P>
    <P>It is not often realised how many people are beneficiaries of the tax system in the widest sense.  When we talk of beneficiaries of the tax system, we tend to think of those who are in receipt of social welfare allowances, of <Col N="306" /> personal allowances of one kind or another, children's allowances, unemployment allowances, and so on.  It is not often realised that there are all sorts of beneficiaries of the tax system. For example, anybody who has children in school after the compulsory school leaving age, at school or at a third-level institution is a substantial beneficiary of the tax system.  Th National Economic and Social Council in their report on the inequality of income in Ireland pointed out that in certain circumstances an extremely well paid taxpayer can, if he has a certain number of children at school or at a third level institution, actually receive more from the State by way of benefits than he is paying to it in tax.  It could be argued that our educational system is one of the greatest offsets to progressive taxation that has yet been devised.  This fact is not often understood well enough by the person paying tax.</P>
    <P>The present arrangement of allowing people who pay mortgages to set off mortgage interest against income tax liability is also a substantial way in which people who otherwise would pay heavy taxes can benefit from the operation of the tax system.  It is possible in this day and age for somebody to get a mortgage of up to £20,000 for a house and if he and his wife are earning enough and if their mortgage is high enough they can bring about a situation perfectly legally in which up to 50 per cent of the cost of paying for the house is paid for by the taxpayer.  He can reduce his actual payments by about half if he is entitled to income tax relief at the top end of his scale.  We almost have a system of taxation, incentives and benefits which turns the society into the sort of society which must have been envisaged by George Bernard Shaw when he gave his advice to all persons wishing to become socialists. His advice to such persons was that they should make as much money as possible in whatever way possible and legal within the system, particularly the unfair ways, so that, first, they could show how unfair the system was and, secondly, they that could amass so much wealth that in their advocacy for socialism they could never be accused of the politics of envy.  It is not <Col N="307" /> often realised when we talk of the welfare state in our society that we have two welfare states.  We have at one end of the spectrum the beneficiaries of the system of taxation which we are here adjusting in the social welfare branch. At the other end we have the beneficiaries of the taxation system at the upper end of the scale.  However hard pressed these people are it is fair to say that they too are beneficiaries of a taxation system and in a sense can be described as the inhabitants of a second welfare state at the upper end of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>On the other hand we have in between these two welfare states a third group of people, a group of people who are not poor enough to be recipients of social welfare or to get any substantial advantage from taxation reliefs and who are not rich enough to be able to set any particular relief against their income. These are people who fall into what might be known as the property trap.  They are the people to whom any taxation reforms and social welfare reforms should be addressed expressly. These are the people who feel most bitter about the present system, who perhaps understand it least and who have least of all any understanding of the overall and cohesive policy of a tax system.</P>
    <P>It is very good that during the past few years, the Government have begun to try to integrate our tax system.  It is good that we are getting, if rather slowly, some kind of indication from the Government that they are aware of the rather haphazard way in which the system has been built up in the past and that they are attempting to reshape it in order to make it more socially responsible and more progressive as a form of taxation.  In the process of doing this they have received many object lessons on the ways in which taxation reliefs which may or may not have been introduced as temporary measures rapidly become established rights and even entrenched privileges.  The classical example of this has been the tax relief to the co-ops.  I have been looking at some of the figures for the co-ops. Some were mentioned in some detail in the Dáil.  I find it astonishing that my personal income tax in the last year was <Col N="308" /> probably as high as that paid by many of the co-ops with a turnover of £1 million or close to it.  When people defend the co-ops let them remember that one of the principles on which these co-ops are run is that the more that is put into it the more that is got out of it.  So that the tax relief for the co-ops was always substantially benefiting the larger and better-off of its members.</P>
    <P>It is good that the Government have decided to do something about this.  I personally regret that it was decided to soften the blow because I do not believe it is a very hard blow at all. Overall I see this measure as part of this slow but deliberate progress towards the rationalisation of the taxation system to bring it to a much more equitable basis than it has been up to now.  I am glad the Government are doing this deliberately but I ask them to make haste not quite so slowly as has been the case up to now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. Although I am not well I came here today because it has been mentioned that as I am an employee of the co-ops I should say something on that section of the Bill which proposes to tax these organisations.  We have demands from all sections of the community, be they social welfare recipients, the industry section or the farming section.  The only way that extra finance can be given is by increasing taxation.  There is also the demand for the security of our State. This demand is one which should be acceded to.  The security of this State should be a first priority so far as the Government are concerned.  It is a task which today costs up to £200 million. We wish to defend our State and we wish to live happily in it.  We want to be able to know that our wives and families are protected when we are away.  If we have no security in the State we have nothing.  Such a situation would stymie investment, for instance, because no one is anxious to invest if there is a doubt as to his return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Opposition for opposing the Finance Bill, 1976 or for opposing any Bill.  That is their job. There are many people on the Fianna Fáil side who are contributing to this debate in a respectable way but there <Col N="309" /> are others who spoke without confining themselves to the Bill.  We are a Christian state and therefore accept that all should be enabled to carry out their duties to their families and so on.  There are demands from all sections and those demands, when they are made, are taken up by Fianna Fáil at the other side and made a platform for opposing the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should examine some of the demands they are making, because if the Minister for Finance gives to every section of the community what they are looking for, the State cannot function. There is a world crisis, not just a national crisis.  Yesterday we heard that there were 1,250,000 unemployed in Britain.  What affects Britain affects us and has done so since the foundation of the State.  Britain was a great help to this State for many years when she gave employment to many of our people.  But that cannot continue because Britain has her own huge unemployment problem.  Therefore we must fend for those people who will stay with us.  It is good they are staying in this country. Even if they are unemployed they are getting enough to ensure that they have the necessities.</P>
    <P>It is not a good decision to tax co-ops. The Minister knows my stand on this proposal as I have made representations to him in regard to it.  There is no point in my making a platform of it here but I will continue as a member of Fine Gael to do my duty at parliamentary party level to try to change the proposed taxation.  We have time to do that.  The co-ops will not be paying tax until 1978 so we at parliamentary party level will again approach the Minister and the Government to amend that section of the Bill.  We will prove that farmers are willing to pay their fair share of tax. The Fine Gael Agricultural Committee, of which I am a member, is now discussing this question with the farming organisations.  We have met the IFA and will meet them again.  We are meeting the ICMSA today and will meet them again.  We will try to reach agreement on what can be considered a fair share of tax.  Farmers realise they must pay tax today, even if that is opposed by some members of the Fianna Fáil Party. What is a fair share of tax?  By taxing <Col N="310" /> the co-ops they are paying some of that tax and I should think that when we have met the Minister again and before the co-ops will be paying tax, we will have convinced him that this measure should not be taken.</P>
    <P>Although this Bill is likely to be passed, I shall remain in Fine Gael because by being within the parliamentary party I shall have more influence than if I were an outsider.  Fine Gael is one of the most democratic parties in the country, a party that is fair to all its members and listens to what they have to say.</P>
    <P>We must look at the situation as it is now and as it has been for the last three or four years during which time the financial state of the world has been in a turmoil.  How could anyone say that the Minister for Finance or the Government should have been planning in those past years because the many decisions of the big nations in that time would have upset any plan here?  We had to wait for the climate to be right before devising a plan that would be possible, that would be workable.  Many plans have been made in this country and many plans have failed but I think we are coming now to a stage where the Government can and must produce a plan.  This would have been impossible in recent years when we had the situation of the oil sheiks changing the price of oil regularly.  That situation has affected many jobs, profits and industry. Until such time as we know that we have a final decision by those people it is very difficult to devise a plan that is worth while.  Those oil sheiks know that they have to depend on the other nations of the world if they are to succeed themselves.  They know that because of the huge increase in their oil prices the demand for petroleum products has reduced substantially. They realise that they also must be part of the world plan.  There must be a world plan and not just plans for individual nations, whether they are developed or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We must do our share for the underdeveloped nations of the world.  As Christians we must pay our share to that section of the world community that cannot do anything for themselves. Regardless of whether this requires <Col N="311" /> extra taxation, it is a task that we must undertake.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done an excellent job.  One of the improvements he has made is to increase personal tax reliefs.  Nothing has been said about that by the other side of the House.  The Minister realises that tax reliefs must be given to the people who deserve them most.  He is faced with demands from all sections of the community, including the public service. The public service, too, owe a duty to this State.  Those people who are in good secure positions must realise that there are others who are not so lucky. All of us owe a duty to those who are not able to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>We must also invest in industry, both small and large industries.  We must invest in industries that will expand and develop.  It is no good pouring money into industry that is likely to fail after two or three years.  Although farmers are reasonably well off today there is much room for expansion of the agricultural industry.  To this end both farmers and the Government must do their bit&mdash;the farmers because today they are better educated perhaps than those of the past and because they can avail of such organisations as Macra na Feirme and the ICMSA in order to produce more.</P>
    <P>If we look at the agricultural scene-I am one of the people in the co-operative movement&mdash;we find that last year we were complaining that we had too much investment in the processing end of the industry.  This was true but the farmers criticised management for creating that situation.  Today there is no such thing as spare capacity.  The farmers have produced more and this is because they have confidence in the country and in the Government. Naturally, like all other groups, they are upset if taxation is being imposed on them.</P>
    <P>All sections of the community rallying round together will put this country on the highest rung of the ladder.  There are many good aspects of this Bill and we will continue to make progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators for the manner in which they have debated the <Col N="312" /> Second Stage of this Bill, although I would not find myself in agreement with all that has been said or indeed all the approaches.  There is one matter that I would like to discuss at the outset.  A great deal of excitement was generated here today suggesting that the Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, was responsible for the disgracefully short period the Seanad is being allowed for discussion of the Finance Bill.  I want personally to put it on record that I endeavoured to get the co-operation of the Opposition in the Dáil to ensure that the Seanad would have some weeks in which to debate this Bill.  Last year when I was debating the Finance Bill in this House I expressed my own personal view that, of the four months the law allows for debate of the Finance Bill, at least one month should be allowed to the Seanad. It was my anxiety that we would have received the co-operation of the Opposition in the Dáil to allow the Seanad to have a month, and if not a month at least some weeks, in which to debate the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>All my personal efforts, all the efforts of the Government and all the requests of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, the Chief Whip, to allow the Seanad to have more time to debate the Bill were obstructed deliberately and consistently by the Fianna Fáil Members of the Dáil, who refused to take the Finance Bill on the days on which we wanted to take it and who required that it be taken at a later date.  When the Bill was debated there they persisted in wasting hours upon hours in making the same political points, many of which had little relevance to the Bill and certainly had no relevance to the financial details of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1974, in order to afford more time for the debate on the Finance Bill and in a desire to see the Seanad having an adequate opportunity to put a better input into the Finance Bill, a provision was made in section 85 of the 1974 Finance Bill extending to four months the period within which the Oireachtas was required to confirm the Financial Resolutions passed on the day of the budget.  If the Oireachtas failed to confirm a Financial Resolution passed on budget day the Financial Resolution <Col N="313" /> lapsed, so it is obviously necessary that by a certain date they pass the legislation. Having extended the period, the Fianna Fáil Opposition had the temerity to waste two-and-a-quarter hours here today condemning the Government's efforts to get this Bill through in time. Their colleagues in the Dáil used up an additional month in order to frustrate the contribution which the Seanad could make.</P>

      <P>The Minister will deal with all relevant matters.  A relevant matter which has been brought in in the course of this debate is the amount of time allowed to the Seanad for the discussion of this Bill, which is grossly inadequate.  I have said that, but I insist on putting on the record where <Col N="317" /> the blame lies and suggest to those who are complaining that they could show their sincerity by making arrangements with their Dáil colleagues to ensure adequate time in future instead of wanting, and I say deliberately wanting both here and in another place which I am not permitted to mention, to get up and do a song and dance about the amount of time which was allowed to them to discuss the most important Bill of the year when any shortage of time was attributable to their own laziness or disinclination to debate it or to take it on the days which were made available to them but which were not convenient for them&mdash;whether it was Punchestown or for some other reason I just do not know.</P>
      <P>Now we will deal with some of the issues which were raised in the course of this debate.  I recall that last year and the year before we had Fianna Fáil Senators demanding tax concessions from the Government to provide more money for the building industry and tax concessions in particular for building societies which they said were about to collapse and which, if they did not get the tax concessions which Fianna Fáil wanted for them, would not be able to provide money for the building industry. We refused to be parties to those unnecessary tax concessions because tax concessions given to one group means that those who are still caught in the tax net have to pay more.  They would not like to be reminded, I am sure, that we were entirely justified in our stand but I propose to put it on record.  At the time they were making demands for the tax concessions for investors in building societies, the amount of money attracted to building societies was £181 million, in 1973.  Without any tax concessions, the figure for 1975 rose to £286 million and this year it is likely to be a record of £360 million.</P>
      <P>As always, Fianna Fáil tended to rush into tax concessions that were not called for and they have bitterly and viciously fought every Finance Bill that we have introduced here whenever we sought to remove tax concessions, particularly when they were available to the better off members of our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was suggested that enough was not being provided in the public capital <Col N="318" /> programme, especially for the construction industry.  We were accused of various forms of increased expenditure on the one hand and accused us of the insufficiency of expenditure on the other.  It is interesting to note that the public capital programme has increased by 140 per cent since 1972-73, which is far, far in excess of any intervening inflation.  And the building construction industry as far as the Exchequer is concerned has increased by the same figure of 140 per cent in the intervening period and, as I pointed out, the building society funds have also increased from £181 million to about £360 million this year.</P>
    <P>So it is not shortage of funds that is creating any problem in that area. Certainly, it is not any shortage of any public funds.  We have pumped the money into the industry.  Ireland's construction industry has suffered much less than the construction industry in any country other than in OPEC countries over the last three years.  That is a statistical fact that cannot be disputed. We have maintained the public capital programme and the construction industry operating at a level which nobody else has been able to maintain.  The housing area, that area so grossly and miserably neglected by Fianna Fáil, has received special attention.  Therefore, not only have we maintained Fianna Fáil's highest output but we have actually got nearly 7,000 a year houses in excess of the Fianna Fáil record and that at a time when the rest of Europe was cutting back very dramatically on its house-building programme.  Then I listened today, or last night, to Senator Hanafin saying that we had not half enough houses.  It is not so long ago since Fianna Fáil published a Government White Paper saying there were too many houses in Ireland, saying that the figures proved a need for a very substantial reduction in the housing output.  That was Fianna Fáil's white paper, it was not ours.  That dictated Fianna Fáil's deliberate housing policy for years and years in this country until, out of fear of social and political upheaval, they decided around 1970 that it was time to correct their gross miscalculation of the housing needs of this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> There were also suggestions made from the Fianna Fáil benches reechoing the suggestions made by some elements in our community that social welfare contributions are excessive. There is only one other country in Europe where the Exchequer's contribution to social welfare is greater than ours, and that is Denmark.  Denmark is also the country that has the highest level of taxation, which is causing quite an amount of political and social difficulty in that country.  The people resent the high levels of taxation which they have to pay there.  But those levels would not be necessary if Denmark had a better integrated and developed insurance system.</P>
    <P>Our insurance contributions lag considerably behind any insurance system in the rest of Europe and as we are being exhorted by so many conscience-stricken members of Fianna Fáil, including Senator Yeats, to follow European practices in all things, I am surprised that he of all people should have been saying in this House that the level of contributions which have to be made for social welfare were too high when he knows, or ought to know, that the level of the contributions for social welfare are well below the European average and are about half the European average.</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats is very good at wearing his European heart on his sleeve when he can cause political embarrassment to Ireland abroad and at home.  Maybe he ought to wear it at all times and not be selective on the occasions in which he uses it.  I have not noted any lack of personal interest in the remarks made by Senator Yeats here or in the European Parliament about the disposition of the Irish Government, or my disposition in particular, and if people want to be European and pretend to be European I want them to be consistent and European at all times and then they should not require that we depart from European practice in relation to our social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Yeats also referred to what he regarded as the inadequacy of personal <Col N="320" /> allowances in the income tax system.  I find it very hard to accept the sincerity of complaints of this kind from a representative of a Government which for 11 years made no variation whatsoever in the value of income tax personal allowances.  When we have done it in each of the last three years at a time of immense budgetary difficulty, it comes ill from somebody who represents the party that did nothing for 11 years to dare to criticise us for what we have done.</P>

      <P>It demonstrates the height of hypocrisy for people, who for 11 years did nothing, to criticise others for the inadequacy of what they did in three years.  At least we did something worth while at a time of considerable budgetary difficulty.  As they have been very generous in delivering their criticism, they might at least show as much patience as we who received the criticism did.  I did not interrupt the Members opposite and I would expect that they might extend to me the courtesies which they say the Seanad usually extends when I am advancing arguments, which I know hurt them, which I know are causing difficulty and which they certainly would wish not to go on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of time left for debating the Finance Bill as distinct from debating various political points that have developed in the course of this debate is unfortunately all too short.  Nobody is more aware of that than I am. Nobody is more concerned about it than I am.  No one is more disappointed than I am, because I wished it to be otherwise.  But, as I said at the offset of my remarks, the blame lies not with the Government, who tried to expedite the passage of the Bill through the Dáil. If we did not succeed the fault certainly did not lie on our side of the House, because in that other place which I am not permitted to mention I was accused of deliberately silencing supporters on my side of the House&mdash;that I would not let them come in to support me.  I was also accused of being there without a supporter because nobody wanted to come in to support me.  The truth is we <Col N="321" /> were trying to hasten the passage of the Bill through the Dáil in order to allow the Seanad to have ample time to debate it so that there would be no occasion for the kind of complaints which were made this morning for the purpose of hitting the headlines.  Those who do not want to hit the headlines <Col N="322" /> and who want to get the work of the Seanad done in a sensible way have another 12 months at least in which to arrange for their colleagues in another place to ensure the rapid passage of the Bill through there so that there will be ample time for the Seanad to debate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises an important issue.  Basically, what this provides is that in the coming two years, the present year of 1976 and the year of 1977, or, if the Minister would prefer accuracy, these two years plus one day, that is, up to 1st January, 1979, the 100,000 self-employed will be required to pay income tax on the income of three years.  The principle being established by the Minister of trying to bring the taxable incomes of the self-employed more up to date than they have been is one with which we agree.  It is wrong that one section of the population should be paying tax on current income and that others should have the advantage in an inflationary situation of pay ing tax on income which is older and generally smaller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having accepted that this is a principle over which one can stand, one cannot under any circumstances agree with the method which the Minister's using in achieving it.  The position is that in this year, tax for the self-employed is payable in this way: 1st January, 1976, a half-year's tax; 1st July, 1976, another half-year's tax <Col N="323" /> That is the normal situation.  But on 1st October, 1976, a further half-year's tax will be required from the self-employed; then on 1st April, 1977, a further half-year's tax.  A year from now, 1st July, 1977, a further half-year's tax and again on 1st January, 1978.  So that between 1st January, 1976, and 1st January, 1978, that is, two years and one day, the self-employed will be required to pay three years' tax; although the 100,000 people concerned will, during that period have had the benefit of only two years' income.  The State stands to gain some £10 million in this year.  The Minister is considering the similar situation that has arisen as a result of the transition to PAYE of the 225,000 people in the public service.  He has given them a concession.  Explaining the reasoning behind this concession in his opening speech yesterday to the House he said:</P>
    <P>There is also the point that, as the change&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this is the change to PAYE in the public service</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;will involve a considerable increase in tax liabilities, there could be hard ship, in the absence of any remission, in cases where heavy financial commitments had already been taken on.</P>
    <P>The 100,000 self-employed also, perhaps to a greater extent than public servants, take on heavy financial commitments. Hardship is surely far greater in their case than it is in the case of the public service.  According to the Minister's calculations, the problem in the public service was that in an inflationary situation they were liable to tax on an income of approximately 23 per cent higher than otherwise would be the case.  In this instance the Minister is effectively increasing the amount of tax payable by some 50 per cent in the case of self-employed but no concession is given to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the specious case, that there is no increase in the amount of tax payable on the income concerned.  That is technically true. There are three tax years involved.  In each one of them the amount of income tax liable to be charged on the income concerned remains the same. <Col N="324" /> But the fact remains, which unfortunately cannot be denied, that the self-employed under Schedule D in this State are liable to pay tax in two years on three years' income, although obviously only two years' income will be received in that period.  How they will do it I do not know.  What effect will it have in a situation where already many small businesses are in a serious financial position?  What effect will it have on employment in these businesses?  What effect will it have on many people in small businesses who will not be able to raise the money to pay the extra tax and who will be charged 18 per cent interest on any arrears there may be, apart from any other unfortunate consequence of their non-payment? How many will be put into bankruptcy? How many more times will Seán P. Bedford's name appear over notices in the newspapers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to quote the names over the whole country. There will be many other similar notices under different names.  This situation is totally unjustified.  It is impossible to conceive the reasoning behind it.  The Minister's point that the amount of tax payable in each particular year remains the same is not valid.  The plain, tragic fact remains that all these people will be liable to pay 50 per cent more tax than they otherwise would.  I mentioned yesterday in the Minister's absence&mdash;and I think it should edify him by mentioning it again today on this point&mdash;that there was a somewhat similar situation in Sweden. Under the Swedish Socialist Government this well-known woman writer of children's fables was told by the officials that her income, which I presume was pretty large, would be liable to 102 per cent taxation.  She wrote a fable which she sent in to the leading Swedish newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the fable the big bad monster, representing the officials, tells the heroine that she is going to have to pay tax on her income at 102 per cent.  The heroine plaintively says that there are not that many percentages and the officials pointed out that there are.  The Minister <Col N="325" /> has exceeded this.  Not only are there 102 per cents in the Minister's life but a person concerned in this section, assuming that his income remained the same over the three years will be paying tax at 115.5 per cent on the income he receives.  Of course, he is paying it at 77 per cent on each year's taxable income, but that person is paying at the rate of 115.5 per cent on the income which he actually receives.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's life there are that many per cents.  It is not only wrong but it will not get in the revenue.  All that will happen will be that a great many people will go bankrupt and there will be further unemployment. The Minister ought to reconsider this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument about the tax to be paid under the new system is based on a false comparison.  What is being argued is that under the existing system everybody is required to pay one-and-a-half years' tax in one year and that people will have to pay two years' tax in one year under the new system. The system is unchanged.  It is a half year's tax on 1st July, 1976, and a half year's tax on 1st July, 1977.  That is not admitted in the argument.  Everyone wants to stop short of 1st July, 1977, and suggest that only one year's tax is paid.  But one-and-a-half years' tax is paid in a year and a day under the existing system and that is the burden with which to compare the new system.  We are not increasing the level of tax, we are not increasing the rate of tax, and we are not increasing the tax base.  On the other hand, people who are being brought into PAYE this year will pay tax on their incomes in 1976 whereas last year they paid tax on their incomes of 1974.  There is a very big difference in the tax burden of people who are being shifted forward by two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People under Schedule D, who are being asked to pay their tax in advance of the date upon which they previously paid it will still pay their tax in arrear. They will pay it 15 months in arrear instead of 18 months in arrear, as they did under the old system.  They will still, as it were, enjoy 15 months' credit rather than 18 months' credit.  And to get that type of credit at this time of inflation is a valuable use of money <Col N="326" /> which such people would not have if they were in the PAYE system.  If we had not advanced Schedule D payers in the way in which we did a greater inequity than previously existed between PAYE payers and those under Schedule D would be created.</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy for Schedule D payers or anybody else whose tax position is being changed in such a way that they may be called upon to make payment of tax earlier than they previously were required to pay it.  That happened in 1960 when the majority of taxpayers were brought within the PAYE system and that is happening in respect of all the public service taxpayers who have been brought within the PAYE system this year.  They will not have the use of Exchequer money. They are required to pay promptly at the time they receive the balance of their pay whereas the Schedule D payers would fail to enjoy a very significant advantage over those who have been brought within the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Schedule D payers who are having their tax credit period abbreviated should get a concession similar to that being given to PAYE payers.  That overlooks the fact that the base, rate and burden of the tax has not been changed.  It will be time enough to consider whether Schedule D payers should receive a tax remission or concession if and when somebody proposes that they pay instalments of tax in advance of actual calculation of their profit for a given period.  I do not want to talk too personally or offensively.  If my tone earlier was not civil I apologise, but Senator Yeats is doubtless aware that there are many countries, including many European countries, where what we would call Schedule D payers pay tax in advance. They pay it by instalments currently and they are not allowed a period of tax credit of 15 or 18 months, or anything like that.  If and when we arrive at that period a case could be made for giving such people a remission related to the remission given to people in the PAYE system who are going to have a very significant increase in their burden of taxation.  The actual increase was roughly between 23 per cent and 25 per <Col N="327" /> cent for the PAYE payers.  That is the additional effect of being drawn within the PAYE system compared with the old system.  That will not apply to people under the Schedule D system.</P>

      <P>The basis for the taxation of corporations has been shifted on to the corporation tax code. Is there any conceiveable effect on employment involved in the acceleration of payment by self-employed persons, except in the very limited number of cases where people were forced to remain in partnership and not enabled to incorporate?  The vast employer is always incorporated.  Is he affected?  Is there a parallel acceleration for payment in the case of corporations?  I did not think the employment argument was there from my own reading of the section, as amended.  Does the 18 per cent interest rate only arise in the case of fraud and negligence?</P>

      <P>The last remark reminds me of a certain Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance who, many years ago, made what to me was an immortal remark when there were complaints about employers deducting tax from employees in the days before PAYE.  He said: &ldquo;It is the duty of every taxpayer to have the money ready for the tax gatherer.&rdquo;  It is as unreal now as it was then.  In practice, one does not have the tax ready for the tax man.  One collects it at the last minute and hopes for the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald is correct in saying that large companies are not affected at all.  It is the small shopkeeper or traders who are affected by this.  I accept that the amount of unemployment would not be great.  The amount of distress and injustice involved in this measure will be great.  The Minister made the point that it is necessary to give this concession to the public service <Col N="328" /> because it was given in 1960.  The more he says it the more I feel that the concession given by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in 1960 has impelled him to do it now.  One feels that if it had not been for this concession in 1960 the public service would not have got away with it now.  They would have been told: &ldquo;It is too bad, we cannot afford to give a concession.&rdquo; I strongly suspected the Minister was going by precedent.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's concession to the public service, the total profit gained by the State this year under the changes in PAYE will be £8 million, taken from 225,000 people. The profits, on the other hand, in respect of the self-employed of whom there are 100,000&mdash;less than half the number of public servants&mdash;will be £10 million.  This would appear to mean that the amount of extra tax per head is very much greater in the case of the self-employed than in the case of the public service.  Therefore, if there were a case for making a concession in the public service there should be a much better case for making a concession in regard to the self-employed, particularly in view of the fact that the public service employees have safe jobs.  They have a certain salary which is indexed to the cost of living and which rises faster than the cost of living in some years.  The self-employed, on the other hand, do not have these advantages.  In present-day economic conditions one strongly suspects that many of the self-employed are not doing well at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks as if, year by year, along with the pattern of inflation, the incomes of the self-employed are rising accordingly.  The Minister has chosen a very bad time to make this change.  The likelihood is that a high proportion of the self-employed have had lower rather than larger incomes. Therefore, the point made by the Minister about paying in arrears at a time when salaries are rising year by year does not apply in many cases.  In many cases if incomes have risen at all they have done so very slowly.  In other cases incomes have fallen quite rapidly. The 100,000 self-employed are being asked to face this large impost of £10 million, that is, £100 on average per <Col N="329" /> head.  They are being asked to face it at a time when, because of economic conditions, many of them are doing very badly.  The Minister has chosen the worst possible time to do this.</P>
    <P>I should like to inquire about the relative liability of the self-employed and the public service, £10 million from 100,000 self-employed as against £8,225,000 from the public service.  The Minister stated that the tax payable by the public service this year was 25 per cent higher than in previous years.  That does not seem to fit in with what he told us yesterday when he said that:</P>
    <P>The effect of the change is to increase the gross 1976-77 tax liability of the groups affected by about £14 million&mdash;or some 23 per cent&mdash; over and above what it would be in 1976-1977 if the old basis of assessment on preceding-year's income had been allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>That is on the basis that the State makes £14 million but, in fact, £6 million of that has been remitted.  So the State only makes £8 million, which suggests that the increase is possibly nearer 13 per cent than 25 per cent.  I should like to know what the exact figure is, allowing for the concession the Minister has made.  I would be interested to know what percentage increase in tax payable under Schedule D the Minister hopes to achieve by this?</P>

      <P>The number of public service people who are being brought within the net is about 130,000.  Quite a number were, for a variety of reasons, within the net already.  The 130,000 involve a net figure of £8 million whereas there are about 80,000 Schedule D payers involving £10 million.  But the 130,000 will be paying the greater sums from the beginning of the year whereas the 80,000 will not pay any greater sums at all by way of net tax but they will have the period of credit shortened by three months.  They will pay their January, 1977 instalment or moiety of tax three months earlier than they otherwise would.  They will still enjoy 15 months' credit from the time they made the profit whereas others will be <Col N="330" /> paying the greater amounts from the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>These 100,000 people will have to pay £10 million extra this year, and I presume £10 million extra next year as well?  What is the Minister's profit from this in 1976 and 1977?</P>

      <P>It could rightly be said that there is no profit in it at all.  There is no additional income.

The Minister may convince himself that there is no hardship, that they are not being asked to pay more than they should pay, that the tax remains the same, but he will have difficulty in persuading the people concerned when, next October, to their amazement and astonishment, they find they have an unexpected half year's tax to pay.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This rather innocent-looking section is the one which reenacts for this year the so-called temporary surcharge of 10 per cent which was imposed last year on all rates of income tax except for the lowest one&mdash;that was from 35 per cent upwards. This was originally introduced last year as a temporary measure.  It was allied to the very temporary cut that was made last year of 4 per cent in the cost-of-living index due to the various subsidies on clothing, transport and so on that were introduced last year and which brought about the very temporary easement in the constant onset of inflation&mdash;a process which has been reversed in this recent budget that we have before us today.  In order to help pay for the subsidies that were introduced last year we had this temporary 10 per cent surcharge.  This is now enacted again in this Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>As the Minister himself admits&mdash;I am quoting from his Budget speech&mdash;we now have the second highest marginal rate of personal income tax in the EEC. It applies at a far lower point than any other member state.  The position is that in Ireland 50 per cent of total earnings become payable in income tax at an income of £13,000, whereas in the United Kingdom, which is looked upon as having a very high rate of taxation&mdash; almost as high as ours and in some cases perhaps even higher&mdash;50 per cent of total earnings are not swept up by the tax gatherers until the payer has an income of £16,000 as against £13,000 here.  In the Netherlands the figure is £25,000.  In Italy it is £100,000 and in France, no matter what your income is, you never reach the stage that 50 per cent is taken up in income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore we have very high rates of income tax.  No matter what way you assess them they remain very high.  At the lower levels they are higher than in the vast majority of other countries.  On top of this we have this 10 per cent surcharge which brings the top rate up to 77 per cent, which is a very severe imposition on those few people whose income is at that kind of level.  It is also a very severe imposition on a great many people whose income is a good deal less than that who have to pay at the very least 38.5 per cent at the marginal level instead of 35 per cent. The Minister will agree with me that, in the interests of encouraging people to increase their incomes, develop businesses and go in for enterprise, obviously if one is to encourage enterprise these levels of income tax are far too <Col N="333" /> high and ought to be reduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>What worries me and I think many other people is that a temporary surcharge can become like the original temporary income tax and remain year after year.  In view of the budgetary position of the next three years which faces us in face of the Minister's promise&mdash;or should I say threat?&mdash;to eliminate the £327 million current deficit over these three years, it is very difficult to envisage this temporary surcharge being removed this side of 1980.  Certainly one would like some indication from the Minister whether he could envisage removing this surcharge at any time in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that this surcharge is only temporary. The surcharge will automatically come to an end at the end of the tax year 1976-77.  The provision in the Bill simply extends it for another year.</P>
      <P>While at the upper rate of income our tax levels are higher than they are in some other countries, of immediate interest to most Irish people is the fact that in the income range up to £5,000 per annum, which of course covers the overwhelming mass of our people, the impact of income tax is less in the Republic of Ireland than in Britain, so that for comparable incomes people here will pay less tax in the income range up to £5,000 than across the water.  What the Exchequer can do by way of tax relief or by way of any revenue collection mechanisms will depend upon the demands made upon the Exchequer.  It can simply be said that the fewer demands that are made on the Exchequer, particularly in respect of current incomes and so on, the smaller will be the demand the Exchequer will have to make to remunerate whatever expenses the Exchequer is called upon to incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be said, and said accurately, that if the Minister for Finance and the Government refuse to increase expenditure taxes will not rise.  That is true, but it will be noted that day in and day out, on every day of the year except on budget day, the Minister for Finance in particular and the Government in general will be abused and accused and <Col N="334" /> attacked because they will not give ready consent to increases in expenditure. There was a number of such items in today's paper, for instance, where criticism has been levelled at Ministers for not giving immediate acquiescence to demands for additional expenditure. There have been parades, marches, protests and banner headlines in the last fortnight or three weeks because Ministers are resisting demands to increase expenditure.  This resistence to increase expenditure arises from two factors.  One of them is that the demands for additional expenditure were not justified, and secondly, even if they were, they could not be granted without further increasing the burden of taxes which the Government considers to be at a level which will not be further increased.</P>
    <P>We, as a community, are fighting with ourselves.  We are fighting because we complain about the level of taxation and we are fighting because we regard expenditure as being insufficient.  But until such time as we bring our resources and our expenditure expectations into line we will continue to be a very dissatisfied people.  I can only hope that the common objective of both Opposition and Government will help to bring about a greater contentment of our people so that their demands for Government expenditure will correspond with the revenue to contribute towards expenditure which such demands make necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in the least impressed by the Minister's first comments that this surcharge is temporary because it will die at the expiry of this section of the Finance Bill.  We all know that unless the Minister and the Government take a positive decision next year to remit whatever amount of taxation is involved in this&mdash;indeed I would be glad if he could give me an estimate as to how much this extra 10 per cent will bring in&mdash;it will appear automatically in next year's Finance Bill.  I do not think that that makes it any less permanent than it seems likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister rightly says that people spend a good part of their time urging him and the Government in general to spend more money.  That is a perfectly <Col N="335" /> normal and natural part of the democratic process.  Indeed, the Minister in his long period in Opposition&mdash;soon, one hopes, to be renewed&mdash;was extremely effective at that same occupation. But, after all, that is not the way Governments work.  The Minister knows that better than I do.  The Minister does not, in fact, increase expenditure in his budget on the basis of somebody who writes in a letter saying, &ldquo;Please, Mr. Minister, spend so many millions on such and such&rdquo;, or on the basis of a demonstration out on the street.  At least one would hope that this Government would deal with things the way other Governments do.  The Minister for Finance increases expenditure on the basis of demands made upon him by his fellow Ministers in the Government. They are the people who have their pet schemes they want to put through.  Indeed, one of our legitimate complaints on this Finance Bill and previous Finance Bills has been that the Minister has not sufficiently resisted, as a Minister for Finance is expected to do, many of the claims made upon him by his fellow Ministers.  It is they who are responsible.  Admittedly, it can reflect to some extent the wishes of public opinion on this; but one expects Ministers to do this, that is what they are for.  It is they who have pressed these claims upon him and it is the Minister who has accepted them, therefore, from his own colleagues.  But one accepts that a Minister for Finance ought, if he is to do his job properly, to resist claims which he feels are excessive in relation to the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, within this strait-jacket that any Minister ought to have&mdash;this Minister has unfortunately refrained from wearing it sufficiently often, with a result in the enormous expenditure we see contained in this Bill&mdash;he does, of course, have a certain choice as to the forms of taxation that he will bring in, or indeed the extent of expenditure he will allow.  The point I am making is that where you have a surcharge such as this which imposes a rate of taxation which is unduly high in relation to the resources of the country and which is calculated to weaken initiative, to reduce the possibility of enterprise, to <Col N="336" /> increase unemployment and generally to help to run down the economy of the country, then he should think on those lines and do his utmost at the earliest possible moment to eliminate this surcharge and bring down direct taxation rates in general.  One suspects that were he to do so the beneficial results in developing the economy might well mean that the net loss in revenue could be quite small.</P>
    <P>In making the comparison that I have made&mdash;and one could make many more with other countries&mdash;one has to bear in mind that our very high marginal rates of tax are, in general, imposed on much smaller incomes than exist in the other countries.  The Minister says that in certain respects the British tax system is even worse than ours.  I accept that, and of course one has to bear in mind that recent British Governments have tended to have socialistic, almost Marxist policies with regard to private enterprise.  There is a definite bias there which I would hope that the Irish Government would not share, but even in England&mdash;and the differences between us and England are not great in the degree of taxation&mdash;the income per head is around 50 per cent higher than here.  On the Continent average incomes are twice what they are here and in some cases even more, maybe three times more.  It is patently obvious that say 30 per cent of a small income is a much greater imposition on the person concerned than 30 per cent of an income two or three times as big.  The marginal rates of tax which we have are on average incomes far lower than elsewhere. To that extent therefore they are far more difficult to pay, far more burdensome on the individual and on the community and far more damaging to the whole concept of enterprise and initiative.  That is a problem.  I accept that any Minister must also face the fact that simply because our incomes are lower&mdash;and the kind of expenses which the State must meet are not necessarily correspondingly lower&mdash;it is more difficult to raise the money.  One has to accept that.  At the same time, this surcharge is peculiarly damaging in its effects on the community as a whole. The Minister should, therefore, consider abolishing it as soon as possible.  I would <Col N="337" /> like to hear from the Minister how much money it brings in.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 is the one dealing with personal reliefs.  The Minister has shown some degree of satisfaction at bringing in these so-called improvements in personal reliefs. Under this section we have the relief for a married man brought from £920 to £1,010.  If my calculations are right that is an increase of 10 per cent.  The increase for a single person is from £575 to £620, an increase of some 8 per cent. The increase for a widowed person goes from £635 to £685 which is, again, around 8 per cent.  Then the child allowance is up from £230 to £240 which is an increase of around 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>All these figures, including even the highest one of 10 per cent for the married man, are well below any reasonable estimate of the increase in living expenses, the rise in prices this year and the consequent fall in the value of money.  Therefore, by the end of the year, the income-tax payers so far as the personal reliefs are concerned will be worse off than they were a year ago.  So, the Minister has very little to boast about with regard to these.  There is a theoretical improvement in that the actual figure in pounds is improved but in practice, from the point of view of genuine benefit in real terms there is no advantage for the taxpayer.  It is likely that the average of around 8 per cent will, perhaps, be less than half the increase in the cost of living and the fall in the value of money this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average increase last year was around 15 per cent and the cost of living increase was something around 21 per cent.  So, while the taxpayer last year was again worse off as a result of these arrangements, he was not quite as much worse off as he is likely to be this year.  The 8 per cent improvement this year can be laid beside the 7.3 per cent increase in prices in the first three months ending February 15th with a <Col N="338" /> likelihood of another 5 per cent or so when the May 15th figure becomes available.  It may be 12 per cent in the first six months as against the average 8 per cent increase in allowances given. Quite clearly where the taxpayer allowance is concerned he is worse off compared with last year's budget because of the surcharge.</P>
    <P>One must set this matter against the very definite undertaking given by the Minister for Finance in 1974 when he said that as a definite statement of fact there would, from now on, be indexing of these allowances, that year by year they would be assessed on the basis of the increase in the cost of living and the fall in the value of money.  One appreciates that this was a dangerous undertaking to give but nonetheless it was given and, quite clearly, is not being carried out.  The Minister, apparently, has not found himself able to carry it out.  At any rate it has not been carried out and the taxpayer is steadily worse off as a result of this.</P>
    <P>The Minister only a short time ago said that Fianna Fáil had left the position as it was for so many years. Shortly before Fianna Fáil left office, in 1972, a very considerable improvement was given all around in these allowances.  The basic point was that the cost-of-living increase and rate of inflation at that time were so much less than now that the position of the taxpayer was correspondingly better off. I have absolutely no doubt that every taxpayer would vastly prefer to have been given no reliefs of this kind in this budget and would prefer to be facing price increases of 4, 5 or 6 per cent instead of the present likelihood of 18 to 20 per cent.  It is absolutely no use giving personal reliefs of this kind and boasting about them and saying: &ldquo;Am I not a good Minister for Finance to be able to give all this money away?&rdquo;  if, at the same time, inflation is allowed to run at a rate which means that in the heel of the hunt the taxpayer is a great deal worse off.  That is what is happening as a result of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question on this. Would it be possible at any stage in dealing with Finance Bills to break away from the particular form and <Col N="339" /> framework of this section?  Would it be possible to introduce a section regarding personal reliefs something on the lines of saying that personal reliefs for the year 1976-77 &ldquo;shall be as follows&rdquo;? Everybody would understand that then but when one reads this, and I quote from section 10;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a deduction falls to be made from the total income of an individual for the year 1976-77 or any subsequent year of assessment in respect of relief to which the individual is entitled under a provision mentioned in column (1) of the Table to this subsection and the amount of the deduction would, but for this section, be an amount specified in <i>column</i> (2) of the said Table, the amount of the deduction shall, in lieu of being the amount specified in the said <i>column</i> (2), be the amount specified in <i>column</i> (3) of the said Table opposite the mention of the amount in the said <i>column</i> (2).</P>
      <P>One does not know whether the Minister is taking one's life or giving relief. I think I know the reason for this because it is all referring back to the Income Tax Act, 1967.  At some stage this is a section which appears in every Finance Bill.  It might be well worth the Minister's while trying to simplify it by saying: &ldquo;Personal reliefs for the year 1976-77 shall be as follows&rdquo; and then list them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the point.  The parliamentary draftsman considers it necessary to express it in that way.  One might consider a more simple form such as saying that the Table in such a section be deleted and replaced by the following Table.  It seems a much simpler way.  There may be very good reasons from the draftsman's point of view why it should be put that way, but the introduction of <Col N="340" /> Tables in the Finance Bill is itself a great improvement because one can see at first sight what is meant.</P>
      <P>Let me also draw attention to another improvement in this year's Finance Bill which I sanctioned last year when it was introduced for the first time, and that is that in the &ldquo;contents&rdquo; section of the index to the Bill, the marginal notes, we explained the purpose of the section which is being amended.  For instance, take section 1 of this Bill which says: &ldquo;Amendment of section 128 (penalties) of Income Tax Act, 1967.&rdquo;  Hitherto, the word &ldquo;penalties&rdquo; would not have appeared nor would &ldquo;dependent relatives&rdquo; have appeared in the second one, or &ldquo;power to require production of accounts and books&rdquo;, and so on.  We would simply have referred to the original section of some other Act which was being amended without any guidance to persons reading the Bill as to what was in the original section which meant you would want to have a library to understand what the impact of the various sections was.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Yeats said, I should like to remind him that at no stage did I or the Government say that personal income tax allowances would be indexed.  I have always spoken against indexation.  I do not believe in indexation.  I believe indexation to rates of inflation is simply a way of perpetuating that which you want to get rid of.  It is like indexing your conduct to a bad habit.  It is unlikely that your conduct will improve, or that you will break your bad habit.  What we did say&mdash;and I quote from the budget speech of 3rd April, 1974&mdash;was:</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to a policy of reviewing the personal allowances at frequent intervals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have reviewed them each year and we have improved them each year.  It is a simple choice.  You grant certain reliefs and if you decide to grant more relief you have to replace it by revenue, and that revenue can only be obtained by an increase in the rates about which Senator Yeats understandably and correctly complained when he was discussing section 9.  I would prefer to be modest in the amount of improvement in the personal allowances rather than <Col N="341" /> further to increase the rates of tax.  It is a choice as to which you do.  I think we have taken the right choice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">

      <P>With regard to the Minister's promise to review income tax, I gained the impression at the time, foolishly I suppose, but I think a great many other people gained the same impression, that what the Minister had in mind was that, in reviewing the tax, the allowances would be modified year by year in accordance with increases in prices.  That was the impression conveyed. Reviewing in itself obviously means nothing.  Any Minister for Finance reviews every aspect of budgetary operations in each year, including allowances.  A promise to review, as such, would be utterly meaningless unless it went further.  All these matters are reviewed as a matter of course at least once a year.  A definite promise to review could only mean, if it meant anything, that at least some reasonable effort would be made to bring these allowances up to the rate of inflation. This year that has not been done and the seepage will be very considerable and the real value of these allowances will fall very considerably during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator O'Higgins about the phraseology, I must confess I turned to the table first, and it was only when he started to read the section that I read it myself.  I had paid no attention to it until then.  There is something rather curious about Finance Bills.  It is almost as if there was a different parliamentary draftsman responsible&mdash;maybe there is &mdash;because it always seems to me that the style or the method of writing a Finance Bill is quite different from that of any other legislation.  The whole phraseology is different.  It is more complicated and esoteric.  Indeed, this Bill, section after section, to the ordinary intelligent reader is simply meaningless.  I do not know why these Bills are written in such a way.  I agree with Senator O'Higgins that, in a relatively simple operation such as is performed by section 10, it ought to be possible to draft it, if not in plain English, in some faint approximation to it.  One wonders why it is necessary <Col N="342" /> to have nine complicated lines to do this very simple operation.</P>

      <P>I have a small query on this.  I am puzzled about the relationship between this section and section 4. As the Minister said, on section 4, if a separate assessment has been asked for, for a man and wife, they do not have to ask every year.  It carries on from year to year until they stop the process. I am not quite clear what this section does that the other section does not do or, alternatively, what new law is made by this section?</P>

      <P>As the law stands, under section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, the wife's income is deemed to be the income of the husband and it is he who is required under section 169 to make the return of the income. One result of this is that we have had cases where husbands having no income themselves have been required to make a return of the income of the wife.  A not uncommon experience nowadays is for a married woman to be working and having an income, while her husband is pursuing studies and not having an income.  Even in such cases, the law as it stands would require the husband to make a return of the income and prevent the wife making the return although she was in receipt of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides for the furnishing of a separate return of income by a married woman in respect of her own income.  The provision has been made in response to requests by married women who wish to make returns of their own income rather than being required to have that income included in their husband's return.  The opportunity is also being taken of correcting a drafting flaw in the relevant section.  There is a reference to &ldquo;period&rdquo; in two places in the section which, in one place, means the period within which the return is to be made and, in the other, means the period for which the profits or gains <Col N="343" /> are to be returned.  This will now enable the wife to make her own separate return of income.  If the wife fails to do it, the husband may, nonetheless, be required to do it in the future, but if the wife makes her own return the husband will not be required to make a return of her income.</P>

      <P>I am happy to hear it.  As the Minister may remember, I raised piteous complaints on the Wealth Tax Bill when it was going through the House.  As far as I remember, the position with the welath tax was that where, for example, the husband had no wealth and the wife had, the wife could fill up the forms but, nonetheless, the husband was still primarily liable for paying the tax.  I thought and still think this is outrageous.  I am happy that at last these kinds of complaints are getting through in certain circles and that, at least in regard to income tax, this rather lunatic proceeding has been stopped.  Perhaps the next time the Minister is amending the Wealth Tax Act he will think of doing the same there.</P>

Were it not for the information given in the memorandum accompanying the text of the Bill as to what was meant, it would be incomprehensible. Without pursuing the matter any further, the provisions do not seem to take in all the subsections or subparagraphs. Why have we not a table to this one which would enable us to understand it?</P>

      <P>I feel complimented to know that Senator Alexis FitzGerald asked precisely the same question as I asked when I saw the original draft even before the Government saw it.  We had consultations, as a result, with the parliamentary draftsman, who of course is the expert who puts these brilliant thoughts into the form in which it ultimately reaches the Government and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of tables is in itself a fairly novel development and a very welcome one.  The approach generally is that where mere amendments, rather than substantially new sections, are being made, tables are not resorted to. Sometimes when the amendments are rather comprehensive, or of a consolidating nature, a table is produced. What we are doing in this section, as I know Senator Alexis FitzGerald understands <Col N="345" /> if nobody else does, is giving relief for unincorporated bodies in respect of increase in stock values. What we are doing is fulfilling an undertaking given in January of last year which arose out of the difficulty in giving this relief to unincorporated traders in the financial year 1975-76.  I said we would do it in this year's Finance Bill and carry the benefit back to last year.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that this section is operating to relieve people.  It will provide ordinary traders who were not incorporated with relief of about £3 million; and, for companies who have enjoyed relief to date of about £24 million, it will give them relief of about another £10 million, making the total relief now in respect of stock £37 million.</P>

When you get to section 31 of the Finance Act, 1975, you are driven back to section 62 of the 1967 Act which was introduced from the old income tax code.  Is the definition of &ldquo;trading stock&rdquo; such as to include rights in action?  It means property of any description whether real or personal in the original.  Are we entitled to relief for debts, or work in progress? What is the purpose of &ldquo;trader&rdquo; as distinct from the professional man who is rendering services?  It is defined in section 62 as property of any kind real or personal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the principle of what is intended here. I should just like to renew a protest I have made on many occasions.  It is an assumption of the Revenue authorities that the only purpose of discretionary trusts is taxation avoidances by rich people.  The Minister in his opening statement used the word &ldquo;rich&rdquo; person. I can tell the Revenue Commissioners&mdash; and they ought to know&mdash;that there are discretionary trusts in existence created by people who are not rich, and can live a long life without becoming rich.  They are trying in some way to provide for somebody who is handicapped in some fashion, to make some provision for them which will at the end of the day come in relief of the taxpayers who might otherwise be required to provide the less than adequate kind of attention the loving parent or person involved might be concerned to give.  The beneficiary may be handicapped by the kind of problem we are all aware of, a tendency to spend his money rather more than he knows he should if he had proper regard for his own needs through a period of time.  Discretionary trusts did not come into existence&mdash;and this is something I will repeat until everyone is bored to death&mdash;to defeat taxation.  The discretionary trust arose as the normal provision in a marriage settlement where it was given to the wife, in one case, and the husband in the other, with the right to appoint, at her or his complete discretion, among the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One child may be all right about money.  Another may not.  The entire fund may have to be given to one child. It may be that during the lifetime of that trust it is proper and wise and sensible and prudent to maintain it intact and make no distribution.  There may be no power to make a distribution except to the beneficiary who should not receive it.  Many of these trusts are in existence and were created long ago.  The powers of appointment have to be strictly exercised only in favour of the beneficiaries, unless you have somebody prepared to condone a breach of trust to give it to somebody <Col N="347" /> else.  You may have the fellow on the bottle and the one thing you do not want to do is give him his full entitlement, but to retain it for his wife and children.  If you gave it to his children that might be the very worst thing to do. Maybe his wife is on the bottle, too, which is a frequent situation.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have another look at the idea of treating discretionary trusts as if they were simple devices for tax avoidance.  They certainly were widely used as such, of that there is no doubt.  Here I agree with the Minister.  As there is in the wealth tax, provision for a different treatment for wealth tax purposes of a particular type of discretionary trust, I suggest to the Minister that he might, at some future date, consider giving at least the like treatment the wealth tax gives in relation to discretionary trusts to surcharges to be made under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amount of sympathy for what Senator FitzGerald has said.  Whether he is historically correct I do not know, but I accept he is when he says discretionary trusts were first established for very good humanitarian and social reasons so that property could be managed in a prudent way and to prevent improvidence.  The truth is that discretionary trusts have been used in ways which have made tax avoidance very easy.  We would like to find some simple solution which would enable the genuine discretionary trust which is set up for good social and humanitarian reasons to operate.  Our difficulty is to find an instrument to enable that to happen and, at the same time, stop tax avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is linked with the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, in particular sections 101 and 162 which have been matters of debate here and elsewhere in relation to which I have given certain undertakings.  I am open to receive people's views on these sections this year&mdash;I am talking about the Corporation Tax Act&mdash;and to consider whether amendments should be made in the Corporation Tax Act provisions in next year's Finance Bill.  Perhaps when we are looking at that we can also look at the possibility of adjustment <Col N="348" /> in the discretionary trust field. But, while we have sections 101 and 162 in being, it is essential that we close the very obvious avenue of escape from the restrictions of those sections by controlling discretionary trusts for the time being.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point.  I suggest in relation to the wealth tax that obviously you cannot have a rich chap creating 70 different discretionary trusts.  In any case where it could be shown that somebody's threshold was not being used up in the wealth tax, it could be left over to be used up according to his option. Something similar could be done with discretionary trusts if somebody was in a position to exercise an option and say: &ldquo;Treat this as my income&rdquo;.  There could be a situation where somebody was only at the 35 per cent rate and there was a 55 per cent rate arising under a discretionary trust.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that I was a member of an <i>ad hoc</i> group representing people in the public services generally negotiating with him on the introduction of PAYE in the public service.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister.  He met us very sympathetically and promised to consider all cases presented to him.  There was total opposition by those affected by it to the idea of the introduction of the principle of PAYE in the public services.  Following a series of meetings, it was decided to accept the idea in <Col N="349" /> principle, provided that the remission given to people in the 1959-60 period was also given to those affected.  The Minister promised this remission would be given and, in consideration of the budgetary situation, the public service group suggested that the idea of spreading the remission over a three-year period would be acceptable to them.</P>
      <P>Since then, there has been considerable disquiet among members of the <i>ad hoc</i> group because of the restrictive nature of section 16.  It is felt that people in certain circumstances, maybe following a bereavement, may not receive the full remission over the three-year period.  It could happen that the person concerned, the widow, would receive only one or two portions of the remission, but that she would not receive the three portions.</P>
      <P>Section 5, in the opinion of those involved in the negotiations, seemed to have discriminatory implications with particular reference to dependants in receipt of pensions on which tax is not payable, teachers whose widows would not be in receipt of pensions, single persons who may have dependants, and dependants of civil servants who did not join the voluntary widows and orphans scheme in 1969.  There is a feeling among those involved in the negotiations on the introduction of PAYE in the public service, that there may be discrimination against them in certain sections, in particular, subsection (2) and subsection (5) of section 16 of the Bill.  We would like a comment from the Minister on this matter.</P>

It has come to my notice in the past&mdash;that is why I am in agreement with PAYE being applied right across the Board&mdash;that very often when people retired they were allotted a lump sum but found that from that lump sum the previous year's income tax was deducted.  It will be more acceptable and beneficial to a person facing retirement to be able to get his full lump sum knowing that he does not <Col N="350" /> owe money to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Senator Brosnahan raises a number of points about which he knows I have received correspondance. We are looking at the particular areas of difficulty which have been identified.  I have already given an undertaking that, if any particular area of hardship arose in the transitional period, we would consider what steps should be taken to relieve those hardships. It is a very difficult matter to debate in public.  Each case can generate a different set of problems, or require separate remedies because the time of payment, the service or action in respect of which the payment is made and so on, can vary.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that the points that have been raised by himself and his colleagues are receiving our earnest consideration and I hope we will be able to find solutions to them.  We have already had to find solutions to some other particular problems which were not apparent when we considered the changes in the first instance.  I agree with Senator Dolan that once we overcome the difficulties of transition everyone will be glad to have the system operating smoothly and be saved a lot of the anxieties and vexations which were attendant on the old system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the provisions of the section I should make it clear that, leaving aside special interests which may be involved, on the general principle we on this side of the House are in favour of PAYE being introduced into the public service.  We are in agreement with the arrangements made with regard to easing the introduction of this new system in order that an undue amount of extra tax will not fall on any individual.  I would not like it to be thought that we feel in any way that there should not be PAYE in the public sector, or alternatively, that they should not have been given the benefit of this arrangement that was come to between the Minister and the public service unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one has to highlight again the <Col N="351" /> great difference between the arrangements made by the Minister in respect of the introduction of PAYE under this section and the complete lack of arrangement with regard to the self-employed under section 9.  The remarks of Senator Brosnahan justifies completely the point I made on section 9. The two basic reasons the Minister agreed to this remission or easement of the transition into PAYE, were, first, that public service unions were able to point to a precedent in 1960, and we all know that public servants are very strong on precedents.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there were strong and active unions involved representing the taxpayers concerned.  The problem with the self-employed is that, although there are 100,000 of them, they have no strong organisation to fight their case. We know from what the Minister has said that the initial increase in tax payable this year in respect of the public servants would be around 23 per cent. As a result of the concession given by the Minister that it is to be reduced to somewhere around 12 or 13 per cent, which is considerable but manageable. Under section 9, the self-employed, all 100,000 of them, are asked to pay in effect 50 per cent more tax this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in respect of each particular income tax year involved there will be no extra tax payable, but the fact remains that in this calender year&mdash;it is calendar years that ordinary people live in and not tax years&mdash;all the self-employed will be asked in effect to pay 50 per cent extra in tax in relation to the income they will actually receive this year.  Therefore there is a very substantial difference in the Minister's attitude in that respect and his attitude in respect of public servants.  It makes one realise yet again, as one so often does, that while sometimes people may criticise trade unions they definitely have their uses in protecting the interests of their members.  In this case they have been successful, and rightly so, in persuading the Minister to ease the harshness which otherwise would have existed in the introduction of PAYE.  Therefore, while they will have to pay more tax, the burden is eased to some extent.</P>

They can certainly articulate their requirements.  This position is not as Senator Yeats has said.  I do not wish to repeat what I said on the earlier section, where I pointed out that the burden of tax on Schedule D groups would not be increased when the burden of tax on others was being increased. All that is happening is that the Schedule D people will be asked to pay in a period of nine months and one day the amount of tax usually paid in a period of 12 months and one day which is not quite the same as saying they are paying 50 per cent more tax in the year.</P>

      <P>What is the case that is contemplated?  Is there somebody here who has a job and does not get paid and by not getting paid avoids his employer the obligation to deduct tax from him?  He just leaves the money with the employer.  It is a very strange case.  Of course he could be employing himself in a company form, but is it tax avoidance we are after here? The Minister refers to the Income Tax Acts, and looking at one of them I see that interest, is payable at 18 per cent. Does that mean that you have a marvellous calculation on a day-to-day basis of liability for PAYE which carried 18 per cent?  I know the last subsection avoids all this if you pay within six months, but where you do not is the interest liability running from day-to-day, too, at 18 per cent?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to combat an avoidance device which, I am sorry to say, is becoming increasingly adopted whereby payment of tax on remuneration, particularly that of directors of close companies, may be deferred for lengthy periods without disadvantage to the <Col N="353" /> taxpayer but with serious disadvantage to Revenue both because of deferment of payment of tax and immunity from interest on non-paid tax.  Under existing PAYE legislation tax is deductible on payment of any remuneration including directors' fees.  Where an employer fails to pay over to the Revenue the tax deductible from remuneration there is a liability to interest charged.  These provisions are now being circumvented in the case of private companies. Amounts which purport to be remuneration are shown as expenses in the accounts of the business and are allowed as a deduction in computing the company's tax liabilities.  It is only when the remuneration is actually voted, which may be a considerable time afterwards, that tax is deductible and liable to be remitted under the PAYE legislation.  In the meantime the directors have been able to enjoy the use of the money which will have been withdrawn in one guise or another without generating any liability to tax or interest.  In the provisions of the section aimed at securing the amounts which are shown in accounts as remuneration the amounts would be deemed to have been paid at a relevant date so that PAYE legislation would apply as if the remuneration had been paid at that time.</P>

      <P>I have a few comments to make regarding the taxation of farming profits.  By now it is accepted that farmers will have to pay tax.  If a big farmer has an enormous amount of land and has workmen who are paying their share of income tax, it is hard to argue against his paying his fair share, too.  But there are a few matters that may be annoying to farmers.  One is the question of rates.  Farmers consider that they are taxed on the double in that they are taxed on the profits of their farms and, at the same time, have to pay rates which are increasing every year.  It is a well-known fact that there are not any rates on agricultural land in the Six Counties.  We are all in the <Col N="354" /> Common Market now and the farmers are more or less in the front-line trenches so far as the expansion of the economy is concerned; because if they are able to increase production, the economy expands.</P>
      <P>Very often the type of encouragement they get from the top is of a dual nature.  For instance, I have recently seen where the Agriculture Commissioner in the EEC has told people to cut back on milk powder and milk production of all kinds and our own Minister has told us to go full steam ahead.  So the farmer must always find himself in a quandry as to what would be the best course for him in the interests of himself and his family.  The Government should be interested&mdash;as I think they are&mdash;in seeing what would be the best policy, not alone for the farmers but for the nation as a whole. We realise that a huge number of people in this country are indirectly in employment, in factories, in offices, and so on by virtue of our agricultural industry.  Agricultural occupations are a hazard.  It has not been ironed out in what way farmers, especially small farmers&mdash;and almost 80 per cent of the farmers in this country would fit into that category&mdash;are going to develop. There have been various comments on the Mansholt Plan and about dividing farmers into categories from transitional to development to commercial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time since we have entered the EEC a great deal of progress has not been made in that field.  The Minister and his colleagues and the EEC should, before there is any intensification or any extension of this taxation code on farmers, try and ensure that as far as possible small farmers as well as transitional, commercial, and development farmers would have an idea of what grants they are entitled to.  I have noticed in my own area that unless people are able to keep about 25 sows, for instance, they will not get a grant. That is a very wrong way to start off because an enormous amount of capital is involved.  There is probably not anything allowed for ploughing profits back into the development of an industry but if there is not a certain amount of money is allowed for depreciation. I do not know what the <Col N="355" /> Minister allows for depreciation of the very expensive machinery that is now needed on modern farms.  We should be encouraging our present-day farmers to try to modernise to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>There may be a few farmers who have got a bad name&mdash;for instance, farmers who frequently go to races&mdash;although they are as entitled as anybody else to enjoy themselves.  But I am talking about farmers with very big farms who may not create a lot of employment or are the owners of underproductive farms.  We should be aiming at trying to get the maximum production from our farms.  Therefore, the Minister should encourage the farmer in every way and not load him down with taxation.</P>
    <P>I know that the notional method of assessment is being employed here.  This is a good thing because farmers have not been used to keeping accounts.  They are being given the option now.  There may be a deadline announced as to when they should have submitted their application to get exemption or remission from income tax.  Even farmers who are under the £100 valuation could be caught.  Rather than aggravate these farmers it should be somebody's duty to let them know that if they have other jobs, in a local factory perhaps, they are liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to sponsor the idea that the sons of small farmers would if at all possible find employment in their adjacent town rather than emigrate to foreign countries.  We have been trying to develop a system which would create employment locally so that the farmer's son could build a house on his father's farm, live in the locality and not be rushing up to the cities.  There is a very wide field here for development.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government will have to go very slowly in this matter of imposing tax on farms.  Very often there is not sufficient credit given to the good farmer in an area who is a tremendous example to his neighbours and who can give better advice than the farmers' journals or any Minister.</P>
    <P>If a farmer is using modern methods, has gone to the expense of providing forage harvesters, rotary mowers and <Col N="356" /> so on and if he is willing to help his neighbour, there should be some concessions for him.  These people are doing excellent work.  They are providing the raw material.  They are encouraging people to keep extra animals on the land, which will eventually mean extra jobs in the meat factories, extra milk at the creamery and extra milk in the milk powder factories and the food processing industries.  In that way we would be building up a greater rural population and helping the economy immensely.  Unfortunately, some farmers are frustrated at present.  They do not know into which of the three categories they can go.  They find that on top of the taxation being imposed on them that there is a section later on in this Bill to impose tax on co-ops.  It is the local co-op that has been supplying the small farmer.</P>

      <P>Let us not fool ourselves.  Those with incomes have to pay tax on them if they are to get the services they are demanding, and that includes the farmers as well as city people.  Let us face facts.</P>
      <P>I think this notional basis was recommended by the committee that reported on taxation.  We all know that the actual valuation of land was carried out as a result of the Griffith Valuation of 1854. It has had the most curious results in modern circumstances.  As a permanent basis for taxation it must lead to great injustices in leaving some people free and others not free.  That is a general comment.  The Minister can obviously do nothing about that until a fuller evaluation of the land of Ireland is made, if that can be tolerated by anybody. The basis of taxation will be changed before that is changed.</P>

      <Col N="357" /> I do not understand what subsection (2) is saying.  I thought, when I first read the amended subsection (4), that it meant that you could only wipe out your liability if the deductions that are limited to you to make scored up to the £40 valuation and that the purpose of it was not to create an artificial loss.  Then I find that there is an ability to elect for relief under sections, all of which provide for the provision of losses and the carrying forward of losses.  I should like to know what meaning this has.  Subsection (4) limits the deductions to 40 times the rateable valuation, but subsection (4) (a) goes on to say that, having done that, you are entitled to opt for relief under sections which when you refer to them you find all provide for losses and so on.</P>

      <P>It might be inappropriate for me to go into great detail on the several observations of Senator Dolan for the very good reason that the National Economic and Social Council, in response to requests of the farming associations and the consent of the Government, investigated the question of the taxation of farming profits and produced a report on the night before I presented my budget.  I said that the report would be examined by all the Departments concerned.  This examination is proceeding at present.  I am shortly to have a meeting with the farming organisations to discuss their views.  It will be recalled that the Council produced a minority report disagreeing with everybody else in relation to what the report recommended. I suppose we will not find entire agreement on what the ultimate solution should be.  The interesting thing is that there is now agreement within the farming community that farm profits must bear their fair share of tax.  The trouble is that we all have a different view as to what the fair share of tax to be paid should be.  The notional basis was recommended for continuation for a period of four years after any group of farmers were brought in to tax.  Extending it for another year complies with that suggestion and it meets with everybody's approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are limiting the deduction which can be made for the reason that the claim has been made recently that <Col N="358" /> persons adopting the notional system may make the deductions that are appropriate&mdash;that is, rates and wages and payments on agricultural machinery &mdash;and that if those deductions exceed 40 per cent of the rateable valuation, they may treat that as a loss to be carried forward against profits which might be generated in a further year.  Of course, that was never intended and that would be a nonsense of a concession which was provided as an ease for farmers in relation to farming profits. I think there can be no serious disagreement about imposing that limitation. In case there is any question of an allegation of retrospection, we are providing that this prohibition will apply only to any claims of this nature which are made subsequent to the 13th March, 1976, which was the date on which the Bill was released for circulation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One matter on section 21: this is designed to deal with the question of subcontractors in the building industry.  I appreciate that what the Minister is trying to do here between sections 20 and 21 is to bring some form of rationality into tax collection in this area.  As a transitory measure he provides in section 20 that 35 per cent of the payments from principals to subcontractors be retained until a certificate clearing the tax situation emerges from the subcontractor. In section 21, which will operate, I think, from December, he has the further provision designed to tighten the collection situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I would like to say to the Minister here&mdash;and professional people have come to me on this matter&mdash;is that it is a very confused area in which to advise clients.  That is putting it mildly. I know that there was a &ldquo;lumper&rdquo; abuse which in 1970 we tried to beat.  But the new section 21, as it is now drafted, which comes to seven pages, is certainly <Col N="359" /> the most complex, involved and difficult section in the whole Bill.  A large part of it is already contained in the 1970 Act. I do not intend to go into any analysis of it.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of representations from accountants and also builders and subcontractors operating under the scheme who are quite willing to participate in paying their taxes and so on. There is no question of tax evasion but where both the speed in dealing with the matter of their tax situation in the sub-contractor/contractor relationship and the complexity of the tax laws and regulations as they now apply are rather too much, it would be very useful if, in some simplified form, precisely what is involved here in this area was made available from the Revenue Commissioners to the building industry.</P>
    <P>There should be some way of reducing the complex of six pages of subsections that we have here in section 21 to a formula where the principal contractor or the sub-contractor can see their rights and where an accountant can give fairly basic advice to such people.  What is happening at the moment is that there are considerable delays in dealing with this and small contractors and sub-contractors in particular can be prejudiced by delays, certificates can be withheld and they are not in a position to proceed by reason of certification being withheld from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would enlighten the House about this general area.  I appreciate what he is trying to do in an area of very substantial evasion.  But, in order to get work going in a certain section of industry, he should not clog that section with undue paper work but should expedite matters on their behalf and have made available to them some A, B, C, D, E primer as to how they should operate so that their tax problems can be dealt with expeditiously and by quick clearance of certificates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator Lenihan has said.  I want to assure him that we have anticipated this and we intend to issue a booklet which will help both contractors and sub-contractors in the operation of the new <Col N="360" /> system.  It seems intimidating when one reads the six pages but I think most of them are too busy to read them and they will be relying on others to guide them.  The system will be comparatively simple.  A contractor will apply for a card to the Revenue Commissioners and in turn will get an authorisation from the Revenue Commissioners saying whether the payment may be made free of tax or otherwise.  The sub-contractor will also have to apply to the Revenue Commissioners and these applications will relate to individual jobs, which is very distinct from being on a yearly basis which has been operated in the past.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners intend to have a section which will work with speed so that the necessary authorities will be issued by return of post.  Even the best organised operations are liable to have delays from time to time.  Even if delays do occur a sub-contractor will receive 65 per cent of payments due to him on the due date.  He will not be entirely deprived of his money but I would not wish, nor does anybody wish, that he be deprived of 35 per cent of it if the income began at the appointed time.  We intend the system to work very smoothly.  It is unfortunate that we have to bring it in at all because it is a bit of an irritant to the smooth working of business.  However, the amount of avoidance under the lumping system is something that we could not, in terms of the general body of taxpayers, tolerate any longer.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately a great deal of the malpractices in this field have been imported from experiences that some of our kith and kin have seen abroad. Rather than allow this cancer to spread any further we considered it necessary at this stage to bring in these corrective systems.  If they need to be adjusted we will do all we can to improve them, but I would say that people will find the system working fairly smoothly.  We have deliberately postponed the introduction of the new system until the 6th of December next so as to allow us time to advise people as to what their rights and obligations are.  Therefore we hope it will be possible to have the new system in operation smoothly by the commencement of the next financial year.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for what the Minister has said because, whatever our kith and kin in the construction industry may have done by way of tax evasion in the United Kingdom in the past, these are in many cases the sort of people we want to encourage in the present economic situation.  Many of them are people who want to get up and go&mdash;give employment, do business and get building projects going.  While I appreciate fully the Revenue have qualms in this matter, it is particularly and peculiarly an area where there should be no deterrent aspect in regard to the Revenue Commissioners' administration. I am glad the Minister said what he has said because I think this section within the Revenue Commissioners should be fully staffed and full information made available to ensure that there is immediate clearance given.  It is an area where rapid changes, rapid decisions, have to be made and, provided the contractor and sub-contractors involved know the score, and there is no delay in issuing authorisation or certification in regard to the tax position between them, it is terribly important in this industry and particularly in the present economic climate.  I am sure the Minister fully appreciates this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which assesses the value of company cars at £300.  In other words, where a taxpayer has the use of a car provided by his employer, in future, the value in terms of taxable income will be looked upon as at least £300 or 15 per cent of the cost of the vehicle in certain cases.  But there is a basic minimum of £300.  The position is, therefore, as far as the taxpayer is concerned, that he cannot claim it is worth less than £300 although, in many cases, it may be.  On the other hand, of course, if the Revenue Commissioners can claim that it is worth more than that sum they are entitled to raise this figure.  As usual, they have <Col N="362" /> it both ways&mdash;they can increase the figure of £300 but he cannot decrease it.</P>
      <P>In some cases, obviously, £300 will be a reasonable figure for the value to a taxpayer of the private use he has of the car of his employer.  In other cases one feels that it is not.  If one considers the case of a commercial traveller who would be travelling around the country from Monday to Friday and might not even come home until Saturday, effectively the only use the car will be would be to bring his family to Mass.  In such a case it seems unreasonable that he should be assessed at the high figure of £300 as being the value of the use of the car.  One wonders why the Minister should bring in this.  One can see that always, in every Finance Bill, there are numerous sections which are simply designed to deal with ingenious practices of evasion which have been thought up by people.  In this particular case the only purpose would appear to be to avoid the Revenue Commissioners having to write letters.  It does not seem that any great amount of money will be gained by it.  Some taxpayers may gain, more are likely to lose.  When taxpayers are gaining the Revenue Commissioners are likely to find out soon and to increase the figure of £300 to some more realistic level.  It certainly seems that a set number of taxpayers, particularly fulltime commercial travellers, may well find themselves with a notional increase in their income for tax purposes of £300 and the use of the car, in terms of real value, comes nowhere near that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law stands, an employee's private use of a car supplied by an employer is chargeable to tax under the Income Tax Act, 1967, section 117, so we are not introducing a new principle.  All we are doing is providing a minimum figure because of the immense difficulties that have arisen in relation to the application of the existing position.  When the total cost and value of a car is taken, its capital cost, running cost, cost of insurance, taxation, repair and maintenance, the figure is very high indeed.  The Automobile Association and other organisations interested in providing information for motorists show that the average cost of even the smallest car runs to, I think, about four to five times the <Col N="363" /> minimum figure which is mentioned in this section.  In most cases the cars provided by employers for their employees are not cars of the smallest and cheapest kind.  They tend to be in the middle range of cars and some, of course, are of a very much higher value. An immense amount of the taxpayers' time and the time of the Revenue staff is wasted on arguing every year about the value to be attached to the private use of a car.  When it is considered that most people in this category will have the private use of the car for at least two days out of seven days of the week &mdash;and that is not making any provision for possible use in the eveningtime or its use going to and from work, which itself is not an item upon which taxpayers may receive tax remission&mdash;it will be seen that the figure of £300 is indeed very small.</P>
      <P>The contrast which must be made is the contrast between a person who has a car supplied by an employer and that of the majority who have not a car supplied by an employer and have to meet the total cost of ownership in operation out of after-tax income.  Such people are clearly disadvantaged against those who have the use of the car for private use because their employers are carrying the cost of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, Senator Daly made a suggestion that any payment made by an employee in respect of private use of a company car should be deducted from the minimum benefit in kind of £300. There is a very practical difficulty there, so great, indeed, that were this suggestion to be acceded to the provision in the Bill would become worthless because an arrangement could easily be made whereby a payment of £300 would be made by an employee to an employer in respect of private use of a car in return for which, in a manner which could not be detected by the Revenue Commissioners, certain benefits could be obtained in relation to the private use of the car such as, for instance, free petrol and so forth.  If it were possible to provide a foolproof system which would ensure that there would be no abuse of the suggestion by Senator Daly then, perhaps, the matter could be entertained.  But it seems to me&mdash;and I <Col N="364" /> have a very innocent mind compared with that of others who might be inclined to adjust any concession to their own advantage&mdash;that the opportunities for avoidance, if we were to allow that, are so great as to render probable the uselessness of the provision which we are trying to make here.  On reflection, if people count the real cost of operating a car they will see that the minimum of £300, or 15 per cent, in relation to private use is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that since our budget, in the April budget in Britain and in their recently published Finance Bill, there are provisions which in respect of many cars put the benefit-in-kind figure at a much higher level than ours.  They have brought in a most complicated system related to the power of some cars and where that cannot be easily ascertained then the original purchase price of the cars.  It is better to have the comparatively simple system which we have here and which, on balance, is not unfair.</P>
    <P>There is a general tendency for us all to overlook the cost of running our cars.  Just in case people feel jealous of Ministers who may have cars assigned to them, I assure them that I, too, know all about the cost of running a family car, because I have one.  Once one purchases a car one quickly forgets about the cost of depreciation which is a continuing factor.  We forget about the cost of maintenance because we probably do not maintain them as well as we should, we forget about the cost of repair because we feel that accidents are things that only happen to other people and if we have one the insurance will pay up.  Except for the moment of displeasure we have when we are paying our motor tax and our insurance premium, we forget about them as well. These are quite sizeable amounts, so the limitation of the benefit-in-kind to £300 for the private use of the car which will be available to the person for a large amount of time any week is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I would suggest another measurement for anyone who wants to try it.  What would be the cost of hiring a car for a weekend?  If a person did not have a free car from an employer, even to go <Col N="365" /> to church, if one did not take it to golf or shopping or anything else, one would not get far in a car these days, even the smallest car, hiring it for £6 per week. That is another way of looking at whether the £300 minimum charge is a fair one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Minister about the cost of running a family car, although he was perhaps a little ingenuous in quoting the rather high figures which the motoring bodies tend to give for the cost of running&mdash; maybe they are accurate or maybe they are special pleading.  One thing we can be certain of is that figures of this kind would not be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners were they allowing an employer, say, the expenses against his income of running a company car&mdash;I do not think the Commissioners would accept so high a figure.  Nonetheless, we must accept that they are high.  While it is not reasonable to talk in terms of an ordinary family man hiring a car to go to church or to bring his family up the mountains&mdash;I do not think many people do that&mdash;it is expensive running a car. I have already said that with regard to the majority of taxpayers who are affected by this section, £300 may be a fair figure.</P>
      <P>I would feel much happier about this section if it contained some provision allowing the taxpayer to prove, if he can, that his use of the car is so small for private use that he should not be assessed at £300.  The trouble is that £300 is the minimum.  If he is a commercial traveller who staggers home on a Saturday and so fed up with driving all week that beyond going to Mass with the family in the car, he does not use it, in such a case it seems unreasonable to add a notional £300 to his income.  I would be happier with the section if there was a provision that if a taxpayer could prove that he did not use the car at all or barely used the car and that therefore the figure ought to be something less, he would be charged a lesser figure.  The section as it stands is completely inflexible&mdash;£300 or nothing&mdash; which in certain cases may be an injustice.</P>

      <P>This is a very straightforward section relating to the payments which we authorise the Minister for Labour to make under the Employment Premium Act, 1975, to employers in respect of additional employees taken on by the firm after June, 1975.  While I agree that such a premium should be disregarded for the purpose of the Tax Acts, it is only in accordance with the spirit not the letter of the actual legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a point of information, a number of my colleagues and I were of the opinion during the passing of the Employment Premium Bill that the scheme would not be anything as effective in its operation as the Minister for Labour thought it would be last June.  The burden of his theory&mdash;any theory is excellent in its own way&mdash;was that it would produce 10,000 new jobs between June, 1975, and June, 1976.  To what extent has the jobs target envisaged by the Minister in introducing the Bill been achieved?  We have not heard anything from the Minister for Labour on this aspect and it is very important. I do not agree that that is the proper way to create further employment; it is not as effective a method as the Minister has at his disposal under the instrument we are discussing, the Finance Bill.  I strongly hold that tax reliefs and incentives geared to employment&mdash; across-the-board, at all levels of industry, retained profits for investment, management involved in productivity arrangements&mdash;are the area in which we should be involved in order to provide a stimulus for the creation of employment.  I am not knocking the employment premium scheme, but the Minister has in this instrument a far more effective way to stimulate the economy rather than the premium system.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the effectiveness <Col N="367" /> or otherwise of the premium scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is directly related to the employment premium scheme.  It is not in itself a tax incentive. When the employment premium scheme was introduced we said that employment premia were not to be treated as income of the employers.  We could have made the employment premium of £24 per employee and made it subject to tax, which would have left a net sum of £12 in the employer's hands.  Maybe that would have looked more attractive and that more employers would have opted for the £24, overlooking the fact that they would be giving £12 back. Anyway, we gave the £12 and the undertaking that it would not be taken into account as profits or income.</P>
      <P>The actual number who have benefited so far, the number of employees, is more than 4,400 and the number of employers more than 260.  I have no doubt, and the Government never had any doubt, that the most important ingredient in generating employment would be increased demand, improved demand and pick-up in our markets both at home and abroad.  The main value of the employment premium scheme is to encourage employers to advance their thinking, to start up their production sooner than they otherwise might, because if they feel this contribution will help to cover the initial period when they might have losses, they would obviously be prepared to start earlier than they would without such an employment scheme. I think it is important to have the employment premium schemes there to generate activity sooner than it would otherwise occur.  That is the number today, more than 4,400.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme continues in operation and, with the gathering momentum of the economy which is there and of our markets which are there, I foresee a greater likelihood of a greater use of the scheme.  Admittedly, the scheme will not cost the Exchequer an immense amount of money.  Taking people off the unemployment register will constitute a saving on welfare benefit, and in employment it will generate contributions <Col N="368" /> towards the welfare fund and contributions also to revenue.  The scheme can be described as a modest success, certainly a move in the right direction.  The fact that it has engaged 4,400 and more indicates that it has the capacity to generate employment, and I would see that improving now.</P>

I am a bit puzzled by the Minister's remark that the scheme continued with the developing economy, that it may continue to be useful, and so on, and that it has a direct relation to the cost of the section.  My memory of the Bill concerned&mdash;The Employment Premium Act&mdash;when it was going through this House, is that from March 31st this year, the premium went down from £12 to £6 and the whole thing would be phased out from next month, or maybe early July.  After that no further premiums could be paid.  That is my memory of it and I think that is in fact the position.  The future of the premium scheme would appear to be slightly less rosy than the Minister suggested.</P>

      <P>I have not got up-to-date figures but I know that up to 31st March, a total of £20.6 million had been advanced to 2,328 applicants by the banks under this approved scheme. This scheme operates in such a way that it enables the bank to advance the money on housing at rates comparable to those advanced by other housing agencies like building societies, which has been done by subjecting their profits from these operations to the standard rate of income tax at 35 per cent rather than to a rate of 50 per cent which otherwise would apply to their profits, being the corporate rate of tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings in a rather strange change in the position about appeals against assessments.  Up to the present if a taxpayer is assessed for tax and wishes to appeal against it, then the inspector could insist on his depositing what he considered to be a reasonable amount to cover part at least of the tax that would ultimately be payable.  This is a reasonable provision because otherwise obviously anyone could make an appeal against an assessment simply in order to avoid paying any money for an unknown period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This changes the position which has worked satisfactorily for the Revenue Commissioners, if not always for the taxpayer, up to now.  Now, if a taxpayer wishes to appeal he has to make his own assessment&mdash;he has to say what he thinks he owes.  Whatever figure he arrives at, he has to pay that sum there and then.  If the figure he settles on is less than 80 per cent of the final figure <Col N="370" /> as agreed on appeal from the assessment, then he has to pay the difference at the interest rate of 18 per cent.  If on the other hand, in an excess of honesty or enthusiasm or merely through inability at that stage to state precisely what his income will be, he overstates his income and thereby pays an unduly large amount, it will be paid back to him, but without interest.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will have to guard against a situation where a person could pay ten times what he considered might be due and then would demand from the Revenue Commissioners that they should repay the large excess to him at the rate of 18 per cent interest.  No administration would like to be faced with that situation. There ought to be some way that the parliamentary draftsman could devise for dealing with that, avoiding the evasion that would ensue while at the same time safeguarding the honest or reasonably honest taxpayer.  It should be possible to provide for a lower rate of interest, perhaps 9 per cent, on repayments.  Under these conditions a taxpayer could probably gain at least as much interest on his money elsewhere and there would not, therefore, be any incentive to overstate his income deliberately.</P>
    <P>It seems unreasonable in the form it is in this section, because particularly with the earlier assessment of tax under the new system the Minister is introducing in the Bill, in many cases it would be impossible for the taxpayer to know at that stage precisely what his income will be.  Taxpayers in that situation will normally have accountants who will be faced with a large number of assessments at the same time.  Although the Minister has given an extra nine days, from 21 days to 30 days, for appealing against an assessment, in many cases it will be impossible to appeal against an assessment with any knowledge of the precise income involved.</P>
    <P>This is particularly so where the burden of the issue between the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners is not the precise level of income in a particular year but whether certain types of income should be taxable at all. Very large sums can be involved.  You <Col N="371" /> can have an argument as to whether a certain type of income is liable for tax purposes or not.  The difference, depending on which side wins an appeal, could be very considerable.</P>
    <P>What is the unfortunate taxpayer supposed to do?  Is he supposed to pay what his advisers tell him he should be paying and face the danger of paying this penal rate of interest&mdash;18 per cent&mdash; or is he to pay the very much larger sum which he may have great difficulty in raising and which his advisers tell him he should not be paying?  Is he to pay this sum and lose the benefit of it in his business in the meantime and then find, when his side has won, that the Revenue Commissioners will pay back perhaps thousands of pounds without any interest at all?</P>
    <P>It so often seems to apply in these tax statutes that all the odds seem to be on the side of the Revenue Commissioners and none on the side of the taxpayer. I can quite see that one does not want to have a situation where the taxpayer could make large sums of money in interest at the expense of the Revenue Commissioners.  Nevertheless, I feel it could have been framed in a different way.  I admit it has been improved.  This business of saying the taxpayers has to make his own assessment, or his advisers make his assessment, on information which may not be available at that time is like having a ticket in a lottery.  It is not really a fair lottery. The taxpayer can lose on interest.  He cannot gain anything.  He has quite a lot to lose.  It is most unfair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is not as bad as the Senator fears.  If a taxpayer finds the assessment unacceptable and pays the amount in the assessment notice, he will in the event of the success of his appeal get a refund of the excess with interest at 18 per cent free of tax.  This is a handsome rate of interest. I do not know of any other gilt-edged security of that kind today where one can get such a handsome return free of tax.  It is obviously a very attractive investment to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer may if he wishes set aside the amount of tax for which he considers himself liable.  In the normal course of <Col N="372" /> events, unless there is some legal point involved in it which might give rise to doubts as to whether there is any tax payable or not, he should be within striking distance of what his tax liability should be.  If he is within 18 per cent of it he will be all right.  He will be allowed a margin of error of one-fifth, which is not a bad arrangement.  It is a very generous concession.  Obviously, if he decides to make a minimum payment which turns out to be less than 18 per cent of the tax chargeable he will have to pay interest on his error.  But if there was not a penalty attaching to that there would be a temptation to underestimate. Part of the encouragement we have for people to estimate accurately is that they will be penalised if they do not.  If an excessive assessment is made against them, and they appeal against that, they can get a refund of the excess with a very handsome rate of interest. On balance, it cannot be said that the taxpayer is being harshly treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem the taxpayer faces is that the 18 per cent interest is of such a penal nature that provisions which would otherwise seem to be fair do become penal in their nature.  I do not think there is any other country that has a rate of interest anywhere near this 18 per cent.  I would be very surprised to find that any of them had a rate of interest of over half the 18 per cent.  It is a very high and penal rate. It is that rate which causes the trouble in a provision of this kind.  If the rate were more reasonable&mdash;something nearer to what the taxpayer could expect to get by investing his money in some other way&mdash;then the position would be less objectionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's point about paying this estimate of tax, if the final amount payable is less than the assessment they would get 18 per cent on the difference, that is very nice if the taxpayer happens to have that amount of money to invest at that particular moment.  But the basis on which all assessments appear to be made&mdash;usually in the absence of adequate returns from the taxpayer&mdash;is upped a considerable amount beyond anything that a person thinks he will have to pay as an incentive to him to do something about it.  If a taxpayer <Col N="373" /> happens to have enough in his stocking to produce at the drop of a hat on an assessment, that is all right.  But the likelihood is that in most cases the taxpayer will be so appalled by the assessment that he will dash off to his accountant and say: &ldquo;For heaven's sake do something about this&rdquo;, and will certainly not be in a position to produce the cash.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be worth considering this whole question of interest.  Quite clearly the situation cannot be allowed to develop whereby it would be an investment for the taxpayer not to pay his tax.  If a situation arose where a person was able to hold onto his money and, by doing that, pay less interest on overdue income tax, that would be bad business.  It would be an encouragement for a person to be late in paying his tax.  On the other hand &mdash;and I have expressed this view previously&mdash;there is something abhorrent in the idea of heavily penalising a person who for one reason or another, be the reasons good or bad, is not in a position to pay his tax.  It may be that he was a spendthrift or, for one reason or another, that he has not made proper provision.</P>
      <P>I would regard as a fair provision a tax rate which would be linked to bank lending rates.  It would be a fair provision to provide that a taxpayer who is overdue in payment of his tax should suffer interest at X per cent, whether it be 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 per cent above the normal bank rates.  In that way there is no danger that a taxpayer will take advantage of the position by delaying payment.  He will pay more than he would if he borrowed money from the bank.  It would be a more equitable provision than a high fixed rate of interest which can only be regarded as penal on people who genuinely find themselves unable to pay what they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point made by Senator O'Higgins and I would hope to look at this 18 per cent figure. It is high but not extraordinarily high. When we introduced it, it was related to the interest rates of 1974 and 1975 which were at a historically high level.  You cannot make a true comparison between <Col N="374" /> say, the appropriate rate here for arrears of tax and the rate which would apply in Germany, because Germany tends to have interest rates on ordinary bank lending at 5 per cent and 6 per cent lower than ours.  Our rate is related in most cases to the London rate because we operate the open money market between the two countries.  We often have to apply rates here which are not specific to Irish circumstances, but we gain more by this open relationship with the British market than we lose. I do not want to enter into a discussion on this subject, a Leas-Chathaoirleach. Your face can be as expressive as your tongue by times.  I gather that I have strayed but the point I am making is that the figure when we introduced it was not inappropriate.  Revenue is not interested in getting money from interest. All it is doing is providing a discouragement to people to postpone payment of tax because it is the cheapest form of lending you can get.  That is what was happening.  Therefore the rate must be a penal rate.  I usually object to people using the word &ldquo;penal&rdquo; in relation to revenue matters because they are using an emotional term to describe something that is not there.  But this rate is intended to be penal; it is a penalty for failure to pay tax promptly.  Delays can arise, I will accept, due to circumstances which do not involve any moral turpitude or blame.  Nevertheless, one one must have the deterrent.  Perhaps there is something to be said for what Senator O'Higgins suggested, that is, to provide, if we can, a suitable formula in legislation for an interest rate in respect of arrears which would be a number of points above, say, the bank lending rate, or something else of that kind.  We would have to be satisfied that, whatever rate we took, the base rate itself was recognised in law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister is looking into this.  This penal rate does seem unfair in cases where there is no delinquence on the part of the taxpayer.  A taxpayer who has not bothered to make a return or appeal his assessment is fair game, but it is not fair to a taxpayer who genuinely has not been able to raise the money.  At the 18 per cent rate the amount of tax due is almost doubled after five months. <Col N="375" /> It is too severe.  The Minister should consider it very carefully.  A taxpayer who has allowed his tax to run for a number of months could find himself in very serious trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general feeling throughout rural Ireland is that the members of the present Government, being mostly domiciled in our cities, have developed a bias against rural wealth.  I believe that to be a fact.  The Government have sponsored the idea that farming is a type of luxury employment and that most farmers are wallowing in wealth.  When farm produce increases in price farmers are blamed immediately.  People forget about the middle men, the amount of labour, the farmer has put into producing these goods.  Since they were founded by the late Horace Plunkett and Father Finlay, who was a Cavan man, co-operatives have given an excellent service to the rural people. The co-operative movement has helped to unite people.  We are encouraged in our efforts when we see people uniting in any rural community to do something for the benefit of themselves, their families and, indeed, for the country.</P>
      <P>In the past co-ops have supplied the farmer with many amenities and articles at a lesser price than he would normally have to pay.  For that reason, they help to keep the farmers in business.  Do people ever reflect on the number of people who are directly and indirectly employed by virtue of the fact that we have efficient farmers in the country? There are hundreds of people employed in food processing, in meat factories, milk powder factories, creameries, tanneries, and many other places where farming by-products of one kind or another are processed for home consumption or export.  In this way co-operatives are providing many people with constant employment.</P>

      <P>We are now short 560,000 cattle, most of our young calves having been exported to Italy.  These are the raw materials that would be needed to supply the co-ops who manufacture in the meat industry and in its by-products. We are very concerned about that because we in our time in office had built up the cattle population and had it disease-free.  The co-ops during their time in existence have provided a wonderful service for the rural people. They paid their workers well.  There was a certain dedication amongst the workers and a built-in co-operation and desire to ensure that their particular co-op would do its work well.  In my own constituency the Killeshandra Co-operative Society did their work so well that they won the Reid Cup on six occasions for producing the best and cleanest butter in Ireland.</P>
      <P>If you travel to Bailieboro' or Lough Egish, or even travel around to the Cork marts and various other co-ops, you will see that these co-ops have given a great service to their areas.  These are all very important developments.  Were it not for the Killeshandra Co-op being in existence we would never have got the food processing plant that we now have in existence there which employs over 300 people.  Neither would we have the new cheese factory that we have there. These are developments that have taken place in a rural community by virtue of the fact that we had a co-op in existence. We should never forget the part that the founders of that co-op and their managers and workers down the years have played in developing and improving the standard of living of the farming community and of the people in general in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us forget that these co-ops need an enormous amount of money to expand.  The type of machinery that it is necessary to instal in a modern creamery is tremendously expensive. Unless a creamery is operating in a modern way at present and able to observe the general rules of hygiene it is impossible for it to compete on the home market or on the export market. If the Minister could get someone to produce the figures of the amount of <Col N="377" /> agricultural orientated or agricultural processed food and raw materials that goes up in Killeshandra or Cavan town and compare it with any other part of Ireland it would compare very favourably indeed.  Confidence in the area, improvement in the standard of living and the extra employment that is being created there are all due to the fact that there is a co-op in the area.</P>
    <P>If there was a new factory coming from Japan, Germany or England there would be a great song and dance about it.  The new manager and his team would be greeted with applause.  There would be a substantial State grant and an official opening and the manager and his staff would be put on a special elite panel because they would be bringing in capital and about to start a new industry.  Let us not forget the people who have been there for over 100 years who have founded the permanent nurseries.  They are making and processing food, milk, butter and cheese, things that the human race needs every day of their lives.  In other words there is a market for them.  Thanks to Mr. Lawless we succeeded in getting this food processing factory there.  Along with that we succeeded in getting markets abroad.  That is very important and entails a lot of cost on behalf of the co-ops and the food processing people themselves who do not wait for the customer to come to them but who actually go out to Spain, Italy and all foreign countries where they dispose of these manufactured goods.  In doing this a new industry would get exemption from rates.</P>
    <P>On my own local county council I proposed a motion some years ago that any new factory should get ten years exemption, an extra three to what is usually allowed.  I do not think the co-ops enjoy this, although they are a very important part of our employment machinery.  Let us also remember that it is the co-ops who more or less set the trend and improve the standard and modernisation of the farms in the area. They are the people who are able to buy the machinery, exhibit it and often give demonstrations of how the machinery is worked.  The creameries and co-ops in general have pioneered and improved the standard and quality of our animals <Col N="378" />&mdash;our cattle and pigs in particular&mdash;by the introduction of the AI schemes and the use of the dearest, most fertile and best suited semen so as to ensure that we would have a very superior cattle herd.  They make efforts to ensure that vets are available and that brucellosis and so on is exterminated.  These are all very laudable things that have helped to keep our agricultural industry to the fore.</P>
    <P>As I said on previous occasions, when we entered the EEC there was great hopes for the development of industry and in particular for the development of co-ops and factories based on agricultural material.  It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party when they return to power that they are committed to removing this tax that the Minister is now imposing on co-ops.  We are not the type of party who act like the Minister who is often slipping and sliding like a gander on ice so far as decisions are concerned.  The Minister one day says he is going to tax co-ops and the next day, because he has an interview with two or three farmers, he panics and says, &ldquo;We will remove this part but we will not remove the other&rdquo;.  We are totally committed and crystal clear in what we intend to do.  We are doing it because we feel it is necessary in the interest of the survival of rural Ireland and necessary so far as the economy is concerned. It will boost and back up the co-ops who down the years have been doing an excellent job.  It will further incorporate and encourage that type of co-operative get together movement which we are trying to foster.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wrong in doing this. It certainly will bring many hardships in so far as the farming community are concerned.  Many of these hardships will be passed on, because the co-op itself will not carry the extra taxation that the Minister is imposing on it.  All the extra taxation will have to be passed on to the farmers who actually own the co-ops. There is nothing that will shake me in my firmly held conviction that this Government have stumbled into this and blundered so far as the rural community are concerned.</P>
    <P>The rural community have been suspicious from the beginning in so far as the composition of the Cabinet is <Col N="379" /> concerned, which has been a matter for the Taoiseach.  We have trade unions of all descriptions in our party.  The propaganda is being levelled against the ordinary farmer and co-op or the person who works in agriculture that he is a type of inferior being who should be loaded down with taxation. He is paying his fair share so far as other commitments are concerned. Without him there would be very few people working in the motor industry, very few in the tractor industry.  Indeed in anything he buys, whether it be a plough, a forage harvester or whatever it is, by virtue of the fact that he is buying it in his own country he is paying far more than he would pay for it in the Six Counties or in Europe.  He has also to carry that extra load to keep those workers in existence and reasonable frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>I see nothing in the trail of this disastrous provision except that there will be fewer people employed in rural Ireland, that the co-ops will find it much harder to give the services which the people expect of them, and that the farmers are being beaten down to earth. This happened particularly in 1974 when they had to accept rock-bottom prices because of the incompetence of our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in not being able to ensure that the payments that were justifiably coming to them from the EEC got back to the producer instead of being absorbed by many of the private meat packers.  The farmer, therefore, cannot have any confidence in this outfit.  I feel that the Minister would be wise if he were again to indulge in that gander-sliding exercise and again get on the ice and perhaps skate off to the corner that would be most beneficial as far as the co-ops and the rural people are concerned.</P>
    <P>As far as I can judge from the general climate in rural Ireland it just seems to be a matter of not alone this Minister but all the Ministers whistling past the graveyard and trying to pretend that everything in the garden is rosy, grasping at a straw like a drowning man and indiscriminately putting on extra taxation in a vain attempt to retrieve what they have lost over the last three years.  I think the only way that the <Col N="380" /> thousands of people engaged in the co-operative movement will get their grievances cured is to ensure that at the next election they will make sure to get rid of this Government and in particular those who, during the last three years have been more or less sneering at the farmer and accusing him of not pulling his full weight as far as the community is concerned and who have been trying all the time to grind him back down to the earth from which he sprung.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding section 33 which deals mainly with the taxation of co-ops, I regret all the acrimony that has developed in recent months between farming organisations and the Government regarding taxation of co-ops.  I am sure that when the Minister gets the feed-back from his colleagues he will regret the decision to tax the co-ops. Possibly it was another sop to the Labour Party in order to enjoy continued participation in Government.</P>
      <P>What is a co-op society?  A co-op society is an organisation which was brought about by people who were willing to give their time and to make sacrifices in order to put a project into existence for their own benefit and for the benefit of those who would be engaged in that co-op.  Co-ops initially were formed on a non-profit-making basis.  They were formed as creamery outlets, separating stations, purchasing centres and so on.  They were formed in the first instance to benefit the people who required the services most, the people who were unable to pay high prices for farm commodities, namely the small farmers.</P>
      <P>My only regret about co-ops is that we have not more of them branching out into other spheres of our day-to-day activities.  I regret that we have not more housing co-ops, more social services co-ops and so on, because all those things, if they were properly organised and encouraged, would take the load off the general taxpayer and they would be giving a wonderful service to the country and would allow people greater participation in the say and running of the affairs of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of a co-op have a say in its policy making, they have a say in <Col N="381" /> its non-profit-making or its profit-making but by and large co-ops were not established as profit-making concerns. They were meant to give a service to the members who were mainly small farmers, people who found it difficult to obtain credit, and who had to avail of the credit facilities of co-ops whereby they purchased their seeds, manures, fertilisers, dairy requisites and so on. In return the co-op stopped an agreed figure from each monthly cheque by way of payment.  That was the real function of the co-ops.  That was how the co-ops were successful, because the people depended on the co-ops for their credit, they depended on them for the supply of their materials, their household goods and so on.</P>
    <P>In recent years the co-ops became involved in bigger business, in farm machinery, forage harvesters, combine harvesters and so on.  The reason that they became involved was because the members felt that there was need for their involvement, there was need to give better direct service to the farmers themselves, there was need to secure commodities for farmers at reduced prices because, as I said, co-ops sold on a non-profit-making basis and, therefore, the farmer stood to benefit most. We have been told in recent months that if co-ops are asked to bear a further measure of taxation the farmer will have to bear something like 1.5p per gallon on milk.  There is no doubt that the majority of small farmers who are not already caught in the tax net and who are not likely to be caught in it will have to bear this burden.  The bigger farmer with the higher turnover will be more comfortable and in a better position to bear this impact.</P>
    <P>Another consideration that we seem to lose sight of is that co-operatives are engaged in food manufacturing and food processing.  Therefore, they are producing a commodity for export and, like any other industry, they should enjoy the facilities afforded to industry at present.  An industry which sets out to export goods enjoys, tax-free remission for those items exported. Therefore, co-ops must be treated similarly.  They must be treated as equals in the export drive.  That is what we want.  We want more and more participation <Col N="382" /> in export.  The agricultural co-ops are geared to participate in that export.  What they need is encouragement and inducement and if they get those things they will play their role in building up the economy.  Look at what agriculture did for our balance of payments exports last year.  If they were encouraged and exploited along the proper lines they would play an even greater role in the export area.  That is what we need badly.  The Minister and the Government know that, but I can see their difficulty.  They have to contend with the Labour Party who have some false idea that farming has become some sort of a haven and that every effort must be made to extract the maximum amount of taxation from those people.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister's colleagues down the country have heard a great deal of noises recently regarding those co-ops.  This is a step which will be regretted because it will increase costs and lessen our chances on the export market.  It is very important that we must always be in a position to produce food and sell it at a competitive price on the European market.  What the co-ops and the farmers need is an inducement and every encouragement to play a much greater role in the building up of the economy and in earning for us more and more capital which this country needs so badly.  Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to make some overtures to the members of the co-ops and the agricultural community in general and that he will make some efforts to protect this great industry.</P>

In an age when we have so many of our concerns, industries and services being taken over by foreign monopolies, instead of discouraging the co-operative movement we should do everything in our power to encourage our rural people to get together and to stand on their own feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very special interest in the co-operative movement because, first of all, it was set up by Sir Horace <Col N="383" /> Plunkett and Father Finlay in the early decades of this century and because it was from the co-operative movement that the Irish Countrywomen's Association grew.  Sir Horace Plunkett and Father Finlay were the first ever to admit that this great movement would never get off its feet without the help of the women of Ireland.  It was as a result of this appeal by those two great Irishmen that the Irish Countrywomen's Association was founded.  The idea behind it&mdash; an idea which should still be to the fore in rural Ireland&mdash;was that the association was founded to foster more self-help and mutual help and in that way to improve the standards of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since their foundation, the Irish Countrywomen's Association have played their part and have taken a very special interest in the movement.  They have been very prominent in setting up country markets.  I do not think these markets would be in the million pounds bracket but, at the same time, their aggregate takings would run into a fair amount of money.  Their latest venture was in the craft co-operative section and there is a shining example of a craft co-operative in Sliabh Bán that has done us proud both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It grieves me that these co-operatives, craft, fishing or agricultural co-operatives, must now come under the taxman's axe.  Instead of being taxed they should be encouraged because they will now have no incentive to expand. Many of the bigger co-ops, as Senators Keegan and Dolan have said, have had to borrow substantially&mdash;even £1 million&mdash;to modernise their affairs and machinery.  It will be a great disincentive to farmers in future to invest any of their hardearned money if their is not a change of mind about this taxation.</P>
    <P>One of the great results of the co-operative movement is the spirit of community involvement which it engenders in an area.  Any industry that gives heart to the people of rural Ireland should be encouraged rather than discouraged which is going to happen if this section goes through.  With the other Senators, I have no intention of supporting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put on the record a few remarks which I think are important.  I am sorry that Senator Dolan is not here because I would like to say how much I appreciate his description of the descendent of a Cavan man who has wandered like a gander slipping on ice while he whistles passing a graveyard, gripping at a straw like a drowning man.  It is not a bad mixture of metaphors.  Whatever else I am, I am not as confused as all that.  I suspect that Senator Dolan, from much of what he has said, is confused, as indeed others are, about the taxation of farming co-ops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Uí Eachthéirn made reference to a craft co-op.  I am not absolutely certain of the crafts in which that co-op is engaged.  It is quite possible that that co-op is liable to tax because industrial co-ops are liable to tax and there are several industrial co-ops made up of operatives in industry who rescued their industries from collapse and who put in their own money and effort and they have not enjoyed exemption from taxation.  There are many activities now engaged in by fishing and farming co-ops which bear no relation whatsoever to the type of activity in which these co-ops were engaged or which it was conceived they might engage in when the concession was first granted before the foundation of the State. Indeed, in Senator Dolan's own area there is a co-op which is manufacturing massive equipment which is more of an industrial than an agricultural nature. It is supplying not merely the agricultural industry with such equipment but it is exporting and is in direct competition with a number of private enterprise operations which are manufacturing precisely the same kind of equipment.  It is fair to ask should one group be free of tax and the other not? They are both servicing similar markets, they are both involved in the same kind of trade, both manufacturing the same product&mdash;a product only remotely connected with agriculture in that it manufactures containers, tankers and silos but can just as easily be used in industry as in agriculture.  That is just one illustration of the anomaly that would continue to exist unless there was a very <Col N="385" /> radical change in the whole approach to the exemption to co-ops.</P>
    <P>Certain suggestions have been made that the Government do not understand the difference between profit&mdash;which is the pursuit of private enterprise&mdash;and the generation of benefits for members &mdash;which is the pursuit of co-operatives. This is said as though profit was something unseemly and something unworthy and something which deserved to be taxed while conferring of benefits on members is not.  What is profit but the conferring of benefit on the owners of the capital in an enterprise and the operators in the enterprise?  There is, in fact, no fundamental difference.  What is totally unacceptable and is now admitted to be ridiculous is the suggestion that taxation which should amount to about £2 million on a turnover which now is known to be in excess of £800 million is going to ruin the co-operative system, is going to bring it to an end, is going to cause farmers to wind up their own operations.  We are told that co-ops are farmers and that because they are to be asked to pay tax they are going to commit hari-kari.</P>
    <P>Nobody on this side of the House or in either of the Government parties has, at any time, jeered or sneered at any farmer.  This accusation has often been levied but I heard nothing as contemptuous as the talk of the leading member of the Fianna Fáil Party in the other House in the last few weeks who referred to the city slickers with curtains on their windows and so on.  I thought that talk was most offensive.  I have never heard, nor would I tolerate it even if I did hear it, anybody engaging in criticism of rural dwellers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This tax is a very mild tax indeed. The adjustment which has been made since the original budget proposal was one which I announced at the time of introduction of the Finance Bill.  The only reason it did not appear in the Finance Bill was due to a technical difficulty in devising the precise form of words to meet the situation.  The situation which exists in the co-operative movement today which causes problems is that a large number of them have over-borrowed and quite a number of them have been in financial difficulties in recent times, long before <Col N="386" /> there was any mention of the proposed tax.  I am not going to enter into any criticism of their decisions to borrow, or of the activities in which they engage, but whatever difficulties they had, they were certainly in no way connected with the proposal to introduce this tax which is absolutely necessary if there is to be equity in the tax system.</P>
    <P>What we have done is to allow co-operatives to write off against future profits the investments they made in previous years, of the balance of those investments.  That means they will be able to repay the money which they have already borrowed.  It allows them sufficient time to adjust to the new system.  The farming community in general, and co-operatives in particular, would be well advised to be led by a very loyal, worth-while and level-headed leader of the farming community, Mr. James O'Keeffe of the ICMSA, who said the other night that farmers should accept that the taxation of co-operatives is the law of the land and adjust themselves to it.</P>
    <P>I commend that approach.  I believe it should be the approach of all right-thinking people.  A disservice has been done, not merely this year in relation to the proposal to tax farming co-operatives, which is a nugatory tax in relation to the turnover of profits of co-operatives, but to the whole farming community by those who have been whinging, crying, complaining and talking about the disincentive effect of tax over the past few years.  The same can be said about all taxation and, therefore, the way to generate greatest wealth should be to abolish all taxation. That might well lead to a social and political revolution which might hurt most those who at first sight might think that would benefit if all taxation were abolished.  The truth is that man, because he is level-headed and sensible, when he counts the cost, decides if he has to pay so much tax he does not want to be any poorer, so he tends to work harder to make up the same net income.  That has always been the trend.</P>
    <P>On top of that, farmers now know, what they did not appreciate at the beginning, that by borrowing and investing they can set off against their <Col N="387" /> tax liability interest which they pay on those borrowings.  Far from taxation being a disincentive to investment, all other countries in which farmers are taxed&mdash;and I do not know any progressive country where farming profits are not taxed&mdash;have shown that the existence of farm taxation has encouraged investment.  Now that farmers have had experience of farm taxation since 1974, they are beginning to realise that.  The result is that there is a very rapid growth in the taking up of credit by farmers.</P>
    <P>I realise that if you are in the political kitchen you cannot complain if people try to stick your head in the oven. People have tried to create a considerable amount of heat on this issue.  They seem to have misled a number of people into misunderstanding what the whole thing is about, but the country at large <Col N="388" /> now knows that what is now proposed is fair.  I will conclude on this note. While we have heard the critics complain, we have not heard the very large number of small traders who had a grave sense of injustice for a long time past, because they saw trade drifting away from them, who were taxed, to enterprises which were not taxed.  I have received in my office several private letters expressing congratulations on the introduction of this tax which introduces some element of fair play.  I also received letters criticising me because I modified the original proposals and it was felt that I should not have modified them.  When I find myself being criticised from both extremes I feel I must be right, and be somewhere in the middle.  That is the right place to be.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the effect of the section in regard to the new duty on beer in particular, but the extra tax situation is involved.  Now that it has been in operation for some three months, has the Minister any figures he can give in regard to whether or not these measures have been counter-productive, which I feel they have been, particularly in regard to beer and stout in terms of reduced consumption?  Has the exercise been worth while from a Revenue point of view leaving aside the merits or demerits of the particular duty?  The Minister may not be able to answer that yet, but I should like him to make some comment on it.  Apart from that aspect, in my view there is very little net gain in Revenue terms and, therefore, consumption remaining <Col N="389" /> fairly static or reducing will create a situation where the increased rate of duty may be counter-productive.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the variance that exists in regard to types of beer and stout in Britain and in Ireland, and even taking comparable beers such as Bass, there is a difference of 10p in the price per pint.  Have any sums been done by the Revenue Commissioners or by anybody in the economic section of the Minister's Department on the deterrent aspect involved in this, <i>vis-a-vis</i>, visitors coming here from Britain?</P>
      <P>There are two valid questions which relate to an essential point I believe has run right through the whole policy and philosophy of the Minister since becoming Minister for Finance.  He has tended to be over-orientated to the tax gathering aspect of his Department.  The Revenue Commissioners have tended to have too free a rein, and sufficient cognisance has not been taken of the overall economic maleffects arising from taxation pursued for the sake of taxation. This instance is a classic example of it.  Beer duties have now risen to a level where, subject to what the Minister has to say, they will be counter-productive from the Revenue point of view, and certainly from the point of view of tourism with the price of a pint 10p dearer than the price of a comparable British beverage.  As the Minister is well aware in view of current events, this duty is a very important ingredient in the cost-of-living index and a cause of severe problem in reaching any wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to advert to what Senator Lenihan has said regarding the tourist industry and the effect this can have, not alone on the industry in general, but on the industry in particular in the Border counties.  As a member of the Lakeland Tourism Organisation I feel it will have a very adverse effect on the number of people coming to our area.  The price of the pint has increased by 20p since 1973, when this Government took office.  For the first time in the sale of drink, a pint now costs more than a half glass of whiskey.  This is wrong thinking.  The people who manufacture whiskey give an excellent service and export quite a ot of their products, and so forth.  The <Col N="390" /> potency of different drinks should be taken into account.  In view of the number of accidents on our roads it is wrong to encourage people to take strong drink such as whiskey in small quantities instead of long drinks such as pints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence points to the correctness of the tax imposition because the consumption in February, post tax, fell by a smaller amount than had been anticipated, which showed in fact that the tax imposition was correctly calculated as being that which was tolerable.  For other reasons the price of beer rose two days before the commencement of Lent and that had a significant impact upon beer consumption which fell considerably in March, not as a result of the tax, but rather due to the fact that on 1st March an addition of about 4p was put on the price of beer.</P>
      <P>One of these increases had been legitimately processed through the National Prices Commission which recommended it.  That was for the brewers.  The other price increase was not processed through the National Prices Commission.  Indeed, a number of other increases were imposed by the vintners in recent times without seeking the approval of the National Prices Commission or of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Dáil, the Government's effort to control these prices is frustrated by the fact that there is at present a case before the courts known as the Dundalk publicans' case, where the validity of the orders is being challenged.  While several other publicans have been prosecuted in respect of what are considered to be illegal increases in prices the issue cannot be determined or controlled until such time as the law case is over.  It is a very frustrating position but one with which we have to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of beer has increased since 1973 but, of the increase in price, the Exchequer has received only 40 per cent, and 60 per cent has gone to other interests, some of it legitimately sanctioned by the National Prices Commission, a very significant proportion o it not sanctioned by the National Prices Commission or by the Minister <Col N="391" /> for Industry and Commerce.  It is something over which, unfortunately, we have no effective control until such time as the litigation is decided upon.</P>
    <P>What the Exchequer receives it returns.  I know more than one person consuming a pint of &ldquo;that which is best&rdquo; has probably resented money going into Richie's pockets in recent months, but it must be some consolation to them to know that there are holes in all of Richie's pockets and that the money never stays there.  It simply pours out.  It does not remain in the Exchequer.  Whatever the Exchequer has received it has handed out, and it has even been said by the Opposition that we hand out too much, that we hand out not merely what we collect in tax but also that which we borrow. The other increases which I am satisfied cannot be fully justified are unfortunate, and it may be possible, as soon as the litigation is resolved, to correct that position.  In the meantime unfortunately we have to live with it.  Finally may I say in relation to what Senator Lenihan said, I am not prepared to accept that British beer is comparable to Irish beer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quoted a comparable one, Bass&mdash;a particular brew comparable in each jurisdiction, and 10p is the difference per pint at the moment. There is very bad British beer and the differential is in the order of 20p, if I wanted to be extreme in my argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a little ingenuous in talking about the rise in price at the beginning of March as being a matter entirely for brewers, and so on.  The Minister himself directly or indirectly added 4p to the price at the beginning of March in increases in VAT.  One of the problems in relation to consumption has been that the Minister had two bites at the cherry. He put 6p on in the budget and then&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Five pence in the budget. The VAT element works out at about 1p but would not have worked out at about 1p if 4p had not been added to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put on 5p in the budget and another 5p VAT in March.  These two bites at the cherry caused a lot of the trouble during Lent. Not content with taking 5p in the budget, the Minister then postponed the increases in VAT until March and put on another 5p, leaving aside the question of the brewers altogether.  If there was a falling off the Minister has only himself to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are administrative difficulties in relation to VAT.  You cannot impose a VAT increase in the middle of a VAT period.  The VAT increase could only be imposed from the commencement of the VAT period which happened to be 1st March.  The VAT increase would have worked out at only 1p, had it not been for the other increases which made the VAT increase <i>in toto</i> 1.36p.  The addition was attached to the vintners' and brewers' increase. That was not intended, I doubt very much if an increase of 1p two days before Lent would have been sufficient to strengthen the resolve of people to abstain during the Holy Season.  The imposition of 5p two days before the commencement of the penitential season helped to strengthen some people's will to stay off it for a while.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I am clear about the situation.  The 1p on the VAT originally envisaged was obviously on top of the 5p.  Surely the increase of VAT from 6.75 per cent to 10 per cent added a considerable amount at the beginning of March.  That had nothing to do with brewers increasing prices.  This was envisaged by the Minister.  It is a 50 per cent increase in the VAT rate.  That is altogether different from the 1p.  The 1p was merely on the increased price. In addition to that, even if he never increased the price, there would have been a considerable increase in VAT because of the 50 per cent increase.</P>

As with the other sections it raises to varying degrees the cost of living on the ordinary man in the street and one can include nearly everybody in the list of people being affected by this section.  Apart from the effects on the individual, a 13p increase per gallon in the cost of petrol between tax and VAT as a result of the Finance Bill is a very serious imposition, not merely on the ordinary individual but also by the time it has worked itself right down to the commercial, industrial and agricultural life it will mean a further lessening of the possibility of economic recovery.  In addition it is likely to cause further increases in the cost of living.  The cost of petrol is now up 52p and the Minister will no doubt say the tax is a proportion of the total <Col N="395" /> price less than it was in some year that he picks to suit himself and so on, but the fact remains that the Minister has increased petrol prices on several occasions by large sums, his first effort was 15p, now it is 13p.</P>
      <P>At a time when the price of petrol is rising very rapidly for other reasons it would seem to be desirable to tax less rather than more.  This must have a very serious effect on the economy and obviously, as Senator Brennan has already pointed out, it has a very serious effect on certain businessmen along the Border because the difference now is very large in the cost of petrol as between both sides of the Border so that no one in his senses would buy petrol on this side of the Border if he could go across and buy it much cheaper at the other side.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside this matter which affects seriously a limited area, the entire country is suffering as a result of this tax and I do not think the Minister can congratulate himself in any way in regard to it.  It is clear that it has had and will continue to have very bad effects.  The trouble with taxes on petrol, or indeed on anything, is that they go up but never come down and with the cost of petrol now at nearly a £1 a gallon it is quite clear that the price will never come down but will remain a burden on the community. We will know that the oil crisis in general has had an effect on prices in all countries but the difficulty is that the internal effects of raising costs in Ireland have been greatly aggravated by the advantages being taken by the Minister of this rise to add very large increases of his own to it, thinking apparently that they can be included in the general rises and perhaps not noticed quite so much.  But I suppose that motorists having got over the first anguished reaction will probably get used to the price of petrol.  Nonetheless it will be a burden on them and particularly it will remain a burden on the economy.  It was a very bad decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say &ldquo;fair comment&rdquo; but, of course, there are two sides to every argument.  If we had not had increases in the price of hydrocarbon <Col N="396" /> oil since 1973 it is probable that our consumption of oil would now be in the region of 280 to 290 million gallons as against 235 million gallons. The effect of the increases in both the imported price and the fiscal increases has been to keep our consumption in or about the same.  It was 233 million gallons in 1973 and 235 million gallons in 1975, which is a very small increase considering that prior to 1973 we were increasing our consumption at the rate of 8 to 10 per cent per annum.  If we had continued at this rate of expansion our balance of payment position would become utterly intolerable.  Last year we had an extraordinarily temporary relief from a difficulty in balance of payments.  That was due to the recession and de-stocking and so forth, but now that recovery is coming about we are likely to move back again into that very difficult balance of payments position which arose in 1974 as a consequence of the massive increase in the price of imported oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from everything else there is urgent reason for us to reduce, and certainly not to increase, our consumption of imported oil.  Therefore, apart from the need for revenue which is one of the major reasons why we have imposed the tax in this year's budget&mdash;I do not want to conceal that or camouflage it&mdash;I also want to say that there are very good economic reasons why we should depress the use of imported oils.  So far we have been successful in that policy.  We wish particularly to do it in the area where, for some people, there is an element of choice.  Of course we must import oil for essential industry and this importation will increase as industry picks up from the recession and industry returns to full capacity but one must consider both of these things in relation to the question of the use of oil and the cost of it.  Criticism was made of some of the other taxes in that we may have pitched the taxes at a level which could reduce revenue and that it was unwise to do it.  Experience has shown that taxation related to this particular item, because it has not shown the same sensitivity as has for instance, tobacco.  Of the old reliables tobacco is the most sensitive to tax increases and in fact within the last six <Col N="397" /> years we had three occasions during which tobacco consumption fell but there was no reduction in consumption of any of the other items or in the consumption of oil.  I am always willing to hear suggestions as to where revenue might be collected and if somebody has a better one I will be only too happy to implement it and to give full credit to the genius who is courageous enough to make the proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not venturing in on that.  That is a matter for the Government and indeed they are dab hands at inventing ingenious methods of extracting the last penny from the taxpayer. The Minister seems to imply that the real thinking behind this is not so much to get revenue as to cut down the amount of oil we import.  I do not know whether he wants the people, the workers in particular, to walk to their jobs.  He must admit and concede that the motor car has become an essential part of rural and family life, especially in areas where there are no services provided by CIE.  I wonder has he adverted to the fact that we in the north-eastern area&mdash;Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim&mdash;get very little use out of CIE, that we have no railways. Not alone have we been allowed to suffer this loss but our roads have been allowed to deteriorate despite the increased price we are paying for petrol. We have great difficulty in getting our manufactured goods to the ports. Further, the recipients of social welfare benefits, particularly old age pensioners and people such as those for whom Deputy Haughey, when Minister, introduced special concessions to allow them to travel free on public transport, now find that they cannot avail of that concession.  I wonder has the Minister given any consideration as to a way in which he could recompense those old people who have given a tremendous service to this country and now find that they cannot avail of this service which is supposed to be there for their benefit.</P>

      <P>The Minister was almost making a virtue out of his enormous series of taxes on petrol by suggesting in effect that he had been performing a public and indeed a national service by cutting down on imports of oil and <Col N="398" /> thereby saving our balance of payments. He gave the show away completely towards the end of his last intervention when he said that one of the great advantages of taxing petrol was that unlike beer, tobacco and so on, it was in fact relatively elastic&mdash;no matter what increase you put on it it did not change the consumption.  In that the Minister is correct.  The facts show over the years that you can put almost any tax on petrol, whatever effect it has on the economy is another thing, but in regard to consumption it will have no effect.</P>
      <P>If the consumption of energy is cut down it is not by reason of the Minister's taxes.  It is because of the extreme state of economic depression that we are suffering from.  This has caused grave financial problems for the ESB because people are simply not using electricity. It is not that people are no longer using lights in their houses but that industry is at such a low ebb that the former heavy users of electricity are not using it any longer.</P>
      <P>In the same way consumption of oil has gone down because the economy has been in such a state that the people cannot affort to use it.  As the Minister rightly says, taxation on petrol has very little effect in changing the pattern of consumption.</P>

      <P>Section 42 is a new measure and takes on a new dimension. For the first time we learn that the Garda are about to be employed to search vehicles to see if they contain special equipment dealing with the running of the vehicle on liquid gas. What form of interrogation will this new exercise comprise?  Are we to have more squad cars on the road and more policemen employed together with Revenue Commissioners searching the insides of cars to see where this special equipment is installed?  What rights has the individual in regard to his property? This is a long and detailed section.  It is <Col N="399" /> a new section in our Finance Bill. Therefore, there is reason for a certain amount of apprehension dealing with the whole matter.</P>

      <P>What we have done is to copy the provisions of the 1935 Act. Sometimes I do imitate Fianna Fáil. They introduced similar provisions when diesel was taxed for the first time. There is a very good case for taxing gaseous hydrocarbon in liquid form which can now be used to drive motor vehicles, but it is appropriate that we should use powers similar to those which exist in relation to diesel.  Diesel and gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form will be taxed at a similar rate which is a rate lower than applies to petrol.  The lower rate is justified on the grounds that they are forms which tend to be used mostly in commercial vehicles.  Accordingly, in order to ease the cost distribution to industry one taxes them at a lower rate.  It would be inappropriate to give this concession and then not allow adequate policing power to make sure the concession is not abused.  I am sure on reflection that Senator Keegan will see the necessity for the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister did not clarify whether he intends to employ the Garda in a new capacity which did not happen heretofore.  The section states that an officer of the Revenue Commissioners or a member of the Garda Síochána may examine and take samples of any gaseous hydrocarbons in liquid form kept in any tank.  That is a new dimension in my opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally the Garda are not used in this work at all.  It is customs officers who deal with it.  Some people have an inclination not to cooperate perhaps as much as they ought to with customs officers particularly if they have a guilty complex.  In such a situation it may be necessary for a member of the Garda Síochána to assist an officer of the Revenue Commissioners in the course of the examination. We have in this Bill and in other measures relieved some of the police work involved in enforcing taxation laws.  I do not expect this is going to <Col N="400" /> involve any significant additional burden on the Garda.  If we are going to tax liquid petroleum gas we clearly have to provide measures to enable the law to be enforced and not abused.</P>

      <P>I should like to be clear as to how to segregate the different vehicles.  Will every vehicle be searched? How do you decide on a particular vehicle?  If there are 100 vehicles travelling along a highway, do you stop and search 100 vehicles or how do you segregate them?  A car that has been converted may not have been reported to the taxation authorities.  I am at a loss to know how you are going to catch the man who is using gas as against petrol.</P>

      <P>I understood that the Senator was in favour of 100 per cent enforcement.  I am shocked to discover that he is not.  He is a party to the passing of laws here which I am sure he would want people to respect once they are passed by the House whether he voted for or against them.  The position will be no different from that which now exists in relation to red diesel and so on. I would love to think there was a 100 per cent detection of wrongdoers but there is not.  You should see some of the letters I get.  Incidently, I have no power to remit fines.  Some people think I have.  It is not uncommon for me to get a letter from somebody or on behalf of somebody saying that he was caught by the gardaí with red diesel in his car and was prosecuted for the offence and for having a hidden tank.  Because it is his first offence he asks me to let him off.  What is usually the case is that it was the first time that person was caught but it does not advance any particular reason why it should be remitted.  That is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  This will be no different from that which already exists.  The Revenue Commissioners and <Col N="401" /> the Garda from time to time through the use of their own intelligence and information services have occasion to inspect cars.  We would not visualise that there would be a sudden descent on every motorist to see whether he has a particular form of fuel fuelling the car.  The authorities will use their powers and I am sure the rate of detection will not be unfavourable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>This is basically the section which fixes the new rates of VAT as imposed in the budget and made into law by this Finance Bill.  The basic change has been the conversion of all the low rates of VAT at 6.75 per cent into 10 per cent.  Basically the general rate of VAT on the ordinary necessities of life on which VAT is charged has been increased by 50 per cent.  That is another example of two aspects of Government policy that we have had to criticise very frequently in the past&mdash; the extraordinary way in which the Government, and the Minister in particular, appear to be able at a drop of a hat to take steps which have a direct and drastic effect in raising the cost of living, at the same time as they are looking for a pay pause, wage restraints and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one aspect of their policy which we have criticised frequently in the past.  The other aspect is their apparent complete inability to make up their minds what attitude they should take with regard to such matters.  It was only last June that in this House we accepted the Finance (No. 2) Bill, otherwise known as the mini-budget, in which the Minister zero-rated certain items and in particular clothing in order to cut the cost of living.  For example, in the earlier years of this Government, in the autumn of 1973, food was eliminated from VAT.  At the same time as he did that he increased VAT on a variety of other things and made an overall profit on the deal.  The Government, on the one hand, tend to take <Col N="402" /> these steps, whether justified or not, in eliminating certain items from VAT and zero-rating them and within months of doing so, to increase VAT on a wide range of goods.  I cannot see any point in that policy from the point of the finances of the country or the inflationary position we are in.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister thinks the people in 1976 are doing nothing except eating food and wearing clothing.  The kind of things which are being increased by this 10 per cent are things which ordinary people buy&mdash; things like building materials&mdash;which add directly to the cost of housing. These are ordinary things which are by no means luxuries.  So-called luxuries are taxed at a different rate.  These are all things we have to buy.  We do not live primitively.  Every household in the country buys, as a matter of course, large quantities each week of the items now rated at 10 per cent.  As I say, the tax rate on those have gone up by 50 per cent.  That has had a very direct effect on living costs.  It has not yet appeared in the cost-of-living index.  It will appear in the cost-of-living index which was assessed and completed within the last week or so, and when those figures are published we will see the results.  In the absence of accurate statistics it has already had its psychological effect in making it impossible to obtain agreement on the pay pause to the end of this year, which the Minister has rightly sought to achieve.</P>
    <P>One cannot understand the attitude of the Government in taking these inflationary steps at the same moment as they are calling for restraint.  One cannot understand the attitude of the Government in taking decisions such as this within months of taking decisions which are contrary to this in eliminating items such as clothing from the effect of VAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not reversed the actions of last June when the reductions in VAT and so forth brought down the consumer price index by 4.5 per cent.  The increases in VAT do not increase the cost of living by the same amount.  It comes to about 1½ per cent, but it does increase it.  As I said this morning, it is a simple direct choice which was put to the country las <Col N="403" /> October, November and December and which has been put since.  It is a choice which a Fianna Fáil Government would have to make, too, particularly a Government which say that if they got into power they would reduce the size of the deficit, that they would reduce borrowing but that they would increase expenditure on a multitude of schemes.</P>
      <P>They would have to decide where they would collect the taxation.  Would they collect it by way of increased direct taxes, which they say are too high, or would they do it by indirect taxes?  If they do it by indirect taxes, then they would increase the consumer price index.  That is the choice which this country has to make.  Which form of taxation does it want?  If they want decreased taxation, that is fine as long as they take the logical consequence that they will have to do without many of the services and benefits which they now demand.  They will have to accept that democratically, or else there will be a revolution.</P>
      <P>There is a very big difference between the pattern of value-added tax now and what we inherited.  We inherited a system in which value-added tax was applied to food, clothing, footwear, oral medicines&mdash;items which are far more essential than the items to which value-added tax now attaches.  As far as the poor person is concerned food and clothing represent the much greater percentage of their budget and also the budget of better-off people.  We believe that we were right to bring in zero-rating for what are the more essential commodities of life and to increase the rates on the less essentials.  I would not dispute what Senator Yeats said about many of the items carrying value-added tax being regarded as necessary in our community with regard to our standard of living.  I am not saying that they are not necessary.  I am not calling them luxuries but there is nothing which is more important than food, clothing, fuel and so on and these are items which have been very significantly reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have preferred if the increase was not necessary.  I agree that there is a certain contradiction in part of what we did last year, but we are faced with the inevitable choice of increased direct <Col N="404" /> taxes or increases in other forms.  We went unapologetically for indirect taxes rather than direct taxes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the 4.5 per cent fall in the cost of living as a result of the mini-budget last year was not due entirely to VAT.  There were other factors.  Only part of it was VAT and, therefore, I think there is a more accurate comparison between VAT now and the increase which the Minister has suggested.  The basic point is that the Minister is constantly veering.  The first budget last year with increases in taxes increased the cost of living by 4 per cent.  The second budget last year with a decrease in taxes decreased the cost of living by 4 per cent.  The first budget this year brought about an increase of 5 or 6 per cent in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody has been told by the Minister precisely what the total increase as a result of his budget activities was&mdash;the direct increases imposed in the budget and the VAT coming after.  It must be at least 4 per cent. There is this complete change from moment to moment&mdash;up 4 per cent, down 4 per cent or whatever the figure is.  One just wonders what the purpose of this kind of policy is.  Obviously we cannot agree to the impositions in this section because they are totally inconsistent with previous Government policy, totally inconsistent with what is needed in this country and, certainly, totally inconsistent with any kind of wage restraint, which is quite clearly one of the things we need in this country at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask some questions on the various Schedules giving the various rates of VAT.  First of all, I should like to ask the Minister why he is so unwilling to give way to what appears to be the very general demand by the interests concerned that there should be a zero-rating of VAT in respect of newspapers and periodicals. <Col N="405" /> I know, of course, that newspapers and periodicals concerned are putting up a fairly active propaganda campaign. I suppose they count as a sort of pressure group in the same way as in any democratic State&mdash;there are pressure groups of all kinds&mdash;but it seems to me as an outsider in this matter, with no particular axe to grind one way or another, that with present day conditions, the extremely high cost of printing and paper, of all the activities relating to the production of newspapers and periodicals, there is a great deal to be said for the concept of relieving them of VAT altogether or simply zero-rating them.</P>
      <P>There are some things which are exempted from VAT which would appear to be somewhat less worthy than the production of newspapers and periodicals.  One finds, looking through this list, that there are 26 different items which are exempt altogether from VAT. Among them are such things as betting, lottery tickets, live horses, live greyhounds. One wonders what the reasons are for these being exempt from VAT. Newspapers and periodicals are clearly of great importance to the wellbeing of any democratic society, much more important to the community than the sale of greyhounds or live horses or even lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>I would be interested to know, therefore, why the Minister is so unyielding in this respect and why he is not willing to take this step which would appear to be reasonable, on the face of it, and certainly would not be revolutionary. When we first started VAT the Government of the day&mdash;reasonably, all things considered&mdash;took the line that this type of taxation was most easily administered and, on the whole, fairest all round if there were as few as possible exemptions and zero-ratings.  We now find there are 26 total exemptions and there are 20 items or groups of items which are zero-rated.  In these circumstances one wonders what the problem is about adding one more which would be beneficial to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should love to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the request to abolish value-added tax on newspapers.  The cost of doing so would be £2.8 million.  I have not yet received any suggestions as to <Col N="406" /> where the alternative £2.8 million should be found, and found it would have to be. Among the critics who are asking for the removal of the £2.8 million are many who are asking for increases in Government expenditure, critics of the size of the deficit and so on.  Of course, it is a very popular cause to espouse, a very unpopular one not to yield to. What is particularly unpleasant is the threat that has recently been issued that the voices of those who will not agree to the removal will be silenced.  This is wrong and I have seen observations from several responsible newspaper persons saying that the freedom of the Press should not be used to suppress views, that it would be wrong if it were used in that way.</P>
      <P>The difficulties of the newspaper industry in this country are not attributable to value-added tax and everybody knows that.  The difficulties of several enterprises and business in this and other counties are not attributable to taxation, but there is always a tendency to call upon taxation to provide the remedy.  That would be very nice if there was not a shortage of resources to meet the necessary Government expenditure. Everybody in this country knows there is that critical shortage of resources.</P>
      <P>There is one essential in value-added tax which must not be overlooked. Value-added tax is a tax on the consumer; it is not a tax on the manufacturer or the distributor but a tax on the end consumer.  If value-added tax is to be taken off any item, the Government would have to ensure that, as a consequence of the removal of the value-added tax, the benefit would pass on to the consumer.  That, in relation to newspapers, would mean the purchaser of newspapers.  It would be quite wrong and quite contrary to the whole tax code to tolerate a situation in which value-added tax would be removed from certain commodities and that the benefit would accrue to persons other than those who were previously paying tax, and that is the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is very honestly and maybe unpopularly answering the request but we cannot run away from that essential element of the whole situation&mdash;that VAT is a tax paid by the consumer <Col N="407" /> and its removal, therefore, would have to mean a reduction in the price of the service or commodity to consumers.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats lists a number of items which are not subject to value-added tax.  One of them is betting.  Betting, of course, is subject to an excise tax of 20 per cent.  One of the reasons some of the other items are not subject to value-added tax is because there is an import-export element in them which when they were subjected to tax led to a multiplicity of complications&mdash;when dogs and so on were exported from this country for races and they were reimported it led to a frightful amount of paper work and complexities.  I could give a variety of reasons for the exemptions of some other ones but they would not be related to this problem.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more anxious than I am or the Government are to see newspapers in this country overcome their present difficulties and, as far as the Government are concerned, they will give any help which is in their power in this direction; but the suggestion that value-added tax is the cause and the cure does not hold water.  Even if we were to remove it, the benefit would have to go to the consumer.  We did not impose value-added tax on newspapers; we inherited value-added tax on newspapers when we went into power.  While it is exhilarating in one way to see the change of heart on the part of Fianna Fáil, it is an awful pity that they began the value-added tax system by not exempting these papers.  They built into the tax system this £2.8 million which I cannot now release from the system until I have an assured and acceptable alternative form of tax which will not be regarded by the people as doing all the terrible things that every other form of tax I have mentioned in this Finance Bill is doing in the eyes of Senator Yeats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government did not build in £2.8 million because VAT at that time was 5 per cent; now it is 10 per cent, so the impact has doubled.  Apart from that, in the years since VAT was first introduced, as the Minister knows, newspapers and the entire printing world, including books, have gone through a very serious <Col N="408" /> inflationary problem.  The cost now of producing any kind of printing material is enormously greater than it was, say, five years ago.  There have been vast increases in costs.  Not only that, but as a result of the economic depression of the past few years, the amount of advertising available to newspapers and periodicals has gone down.</P>
      <P>The Minister speaks about handing on the proceeds of any reduction in VAT to the consumer.  I did not think that was the problem at all.  If newspapers and periodicals were relieved of VAT and were to hand back the proceeds to the consumer they would be no better off.  I understood the basis of their case was that they were either losing money or risk-inglosingmoney, and in many cases threatened with outright bankruptcy.</P>

The whole basis of their claim is that it is a burden on them and they need some kind of leeway to enable them either to make a profit where they are now having a loss or to make a reasonable profit where they are now just about breaking even.  There has been a very big change in the past few years which justifies their being given consideration which was not perhaps so vital a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about £2.8 million.  Of course, when we think of £2.8 million it sounds like a lot of money but if it is thought of in relation to some £1,300 million or £1,400 million being taken in taxation this year, the £2.8 million is quite small.  I suspect that if the Minister were to add to the betting tax which, for some reason he ignored in the recent budget, or included lottery tickets or made some effort to include live animals or live greyhounds&mdash;after all, all other live animals are included in VAT, but for some reason, greyhounds and live horses are exempted&mdash; one would imagine that without doing anyone any harm, the Minister would be able to get some of the £2.8 million <Col N="409" /> back.  However, I will leave that point, as the Minister does not appear to want to yield to the campaign that has been mounted.  I agree fully that the suggestion that politicians could be discriminated against on the basis that they support or oppose the case is quite outrageous, and I hope that no effort will be made to carry it out.  I agree with the Minister that it would be completely undemocratic.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled why the top rate of VAT, 40 per cent, is included in a rather curious way.  The only items which appear to be covered by this are radio receiving sets, television sets and so on, gramophones, radiograms and records.  I do not know why these should be regarded as much more luxurious than anything else.  I find that yachts are taxed at the rate of 10 per cent.  The man-in-the-street always thinks of the real luxury of the man who owns a yacht.  Yet he pays VAT at 10 per cent whereas the unfortunate man who buys a gramophone record or the young teenager who buys a record pays 40 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the reasoning behind this highly luxurious category given to people who like their music.</P>

      <P>The Senator spoke about items which are essential and items which are not.  I am sure he will not seriously disagree with me when I say that the items at 40 per cent are not as essential as food and clothing.  They are only an optional item and as such it is not inappropriate that they carry a higher duty than items which are more essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case anyone is in doubt about figures, I gave a figure of £2.8 million as the value-added tax on newspapers.  By that I mean what everybody understands as newspapers, the traditional Irish newspaper, but if value-added tax were removed from newspapers the exemption would apply to imported newspapers as well.  The £2.8 million would be the loss.  Senator Yeats mentioned magazines in his statement and I should like to say if it were removed from magazines it would cost an additional £1 million.  Once we enter into the area of magazines we have the difficulty of distinguishing between magazines and books&mdash;when does a <Col N="410" /> book cease to be a book and become a magazine and when does a magazine cease to be a magazine and become a newspaper?  This area would cause many problems.  The whole amount on those three items is £5 million.</P>
    <P>The Senators asked why yachts were at a lower rate of VAT.  The Senator might like to address the question to my predecessor because it was he who did it&mdash;in 1972 he reduced the rate on yachts.  However, I know the answer. The reason was that the very high rate on yachts here led to a situation in which a number of boatyards building yachts were placed in an uncompetitive position. It also led to a situation whereby people imported yachts from abroad without paying tax on them.  Yachts are items which are easily imported to an island and they need not be brought on to land.  A situation might then arise where yachts would be brought in and used around our shores which did not carry VAT.  That was the reason for the low rate&mdash;it was primarily in order to protect employment in Irish boatyards.</P>

      <P>With regard to the £2.8 million, I referred to newspapers and periodicals because they are set out in the Schedule, but obviously newspapers was the category I was interested in. I would not be particularly worried about the provision of periodicals.  A man who starts a periodical may gain or lose on a periodical and the world will not suffer unduly either way.  Newspapers are an important part of our democratic fabric.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, but for tax purposes they have to be lumped together.  Anything different would cause problems.  I was not suggesting that radio sets, television sets, records and so on were in the same category as food, but because something is charged at the rate of 20 per cent I was wondering why a special high rate was imposed. When I studied this Bill I thought I would find many items covered under the 40 per cent rate but one finds that it is exclusively for television sets, radio sets, gramophones and records, which <Col N="411" /> is odd.  One would have thought that there were other items which were more luxurious than those, even apart from yachts.  One would have thought that 20 per cent would have been sufficient for them.  When the Minister speaks about importing yachts from England, a much more realistic fact is that there are many people importing gramophone records.  In this connection the Minister has had representations from Irish record shops, that their trade is decreasing.  Anyone who can will get a record from England where they are much cheaper.  Presumably, they will continue to do this.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed by the Minister's point that his predecessor originally brought in this provision.  After all, this is the Minister's fifth budget and he should be able to stand on his own budgetary feet without referring all the time to his predecessor.  He has had five budgets in which to make up for any defects he may have found in his predecessor's activities.  I can understand why the Minister is concerned over this himself.  I was not criticising, just merely puzzled why those who are interested in music and television should be looked upon as luxurious types.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the meaning of section 68.  Does it mean that if a person lays up a car for a year and has no intention of using it he is nevertheless liable for excise duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility. The Act is framed in such a way that it requires the Minister for Local Government to make regulations which will provide for continuous liability.  Those regulations will then have to come before the Dáil and Seanad for approval, so an opportunity will arise for Members of both Houses to look at the details.  What we have in mind is to have continuous liability, but it would be possible to stay within certain provisions <Col N="412" /> where if a car is genuinely off the road and this can be established beyond all doubt, relief could be given. Obviously this would need to be very tight.  There is reason to believe that in respect of between 16 and 20 per cent of cars on the road current duty is not being paid.  The established motorist would like to see that terminated without punishing those who, legitimately and for good reason, have their cars off the road.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much about this Bill.  We have examined it in reasonable detail, allowing for the circumstances.  Its provisions, with their variety of forms of taxation, are not the kind of remedy the country needed in the present economic circumstances. Apart from their effect in directly raising the cost of living, they also make wage restraints impossible.  They must have the effect of reducing demand, of making the likelihood still more remote of economic recovery in the near future. The effect of this Bill will clearly not be to the benefit of this country.  We have done our best to criticise it.  In the circumstances it would be impossible to amend it in any way.  It is a reflection of the faulty economic outlook of the Government.  Even after all the taxes contained in this Bill, we still find that the borrowing, the current deficit and the other inflationary aspects of the <Col N="413" /> budget are even worse than they were before.  It has imposed very serious burdens on the community and on the future economic development of the community without in any way solving the financial problems that the Minister faced before he began framing it.  This is a budget which should not have been brought in.  It is one that will do the country no good.</P>

      <P>Despite the highly undesirable circumstances with which this Bill faced us, obviously one cannot object to the earlier signature motion. It is clear that constitutionally speaking the President has to sign it, but I reiterate that this is the sixth such motion since December.
