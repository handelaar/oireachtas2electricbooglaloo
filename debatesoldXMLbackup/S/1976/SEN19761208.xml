      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House what arrangements have been made for the inclusion of No. 9, The Family Planning Bill, in the Order of Business.  It will be agreed that, n latter months, this has been a very nder-worked Seanad.  The situation in elation to the whole question of amily planning has deteriorated rather han improved with the recent with hunt against the family planning leaflet. and the banning of it by the Censorship Board.  Could the Leader of the House give us an undertaking that he will interest himself in this matter and see that the Bill, which has been on the Order Paper since 1974 intermittently, will be taken today?</P>

      <P>If Senator Browne would have the courtesy to consult with me as the proposer of the Bill I could inform him that there are, in fact, active negotiations about the possibility of this Bill being taken before the Christmas vacation.  In view of that, I would suggest that if he wishes to raise the matter he should ask me about it beforehand so that I can inform him on these developments.</P>

      <P>I am an Independent Senator in this House, as I made clear on a previous occasion.  I do not take the party Whip from the Labour Party and have not done so since the beginning of this Oireachtas.  I might say in relation to patience, I have been pursuing this matter since about 1951, which is a period of 25 years.  Surely that can be called patience.</P>

We should get the precise information from the Leader of the House as to when we are likely to take the Bill.  I am glad to hear from Senator Robinson that negotiations are in train, but can the Leader of the House indicate precisely when we can have a debate on this issue?</P>

      <P>This should not be the subject of private negotiations.  This is an open forum.  This is an open Government, presumably.  We should know what is going on.  I personally propose to press the matter now unless I get an assurance from the Leader of the House.</P>

      <P>There is no question of stonewalling on this Bill.  I would be prepared to have a discussion and deal with the Bill today if that was the desire of the House.  As Senator Browne properly points out, this is an open forum.  He is perfectly entitled to raise this matter.  It is a question of opinion as to whether or not he has shown discourtesy to Senator Robinson in not speaking to her about it first.  I recognise, of course, as Senator Browne has pointed out, that he does not take the Labour Party Whip.  Whatever his association or should I say liaison with the Labour Party, apparently it is not recognised by the House.  There is no question of stonewalling as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>The undertaking I gave on the last occasion was that the attention of the Tánaiste would be called to the views expressed in the House.  The Government Whip here has, in fact, called the attention of the Tánaiste to the views which were expressed and, when arrangements are made suitable to him and to the proposer of the motion to have the Bill discussed here, I will be prepared to move it on the Order of Business.  Senator Browne is quite alive to his rights and if others want to move it at any other time they are perfectly free to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the County of Louth and Borough of Drogheda (Boundaries) Provisional Order, 1976, which was made by me on 19th October last.  The order provides for the extension of the boundary of the Borough of Drogheda to take in part of County Louth and part of County Meath, a total area of 1,715 acres approximately.  This includes about 100 acres of tidal or marsh land. The extension of the boundary of Drogheda involves a consequential alteration of the boundary of County Louth in order to include the area transferred from County Meath to Drogheda Borough.  Both extensions are provided for in this provisional order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for alteration of the boundary of a county or borough is governed by Articles 25 and 27 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898.  Petitions were received by me from Drogheda Corporation and Louth County Council.  There was a public inquiry at which all interested parties were afforded an opportunity to express their views.  Having considered the report of the public inquiry, I reached a decision on the matter which is now formalised in the provisional order but <Col N="853" /> cannot become effective until confirmed by an Act of the Oireactas.</P>
    <P>I hope to have the present legislation enacted before the Christmas Recess so that the extension will come into force as from 1st January, 1977.  This, being the beginning of the financial year, is the date most suitable for the local authorities and the one which will cause least inconvenience for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The main case made by the corporation in support of their petition was that the existing area of the borough &mdash;1,486 acres&mdash;was totally inadequate to meet development needs.  While I was satisfied on the basis of the evidence given at the inquiry and the report of the inspector who conducted it that there was a case for an extension, I did not feel that a boundary extension on the scale sought was justified.  This would have involved an increase of some 4,189 acres, or almost three times as much as the existing area of the borough.  The areas of land being added to the borough under the provisional order amount to less than half the acreage sought by the corporation but, nevertheless, the increase to a total of 3,201 acres involves more than a doubling of the existing area of Drogheda.</P>
    <P>The areas being added to the borough under the provisional order are contiguous to the existing borough boundary and extend north of the River Boyne into County Louth and southwards into County Meath.  Parts of these areas are becoming both residential and industrial suburbs of Drogheda, and it is desirable for the proper planning and orderly development of the areas that they be brought under the control of the corporation.  The extension of the boundary will help the corporation to play even a more positive role as a development authority under the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1975.  When the boundary extension is effected, I would expect that Drogheda Corporation, as a matter of urgency, would review their development plan and, perhaps, bring forward an entirely new plan, as they are now specifically enabled to do under the Local Government (Planning and <Col N="854" /> Development) Act, 1976, to meet the needs of the expanded area.</P>
    <P>The necessity for an extension of the borough boundary is evident from the fact that Drogheda, a compact and densely developed town, is already compelled to overspill the existing borough boundary to find accommodation for essential development.  Indeed, for quite some time now, Drogheda Corporation have had to seek land outside of the borough to meet their statutory obligations.  The extension of the boundary will bring within the borough existing overspill development as well as providing for future population growth and development needs. The population of the borough increased from 17,909 in 1966 to 19,762 at the 1971 Census and has continued to increase since then.  The population of the area now being added to Drogheda is estimated to be of the order of 2,000, occupying some 500 houses.  About 200 of these are houses built by Drogheda Corporation, mostly in the area being transferred from Meath.</P>
    <P>The order contains a number of provisions which are consequential on the extension.  These are along the usual lines and provide for the preparation of official maps of the altered boundaries of the three areas involved, the continuation in effect of resolutions and orders, as appropriate, arrangements in regard to registers of electors, bye-laws, hours of trading orders, polling districts, development plans and any necessary financial adjustments as between the three authorities in relation to property, debts and liabilities.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the order is the provision&mdash;in article 16 and the Second Schedule&mdash;relating to existing ratepayers in the areas being added to the borough.  These ratepayers will be cushioned against increases in their rates bills by the provision for phasing-in arrangements which ensure that the rise to Drogheda rate levels will take place over a 15-year period. These arrangements have been so designed that ratepayers in the area being transferred who were liable for rates in the current year, will pay in 1977 only that proportion of the <Col N="855" /> Drogheda rate which the rates in their present rating area bore to the Drogheda rate in 1976; this proportion is 61 per cent in the case of the Meath ratepayers and 68 per cent in the case of the Louth ratepayers.  It will be 1993 before these ratepayers are liable for full Drogheda rates.  These generous phasing-in arrangements, coupled with the decision, which was given legal effect in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1976, to continue the agricultural grant reliefs on land being transferred to urban areas, provide a very considerable easement for ratepayers who otherwise might have found themselves paying much higher rates as a consequence of the boundary extension.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I ask for the co-operation of Senators in ensuring that it will have a speedy passage so that the boundary extension can become effective on 1st January next.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. This is a sensible measure.  Obviously the proper procedures have been undertaken in regard to it on foot of petitions from the Drogheda and County Louth authorities.  There is just one matter I should like to mention.  I feel very strongly that this should be pushed&mdash;I know it has to be pushed at local level by way of petition&mdash;generally throughout the country in areas similar to the Drogheda experience.  I am thinking in particular of the town I come from, Athlone, which is an obvious area where this sort of initiative could be taken.  Clonmel is another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towns which are major development centres on county boundaries have this particular problem which Drogheda has to a greater or lesser degree.  We have been too conservative heretofore in having to observe distinctions between urban authorities there and the contiguous local authorities.  This has led to a very real impediment in regard to development of the urban authorities concerned where the overspill occurs in two separate local authority areas. Especially with the conception of the urban authority being the dynamic authority, which they are inevitably <Col N="856" /> with the movement from the land into urban centres, initiatives of this kind should be taken generally throughout the country.  I appreciate that the Minister has cushioned the ratepayers in this respect, and rightly so, because this is the only argument at local level against any move of this kind.  The obvious argument against it is that it does lead to a higher rate-paying capacity, unless there is a postponement or a staging of payment of rates such as is proposed in this instance.</P>
    <P>There is no objection so far as I am concerned here.  I just wish to say that as a general principle I should like to see this sort of approach being adopted in other growing urban centres with development problems as in Drogheda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to extend a welcome to this legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on moving so expeditiously in finalising this matter. For the information of Members of the Seanad, this petition was originally made back in 1969 by both Drogheda Corporation and Louth County Council and it has taken a considerable length of time&mdash;seven years in all&mdash;for it to reach this final stage.  I congratulate the Minister on finalising it.</P>
      <P>There is an addition of 1,170 people coming in from County Meath into County Louth.  The fact that this is double the population figure indicated in the original petition gives an example of what has happened with the passage of time since the petition was first submitted.  We are presented more or less with a <i>fait accompli</i> in that many of these people having already been housed by Drogheda Corporation, technically they are now being brought under the umbrella of County Louth.  The needs of Drogheda in this regard were first highlighted when Drogheda Corporation drew up their statutory development plan under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and they saw what the future needs of the town would be in regard to area extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When all is said and done, this Bill is concerned not only with people but with the area involved, because Drogheda has had to suffer under some physical constraints as regards its own <Col N="857" /> natural development and expansion. On one side it is bounded by the sea and river and on another side it is bounded by the extensive quarryings carried on by Cement Limited.  Some geographical features of land in other areas are not suitable to commercial residential development.  So the area into which the corporation could extend their boundaries was limited.  The result is that we are extending somewhat south into County Meath and north into County Louth.  In brief, it has been closed off as regards the east, particularly, and the south-east and north-east due to the features I mentioned.</P>
    <P>What happened was that Drogheda Corporation found themselves with practically no uncommitted building land left within their existing borough boundary.  Their plan, drawn up in the sixties, foresaw that they would have certain needs, residential and commercial and as regards open spaces, because of a rapidly increasing population. That population has grown tremendously over the past two decades. It rose from a figure of 17,000 in 1966 to over 20,000 in the early seventies, and at the latter date the population density was 12 persons per acre.  The best experts in the economic and social fields have made a population projection of something between 30,000 to 35,000 by the mid-1980s.  Therefore, we can see the urgent requirement of Drogheda Corporation to have sufficient land under their jurisdiction without further delay.</P>
    <P>The manufacturing content in Drogheda has contributed largely to this increase in population.  In the old days Drogheda had a traditional industrial base of milling, food processing and textiles.  Over the past ten years in particular this industrial base has widened considerably.  It now embraces such features as the manufacture of household equipment, medical instruments and hydraulics equipment.  This considerable expansion in its industrial activity and its population created a situation whereby Drogheda Corporation were forced to expand into County Meath without waiting for this legislation to come into effect.  The best example of this is St. Finian's Park, a <Col N="858" /> housing area developed by Drogheda Corporation and which embraces many of the people in the County Meath area now coming into the Drogheda Corporation area.</P>
    <P>Drogheda Corporation also put a considerable amount of work into their new traffic plan.  The most recent achievement is the new Boyne bridge, the Bridge of Peace, which was the focal point of the peace march last weekend. The Harbour Commissioners have also set about devising development plans and propositions for the harbour.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points to which the Minister might be able to give us some answers when he is replying. There is the question of compensation. The 1971 White Paper on Local Government Organisation referred to this question of compensation in such extensions of boundaries as here and threw cold water on that idea.  I should like the Minister to say whether this question of compensation has been negotiated by the relevant authorities. Since we have not had any changes in the boundaries of a number of borough councils in recent years, this is a question which should be decided in this case and for any future extensions.</P>
    <P>This question of compensation arises both in County Louth and County Meath, principally I would say in County Louth, because of the total acreage involved in County Louth.  The original petition set out that 1,147 acres were being sought in County Louth and the corporation have obtained 1,000 of this requested figure.  In the case of Meath there has been a considerable shortfall and only about 700 acres approximately of the original 3,040 requested are coming in.  This may well lead to an agrument in future, with one side saying enough has been given and the other saying enough has not been given.  If the projections of population and industrial growth in Drogheda are borne out at all we may have to come back for a further extension.  That could mean seeking more land from County Meath.</P>
    <P>There will be consequential effects of this legislation.  These will be seen in regard to the vocational education committee.  A certain financial adjust ment may be required as regards their <Col N="859" /> rating requirements.  Also there may well be consequential adjustment required in regard to legislation on unemployment assistance, Valuations Act, housing regulations, Jurors and Registers of Electors Acts.  The Minister indicated in his speech that a number of these matters will be met.  The most pleasing will be the phasing of the rate impost on the Meath people coming into Drogheda Corporation area.  This will be appreciated very much and I thank the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>We are concerned here with a town which has had significant and exceptional growth in the past two decades. This Bill will enable it to continue that expansion.  I should like to welcome the people of County Meath who are coming into County Louth.  They have long regarded Drogheda as being the focal point of their commercial, social and recreational life and many enjoy the amenities and services provided by the corporation.  I do not think they will see any great change by coming under the umbrella of County Louth.  I welcome them and congratulate the Minister for introducing this Bill so expeditiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot welcome this order with the same enthusiasm as Senators Lenihan and Markey.  I can understand Senator Markey's welcome because Drogheda is doing quite well out of this.  Having heard Senator Markey I feel that a better solution to this problem would have been to transfer Drogheda into County Meath.  Senator Markey has pointed out, and rightly so, that Drogheda cannot expand east because of the sea, and he is not too happy about the suitability of the land north of Drogheda, which is in County Louth and is the area into which Drogheda would be expanding.  On the west Senator Markey mentioned that they have the problem of the cement works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally Drogheda Corporation sought 4,189 acres.  They are getting 1,715, which Senator Markey said is <Col N="860" /> about 700 acres in County Meath and 1,000 in County Louth.  Is it not obvious that somebody will be back here in a few years looking for more of County Meath?  It is obvious that quite a large portion of County Meath will be in the Drogheda Corporation area within the next 30 years if this expansion continues.  While I listened to Senator Markey welcome the people of Meath into County Louth, I regret that a number of County Meath people will now become Louth people.  It will be interesting to see what flag they will wave in Croke Park when Meath and Louth meet in a Leinster championship&mdash;we all know the rivalry there.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey talked about the White Paper and said that compensation should not be given.  Meath County Council will have to be treated generously in regard to the transfer of this area of County Meath.  Hugh sums of money have been spent in the development of that area.  We shall be dealing with this in legislation later, but I hope the Minister will ensure that Meath County Council and the ratepayers of County Meath will be generously treated for the development achieved in the area now being transferred.  If there are any more requests for land in County Meath for the extension of the Drogheda boundary we, in Meath, shall be making a request that Drogheda come into County Meath, when we would be more generous with them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into this argument between Counties Louth and Meath.  There are many such instances all over the country where, say, half a town would be in one county and the other half in an adjacent county.  I am primarily concerned that in the additional development around Drogheda&mdash;and I am glad to see towns like Drogheda developing&mdash;the Minister would ensure that there would be a wide route provided so that we in Cavan can get our manufactured goods to the ports.  We have been pressing for years to have something done about the road into County Dublin.  We have now turned our attention to Greenore and Drogheda.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a few questions on this Bill.  This type of boundary extension comes up every so often.  It is the first time I have seen it come before the Oireachtas as a Bill.  Senators may remember that about five or six years ago there was a most unholy squabble in Cork over a boundary extension, where the county council adamantly refused to allow the corporation to extend into the county. Seemingly it can be done, according to this Bill, on the application of the relevant authority&mdash;in this case, Drogheda Corporation.  They may apply and the Minister can make an order if he so wishes.  Is that the case or not?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a similar case arising in my own area in Waterford city where there is great need for the city to expand into Waterford and Kilkenny counties.  Perhaps the Minister would outline the procedure to be adopted in that case.  Generally speaking the county authorities and the county public representatives feel that, if the city take over this area, which already is partly built up, the city will benefit by receiving rates on that property.  Of course rates on buildings are considerably greater than those on land.  There could be a bone of contention on a matter like this.  I should like to know what compensation a county authority receive where the corporation takes over property or is given authority to take it over by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister would explain some of those points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also.  It is a reaffirmation by the Minister of the importance he attaches to corporations and urban councils.  I welcome the Bill for another reason, in that it can be interpreted as being the only sensible reaction to a situation <Col N="862" /> where you have a town like Drogheda expanding and, as it were, bursting at the seams.  There are many towns, as Senator Lenihan pointed out, with the same type of problem.</P>
      <P>I come from Ballina&mdash;I must be very careful here as I am a county councillor as well as being an urban councillor&mdash; and it is not very easy to talk about robbing Peter to pay Paul.  We have much the same problem in that we have thank God, industrial expansion and population expansion in the area.  We have not got the facility to provide enough land for the building of houses and so on.  The result of that is, to my mind, is allowing ribbon development to take place along national primary and national secondary roles in and out of town.</P>
      <P>Now, if towns had an adequate supply of building land they could develop these lands in depth&mdash;these sites&mdash;and draw proper plans within town boundaries.  What is happening at the moment in many towns is that county councils have a responsibility for planning on the periphery of the town. Naturally the county council are very jealous of revenue accruing to them from these developments and the questions of compensation comes in&mdash;I think it always did.  In many cases what is happening is that the towns are providing to these housing developments water and sewerage services as extensions to their own system.  There is nothing accruing to them for the provision of these services in the county areas.  I am not saying that we should have two distinct authorities within a county with no liaison or co-operation. I think there is room for more co-operation between urban councils, corporations and county councils.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to outline the procedure to be adopted in furnishing a petition for an extension to the boundary because, as far as I am concerned, Ballina Urban Council will be seeking an extension to their urban area in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the House for the way in which they received the Bill.  There are a number of points which have been raised and I will <Col N="863" /> try to deal with them very briefly.  I think I should get one out of the way immediately, that is, that there is no power to provide for compensation for added burden on the extension of an area except in the case of a county borough extension.  There is no power whatever to provide for such compensation for the extension of an ordinary corporation or an ordinary county.</P>
      <P>This extension had a number of peculiar things about it, the most difficult one being the fact that it extended into two counties.  I could see easily enough the reason why there would be no objection, or not much objection, by people in the Drogheda area who are in County Louth having the borough extended into portion of County Louth.  County Louth people might have a different view, but this simply meant that they were remaining in the county.  There was considerable opposition from people in County Meath.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald, who is chairman of Meath County Council, is aware of this.  I can understand his point of view here.  As a matter of interest, I was a member of Meath County Council when this was introduced first.  Lest somebody else raise the matter here, my comment then was that they should not be given an inch, the main reason being that Drogheda Corporation and Louth County council, instead of approaching Meath County Council and asking if an extension could be negotiated, without consulting them made the application direct to the then Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In matters of this kind it would be far better if the first discussions took place between the local authorities themselves.  I am quite sure that the members of Meath County Council, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation might have reached almost the same conclusion as I have now reached, with very much less cost, had it been done in that way. I was particularly annoyed that it had <Col N="864" /> not been dealt with in that way.  However, the legal manner in which it was dealt with was perfectly correct.  The petition was entered, a public inquiry was held and eventually recommendations were made.</P>
      <P>I am in the position of being perhaps the hurler on the ditch in this case.  I live within two miles of the boundary&mdash;in County Meath, of course.  From there I am aware not alone of the necessity for an extension of Drogheda&mdash;there is no doubt that Drogheda needed to extend its area&mdash; but also of the objections of people living in County Meath being put within the borough boundary of Drogheda.  The first was that they and their forefathers having lived in County Meath did not want to be moved into another county without moving their residence.  Secondly, they felt it would vastly increase their rates. I could not do anything about the first objection but I have taken steps to ensure that the second one is eased and that there will not be a big extra impost on rates.  This is a step forward everybody welcomes.</P>
      <P>The question of when the next extension will be looked for has been mentioned here by one or two people, particularly by Senator Markey.  He should remember that the last one&mdash; when the Boyne divided Meath and Louth as far as I can remember&mdash; was in 1898.  If this one lasts for 78 years, we shall have another look at it then.  Senator J. Fitzgerald and I will take a hard look at it when it arises again.</P>

      <P>They will continue to vote in Meath.  The matter is of some disturbance to me because I have not been responsible for putting them into County Louth.  Their views on the matter might not be what they were previously.  There is nothing I can do about that.  It is true that Drogheda Corporation built a very substantial number of local authority houses in County Meath.  They are now going into County Louth.  It is only right that <Col N="865" /> the residents of these houses will be voting in the Drogheda Corporation elections and that they should be transferred into County Louth at the earliest possible time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The next time the boundaries on the constituencies are being changed they will have to go into County Louth; this whole area will have to go into County Louth.  In the meantime, they are in County Meath. It is of interest that a very good hotel is involved in this and a number of Drogheda factories are, in fact, in County Meath&mdash;they were built in County Meath&mdash;and will now be going into Drogheda.  The extension does not include the new cement factory. Drogheda Corporation rather slipped up there.  They did not take a good look at where the cement factory was going or I am quite sure they would have included it, because it is only about half a mile outside the boundary they sought.  But, while they have not got all the extra land they wanted, I think they did not expect to get it all. As a matter of fact, I think they are surprised that they did get so much, because the additional amount of land they have got is very great.  All I can say to them is that, if they succeed in building on the additional amount of land so that they can make the same case again, then I am sure that when they have another thousand acres built on an application to extend again will be fairly favourably considered.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that in the discussion document I issued on Local Government, it was recognised that the pace of urban development makes it necessary to speed up the process of boundary adjustments.  I undertook to introduce legislation providing for a simplified and comprehensive system of boundary adjustment applicable to all local authorities.  The question of simplification of the law relating to boundary extensions is one of the matters included in a general Local Government Bill being prepared at present in my Department.  I hope to have that Bill before the Oireachtas sometime before the end of the next parliamentary session, some time before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> It is only right that we should have some way of dealing with boundary extensions other than the one we have at present.  The present one is ridiculous. The fact that it costs so much is a very strong argument against it.  Along with quite a number of other adjustments which should be made in local government law, the question of adjustment of borough boundaries will be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as Waterford is concerned, if the county borough want an extension now it is for them to initiate proceedings by presenting a petition to the Minister.  At present I cannot take the initiative in a matter of this kind. Obviously before presenting the petition as much agreement as possible should be sought locally, because it is ridiculous that we have this question of people almost at war with each other.</P>
    <P>There is a situation in Limerick where Limerick Corporation, Limerick County Council and Clare County Council are involved.  So far it has been difficult to get them even to talk to each other about it.  This is wrong.  Even if they agree to differ on some issues, there must be scope for a very large measure of agreement between them on points which will have to be dealt with eventually when the boundary is being extended.  Those should be cleared away.  Every point cleared will make the extension of the boundary easier and cheaper.  That is the important thing. After the new legislation has been passed everything will be dealt with in a more simplified way.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of rates, the agreement reached by this House and in the Dáil earlier this year when the rates on Agriculture Land Bill was passed, together with the provision in the provisional order means that for all ratepayers in the transferred area, the increase will be phased over a 15-year period.</P>
    <P>Those were the points raised.  I am very grateful for the way in which the House has dealt with this problem.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> The purpose of this Bill is to enable additional assistance to be given from public funds towards the cost of connecting some isolated houses in rural Ireland to the electricity supply.</P>
      <P>Rural electrification was first commenced in 1946 under the provisions of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, which authorised capital expenditure by the ESB on the scheme.  In the past 30 years some 420,000 houses have been connected to the rural network at a total cost of about £80 million, some £27 million of which represents State subsidy, the balance being met by the ESB.  The total of 420,000 houses represents some 98-99 per cent of all rural houses and compares favourably with the connection rate elsewhere.  In Britain and the USA the connection rate is believed to be about 98 per cent and 98.4 per cent respectively, whilst on the Continent generally the connection rate is somewhat less.  It is only in countries such as Germany and, possibly Switzerland and Sweden, that the connection rate in rural areas exceeds the 98-99 per cent level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is known as the final phase of the rural electrification scheme was undertaken over the four years, 1971-75, to give every unconnected house in rural Ireland a final opportunity of obtaining electricity supply on subsidised terms.  The programme was well publicised and at some stage during the four-year period every rural householder then unconnected to the electricity supply had an opportunity of obtaining electricity supply on subsidised terms.  The final phase was officially closed on 31st March 1975, that is, <Col N="872" /> no further applications for subsidised supply were accepted after that date, but subsidised terms have yet to be quoted by the board to applicants in a few areas while construction work remains to be done in these and some other areas.  However, all householders in each of these areas where work remains to be done, whether already quoted terms or not, who applied and qualified for subsidised supply before 31st March 1975, will still get supply on subsidised terms.</P>
    <P>Under the final phase of the rural electrification scheme the board looked for the very modest rate of return of 5.2 per cent on their capital outlay or investment in providing supply to each house.  The board were prepared to meet, subject to a limit of £750, the capital cost of providing supply to any house or premises.  If the applicant's ordinary annual fixed charge which every consumer pays&mdash;usually about £12 per annum or so in rural Ireland&mdash; was not sufficient to cover 5.2 per cent of the cost of connection, the applicant was required to pay what was known as a special service charge.  The amount of the special service charge in any one case was the difference between the ordinary fixed charge and the sum representing 5.2 per cent of the cost of connecting the house in question.  For example, if a house cost £500 to connect, the ESB would look for a return of £26 per annum, that is 5.2 per cent on their investment of £500.  With a fixed charge of, say, £12 per annum, this would mean that the special service charge payable by the applicant would be £14 per annum in six two-monthly instalments of £2.33 each.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In those cases where the cost of connecting a house exceeded £750 the board required the prospective consumer to meet by way of lump sum payment part of the cost of connection, as determined by the board.  This lump sum payment was known as a capital contribution and, in effect, represented the non-recoverable part of the connection costs above £700 which would arise in the event of the consumer refusing or ceasing to take supply <Col N="873" /> shortly after having the house connected. The ESB adopted this arrangement in the light of working experience.</P>
      <P>During the final phase of the scheme some householders, mainly in the Black Valley area of County Kerry and the Ballycroy area of County Mayo, found themselves unable to accept the board's offer of subsidised terms, involving payment by them of substantial sums by way of capital contribution. Precise figures of the number of such householders are not readily available but the ESB have estimated that, in all, there are some 800-900 such householders in these and other isolated areas.  This is not a definitive figure as there are also individual houses in this category here and there throughout the country and the final total may well be more than the ESB estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While any scheme of rural electrification will throw up anomalies, the plight of the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders is probably the worst of the unresolved anomalies revealed at the closure of the final phase of the scheme.  These householders can reasonably be regarded as unfortunate in that, through no fault of their own, they live in areas where the cost of connecting them to the electricity supply, even under subsidised terms, is substantial.  The cost of connection under normal economic or unsubsidised terms would of course be very much higher.  All, or nearly all, of the houses in question were built when proximity to the electricity supply was not an obvious factor to be taken into consideration when selecting a site for a dwelling.  The practical effect of the Black Valley and Ballycroy householder's inability to accept the subsidised terms of supply offered to them in 1971-75 is that they do not now have available to them a service which is widely regarded as a basic amenity of life.  They represent, by and large, the hard core or outstanding balance still remaining of the unconnected rural houses which the subsidised rural electrification scheme was intended to benefit.  To leave them unconnected to the rural network now would, to some extent at least, vitiate the whole purpose of the rural electrification <Col N="874" /> scheme which was to bring the benefits of electricity to all parts of rural Ireland.  The scheme was not limited, and was not intended to be limited, only to the parts of the country where connection was relatively inexpensive.</P>
    <P>The Government are in all the circumstances prepared to recommend approval to the provision of additional moneys to enable the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders, as well as others in the same category throughout the country, to obtain electricity supply on terms comparable by and large with those generally available to applicants under the final phase&mdash;1971-75&mdash; of the scheme, but with a special concession in relation to payment of capital contributions.  Briefly, what is in effect proposed in this Bill is that these householders, that is, the householders who refused supply under the final phase of the scheme because of the requirement to pay capital contributions, will be given a further and final opportunity to obtain supply on subsidised terms, but this time without having to pay a capital contribution. In so far as provision of supply to them is concerned, they will only have to pay an annual or standing charge of £36.40 in six two-monthly instalments. This standing charge, which may from time to time be subject to review by the ESB in accordance with the board's normal criteria for review of fixed charges, is inclusive of both the usual fixed charge and the special service charge; if there is no review by the board the standing charge remains unaltered.</P>
    <P>Apart from charges for electricity consumed or for instalment payments, if any, in relation to electrical appliances and so on that may arise, no other charges will be payable by them.  The appropriate capital contributions which these householders would otherwise have had to pay to the ESB under subsidised terms will be paid on their behalf to the board out of the Vote for my Department.  At this stage it is not possible to indicate with certainty the aggregate of all such capital contributions, because costs of connection are rising all the time, but the sum of £300,000 being provided in the Bill <Col N="875" /> should meet the requirements of the scheme.</P>
    <P>This is a once-for-all scheme of limited application intended to deal with a special case of localised hardship which, because of the nature and extent of the anomaly revealed under the final phase&mdash;1971-75&mdash;of the rural electrification scheme, merits special consideration.  To eliminate all anomalies in a scheme of rural electrification which covered the whole of the country would be a virtually impossible task and involve an unacceptable drain on the Exchequer.  In taking steps to eliminate this anomaly the Government consider that they are going as far as they can reasonably go in all the circumstances.  Government expenditure on rural electrification down the years has been in the aggregate very substantial and further expenditure other than that now proposed could not be justified.</P>
    <P>The details of the proposed scheme are now being worked out but, broadly speaking, what is envisaged is that a reasonable period will be set during which applications from the householders in question for benefit under the scheme will be accepted by the ESB who will then proceed as quickly as possible to provide supply, after issue and acceptance of quotations, which will not include capital contributions. When the work has been finished subsidisation of electricity supply in rural areas will then finally come to an end and normal economic or unsubsidised terms of supply will apply from then on.</P>
    <P>While I must, because of Exchequer constraints, set my face against any further extension of the rural electrification scheme, I am very conscious of the heavy financial burden which can be involved on householders, both persons building new houses as well as existing householders not already connected, in meeting the cost of connecting their houses to the electricity supply.  I am, therefore, pleased that, in order to ameliorate such burden, the ESB at my request agreed to introduce a scheme of deferred payments for costs of connection to the electricity supply in cases where subsidised <Col N="876" /> terms are not available.  Details of the scheme which came into operation on 1st December have already been published and I must commend the board for agreeing to an arrangement of this kind which will go a long way towards easing the financial burden sometimes involved in obtaining electricity supplies.</P>
    <P>I might also add my voice to the board's appeal to persons proposing to build new houses for prior consultation with their local ESB office before deciding on sites for their new houses.  In very many cases consultation beforehand with the board can result in considerable financial savings. As Senators no doubt readily appreciate, the cost of connection of any new house to the electricity supply is largely determined by its location in relation to the nearest electricity distribution centre.  In recent months the board have been at pains to emphasise this, and to encourage prospective new householders to inquire beforehand as to the cost of providing electricity before irrevocable commitments as to erection of new houses are entered into.  I can only endorse the board's appeal and reiterate the importance of prior consultation with the board's local office in all cases where erection of new houses is contemplated.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes provision to enable the ESB to submit to me schemes amending the general employees and manual workers superannuation schemes to provide improved superannuation benefits for persons retiring from or being discharged by, the board on grounds of ill health.  This provision is being added to bring the ESB superannuation schemes into line with recent similar improvements in the Civil Service superannuation code.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like first to say that there is no objection as far as we are concerned to this Bill which is really a culminating effort on the part of the Government to deal finally with the important work as far as rural Ireland was concerned that was embarked on in 1945&mdash;the rural electrification programme announced under the Act of that year and intensified under <Col N="877" /> the Act of 1971 continuing up to 1975. As the Minister mentioned, there were these two particular anomalies in areas: the Black Valley area in County Kerry and the Ballycroy area of County Mayo where, because of the remoteness involved, a very real cost problem existed.  We have £300,000 provided under this Bill to deal with these areas, on the basis of the capital cost of connection exceeding £700.</P>
      <P>This provision is welcome because of the remoteness of the two areas concerned of which I am well aware, knowing them through various political and social procedures over the years. This is welcome as a final addition to the programme of rural electrification which undoubtedly has done more to revitalise rural Ireland than any other single scheme.  One may talk about redistribution of land and talk <i>ad infinitum</i> on the various measures which could be required to revitalise social living in rural Ireland but the most fundamental area, both from the social point of view and the practical business point of view, was rural electrification. The social point of view was obvious in giving basic amenities to rural homes. In regard to the business point of view, the very provision of electricity to rural homes made possible the up-to-date milking and other facilities needed to make the farmyard and the area around the rural home an efficient farm industrial unit.  In that area electricity was very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress, as mentioned by the Minister, has been very real and very creditable.  The figures bear repetition. We have 98 per cent to 99 per cent of all rural homes connected.  This is a fantastic development compared with the connection rate in other countries. It reflects on the interest and the basic capacity of the rural population.  This has been, since the inauguration of the scheme in 1946 and since its intensification in 1971, one of the great social developments of our time.  It has been so fundamental that other schemes and other ideas for the improvement of rural life pale in comparison.  I am glad to see that the Minister is dealing with the two outstanding areas where because of their remoteness there was a <Col N="878" /> real problem from the finance point of view.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Minister in his new capacity as Minister for Transport and Power and to congratulate him on his appointment.  I and my party consider him to be fully fitted for the task he has undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill.  It is an expression of the commitment of the Government to ameliorating the difficulties of people in less well-off areas.  The two areas mentioned in the Bill are Ballycroy in County Mayo and the Black Valley in County Kerry.  As the Minister has said in his speech, they are the less well-off areas.  The areas mentioned in the Bill are Ballycroy in County Mayo and the Black Valley in Kerry.  As the Minister said in his speech, the residents in these areas through no fault of their own have found themselves incapable of meeting the cost of providing themselves with electricity.  The onus is on the Government to see to it that these people get what is their right in equality with other people all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect of the Minister's speech which has very important implications also is his statement that the ESB will now accept payment of lump sum charges on a deferred payment scheme for other parts of the country. We all know of people who come to us in our capacity as Senators asking us to do something for them because of the bills that have been presented to them by the ESB seeking a capital contribution towards the cost of providing them with power.  I have seen bills in my area of up to £2,200.  When one considers the cost of housing and the problems which young people have in providing and paying for new houses, this is an intolerable burden on them.  They cannot and should not be expected to pay the full cost in lump sum form of providing themselves with electricity. This new scheme will be welcomed by many people who are faced with big bills, which in many cases they did not give any thought to initially when they were providing their houses.  They thought of the price of the site, of a contract price, rates and so on, but they <Col N="879" /> did not give any thought up to now of ESB charges.  Many people thought that up to now the subsidised scheme still existed.  Overall this is what might be regarded as an enlightened approach to a very dark problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to Seanad Éireann.  It is his first visit as Minister for Transport and Power and I wish him well in his new office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>A small Bill such as this gives us the opportunity to have a look at the excellent work the ESB have done since they were founded and especially since the 1945 Act.  Nothing has happened in the history of the State that has the same importance as the rural electrification scheme so far as rural Ireland is concerned.  It has made it possible for factories to be established in very remote parts of the country.  It has contributed immensely to the welfare of the farming community and has been a great social amenity in many ways.  We would be very backward as a new country in the EEC were it not for the foresight of the Government in those days in seeing to it that rural electrification was extended as far as possible over the whole country.  It is only fair to pay a special tribute to the ESB personnel, their engineers and workmen, because they did a magnificent job in record time.  The figures the Minister has given compare favourably with much richer countries.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in any scheme it can happen that there will be pockets left out.  Appeals have been made on many occasions to people in any such pockets to send in their applications, but very often some are rather hesistant to do this and others may not read the papers carefully.  Consequently, it transpired that some pockets were left out, as indeed were some individual houses.  In many cases the individual houses were occupied by old people.  This situation was attributable to the very high rate of emigration.  All the members of a family could be living in America while the old people were left at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the cost, the way we treat our old people is vitally important, and I know that electricity will be a great consolation to them in their old age.  It will be of great benefit in providing <Col N="880" /> many necessary amenities for them.  I would like to see them being provided with this amenity if they are anxious for it.  It would enable them to have wireless sets or television sets.  There is no use in saying that an old age pensioner is entitled to a free television licence if he has not the current to enable him to have a set.  He might as well be offered a free trip on a Concorde.  I would make a special appeal on behalf of those people.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have rural electrification has enabled farmers to install water and provide many amenities that are vital in this day and age in rural homes.  From the tourist point of view this scheme has put us on a high level and has enabled many rural houses to join the various schemes for enticing tourists and fishermen into areas to which they would not come otherwise. They find our standard of living and standard of cleanliness second to none by virtue of the fact that piped water and water from deep-bore wells is available, thanks to the ESB, in most homes in the country.  That is how it should be.</P>
    <P>In my area very often the ESB lines run along the Six Counties.  On previous occasions I happened to be successful in getting some connections made from here for residents in the Six Counties. The same scheme would apply from the other area.  The ESB have no legal power to erect transformers in the Six Counties but they have been very helpful in so far as the transformer situation would allow.  This co-operation is important so far as ESB power is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably be looking at the various sources of power to carry the extra loads that may be needed to keep the supply adequate.  He will have another look at water supplies or some other means of providing power apart from imported oil which costs a lot&mdash;both to the ESB and to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and, as a Cavan man, I welcome the Minister in his new position.  I am glad to see him here.  I know he will have many problems so far as transport and power is concerned in our area, but I am glad to see him in the hot seat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to add my words of welcome to this legislation which aims at giving the overwhelming majority of people electricity supply at subsidised rates.  The growth of the ESB since it started is a credit to that body and is an indication of the extent of the input of national finance over the years.  It is reflected in the living standards, both socially and economically, of the community. The absence of it is also reflected in the frustration of those who have not got the same amenities and living standards. It is pleasing to note that the Black Valley in Kerry and the Ballycroy area in Mayo are, because of their peculiar terrain problems specifically to benefit from this legislation.  The introduction of electricity to the Black Valley will, I hope, bring brightness instead of darkness to that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening speech said that, despite what he envisaged in this legislation, some anomalies would still remain.  I would ask the Minister for some clarification.  Up to the moment we have had two classes of people who have been out of benefit&mdash; those who were quoted special service charges and those who were quoted a capital contribution.  Many people were obliged because of the economic circumstances to refuse the electricity.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know where the real dividing line should be.  This legislation concerns mainly the western seaboard counties.  Much of the line work will be to houses in valleys.  People living at the end of those valleys will be asked for a capital contribution. They would have been quoted a special service charge.  The line may well be passing people quoted a special service charge and subsiding a house further on. Possibly a number of those people may not be in a position to benefit from this subsidisation.  I should be glad to know if the Minister has investigated and examined that type of situation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that this legislation has been availed of to give to ESB personnel retiring on health grounds the same benefits that have for so long been available to civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to welcome the Minister here in his new capacity as Minister for <Col N="882" /> Transport and Power and wish him well in that office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by clearly associating myself with the remarks of welcome to the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Fitzpatrick, to this House.  I have very clear memories of the generous response which he made to a number of amendments which were put down when legislation which affected his previous Department was introduced in this House.  While I was not too happy with the result of some of them, his response was generous and I wish him every good fortune in his new ministry.</P>
      <P>As a former ESB employee, I must confess a slight personal interest in the Bill, I have been fascinated by the operations of that board.  In the interests of the provision of electricity and of the future of the board and myself, I think it is well that we parted in the 1960s.  I might address those of you who may be interested in researching the meaning of that remark to a very fine play which has been written on the subject of the Electricity Supply Board entitled &ldquo;The Board&rdquo; which was produced in the Abbey some years ago.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will excuse me if I begin at the end of the Bill, or at the end of his speech, at that section which includes provision to enable the Electricity Supply Board to submit to him schemes amending the general employees and manual workers superannuation scheme to provide improved superannuation benefits for persons retiring from or being discharged by the board on grounds of ill-health.  This is introduced on the ground that this provision is being added to bring the ESB superannuation scheme into line with recent similar improvements in the civil service superannuation code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ESB pensioners&mdash;I am referring particularly to the body known as the Electricity Supply Board Retired Staff Association&mdash;have had unsuccessful meetings during the past five years with different people involved in the Department of Transport and Power.  The representatives have had very reasonable requests.  On one occasion I accompanied them myself to <Col N="883" /> meet some officials and we had an argument as to whether a pension was a matter of contract or was something that took cognisance of a lifetime of work given in national service. I think that the very reasonable request not demand, of the employees on that occasion might have been met. I should appreciate the Minister's opinion on it.  The ESB Retired Staff Association requested very simply something which was legislatively possible, that is, that they be allowed representation on the superannuation council of the board.  Legislation provides that where one third of the signatures are gathered a meeting should be called by the board to enable a representative to be put on the council.</P>
    <P>The board has systematically refused over the years to summon such a meeting.  The ESB Retired Staff Association have secured more than one third of the signatures of retired people. They have pointed out that their request is legislatively possible, but the board still refuse to meet their request. May I say why one of the pensioners might be represented on this council? Members of the ESB Retired Staff Association, mainly elderly people, are worried in particular about two aspects of the use of superannuation funds. They are worried about the low returns on the capital sums invested by the fund and they are worried also that so far no scheme for the widows of manual workers exists or has been approved or suggested by the board.  If for no other reason than to press the very reasonable demand that their pension be invested to yield a proper return and to express their concern about the widows of their fellow workers, they are seeking representation on the superannuation council.  Their meetings with the board have gone on for over five years.  There might be more appropriate occasions for raising this, but I am encouraged to raise it in so far as the superannuation benefits are referred to in the Bill itself as a result of a motion suggested in the other House.</P>
    <P>The major substance of this Bill is of course a tidying-up operation that particularly affects two areas, the Black Valley and Ballycroy.  I note from the Minister's speech that these two areas <Col N="884" /> are the worst of the unresolved anomalies in provision of electricity supply. It is quite fair, too, that in the Minister's speech he mentions other people who are in the same situation.  There was a long discussion in the other House as to who would be entitled to assistance and who would not.</P>
    <P>One point which has confused me a little is the extent of other areas, peripheral areas particularly, which might be applicants for assistance under FEOGA schemes.  These are also areas for which the capital contribution required or quoted for the supply of electricity might be high.  I wonder whether a source of assistance under FEOGA might continue after this Bill has drawn a line.  My own estimation of the operation of FEOGA is not encouraging and I believe that some grants which might have been available under this year's budget may not be available in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The third and last part of what I have to say refers to the section in which the Minister addressed his appeal to persons proposing to build new houses to consult the ESB prior to actually becoming involved in the building. As one drives around Ireland one is continually aware of what a marvellous engineering achievement it was to erect poles on different parts of the Irish landscape.  It is one thing to marvel at man's achievement, the technical achievement in bringing light where there was no light or light where there was dark, as other Members have said. It is not too unreasonable now to ask that there be a fit between what might be regarded as reasonable demands of visual amenity and the activities of the Electricity Supply Board and, indeed, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In the absence of a Department of the Environment different Ministers have to be careful about the operation of their Departments and ensure that they in fact are not environmentally detrimental. There are no rigid lines laid down as to, for example, the manner in which poles and low tension cables can be strewn across different small towns and villages which are otherwise attractive, not only for tourist purposes but because people want to live in a pleasing environment, and the environmental <Col N="885" /> impact of electricity provision is something which should concern us.</P>
    <P>May I say immediately that I do not want anybody to make me the reply that I am saying we have to make a choice between having no light and proper visual planning.  Thankfully we do not have to make that choice in this country yet, and it is wrong for people to indulge in crude similarities and the general idea that no matter what the cost we must have poles strewn across the country.  We do not have to make that choice.  In addressing myself to the new Minister for Transport and Power I may say that it may not always be appropriate to rely on the provision of electricity in the conventional way for a number of parts of the country.  I am aware that alternative energy sources are now being investigated within the Department of Transport and Power, and these alternative energy sources are often more in keeping and in a better fit with the natural conditions of communities, and I hope that we will have the applied or technical spin-off of those investigations quite soon.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as other Senators have welcomed it.  In welcoming it I might reflect on something else.  I think one gathers from the Minister's speech a concern that we are living in economically difficult times.  Of course we are, but I have always argued that one should never ever judge the provision of basic necessities, the provision of transport, or, in this case, the provision of electricity by economic criteria.  For many people the provision of electricity supply was a basic necessity.</P>
    <P>Anybody studying the effects of the major demographic trends in our population over the last decade will know that the counties that have been most affected from the outflow of migratory movements have been the western counties and peripheral counties, and I might even mention islands. Now in the case of these, even when an outflow of migration from this country to Britain ceased and was replaced by an internal flow of population to the larger centres of population, it meant that a great number of old people were left in their houses on their own.  For <Col N="886" /> such people, in the absence of very sophisticated home care, medical care and other facilities, visiting facilities, the sheer existence of the possibility of having electricity was a basic, human and necessary requirement.  We should set ourselves to it that no matter what penalties we may impose on people well off in our community we should always protect the interests of such people, who are after all the most vulnerable members of our community.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about what happened in an analogous situation in the case of transport.  The people who were left at home when public transport was cut back were the least vocal lobby in this country.  They were not a lobby at all.  They were simply people who retired from active participation in life because they no longer had the railway. In exactly the same way, lost in valleys and in peripheral areas in Ireland today, there are people who are old or who, because they are not a vociferous lobby, sometimes do not have their needs pressed in the same way as other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I had been speaking about different aspects of this Bill, and the one so far that I would stress is the one concerning the position of ESB pensioners, particularly those I referred to who are members of the Electricity Supply Board Retired Staff Association.</P>
    <P>I should like to clarify two points before I conclude.  Reference is made to the Black Valley and Ballycroy. At the time an offer was made to these two areas, an offer was also made to and rejected by the people of Omey Island in the Clifden area.  I quite accept the Minister's explanation that the Bill is limited in scope and that any review of the rural electrification programme will involve the making of special cases.  Of course it is limited in scope.  There is also the case of localised hardship.  I mentioned Omey Island. This is an island when the tide is in, and it is a peninsula when the tide is out.  The offer made to the people of Omey Island was unacceptable at the time the offer was made to Ballycroy and the Black Valley.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to interrupt the Senator, but it is not confined to the Black <Col N="887" /> Valley and Ballycroy.  It includes the entire country, including Omey Island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am grateful for the Minister's intervention. He said:</P>
      <P>The Government are, in all circumstances, prepared to recommend approval to the provision of additional moneys to enable the Black Valley and Ballycroy householders, as well as others in the same category throughout the country....</P>
      <P>This is the point to which the Minister correctly draws my attention.  I am adverting to the fact that, in the discussion in the other House, many people wished to extend that category. The circumstances of the rejection of the offer by the householders at Omey correspond almost exactly with those of the two areas mentioned in the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point intrigues me somewhat, and here I am seeking enlightenment. When the ESB are considering the supply of electricity&mdash;obviously the Minister takes cognisance of their opinion&mdash;I am sure they have what they would call a hardship category. The Minister said: &ldquo;This is a once-for-all scheme of limited application intended to deal with a special case of localised hardship...&rdquo;.  I am concerned about people who were unable to take up the board's offer because of the size of the capital sum at the time the offer was made.  There were technical restrictions on what the board might offer in that period.  For example, since then, availability of expertise has enabled the idea of the supply of electricity to islands to be entertained.  On an island such as Inishbofin which does not come within the competence of the Minister for the Gaeltacht there are a number of householders who are anxious to have electricity available to them.  I mention their case although I am well aware of the fact that I introduced a note of environmental responsibility, and I seriously question whether we should not regard remote locations as suitable locations for alternative energy supplies.  We should be imaginative in doing that and, if necessary, we <Col N="888" /> should be willing to subsidise alternative energy sources where they have a high environmental attraction.</P>
    <P>I want once again to welcome this Bill.  I know I have raised some questions.  The one which bothers me is the provision mentioned in the last paragraph of the Minister's speech which seeks to allow for amendment of the general employees and manual workers superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>May I finally wish the new Minister for Transport and Power well in dealing with the Electricity Supply Board, a board of which I am a former employee.  My memory of that board is quite clear.  I can remember some major difficulties concerning the integration of engineering and administrative functions.</P>
    <P>My reason for stressing the importance of dealing well with ESB pensioners and particularly the case of the widows of manual workers who have worked for the ESB is that I know the commitment which the linesmen had to the supply of electricity in rural areas and the sense of attachment many of these men had to the provision of a valuable amenity to people in remote rural areas.  It would be very wrong if the widows of manual workers, or the retired members of the Electricity Supply Board in this most exciting stage of its history, were somehow or another left behind.  It might be very useful, too, when we look at the history of these boards&mdash;and we should look at them more critically than we do&mdash; to contrast the sense of zeal which inspired the workers in their early stages with the present atmosphere in a number of the semi-State bodies now that they have become bureaucratic because of insufficient allowance being made for participation by employees. As I say, that people have said it is a mixed blessing.  I wish the Minister for Transport and Power well with all the new semi-State bodies he has just so recently acquired and which are now more accountable, so many of them indirectly, than they have ever been before to both Houses of the Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>I only hope that these bodies including the Electricity Supply Board <Col N="889" /> who are not mentioned in the motion, will realise that if the public gaze comes on them it is not in a spirit of criticism. Many socialists, like myself particularly, see it as an attraction to work for the community rather than for individual profit.  I hope that, as we finish with this minor aspect of the ESB's activities, people will discover, perhaps for the first time, the genuine enthusiasm which can come from serving the community rather than individual profit motivation.  It is high time we realised that many of the semi-State bodies are not just left-overs from private enterprise, or some area into which private enterprise would not move.  It is true that private enterprise will never move into something that does not make a profit, but there can be a great spirit of excitement, and we are moving into an area where the private sector will be withering away more and more, and the experience of having worked in the Electricity Supply Board will be a more valuable one in the future than I have found it myself to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome this Bill.  I believe it will make many people happy who thought they would never enjoy the ESB service.  I was disappointed at first when I read the Bill because I thought something should be done for the ordinary young married couples throughout the country.  When it came to building their own homes, they were confronted with a very heavy demand at a time when they could least afford it.  I am glad they, at least, are being considered.  I often wondered why we could not have a co-ordinated service between the Department of Local Government and the ESB.  I believe it is not impossible to introduce some form of rent or rates structure which would meet that demand instead of requesting a contribution to be paid immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nice to know that people are very anxious to return to rural Ireland. This is a step in the right direction and something which we all welcome.  That step should be encouraged and every possible effort should be made to induce and help people to live in rural Ireland. <Col N="890" /> There are many things I fail to understand about the ESB services.  Very often when people were about to build a home public representatives were asked to make representations to the ESB.  At no stage in my life as a public representative was I successful in getting an ESB bill reduced.  Very often I was told it was a problem of so many poles or an additional transformer.  One felt that some people who could least afford it were making a contribution to an additional transformer for the entire district.  One was told the people concerned should have consulted the ESB before they decided on the location of their house.  For a married couple purchasing a site in rural Ireland at the moment there is very little choice.  They have to take what they can get.</P>
    <P>The ESB were most unreasonable when power was being transferred from an old to a new house.  In that case there should have been no charge, and I often wondered why it was raised.  In rural Ireland the farming community have many grievances because of the lack of power in their area.  It is often said that the power is completely inadequate to cope with their milking machines and other modern equipment.  It is gratifying to know that 98 per cent of our rural. houses are connected to the ESB service. Not alone do we compare favourably with other countries, but we are ahead of quite a number of them.  I welcome the Minister here today in his first appearance as Minister for Transport and Power and I wish him many years of happiness.</P>

      <P>There is nothing like a by-election for getting results.  In 1966 in South Kerry, the people were &ldquo;rained&rdquo; with wellington boots and eventually they got a bridge to span the divide between Valentia Island and the mainland.  Now, as result of the 1975 by-election in West Mayo, the people of Ballycroy are to get electricity, and rightly so, and the people of the Black Valley in Kerry and places like Woodford in Galway will benefit from this new Bill.  The Minister told us there are some 800 to 900 householders without electricity in these and other rural areas.  I find it difficult to <Col N="891" /> believe that figure is correct.  I would have thought that it was much higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is not what I said.  There are between 800 and 900 people who declined electricity because they were not prepared to pay the capital contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that, if the £300,000 which is being voted in this Bill is used up in attending to areas such as Ballycroy and Black Valley, other parts of the country will not suffer.  For instance, my own county of Waterford has a considerable mountainous area and there are numerous houses without electricity.  I should like to get the same consideration as the areas mentioned.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of people who build new houses and get very high quotations from the ESB.  I have the greatest sympathy with these people. We, as public representatives, receive representations daily from this type of person.  The people themselves are largely to blame, but they are not completely to blame.  What may appear to be an excellent and convenient site can often turn out to be very costly. Looking at a specific site people might say that to connect it up to the ESB mains would not require even one pole. When the house is half-erected the builders ask the ESB for a quotation. They can get the shock of their lives when they are asked to pay £300, £400 or £500.  It is not the ESB's fault. I presume prices dictate their policy.  I wonder if it could be made complusory that when people apply for planning permission to a local authority they must also apply for a quotation from the ESB.  Time and again I have seen people getting caught in this way. They cannot afford to pay this charge unless they skimp on some other item and the house may be left unfinished for a couple of years as a result of this exorbitant ESB charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many problems in the country as regards low voltage, particularly now that farms are becoming more and more modernised and using expensive milking parlours.  Neighbouring houses and even the farmer's house can suffer from a lack of voltage at milking time.  I know the ESB do <Col N="892" /> their best to remedy this situation, but I believe they have a criterion that the voltage has to be less than 200 volts before they will attend to the matter. If many farmers in one area are milking at the same time, this can result in people in nearby houses not being able to get television reception, or not being able to use electrical applicances.  The limits the ESB adopt are a bit too severe.  They should facilitate people on a wider scale.</P>
    <P>If a young man is setting up an industry, be it a metalwork or a woodwork industry, he has to have a three-phase supply of electricity.  He has to pay the full whack for connection to the ESB.  The Minister might consider giving a subsidy to somebody setting up such an industry.  Very often the capital cost of installing a three-phase supply can stop or, at least, put back the promotion of the industry for several years.  I am glad to see the Bill eliminates the need for the payment of a lump sum by people in remote areas. That is the essence of the Bill and the Minister is to be congratulated on it.</P>
    <P>If I may go back to the mechanics of it, I feel the majority of members of the House do not understand what is involved financially.  I want to reassure myself that my views on it are correct. If I am wrong I hope the Minister will correct me.  Under the old rural electrification scheme people were subsidised up to an extent of £750.  They could pay this £750 in terms of a fixed charge and a service charge.  Once they went over £750, they had to pay a lump sum.  For instance, if the installation cost £1,500, they had to pay the first £750 on a fixed charge and a special charge over a number of years, <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The remaining sum of £750 had to be paid as a lump sum.  Since this scheme ceased on 31st March, 1975, I understand the whole £1,500 had to be paid as a lump sum.  Now as a result of this scheme, the first £700 will still have to be paid in terms of a fixed charge and a service charge, and the remaining £800 will be paid out of the £300,000 being voted in this Bill today.  If I am not correct in that I should like the Minister to contradict me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very confusing.  I see from the Dáil Official Report that the majority of Deputies were &ldquo;in a heap&rdquo; about it.  I should like the Minister to clarify those figures.  I have always found the ESB officials very helpful in administering the various rural electrification schemes.  More recently they got a lot of abuse and criticism because the subsidies which existed under the old scheme were eliminated.  The public do not readily understand that the subsidies were eliminated and it is not really the ESB who are to blame.  They found it exceedingly difficult to explain this and, as a result, people come to us local representatives and, unfortunately, in the vast bulk of cases we are not able to help in any way whatsoever. The ESB have had a most difficult job, and this Bill will be a help to them. They can offer people more favourable terms.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this is a once-for-all scheme.  I wish he had not been so definite, because it is not very humane to be so definite.  Time and again we come across people in very remote areas who could not get electricity because their neighbours did not want it.  As a result, instead of being shared between three or four houses, one individual had to bear the brunt of the complete cost.  With the passing of years their might be a change in ownership of the other residences, or a change in attitude, and the contribution might be equally shared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely unfair to a son or a daughter who inherits the house from parents who were old-fashioned and did not want electricity in the house. Some people had ridiculous ideas about the dangers of electricity, and the cost of it, and so on.  Children were often the victims of this type of old-fashioned philosophy.  When their parents died they found themselves stranded with no electricity and faced with exorbitant costs of connection.  If this is a once-for-all scheme that type of person will still be victimised in ten or 20 years' time.  Provision should be made for hardship cases such as that.  In that connection, I would have thought the <Col N="894" /> EEC would surely have some scheme where people in remote areas and in such circumstances could be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to refer to the matter of overground ESB lines.  The suggestion has been made that the ESB should put their cables underground. I agree fully with that suggestion. Some of the most beautiful parts of our country have been spoiled and absolutely raped, once could say, by miles and miles of telephone wires and ESB lines.  I know it is more expensive to put these lines underground.  I appeal to the Minister to make an attempt to start putting them underground. We all know the poem starting: &ldquo;I think that I shall never see.  A poem lovely as a tree.&rdquo;  On the other hand, there is probably nothing as ugly as to see beautiful countryside spoiled by miles of wires and poles.  Unless we can get those poles to sprout branches there is no alternative but to place them underground.  Our tourists must be appalled when they come across scenic areas which are spoiled in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It serves a most useful purpose.  I would appeal to the Minister not to put a closing date on it, leave it loose-ended so that victims of circumstances may benefit from it in years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Sentors I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister to the House in his new capacity as Minister for Transport and Power.  It is especially gratifying to see an old Member of the Seanad back wearing his second Ministerial hat.  We both have many pleasant memories of our times together on these benches, not to mention the various PR and other campaigns that occupied that period rather fruitfully and happily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small Bill but affords an opportunity of paying tribute to the work done in rural electrification.  It is gratifying that today we have reached a 98 per cent to 99 per cent completion, figures which are fully comparable with those in England and elsewhere. All concerned are to be congratulated on them.  Anything that can be done to <Col N="895" /> bring this necessity of modern living to the remaining scattered households in the country will be welcomed, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions a figure of £300,000.  He says this is a once-for-all scheme.  I agree with previous speakers that it cannot ever be completely finished.  There will be always some anomalies.  Those anomalies simply should be placed on the conscience and or goodwill of the ESB.  Whatever little it will cost it will be the contribution of all those who have enjoyed electricity over the years to their less fortunate brothers.  If it costs only something of the order of the present figure, getting rid of anomalies, it will have cut the red tape.  There should be no need for further legislation, except a simple clause that will give some discretion to the ESB to judge these very rare cases on their merits and make whatever accommodation that can be made available to owners, with the overall aim of ensuring that as far as possible everyone will have connection.</P>
    <P>Electricity is not the only means of heating and cooking.  In the present situation, with the gas find and its development off Kinsale, in many ways gas is more economical and a more direct way of using energy for heating and cooking rather than conversion into electricity.  Perhaps some of the remote places could be brought into some type of scheme&mdash;I will not say subsidised&mdash;which would encourage them to use gas.  The objective of that has been declared before.  Some progress has been made.  At present it would suit the national interest to encourage the direct use of gas in such situations.  In the years ahead we may even be envisaging national schemes.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and the Minister to realise the pool of talent and expertise we have got in the ESB at all levels.  We should place tasks on their shoulders and give them the necessary discretion for carrying out those national tasks.  We should also encourage them to expand and develop further their present contract work with Third World Countries in selling their expertise for development in those countries.  That is something that will <Col N="896" /> be beneficial to both of us.  It will provide an outlet for the creative talent in the ESB to really show what they can do often on a larger scale than we can provide at home.  Great tribute has to be paid to them for the work they have done.  Their continuing central role in the country and in the energy field does not need emphasis.  I hope they will be given every encouragement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other Senators in the general welcome given to this provision to enable additional assistance to be given from public funds towards the cost of connecting isolated houses in rural Ireland to electricity supply.  I do so in the knowledge, which is unbelievable, that even in my county, Tipperary, which was one of the first counties to avail of rural electrification &mdash;indeed the late Canon Hayes performed the switch-on in my native village in the first years of rural electrification&mdash;much still needs to be done. There are regions within the county, on the slopes of the Galtee Mountains&mdash; and Glencushabinna comes to mind immediately&mdash;there are still houses some four miles on the side of the mountain without rural electrification. When they applied in recent times, hoping to modernise themselves, they were staggered at the cost quoted by the ESB.  I should like an assurance from the Minister in his reply that these applications, although made some time ago, will be treated as valid applications under this new scheme.  Although they had applied the terms quoted were so prohibitive they were dropped as a live effort to have rural electrification in their area.  Whereas some people on this roadway have achieved rural electrification through intensive farming and so on there are still smaller farmers in the upper regions that have not been connected yet.  I am hoping that under this new scheme they will benefit.  I compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the principle that where new households are concerned consulttation should take place with the ESB, Of course, there are exceptions even to this rule.  I would hope that certain people, who for economic reasons get isolated sites&mdash;isolated in the board's <Col N="897" /> terminology would be a roadway on which there is no electricity.  It may not necessarily be an isolated road.  Indeed it may be the only suitable site a person, in some circumstances, could get on which to build a house.  I know of one such person recently who is incapacitated through a leg amputation.  He is now living on social welfare and, through compensation and so on he decided to build himself a house more suitable than his present one.  Through the generosity of his relatives a site was offered to him in an area the ESB considered was isolated.  The quotation for electricity there was in the region of £600, which means that the man has to further depend on the generosity of his family and others for the provision of what most of us consider now to be one of the essentials of life.  Water is probably the first and electricity is very high on the priority list.  We have grown so dependent on it as a mode of power and convenience that we look on it as vital to survival.  It is a compliment to people in isolated areas such as those mentioned in parts of Kerry and Mayo and in parts of my own county, Tipperary, that they have managed to survive for so long with the problems that can be created because they cannot avail of all the modern conveniences which make life easier.</P>
    <P>I should like to join other Members in complimenting the Minister on his first visit to this House as Minister for Transport and Power.  With the energies he put into his previous Department I have no doubt that Transport and Power is in very safe hands, and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): First of all, I want to express my gratitude and thanks to Senator Lenihan and all others for the welcome extended to me on this my first visit to the Seanad in my capacity as Minister for Transport and Power.  I also want to thank them for their complimentary remarks and for their expression of good wishes.  As I said on a previous occasion it is always a friendly experience for me, and one which I enjoy, to come back to Seanad Éireann where I started my professional parliamentary career in 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to thank all the Senators <Col N="898" /> who spoke for their general welcome for this Bill and for their general satisfaction with it.  It is a small Bill but affords scope for a very wide discussion.</P>
    <P>Many Senators complimented the ESB on the work they have done over the years.  I should like to add my words of thanks and appreciation to the Electricity Supply Board for the great service they have rendered this nation.</P>
    <P>In 1976 it is not amiss to put on the record of this House that the Electricity Supply Board was established in 1926 or 1927, and is now reaching its golden jubilee.  I know I will not be misunderstood if I say that the establishment of the ESB in the mid-twenties is further evidence of the very enlightened approach of the Government of that day to the social and economic requirements of this country.  The State had only been founded a few years.  There were many difficulties to be dealt with.  Finance had to be found.  The various institutions of the State had to be established.  The politicians of those days were young men who found themselves in charge of the government of a country with very little or no parliamentary experience. I say, therefore, that the establishment of the Electricity Supply Board is evidence of the enlightened and farseeing thinking in those days.  The ESB, having been established, progressed very satisfactorily.  As the years went on, notwithstanding the set-back and interruption of their work brought about by the Second World War which started in 1939 and went on to 1945, we find that, when the Government of the day in 1945 passed the Rural Electrification Act and asked the Electricity Supply Board to take on the job of lighting and bringing a much wanted necessity to rural Ireland, the Electricity Supply Board were ready to undertake that onerous task.</P>
    <P>The fact that we can record here today&mdash;to which Senators have drawn our attention&mdash;that 98 to 99 per cent of the households of this country are connected to the electricity supply and have that benefit and amenity is an outstanding credit to the ESB.</P>
    <P>From time to time we are very fond of comparing ourselves with other countries, but for a different reason, comparing ourselves with other countries <Col N="899" /> to show that we are not as good as them, that we are lagging behind or that we are not doing the job as well. Here we find the position is different. We find that 420,000 houses are connected, and that represents 98 or 99 per cent of all the rural houses in Ireland.  In Britain and the United States of America the percentage does not reach 99 per cent.  It is marginally lower than ours.  That is something we should take pride in and something we should record as being an example to other countries.  Countries like Germany, Switzerland and Sweden have virtually the same rate of supply or connection as we have.  When we find ourselves criticised so often it is good that we should put on record fairly and squarely and in no mistaken manner, the achievement we have reached.  I have great pleasure in doing so and join with other Senators in complimenting the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>If I might turn to the Bill before dealing with the various points raised by Senators, which might take a little time, I should like to tell the Seanad&mdash; to repeat what I said in my introductory statement, that the rural electrification scheme was got under way in 1945 or 1946.  Then everybody in the country had an opportunity of having their houses electrified at subsidised rates. But 1945 or 1946 is 30 years ago and some people, particularly elderly people, were slow to take the light for one reason or another.  Some of them said: &ldquo;An oil lamp will do me for my day&rdquo;. Others said it was too expensive.  Others might have been afraid of it.  For one reason or another a lot of them did not acquire it.  It did not end there. They were given two subsequent opportunities of availing of subsidised electricity, one I think in the sixties and the last one between 1971 and 1975.  As rural Senators here will be aware, there could not be any possible question of people not knowing that these subsidised terms were offered to them.  Every local newspaper, which is read in most houses in Ireland, carried large advertisements drawing people's attention to it.  It did not stop there either.  In every place of worship, every church in the country, notices were read out by <Col N="900" /> the clergy drawing the attention of the parishioners to the fact that a last opportunity was being given them to avail of connection to electricity supply at subsidised rates.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in all fairness, there can be no question of people not being aware that they were being given a last opportunity between 1971 and 1975. The terms offered in 1971-75 made electricity available to private householders on the basis that the Electricity Supply Board would provide electricity on a rental or a fixed charge in normal circumstances.  Where the circumstances were abnormal, or where the amount of work involved in connecting was something out of the ordinary, then a special service charge by way of rental was payable where the capital charge of connecting a house did not exceed £750.  In cases where the capital charge of connecting the house exceeded £750 a lump sum contribution of part of the capital cost was required.  During the last subsidised rural electrification scheme a number of people all over Ireland refused to take the light or the current because they could not afford the lump sum contribution which, in some cases, ran into hundreds of pounds.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear to the Seanad that those are the type of cases we are dealing with here, under the Bill.  We are dealing with people who were offered subsidised electricity, subject to a capital contribution, and who refused to take it.  Those people now, whether they are in Black Valley, Ballycroy or any place else in Ireland are now being offered electricity on subsidised terms, but this time there will be no capital contribution of any nature.  There will be no lump sum payable.  All the cases that we are dealing with now would have cost, in 1971-75 values, £700 at least.  There will be no capital contribution of any description now.  The only payment that will be required of householders is a rental fixed at present rates of £36.40p per annum.  That is the only charge they will have to pay. It is not confined to the Black Valley or to Ballycroy.  It includes the entire Republic of Ireland where any person applied for electricity at the subsidised rate, was quoted terms which included <Col N="901" /> a capital contribution, and did not accept it.  I hope that is clear.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Bill is intended to cover people who applied and were quoted unacceptable terms, which included capital contribution. It does not matter who is residing in the premises now.  If an application was made in respect of the premises and terms refused because of capital contributions the premises are still covered.  But, if no application was made, they are not covered by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other very useful provision in this Bill.  Many Senators made reference to young married couples and others who build houses in rural areas <Col N="902" /> and then find themselves with a demand for a capital sum of several hundred pounds for the installation of electricity. All of us in the course of our constituency work know of these cases, and cases of hardship.  It is true that anybody who is going to build a house would be well advised to consult the local ESB office.  There is one in every provincial town and a few in every county.  They should inquire there as to the cost of connecting before they build the house.  That is only a prudent precaution.  Anybody who does not do that is taking a risk just as if he were to build a house without ascertaining whether he would have to bore 50 feet or several hundred feet to get water. He would be well advised to find out the cost of installation.</P>
    <P>Where new houses are built in reasonable places there can still be a demand for a capital contribution for the installation of the light.  The applicant will be required to pay the first £300 cash down.  Up to the next £1,000 may be paid by instalments over a period of three to five years at the election of the applicant.  Sums in excess of £1,300 must be paid in full. This is to discourage people from building houses in completely unsuitable places.  Payment by instalments is a considerable concession and will be welcomed by a great many people.</P>
    <P>Many Senators raised a lot of questions.  I will try to deal with them as best I can.  Senator Brian Lenihan confined his remarks to saying he was generally satisfied with the Bill and complimented the Electricity Supply Board on the work they had done, with special reference to rural electrification.</P>
    <P>Senator Dolan welcomed the Bill also and referred to the social and economic value of electricity.  He suggested that I might consider ways and means of generating electricity by a means that would be less expensive than the use of imported oils.  I can tell him that this is something that the Electricity Supply Board have constantly under review and that they are anxious to use native fuel and native power as far as that is possible.  The Electricity Supply Board started off by using the cheapest of all kinds of power&mdash;water&mdash;and where possible we <Col N="903" /> use turf.  I can tell Senator Dolan that I am anxious that electricity should be generated at the cheapest possible rate. The Senator raised the question also of co-operation between Northern Ireland and ourselves.  There is a very close though informal contact between the ESB and the Northern Ireland electricity authorities.  It is unfortunate that the inter connector between the North and South has been out of order for several months.  It has been blown up a number of times and it is not proposed to restore it at the moment.  This is yet another example of the dreadful consequences of the trouble in Northern Ireland.  It is another way that is affecting us.  Indeed it shows the futility of the actions of some people whose expressed aim is to bring about the union of this country.  The actions of some of them in blowing up a connector like this is driving people apart, keeping people apart and doing more to make any sort of a happy relationship between both parts of the country more remote than it is.  I want to deplore it, and I am sure the Seanad will join with me in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Moynihan dealt with the capital contribution and the fixed charges I have dealt with those questions. Senator Moynihan, too, raised the point of a number of houses being grouped together.  The Bill will only cover the houses in respect of which capital contributions were sought but the occupiers refused to accept.  That is the position there.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins dealt with a number of questions.  In particular he dealt with the section of the Bill which enables me to approve of more generous pension schemes for ESB employees. Though in theory the right of approval to superannuation schemes rests with me, in practice the superannuation provisions are a matter for the Minister for the Public Service.  The points made by Senator Higgins will be examined fully and every consideration will be given to them.  I can tell the Senator also that proposals to amalgamate the ESB general employees and manual workers superannuation schemes which would give the same benefits to widows and orphans of manual workers as <Col N="904" /> apply to general employees cannot advance until such time as the triannual actuarial evaluation of the schemes is available to the board. I understand that this evaluation will be available early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his assistance in this technical matter as it arose to make the point somewhat clear, may I say that in his speech the Minister said that this would bring the scheme into line with the more progressive changes which I acknowledge in the civil service generally and which have been introduced by the Minister for the Public Service, but the point which has been made continually to the ESB staff association when they have approached the Department of Transport and Power is that this is a matter for the board of the ESB and that the board up to the time of this assurance by the Minister, have been intractable in dealing with their approach.  I am grateful to the Minister and apologise for interrupting him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As the Senator will appreciate, superannuation matters are complex and can involve long and protracted negotiations between the ESB management and staff involving and requiring my approval in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.  However, if the Senator wishes I shall arrange to have these matters discussed with him.  They are complex.  They are involved.  There are on-going consultations, but a member of the staff of my Department will be available to the Senator or to any other Senator who wishes to discuss the matter.  Senator Higgins was also concerned about Omey Island.  It is linked with the mainland, I understand, and will likely benefit from the Bill.  I have a question down on this very matter for answer tomorrow and I will be giving the exact number of people who will likely benefit under the scheme. There may possibly be other householders on the island who will not benefit, but we have no knowledge of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins also raised the question of FEOGA.  I am told that FEOGA grants are not available for <Col N="905" /> non-farm installations.  In other words they are not available for private installations.  Again Senator Higgins raised the question of the non-Gaeltacht islands.  The position is that Gaeltacht islands such as the Aran islands benefit under the Gaeltacht scheme.  Generally speaking non-Gaeltacht islands have not as yet got electricity but they get grants for bottled gas and so on. However we are considering, without any firm commitment at this stage, what can possibily be done to cover the non-Gaeltacht islands.  Generally speaking the cost would be very substantial. In general, the offshore islands were excluded from the various schemes of rural electrification.  Only islands very close to the mainland were included, but you can take it that if any reasonable way can be found of providing electricity for these areas it will be found.</P>
    <P>Senator Willie O'Brien raised the question of a young married couple seeking electricity.  I think I have dealt with that.  The provisions in the Bill have gone as far as they can go.  I think it would be a good thing if there was co-operation between the Department of Local Government and the ESB. I do not think I would go entirely so far as to say that the provision of electricity should be made a planning condition, because if that were made a planning condition I could see some people coming in here and saying that it has nothing to do with the environment, that it has nothing to do with the scenic position in the country, and some people might not want electricity at all. They might be prepared to use gas.  So I would not be prepared to go that far.</P>
    <P>The question of low voltage was raised by Senator O'Brien.  It is true that in the past there were various complaints about low power in rural areas, especially in the dairying areas. While there are some complaints yet, these are less frequent in recent months. The ESB are doing their best to improve power in all such cases, and I will encourage them to continue to do so. Senator O'Brien also dealt with newly married couples seeking to have their homes connected.  I have dealt with that.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy raised a number of <Col N="906" /> points.  I have dealt with most of them by spelling out clearly what is covered by the Bill and what is not covered by the Bill.  The Senator also raised the question of planning authorities, and I have dealt with that, too.</P>
    <P>The general statement I made at the opening covers also the points raised by Senator Deasy as to whether every house in the country would be covered or whether the items would be confined to the Black Valley and Ballycroy.  I have made it clear that it applies to every house within the category set out in the Bill&mdash;those who applied under the subsidised scheme, were quoted terms which included capital contribution, and refused.  I would tell the Seanad that a special pamphlet is being prepared within my Department which will give full details of the application of this Bill and, when it becomes an Act, I hope to have that pamphlet circulated to members of the Oireachtas and to other interested parties.  It should prove very useful.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy raised the question of the disfiguration of the countryside by overhead wires.  We would all like perfection, but we must be practical. We must keep our priorities right.  The cost of putting all these wires underground would be enormous and the cost of electricity would have to be increased enormously to the consumer or, alternatively, the taxpayer would have to be asked to pay more.  Neither course would be acceptable.  It is true to say that even at this stage wires are being put underground in various places as a beginning, but in rural Ireland if wires were to be put underground the cost, I am told, would be ten to 15 times greater than the cost of overhead wires. That is my information from the experts.  While the installation of underground wires is something we would look forward to and something that we would desire, it cannot be given priority at the moment.  I agree that where convenient or where possible without undue cost, this course should be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan is fearful that the provisions of this Bill might not be adequate to do the job that it sets out to do.  I have spelled out clearly the job that it sets out to do.  That is, first, <Col N="907" /> to provide electricity to those who were quoted a capital contribution.  I am satisfied and I assure the House that the financial and other provisions of the Bill are adequate to cover every house that falls into that category. The other item in the Bill relates to deferred payments.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan suggested also that the expertise of the ESB should be availed of to advise people and to provide a consultancy agency, both at home and abroad.  I am glad to tell him, and I would not be surprised if Senator Quinlan already knows, that the ESB are just engaging in that sort of activity. The ESB have the Minister's approval to undertake overseas consultancy and related work.  They are in fact doing so at the moment, and they also undertake specialised consultancy work at home. They are doing that under authority from my Department, but legislation is being prepared to formalise the authority.  I am sure the Senator will be glad to know the board expect to gross about £1 million income for such services during the current year. I am glad that the Senator raised the matter because it gave me an opportunity of saying that.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the points raised by the Senators, and again I want to thank them for the welcome they have given the Bill.  As I said in my opening speech, there will still be the odd house here and there that will not be included, but I put to the Seanad that 99 per cent, and it will be 99 point something per cent at the moment, is a fair performance, a performance that the ESB and the various Governments can be proud of.</P>

      <P>I have a number of questions to ask on this section.  I am <Col N="908" /> going back to subsection (1) (a) and to the question Senator Dolan has raised about the Bill only applying to people who had already applied under the rural electrification scheme.  Even if there was only one case of a child being discriminated against, I think it would justify the Bill being amended.  I am sure there are dozens of cases throughout the country.  It is unduly harsh to expect children who inherited a house and who probably have been living in that house all their lives to pay the full capital sum.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his summing up, if I heard him correctly, that in respect of new houses the owner will pay the first £300 and will be allowed the remainder in instalments&mdash;is that correct?</P>

      <P>Take, for instance, an old-age pensioner under this section who is quoted an installation fee of £2,000.  Would that person have to pay first £700 under the heading of charges such as special charges, or does he pay anything at all?  On the Second Stage I gave a hypothetical case of where the charge for installation might be £1,500 and I tried as best I could to explain what I considered to be the meaning of the Bill as regards its interpretation under the old Rural Electrification Act, then from March 31st, 1975, up to the present and from now on&mdash;three separate cases.  The Minister said I was substantially right, but would he tell me where I was incorrect please?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us imagine that a person was quoted a fee of £1,500 under the old rural electrification scheme. My reading of the Bill would be that <Col N="909" /> he would have to pay £750 of that as a lump sum, that the first £750 was paid in terms of special charges and fixed charges.  When the subsidy was got rid of in March, 1975, then he would have had to pay the whole £1,500 as a lump sum, and under the new scheme he would have to pay the first £700 in terms of fixed charges and special charges but the remaining £800 would be a complete grant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Take the case of a man who was quoted a charge of £1,500 under the last rural electrification scheme.  On a subsidised basis the cost of connecting his house was £1,500.  He would be required to pay first a fixed charge, a special charge, whatever that was, and £750 of a lump sum.  That man now will get his house connected on a fixed charge of £36.40 per year without any other payment.  I do not like the word discrimination.  There is no question of discrimination here.  The child is not being discriminated against.  All we are saying here is that we set out to cover anybody who was an applicant under the last scheme and who was quoted terms which included a capital contribution. That person will come under this scheme, but if he is dead and his children are living in the house they will come under the scheme.  If the house has been sold and some new person is living in it, that new occupant would come under the scheme.  In so far as everybody else in the country is concerned all we are doing for them is to say that if they are quoted a connection charge for a new house or for an old house which exceeds £300 they may pay the next £1,000 by instalments over three years of five years at their option.  That is a big improvement, and it is something that I am satisfied from my local experience will be welcome.  I hope that makes the position clear.</P>
