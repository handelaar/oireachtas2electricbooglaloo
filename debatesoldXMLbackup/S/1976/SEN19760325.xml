      <P>The Minister last night indicated that we would wish to finish at 5 o'clock but I understand there was some pressure to continue, if necessary, to complete the business. I think the question came from the Senator's side of the House. The Minister certainly indicated his willingness to sit to continue the Order of Business.  I suggest we postpone the decision and perhaps discuss the matter during the day.</P>

      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage there was a discussion on the question of the District Court in regard to its jurisdiction in maintenance and affiliation proceedings and there is an amendment in the name of Senator Robinson with which many Members of the House were in sympathy.  Indeed I was in sympathy with the spirit of it myself.  The <Col N="1322" /> amendment was to provide that, by ministerial orders, the jurisdiction of the District Court could from time to time be raised, subject to the power of either House of the Oireachtas to annul any order.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the House at that stage that my advice was that there might be constitutional difficulties about the court's jurisdiction.  I have gone into this matter again and my advice is still the same&mdash;that there could be a constitutional problem in this area.  Consequently, I am unable to accede to the amendment in the terms proposed by Senator Robinson. I think it would be wrong to accept an amendment that might inspire a challenge to the legislation at an early stage.  In an effort to meet what was in the minds of Senators, I am proposing these amendments raising the maximum amounts in the District Court from £40 to £50 per week in the case of a spouse and from £10 to £15 per week in the case of a child, including, of course, an illegitimate child.  For a spouse with four children, the amount that the District Court could order would be £110 a week.  I think that should take care of practically all cases that are likely to arise in the foreseeable future.  This should go a long way towards meeting the problem that was worrying the House.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to the Minister for coming some of the way to meet the point of view which was expressed by Senator Robinson and myself on Committee Stage.  Depending on inflation being reasonably corralled, the Minister's amendments meet the point that was expressed by us, not to be having recurrent legislation on this aspect but rather to introduce a regulation procedure. I appreciate the Minister's point in regard to the Constitution although I still think it is the better way to do this sort of thing but the Minister has gone some of the way to meet us by increasing the limits which&mdash; as he said himself&mdash;should meet the situation, at any rate in the foreseeable future.  I think I am speaking for all sides of the House in saying that I am grateful to the Minister for coming that distance within the <Col N="1323" /> restraints of the Constitution to meet the point that was expressed.</P>

      <P>I also would like to thank the Minister for coming some of the way.  It may not be as far as what we wanted but at least it is a step in the direction we sought.  I can appreciate also that there may be constitutional difficulties although I was under the impression that if you reversed the procedure and had both Houses of the Oireachtas to decide it first, that difficulty could have been overcome. I thank the Minister for coming some of the way.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should mention one other point that was raised on Committee Stage.  It concerns the question of attachment of income other than earnings.  This is a matter that some Senators raised.  They were anxious to have the attachment proceedings extended to income other than income paid by way of wages or salary.  I have again considered this matter and I am still of opinion that there would be very formidable difficulties in devising adequate machinery.  It is not that I am against the idea.  Anything that would improve the enforcement of District Court orders in this or in any other sphere is something to be welcomed. However, the machinery to deal with enforcement would have to be carefully examined.  There are difficulties and complications.  Enforcement in this area has to be examined on a broad basis.  I think that there is a fair amount of dissatisfaction with regard to the effectiveness of our present system of enforcing court orders. Some people consider it a slow and <Col N="1324" /> tedious process.  The attachment of earnings procedure proposed in this Bill in respect of persons in employment will overcome many of the present difficulties.  There will, of course, still be difficulties in the case of a self-employed person, although there are a number of remedies under the existing enforcement law.  The remedies are there but how effectively they are implemented or operated is a matter for the particular parties involved and will depend on how well they use the existing machinery.</P>
      <P>I have not been able to do anything with regard to that point because there are real difficulties.  It may be a matter which would be competent to the Law Reform Commission, to look at the entire law relating to the enforcement of court proceedings.  It was Senator Halligan who raised it.  Extending the definition of &ldquo;earnings&rdquo; by itself would not be enough; there would have to be machinery to attach incomes of self-employed people.  To get such machinery operating would, at the moment, be well nigh impossible. It can be looked at again in the general context of review of the law relating to enforcement of court proceedings.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to thank all sides of the House for their reception of the Bill and for their co-operation in dealing with the various amendments.</P>
      <P>Bill reported with amendments, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare Bill provides for the implementation of the increases in rates of payment and of the other changes in the schemes of social insurance and social assistance announced in the recent budget. It provides also for increases in the benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme and for a number of minor improvements in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> This year, the Bill goes beyond the budget proposals in so far as it is designed to give effect to an extension of the maximum period of entitlement to unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.  It contains the consequential provisions for increases in the contributions payable under the social insurance and occupational injuries schemes in order to ensure the adequate financing of the extensive services now provided.</P>
    <P>Because this is a technical Bill, and also an annual Bill closely related to the budget, there is an understandable tendency to see it as a matter of routine.  I would submit, however, that the Social Welfare Bill each year is one of the more important pieces of legislation debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It deals with the financial and administrative provisions for a range of services which, together, cost more than the services provided by any other Department of State.  The total number of beneficiaries under the various social welfare schemes amount to almost 900,000 men, women and children even leaving out the 1.1 million children in receipt of children's allowances.</P>
    <P>But far more important than any statistics which may be calculated or circulated is the knowledge that, in making provision for social welfare, we are making the nation's collective answer to some of its profound responsibilities.  By the way in which a country treats the old, the widowed, the orphans, the sick, and the unemployed it is possible to judge its social values.  We must look upon our approach, in the Oireachtas, to those matters as a very great test of the democratic system which we operate.</P>
    <P>I have attempted on a number of occasions to stimulate debate and discussion on the future of social welfare and on social policy as a whole.  Never has the need for such interest and debate been greater that at the present time when we must take long term decisions about the way in which this country is to develop and advance in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> This debate on the detailed proposals contained in the Social Welfare Bill, 1976, is not, perhaps, the most appropriate place for discussion in depth of the proper social components of national strategy.  It is, however, an opportunity to remind ourselves of the importance of the social component in our overall national policy.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the budget statement, the increases proposed for introduction in April next will amount to 10 per cent in all weekly rates of social welfare payment.  This will involve a total expenditure of more than £25 million and will bring the overall outlay on social welfare benefits and allowances in a full year to more than £430 million&mdash;nearly three times as much as in 1972-73. Social welfare spending will amount, this year, to about 10½ per cent of the gross national product.</P>
    <P>These increases consolidate the advances made over the past three years.  In the period between July, 1973, and April, 1976, very substantial increases in all rates of social welfare payments will have been given.  The rise in personal rates under the social insurance scheme will have been between 89 per cent and 110 per cent, with child dependant rates up by between 130 per cent and 160 per cent.  The growth in maximum personal assistance rates will have been between 96 per cent and 122 per cent, with child dependant rates up by between 139 per cent and 180 per cent. The increase in the consumer price index between February, 1973, and November, 1975, was approximately 52 per cent so that&mdash;even taking account of price rises since last November&mdash;very substantial real gains have been enjoyed by all social welfare beneficiaries.  These gains will not be permitted to be whittled away by inflation since they represent the minimum response of a community that claims to care for its disadvantaged citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the rates to be introduced in April will be reviewed in the light of the trend of price rises during the year and that necessary adjustments will <Col N="1327" /> be made&mdash;as was the case in 1975&mdash; to guarantee the recipients against the erosion of the purchasing power of their benefits and allowances.  The important change made last October when weekly rates were increased for the first time during a benefit year has been recognised as crucial in a time of rapid inflation.</P>
    <P>The budget proposals for social welfare involve increases in all social assistance payments.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory old age pension is being raised from £9.30 to £10.25 for persons under 80 years and from £10.50 to £11.50 for persons aged 80 years and over.  The rates of pension payable where the weekly means exceed £6 are also being increased&mdash;by 10 per cent&mdash;up to the point where weekly means exceed £14 and no pension is payable.</P>
    <P>I should explain that, for a pensioner with qualified children the means limit is greater than £14 which is the figure shown in the table, and this section enables the table to be extended to cases where the means are not actually shown within the limits of the published text.</P>
    <P>The maximum weekly payment for dependent spouses who are not themselves entitled to pension is being increased from £4.65 to £5.10, so that the overall weekly payment for a non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will, at the maximum rate, be increased from £13.95 to £15.35 and, if the pensioner is aged 80 years or over, from £14.70 to £16.15.  The allowance paid in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is to be raised by 50p a week to £5.70 a week.  In addition, increases of pension for the qualified children of pensioners are being raised by 25p a week to £2.75 for each of the first two children and by 20p a week to £2.10 a week for each further child.</P>
    <P>The details of these changes and of the new table of weekly means and rates are set out in section 2.  I should explain that, for a pensioner with qualified children the means limit is greater than £14 which is the <Col N="1328" /> figure shown in the table, and this section enables the table to be extended to cases where the means are not actually shown within the limits of the published text.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for 10 per cent increases in the personal weekly rates of unemployment assistance bringing them up to £8.90 in urban areas and to £8.55 in rural areas.  There are corresponding 10 per cent rises in the rates for adult dependants and for qualified child dependants.  Thus, the rate of unemployment assistance payable to a man, wife and child in an urban area will be increased by £1.65 a week&mdash;from £16.45 to £18.10. Subsection (2) of this section makes provision for the change announced in the budget in respect of certain smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance.  It is now proposed that the existing rates of unemployment assistance&mdash;those are the rates established in October last&mdash;will continue to apply in the case of landholders with valuations in excess of £15 whose means are notionally assessed by reference to land valuation for purposes of determining eligibility for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is designed to give effect to a major amendment of the special scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders which Senators will agree is long overdue.  This special scheme, as Senators are aware, was introduced in 1966 and under it the means of landholder applicants for unemployment assistance are calculated on the basis of the poor law valuation of their holdings.  The scheme applies to smallholders resident in specified areas&mdash;the whole of Connacht, the counties of Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford and Monaghan plus the congested parts of west Cork and west Limerick.</P>
    <P>What is involved is a change in the notional basis of means assessment under the terms of the scheme.  In a situation where farm income has risen by 250 per cent since the introduction of the scheme in 1966 there has been widespread and increasing criticism of the maintenance&mdash; unchanged&mdash;of means guidelines established ten years ago.  Many <Col N="1329" /> objections have been made to the whole basis of assessment which is related to poor law valuation levels.</P>
    <P>Under this scheme the yearly means deriving from the use of land in specified areas are calculated on the basis of £20 per £1 of the applicant's net rateable land-valuation, excluding buildings.  Thus the means of a person with a valuation of £10 would be taken as £200 a year, or £3.85 weekly for unemployment assistance purposes and his entitlement to unemployment assistance&mdash;if he had no other means&mdash;would be the maximum weekly rate applicable to his family size reduced by £3.85. This &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; of £20 has remained unchanged since the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The amendment now proposed will leave the position unchanged for all smallholders assessed in this way whose valuations do not exceed £15 &mdash;that is, some 18,000 of the present total of approximately 23,500 smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>For smallholders whose valuations exceed £15 but do not exceed £20, a new notional &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; of £30 will replace the present £20, that is the notional income will be increased by 50 per cent affecting some 2,500 recipients.  For those whose valuations are over £20 the new multiplier will be £40, thus doubling the notional income of some 3,000 recipients.</P>
    <P>I intend to give very detailed consideration to the long-term future of the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme in the context of the planning of the reform of all assistance schemes which is included in my Department's development programme.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of sections 5 and 6 non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are being improved in line with other allowances.  The maximum weekly personal rate of widows' pension will be increased from £9.30 to £10.25 a week and the payment for qualified children will be raised to £3.40 a week for each child.  Orphans' non-contributory pension will be increased from £6.05 to £6.65 a week.  The details of these <Col N="1330" /> increases are given in the tables which form part of this section and, as in the case of old age pensions, provision is made to cover cases where means are not shown in the text.</P>
    <P>The new rates of widows' non-contributory pension will automatically apply to deserted wife's allowance, to the social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers and to the allowance for prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Section 7 raises the maximum weekly rate of payment to qualified single women over 58 years from £8.10 to £8.90 a week.  The impact of these substantial increases can be more clearly understood by reference to the numbers of recipients involved. Some 153,000 persons will benefit from the increases in the rates of non-contributory old age pension; over 200,000 persons from the rise in unemployment assistance rates; 20,000 from the increases in non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions; and about 16,000 from the new rates of social assistance allowances.  This total of about 390,000 includes both adult and child dependants.</P>
    <P>I now come to the increases provided for in the rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system.  In the case of retirement pension and old age contributory pension the personal rates will go up by £1.10 a week to £12.15 where the pensioner is under the age of 80 years and to £12.85 where the pensioner is aged 80 or over.  The allowances for adult dependants are being increased by 70p for those under 67 years and by 85p for those who are 67 years or over.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to a pensioner is to be increased from £5.20 to £5.70 a week.  Thus, the pension for a couple, both over 67 years of age and not yet 80 years of age is being raised to a weekly rate of £21.30&mdash;106 per cent greater than the rate being paid three years ago.</P>
    <P>The personal rates of widows' contributory pension and deserted wife's benefit are being increased by £1 to £11.00 a week, with the special rate for a widow aged over 80 years being raised to £11.85 a week.  Orphans' <Col N="1331" /> contributory allowance will be increased by 75p to £8.00 a week.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for a rise of £1 a week in the personal rates of disability and unemployment benefit and invalidity pension&mdash;the new flat rate will be £10.90 a week.  Maternity allowance will be increased to the same weekly figure.  All adult and child dependant allowances will rise in line with the general 10 per cent increase.  Some examples of the effects of these changes may illustrate what the budget provisions mean to families who depend on social insurance payments.</P>
    <P>The contributory widow's pension for a widow, aged under 80 years, with three qualified children will rise by £2.05 a week to £22.10 while a deserted wife with two qualified children will receive an additional £1.70 a week, bringing here benefit to £18.40.  Flat-rate unemployment benefit in the case of a man, his wife and three children will be increased by £2.50 a week, from £24.30 to £26.80.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system, the Bill also provides for increases in the rates of the various benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increase in weekly rates will be broadly in line with those provided for in the various social insurance categories.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made for increases in the special rates of unemployment benefit payable in certain circumstances where unemployment continues beyond 156 days.  These rates are related to the urban levels of unemployment assistance increases which are dealt with in section 3 of the Bill.  The increases which will come into effect in April are intended to retain the parity between the two rates.  The basic rate goes up by 80p, that for an adult dependant by 60p with corresponding increases for qualified child dependants.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons who will benefit from these social insurance increases amounts to about 490,000, including both adult and child dependants.  Of these, some 138,000 will benefit from the rise in <Col N="1332" /> rates of sickness benefit and 133,000 from the increases in unemployment benefit.  The number of contributory old age and retirement pensioners is in the region of 108,000 and there are about 81,000 recipients of contributory widows' and orphans' pensions. Some 3,500 maternity allowances will be paid at the new higher rates.  There will be about 4,000 beneficiaries from the increased levels of deserted wife's benefit.</P>
    <P>I have kept the operation of the unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit schemes under very careful review and, having regard to the overall unemployment situation, I made certain proposals to the Government which were approved.  The proposals which the Government approved were that the maximum period for which unemployment benefit may be paid to persons who are at present entitled to a maximum of 312 days' benefit will be extended by a further 78 days to 390 days.  The rate of benefit payable during this extra three months is to be the same as that which applied for the 156 days prior to the exhaustion of the 312 days' benefit.</P>
    <P>Under the transitional provisions contained in section 11 this significant extension of the unemployment benefit scheme will apply to persons who had exhausted their 312 days' unemployment benefit entitlement within 78 days of the operative date of the extension and who are still unemployed when the extension enters into force. For instance, a person who exhausted 312 days' benefit 30 days before the operative date, will get an extension of 48 days' unemployment benefit.  This extension of flat-rate unemployment benefit will provide badly-needed financial support for many families who continue to be affected by the prolonged economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for an extension&mdash;by a further 78 days to 381 days&mdash;of the maximum period for which pay-related benefit may be paid.  The proposed weekly rate of pay-related benefit during this further extension of the system is 20 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings between £14 and £50.  Pay-related benefit is payable together <Col N="1333" /> with unemployment, disability and maternity benefit.</P>
    <P>The extension will, in the same way as I have explained for flat-rate unemployment benefit, apply in the case of persons who have exhausted their full pay-related benefit entitlement within 78 days of the operative date of the extension and who still retain their entitlement to flat-rate benefit.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the success to date of the extended pay-related benefit system in terms of reducing the financial impact of sickness and unemployment has been of the greatest social and human importance. It is out of the question that we should allow our fellow-citizens who have in effect been betrayed by the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system to suffer substantial deprivation.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, 1975, in the other House I stated that an analysis of the operation of pay-related benefit refuted absolutely the criticism that this system provided some form of serious disincentive to work.  I pointed out then that the pay-related benefit scheme does not give the average unemployed man more than he could get if he were at work, but that it does keep his head above water for a reasonable time.  It is the purpose of all income-maintenance payments to cushion a person to the fullest extent possible if he becomes unemployed or ill and this purpose is fulfilled by pay-related benefit under the present social insurance code.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that the progressive development of our social welfare services demands a continual process of review and, where necessary, of reform and change.  We have, in three years, brought about a really major advance in social welfare provision and have established a new basic level of provision which cannot be reversed.  Further improvements and structural changes in the system are being worked on in the Department of Social Welfare at present in active pursuit of the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> The continuing review of the system has led, in this year's budget, to a change in the arrangements relating to the range of benefits available to unemployed persons and section 12 of the Bill is designed to facilitate the making of regulations to implement this change by restricting the total amount of the benefit payable to a wholly unemployed person to 85 per cent of net current earnings.</P>
    <P>This decision arises from a detailed study carried out by an inter-Departmental working group set up by the Government to investigate and assess the possible disincentive effects of benefits and concessions available to unemployed persons.  The establishment of this working group followed a report prepared for me within the Department of Social Welfare on the working of the pay-related benefit system.</P>
    <P>The study carried out by the working group was intended to look at the effects of the whole range of benefits and concessions which may be available to unemployed persons.  These include&mdash;in addition to unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and unemployment assistance which are the direct concern of my Department&mdash; the weekly redundancy payments scheme, tax rebates, relief from tax of social welfare contributions and, in certain cases, reduction of differential rent.  If inequalities exist, if there are situations in which people can become caught in the &ldquo;welfare trap&rdquo; where an unemployed worker could suffer financially by seeking and accepting a reasonable job offer&mdash; then this can arise only through an interaction of a number of the available concessions.  This was the general conclusion of the working group and one which gives rise to very serious implications.</P>
    <P>The working group concluded that it is not possible to say whether, or to what extent, the levels of income available to the main groups of unemployed persons do act as disincentives to seek employment.  Incentive and disincentive relate to personal attitudes as much as&mdash;and perhaps even more than&mdash;to money.</P>
    <P>Research being carried out separately <Col N="1335" /> for my Department indicates clearly to me that unemployed men and women want to work and that there is little or no evidence that many unemployed persons see their situation as a tenable or lasting way of life, despite improved benefits.  This is exactly what any reasonable person would expect.</P>
    <P>The working group were of the view that the basic objective of the pay-related benefit scheme to which I have referred&mdash;to ensure that workers do not suffer a serious drop in disposable income on becoming unemployed&mdash;is being achieved even without the intervention of the other available scheme.</P>
    <P>The study carried out revealed certain anomalies in the concurrent working of a number of schemes and the logical recommendation was made that there should be a rationalisation based upon the establishment of a unified wage-stop.  This will now be introduced.</P>
    <P>The new approach will be brought into effect by appropriate regulations which will be made shortly.  In general, the procedure will be along the following lines.  When a worker becomes unemployed, his or her average net weekly income prior to unemployment will be calculated on the basis of the income tax cessation certificate with appropriate deductions for tax and social insurance contributions. A figure equivalent to 85 per cent of this average will then become the wage-stop level.</P>
    <P>The flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and redundancy weekly payments where applicable will be calculated in the normal way. Where the total of these payments exceeds the maximum permissible income the total amount payable will be reduced accordingly.  Where, however, the person concerned is entitled only to flat-rate unemployment benefit no reduction in this amount would be made.</P>
    <P>If the person concerned is entitled to a rebate of income tax an appropriate reduction in his total payments will, if this is necessary, be made to keep him within the maximum laid down.  His position will have to be <Col N="1336" /> further reviewed on cessation of the tax rebates.</P>
    <P>Subject to the other conditions provided for, the maximum weekly amount of benefit payable by way of flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and weekly redundancy payments to a person who is eligible for weekly redundancy payments, would then be £50.</P>
    <P>The new approach will apply only to new claims received as and from an appointed day.  It will do away with an anomaly which has arisen in a large part due to the operation of a number of relatively new schemes. It does not result from a widespread abuse and certainly does not represent a general level of benefits which is destroying the will and the incentive to find work.  An adjustment is necessary and it is being made.</P>
    <P>Much, indeed most, of the public criticism of the pay-related benefit system has been ill-informed, crude and confused.  It has come in the main from persons and groups which have shown little or no concern for the poor or for the unemployed.  I continue to be contemptuous of critics who have never faced, and who will never face, unemployment and its attendant stresses and strains.  My job is to make provision for those who do face these personal hardships and it is my concern to ensure that they are given every reasonable help.</P>
    <P>The purpose of pay-related benefit is to improve on the position under the old flat-rate system by relating both benefit and contributions to earnings to some degree and to provide rates of benefit which will better enable persons to maintain, during sickness and unemployment, a standard of living reasonably close to that to which they have been accustomed.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion, based on an assessment of its working over a year and a half, that the pay-related benefit system has achieved that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains one or two reform measures which have been designed to deal with gaps or anomalies in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> There is provision for the payment of a benefit, at a rate equal to the contributory widows' pension, to a widower whose wife immediately prior to her death had been in receipt of a retirement pension which included an increase in respect of him because he was wholly or mainly maintained by her because of his physical or mental infirmity.  This will bring the retirement pension scheme into line with the contributory old age pension scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 18 of the Bill deals with the payment of child dependant allowances to recipients of contributory widows' pension.  At present these allowances are payable in respect of children who normally resided with the widow or the late husband prior to the date of the husband's death and also in respect of the children, grandchildren or step-children of the widow or of her late husband, or adopted children, who came to reside with the widow after her husband's death.  The Bill provides for payment of allowances in respect of all qualified children normally residing with the widow regardless of the date on which they became normally resident with her.  A similar provision is being made in respect of the scheme of non-contributory widows' pensions.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the increase in the rates of social insurance contributions which cover all benefits of the social insurance system. The increase in the contribution this year must provide for the appropriate share of the increases in benefits and pensions provided for in the Bill and for the general improvements to be made in the social insurance scheme.  It must also include an element for the part financing of the extension of the unemployment benefit scheme for a further three months to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>Provision must also be made for the increases in contributions arising from the decision announced in the budget statement to transfer £8 million of charges from the Exchequer subsidy to the social insurance stamp as part of a phased reduction of the Exchequer contribution.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in the case of <Col N="1338" /> contributions which count for all benefits involved is £1.53, of which the employer will pay £1.03 and the employee £0.50.  Lesser increases will apply where the rates of contribution do not cover all social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for the continuation this year of the special increase of 31p made in the Social Welfare Act, 1975, to meet the financial implications of the abnormal unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rates of contribution covering the social insurance services administered by my Department, including the increase of £1.53 and the special unemployment increase of 31p, will thus rise to £5.64 a week for men, of which the employer will pay £3.50 and the employee £2.14.  For women the new ordinary rate will be £5.56, of which the employer will pay £3.48 and the employee £2.08.</P>
    <P>The rates of voluntary contribution will be correspondingly raised to £1.10 a week at the low rate and £2.83 a week at the high rate.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for an increase of 39p to £1.73 in the new rate of voluntary contribution introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1975, to cover the situation of a certain category of insured persons affected by the abolition from April, 1974, of the remuneration limit for the insurability of non-manual workers.  Contributions payable in respect of occupational injuries insurance are to be increased by 2p a week to 14p for a male employee, and 11p for a woman&mdash; all borne by the employer.  All of these new rates of contribution will be effective from Monday, 5th April, 1976.</P>
    <P>The budget this year was framed by the Government in the context of the very real difficulties arising from what is by far the worst economic crisis faced by the nations of Europe for 40 years.  In the present economic circumstances the major objectives of the budget might well have been restricted to tackling economic problems and at the same time seeking to achieve a reasonable balance in the finances of the State, and such considerations have indeed been fundamental <Col N="1339" /> to the budget strategy of the Government.</P>
    <P>But from the beginning of the budgetary exercise the Government had another priority goal.  It was made clear before Christmas that, whatever the difficulties, the interests of the less well-off in the population would be protected in the provisions of the budget.</P>
    <P>That pre-budget commitment was of the greatest importance and by making it the Government were concerned that it should be understood and accepted in the national community. What was at stake was the maintenance of the basic position of many thousands of men, women and children who are deprived because of age, illness, widowhood or unemployment.</P>
    <P>It was accepted by the Government that in a time of recession there is a special community responsibility to ensure that the poor are not called on to bear burdens which can be, and must be, borne by those in more fortunate circumstances.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Bill now before the House reflects the impact of the current economic situation.  However by far the most important consideration is that the progress made to date in improving the level of payments should be maintained.  This has been done.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will be welcomed by Seanad Éireann and I ask for expeditious consideration of it so that its provisions can come into operation next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the annual Social Welfare Bill implementing the budget decision which applies a 10 per cent increase across the board in regard to social welfare payments. That is the situation which we know since the budgetary speech of the Minister for Finance.  I should like to inject into this debate some reality in regard to what exactly a 10 per cent increase means in the context of what we have at the moment.  It can be reasonably described as hyper-inflation in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says in <Col N="1340" /> his statement that between February, 1973, and November, 1975, there has been an increase of 52 per cent in the consumer price index, that is for only three-and-a-half years.  That is the first note of reality.  We are now talking about figures in estimating the real gain in social welfare advances or improvements.  Figures mean very little but, unfortunately, figures and paper money are the tools and trade of conmanship.  Basically what counts in regard to money in one's pocket is what one can buy.  One gets the perspective of the social welfare increases into context when one looks at&mdash;on the Minister's own admission &mdash;a 52 per cent rise in the consumer price index over the past three-and-a-half years.</P>
    <P>However, that was inflation.  We had inflation between February, 1973, and November, 1975, inflation of the order of a 52 per cent increase in the consumer price index.  What we are now witnessing in the early months of 1976 is not inflation but hyper-inflation and this is very much borne out by the latest figures which have come to hand and can be related to the 52 per cent increase in the consumer price index in the past three-and-a-half years to a situation where our price increase on present trends in 1976 will be of the order of 28 per cent.  This is a situation which has been assessed by an independent survey and has been reported already.  It has been positively estimated that for the three months to February of this year prices rose by 7.1 per cent.  Projecting that forward into the rest of this year one is in the appalling prospect of a 28 per cent increase in the cost of living in this year alone.  So, taken in conjunction with&mdash;on the Minister's admission&mdash;a 52 per cent increase over the past three-and-a-half years, we are now faced with a 28 per cent increase in this current year.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to the social welfare provisions is to increase across the board various social welfare payments by 10 per cent.  So there is a 10 per cent increase in 1976 related to a projected increase of 28 per cent in the cost of living in the current year. That is the reality.  The reality is that the 10 per cent increase is not anywhere <Col N="1341" /> near dealing with the problem of hyper-inflation.  At least in Britain, which has been rightly described as the lame duck economy of the European Economic Community, they have set about tackling inflation and Mr. Harold Wilson rightly said in one of his farewell comments that the thing of which he was proudest was the fact that he had achieved a national partnership in regard to tackling the question of incomes, inflation and so on and that in the past year-and-a-half he had succeeded in coming together with Mr. Jack Jones in getting the British people to adopt £6 a week flat increase across the board.  This is the target that is currently in the process of implementation.  It will restrain incomes and ensure that a positive effort will be made on the basis of partnership to deal with inflation by restraint in that area.  Certainly Mr. Harold Wilson has succeeded.  We do not have any evidence of success by our Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to set my contribution in the context of what the Parliamentary Secretary did when he appealed to us to look at the social welfare provisions &ldquo;in the overall context of national strategy&rdquo;. He asked us to have a discussion in depth of the proper social components of national strategy.  Social <Col N="1342" /> welfare improvements are one of the components of national strategy and must be related to the overall effort to corral inflation.  I referred to the fact that Mr. Harold Wilson of Britain was rightly proud of the fact that he had, through the acceptance of the £6 a week formula, made a positive contribution towards rescuing the lame duck economy of the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>We still have our lame duck waddling on in the course of successive failures to reach any agreement on the new wage pact. Fundamentally, what we are talking about on social welfare provisions is the reality of the payments that are being made.  Payments will continue to be unreal, to be paper money payments, as long as the national strategy is geared towards a policy of unemployment and hyper-inflation. The success of the steps that have been taken to rescue the lame duck economy of our neighbouring island have been highlighted by a recent survey which puts consumer prices now in Ireland at 6 per cent ahead of Britain.  Over a period of two to three years we ran side by side in inflation but we are now moving towards hyper-inflation by running ahead of them to the extent of 6 per cent at present.</P>
      <P>This puts the 10 per cent paper increase into perspective in regard to our national strategy.  At a hyper-inflation rate of 28 per cent at present we are giving paper increases of 10 per cent.  The reality is that we are falling behind by 18 per cent in real payments to social welfare recipients.  They are going to get 18 per cent less in purchasing power in their pockets compared with what they had last year because the consumer price index rose by 28 per cent and they have received a 10 per cent increase.  That is the matter in perspective and in focus.  That is the real social component in the national strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in the Parliamentary Secretary here, or Senator Halligan last week, or the Tánaiste very recently, in public debate saying what improvements should be made, <Col N="1343" /> what developments should be carried out and the necessity for a new plan, a new approach.  These men are members of the Government which has been in office for the past three years. They are not members of a debating society.  They are concerned with Government and Government is about making decisions.  It is not about talking out loud, producing blueprints, or uttering nice clichés as to what is required to further our economic and social development. They should be making decisions, not merely talking about what should be done.  They are members of the Government who do not seem to realise they are in Government.  They often complain that Fianna Fáil do not seem to realise that they are in Opposition.  In the Parliamentary Secretary's script he says:</P>
    <P>It is out of the question that we should allow our fellow-citizens who have in effect been betrayed by the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system to suffer substantial deprivation.</P>
    <P>Who has betrayed them?  Who is responsible for the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This happens to be March, 1976.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have been in power for the past three years.  He is not in Opposition any more; he is part of the Government apparatus that has been directing and guiding our economy for the past three years.  He is, therefore, responsible for what he calls, in his own words, the betrayal by the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system.  He is responsible for the substantial deprivation that has resulted from the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system.  All that can mean, if words mean anything, is that there has been hyper-inflation and massive unemployment over the past three years.  I do not <Col N="1344" /> know who has betrayed our fellow-citizens; I do not know who is responsible for the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system; I do not know who is responsible for the substantial deprivation of which the Parliamentary Secretary speaks unless it is the people who have been in charge of our economy for the past three years. Surely it is legitimate to suggest that the sooner the members of the Government and, in particular the Labour members of the Government, get off the tight-rope of dialectical debate and get down to the brass tacks of assuming responsibility and getting on with the job of dealing with the root cause of the deprivation which many of our citizens are feeling at present. The root cause has been to allow inflation to drift into hyper-inflation and to allow unemployment to continue so that now we have a unique situation in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got the combination of hyper-inflation and high unemployment. The Ministers for Social Welfare and Finance see no way out of this.  That is the basic social component of national strategy to use the Minister's own words.  The basic social component of national strategy must be to kill inflation and to get people back to work on the basis of an expanding economy.  In that way we can then afford far more than a 10 per cent paper increase in regard to social welfare payments.  That is what Government is about in the context of the Irish situation at present.  It is about getting the economy moving. Until we get the economy moving, we cannot really have the appropriate social components in a national strategy. The social component in a national strategy must be to give our people social welfare increases which have a reality in real purchasing power and are not just paper increases not even coping with the inflationary leap that is current.  We do not want increases of 10 per cent on paper related to an increase in hyper-inflation of 28 per cent.  We want some reality injected in to economic thinking.  The reality of economic thinking today is to get down to brass tacks and have what Harold Wilson has achieved in <Col N="1345" /> Britain, have a national partnership in regard to all elements in society, give the required leadership that is needed to ensure that national partnership, to see that everybody in our society accepts restraint in the current year, to ensure that the Government get their priorities right in regard to capital investment and to ensure that employment is the priority and not cater for unemployment.  The Government should get their priorities right to ensure above all else that we can do this through positive Government planning.  I have referred to three Labour Party members already and I am going to refer to a fourth, the Minister for Labour.  The other three, Deputy Corish, Deputy Cluskey, and Senator Halligan, have engaged in dialectical Marxist-type exercises about new dimensions of planning and so on as if they were at a schoolboy debating society.  The other gentleman, the Minister for Labour, has lately taken to berating the EEC.  That is his particular contribution to his non-event as Minister for Labour.  There is no point in blaming the EEC.  We are substantial beneficiaries from the EEC. The EEC are practically subsidising <i>in toto</i> the AnCO retraining programme which is the most positive programme being undertaken at present in regard to retraining and adapting workers in a period of unemployment. Were if not for the EEC at present, AnCO could close down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not the contribution <i>in toto.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about cost/benefit analysis and effectiveness in regard to the retraining programme which will ensure that our workers and our young people, in particular&mdash; 52,000 of our young people leave post-primary education every year&mdash;adapt to society in job earning functions. AnCO would not be effective at all were it not for EEC funds, channelled out of the social action programme fund.  It is futile for the Minister for Labour to again discuss the inadequacy of EEC help when he can double that programme out of national resources.  There is nothing whatever <Col N="1346" /> to inhibit or prohibit the Government from doubling the fund towards AnCO, to quote one example.  Again, of course, that would be a positive policy for employment, whereas the priorities are wrong in that the only positive policy appears to be one of catering for unemployment.  Of course, that has to be done.  I am not objecting to the fact that there are increases in the Social Welfare Bill because once you have created a problem you have to mitigate the problem as best you can.  But this is Government by reaction, not Government by action.  Government by reaction is seeking to uphold an edifice that is in the course of collapsing by reason of the Government's own action in regard to inflation and unemployment. Fair enough.  They are doing what they can in giving a 10 per cent increase. That is all they can afford. But there is not the same dedication towards getting the capital programme right.  There is not the same dedication towards getting private house building going, in providing the infrastructure of water and sewerage required to sustain the building industry. There is not the same energy about getting people back to work. There is not the same energy about the social action programme of retraining which as I say, would be on the floor were it not for EEC aid. There is not the same urgency about the fundamental social components in national strategy, to quote the Minister for Social Welfare.  I regard the social components of our national strategy in a different light from the view being adopted by the Government. I regard the most fundamental social component in our national strategy as full employment.  I am an old-fashioned socialist in that respect. I regard full employment as the basic objective of social philosophy and the basic social component of any political or economic philosophy.  I would regard that as the number one target and number one social component in any national strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Priority number two is to cater for the inadequacy of dealing with the main social component, which is the provision of full employment.  The inadequacy of dealing with that social <Col N="1347" /> component, priority number one, is reflected here in the need to have provisions in this Bill to cater for massive unemployment.  It is a very necessary Bill, one that we support, but one, in my assessment of the social priorities, which must come second to the basic social objective of full employment. Because of the total inadequacy in dealing on the one hand with employment and on the other hand the positive encouragement towards hyper-inflation, on which we are now engaged, we have a Bill which is inadequate in the extreme to deal with the problem created by the inadequate order of priorities assessed by the Government.  We have a Bill which, in real terms, gives a 10 per cent increase to cater for a 28 per cent increase in the current cost of living in 1976.  That is the nub of the issue. The combination of policies of inflation and unemployment, the creation of stagnant inflation and hyper-inflation has resulted in Ireland currently running ahead of Britain by 6 per cent in regard to inflation, currently in 1976 working towards, unfortunately, a 28 per cent increase and a 10 per cent increase is given of a paper category, or character, to deal with the real decrease in the value of money which we are suffering from. It is rather tragic that all this is taking place while the other countries with whom we trade are pulling out of their inflation.  That is why I use the word &ldquo;hyper-inflation&rdquo;, because hyper-inflation is inflation upon inflation. The United States of America, Germany, even the lame duck economy of Britain, are now pulling out of the inflationary trauma of last year. We are not and because we are not, we are going to be left with inflation while the other economies with whom we trade are reflating.  The United States of America, Canada, Germany, all the countries in the EEC with whom we trade, including Great Britain, will at the end of this year be reflating their economies because they will have tackled inflation. We will be caught up in the tailrace of their reflation.  So we will have hyper-inflation on hyper-inflation on present trends.  It is very sad.  That is <Col N="1348" /> the basic social component in viewing this Social Welfare Bill in perspective. That is the perspective in which we can view dispassionately the 10 per cent paper increase in social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise the problem which faces us in that apparently the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Welfare has been unable to remain here.  We are always glad to see the present Parliamentary Secretary here.  It seems quite futile to continue with this debate under these circumstances.  I have never before known it to happen that during the opening speech of the Opposition the Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, was unable to remain.

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  First of all, it is obvious from Senator Lenihan's remarks that he has deliberately omitted the reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech in which a guarantee has been given that the recipients of social welfare will be protected against the erosion of purchasing power, if there is any erosion.  It is therefore wrong just to put the 10 per cent increase against what he calls the projected cost of living increase of 28 per cent for the coming year.  Two of the trade marks of this Government's activity in the social welfare field since they came into office in 1973 have been, first, in raising what was a deplorable level of social welfare benefits to what is only a just and equitable level, and secondly bringing within the social welfare ambit many categories of people who had been omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can, if one so wishes, always dispute figures.  But we must accept, on the basis of the figures that have been given, that between July, 1973, and April, 1976, growth in personal rates on the social insurance scheme have risen between 89 per cent and <Col N="1349" /> 110 per cent, with child dependant rates going up between 130 per cent and 160 per cent.  The growth in maximum personal assistance rates has been between 96 per cent and 122 per cent, with the child dependant rates going up by between 139 per cent and 180 per cent.  These are real increases when seen in the context of the cost of living.  Our consumer price index increase between February, 1973, and November, 1975, was 52 per cent.  Even if we allow an increase for this year, there will be a very substantial real gain by the recipients under the social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government have, in their budget statement, guaranteed that the recipients of social welfare will be protected against any erosion of the purchasing power.  This is to be complimented. When this change was made in October, 1975, it was the first time this had ever been done by any Government.  It was to be welcomed. Far too often in the past we had seen any increase given in the first part of the year eroded by the end of that same year.  That will not happen under this Government.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in a discussion on this Bill, wants us to get away from the old traditional attitude that this was, again, the annual Social Welfare Bill which provided certain increases in benefits and increases in social insurance contributions to meet those increased benefits. He is conscious of an attitude which, unfortunately, and, I think, rather disgracefully, is growing in this country of criticising the social welfare system and, particularly, the unemployed people who are benefiting under the social welfare scheme.</P>
    <P>The social welfare scheme embraces almost 900,000 people.  It covers a much larger field than one is sometimes led to believe.  It covers the old, widows, orphans, the sick and the unfortunate unemployed.  The fact that the figure is at 900.000 is a credit to this Government, because only for their bringing into the social welfare ambit certain categories in the past three years, the same number of people would not be benefiting <Col N="1350" /> through our social welfare schemes. The criticism which I detect growing is particularly aimed at the unemployed. We have to be very careful to see where this criticism is coming from and identify its source to see if it is justifiable.  It is a criticism which is aimed and directed in a rather subtle way.  I have no doubt that it is coming from people who themselves may never face the prospect of unemployment, who may never have it come to their own doorstep.  People who, in addition to never facing the prospect of unemployment, may have a certain hankering for a return to the old days when the employee was regarded as a sort of hewer of wood and drawer of water, to be picked up and disposed of at a whim.  We want to advance from this stage to a stage where every citizen of this State is regarded in an equal and just way. Allied to the criticism of the unemployed has been a sort of advocacy that they should be put to work, whether they are put to work in so-called community schemes, or other schemes.  We have to be careful about this.  The unemployed have paid, perhaps for two-thirds of their lives, insurance contributions as a security against the rainy day which, unfortunately, I would think comes to every employee at least once in his lifetime.  Whatever these community schemes are called, there is attached to them&mdash;and this is the experience in any country which has started these schemes&mdash;a stigma.  It will be the stigma that these are people who are on the dole and, therefore, they are dole workers.  The only thing we would be short of in that instance would be perhaps to give them a striped uniform, because there would be a certain identity attached to those unfortunate people.  A stigma will be attached to them which I certainly would not like to see imposed upon them.</P>
    <P>There are also practical difficulties in the administration of such schemes. I could foresee a situation where a community work scheme could be operated in some areas of the country but which it would not be feasible to operate in other areas.  There would, therefore, be discrimination.  Why <Col N="1351" /> should some people who are unemployed have to go out and work while other people, because there are no community schemes available, not have to do so?  The trade unions would possibly also have reservations on this whole matter.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Parliamentary Secretary has always been quick off the mark to refute such an attitude about the unemployed.  Trade unions should now come into the picture. There is an obligation on trade unions to voice their objections to such projected schemes.  There is a far more dangerous element in the advocacy of such work for the unemployed. I see in it a bias against certain categories of people and it contains very dangerous implications.  There are enough rifts and divisions in this country without causing further ones.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay any more. Speakers coming after me will refute anything that has been said by Senator Lenihan.  This Government have got their policy right in regard to social welfare.  It has been made clear by them over the past number of years that, no matter what difficulties come along on the economic front, the people less well able to look after themselves will be protected by this Government.  That is a highly desirable action by any Government in any country at any time and it is very creditable, particularly in times of economic recession abroad.  I want to conclude on this point.  In both Houses on previous occasions Opposition speakers have far too often tried to create the impression that what has been happening as regards inflation over the last three or four years is peculiar to this country and this country alone.  Anybody who reads the daily papers, or listens to the news, knows that is not the situation.</P>
    <P>When this budget was framed it appeared we had got inflation rates of last year's 20 per cent plus on a reducing level.  That is still the hope of this Government.  The Government are taking measures in their budgetary provisions to try and ensure that nothing inflationary is done.  If by any chance the 10 per cent provided <Col N="1352" /> in the budget for social welfare recipients does not meet any erosion in purchasing power which they suffer in the remaining nine months of this year, the Government will take active and quick steps to ensure that that erosion is counterbalanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House, as Senator Lenihan has already said, welcome this Bill as a Bill which does a little, if not very much, to improve the conditions of those on social welfare.  Unfortunately, while we welcome it&mdash;I have no desire whatever to hold it up&mdash;one must point out that it in no way does anything to raise the standards of social welfare payments, pensions and so on, and, in fact, the likelihood is that during the year it will prove entirely inadequate in the face of the rate of inflation that we have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan pointed out that an independent survey had said that in the three months ended last February, 1976, there had been a 7.1 per cent rise in living costs in this country.  It is a rather strange thing, incidentally, that we had to rely on an independent survey.  The official cost of living index which was taken up on the 15th February last should have been published long since for the three months ending February.  It is difficult to know why it has not been, but it has not been, and one has to rely apparently on these independent private surveys. In fact, the rise in the first three months of this year was probably greater than this, because after the budget and the consequent price increases caused by it, we had on 1st March the very heavy increase in VAT, the rise in the cost of CIE fares and so on.  It is likely that in the first three months of the year the cost of living has been rising at a rate of somewhere around 8 or even 9 per cent, which would mean over 30 per cent if spread over a whole year.  Fortunately, I think we can be reasonably certain that the cost of living will not continue to rise at this rate in this year.  How far it will rise it is impossible at this stage to say, but I would think that perhaps the ICTU estimate that there will be a 20 per cent rise in prices this year may not be too far off <Col N="1353" /> the mark.  Going on the ICTU estimate of a 20 per cent rise in the cost of living this year in the 12 months ending next December, the 10 per cent increase given in this Bill is clearly entirely inadequate.  It is a tragedy that after three years of this Government, with all the boasting that is going on about improvements in social welfare and so on we have now reached the stage as a result of Government incompetence that the social welfare beneficiaries are going backwards rather than forwards.</P>
    <P>I know the Parliamentary Secretary has said that when the cost of living has shown an increase of beyond the 10 per cent mark a further increase would be allowed.  One wonders, indeed, as one so often does with this Government, which bit of the Government at any one time is speaking for the Government and which is not. We have had from the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions during and since the budget debates the statement that there can be no additional expenditure in this year's budget and that any further expenditure will mean further taxation.  There is, of course, no sum anywhere in the budget for any further increases. What the Parliamentary Secretary in effect is telling us is that not that there may be, but that there will be a supplementary budget in the autumn and that there will be further taxation. This is the prospect that he holds out for the taxpayers, the employed and the unemployed, that there will be further taxation in the autumn, not as a possibility but as a definite statement, because we all know that there simply could not be a price rise of as low as 10 per cent in this year.  It is going to be well beyond it, and, as I say, the ICTU suggest 20 per cent, which I would think is not too far out.</P>
    <P>There is going to be, in other words, a further budget, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, and further taxation.  This is because the Government failed to incorporate in the first budget of this year an adequate amount in order to ensure that, even though there might be no improvement in our condition, at least the social welfare beneficiaries would not fall back <Col N="1354" /> in this year.  Enough money was not provided in the budget to ensure that during the year they would be able to hold their existing position.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, as he often does, boasted to us of the increased spending in the past three years on social welfare.  As far as that is concerned, we in Fianna Fáil are entirely in favour of such increased spending.  We are happy that it has taken place, but the tragedy has been &mdash;which has had disastrous consequences for the country&mdash;that having spent this money, no adequate provision was made to meet this expenditure by the Government.  The result of this, not merely in the field of social welfare but many other fields, was that you have this year a planned deficit, a current deficit in the budget of £327 million.  One wonders&mdash;it is a rather useless activity&mdash;what could have been done with that £300 million to provide employment.  If the budget had been balanced, or even an approximation of balance had been reached, instead of the spendthrift progress of the last few years, that £327 million would have been available to take people off the unemployment register, to improve the economy of the country in every possible way, to make much of this social welfare expenditure unnecessary.  We have had in recent days the necessity of the Government to raise an enormous loan from the EEC, a loan which does not even go half way to meeting the current deficit, a loan which comes with conditions that have been accepted by the Government, which will prevent them from continuing to expend at the rate that they have been expending. Indeed, allied to this we have had the statement from the Minister for Finance in the budget that this enormous £327 million current deficit is to be eliminated over three years. I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is better aware than I am of the consequences of this.  It is going to mean that over the next three years&mdash;and indeed it may extend to five or ten years&mdash;it is going to be difficult to give any further increases in social welfare benefits.  It may be very difficult to prevent still further slipping back, as will happen this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> We have the situation, as a result of this enormous deficit financing which has been going on, where the Taoiseach has pointed out that a great part of the enormous unemployment we are experiencing at present is due to excessive spending by the Government. The Taoiseach has made this clear.  He pointed out that since this Government came into office, Government spending has increased from 42 per cent of the national income to 58 per cent.  The Taoiseach has admitted that this is a sort of albatross hanging round the necks of the people. It has had disastrous effects on the economy in bringing about the enormous number of unemployed and, in particular, in bringing about the runaway inflation we suffer from at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey repeated the proposition which is so often put forward on behalf of the Government: &ldquo;Why should the Government be blamed for inflation, does it not exist everywhere?&rdquo; It does but it is a great deal lower everywhere else in Europe than it is here.  Not only is it lower and has been consistently lower but it is falling very rapidly.  Nearly all the countries of Western Europe, including Great Britain, will see very rapid falls this year in their rate of inflation. Only in Ireland is it likely to be, if not as great as last year, at any rate only marginally less.  Even England, the sick man of Europe, apparently may well succeed in getting inflation this year into single figures.  Certainly, it is likely that their rate of inflation by the end of this year will be not much more than half our rate.  Even Greece, which had really runaway inflation two years ago, up to 30 per cent, an enormous figure, expects to have a rate of inflation this year of 10 per cent.  In Ireland, however, inflation is not falling, and during the first three months of this year is rising perhaps more rapidly than ever before.  Even if there is an improvement in the rest of the year, which one certainly hopes there will be, inflation will be worse in Ireland than in any other part of Western Europe, <Col N="1356" /> except perhaps Italy&mdash;I am not sure what the position will be there and they are not necessarily an example that we should follow.</P>
    <P>One of the sections of this Bill puts an extra £1.53p per week on the insurance stamp.  This is not, of course, merely to cover the cost of increasing rates in this Bill.  There is, in addition, £8 million profit for the State. It is an extension of the budget.  It is a further £8 million in taxation which is imposed on the workers and employers and they pass it on to other workers&mdash;£8 million more than is needed to pay for the benefits contained in the Bill.  The cost on industry, leaving aside services and so on, will be in the region of £20 million.  I would be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what estimates have been made in his Department with regard to the unemployment that this additional impost will create.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that the Minister for Labour, when discussing the matter of equal pay and the £6 million which this would cost Irish industry, claimed that this sum would create 10,000 unemployed. In the light of that, how many unemployed does the Parliamentary Secretary estimate will result from this impost of £20 million, including £8 million which is merely thrown into the general budget as an additional form of taxation?  I take it that estimates have been made.  I should like to know what they are.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary concluded with a paragraph which states:</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Bill now before the House reflects the impact of the current economic situation.  However, by far the most important consideration is that the progress made to date in improving the level of payments should be maintained.  This has been done.</P>
    <P>This has not been done.  As I pointed out, the level of payments has not been maintained.  The money amount has been increased but the beneficiaries under the various social welfare schemes would be far better off this year if the Government had <Col N="1357" /> dealt with inflation, if they had eliminated inflation, as they promised to do before they took office.  The beneficiaries would be far better off without inflation and without this Bill.  The effects of this year's rate of inflation and this Bill, taken together, mean a decrease in the real value of all these payments under the Bill of some 10 per cent, except in the event, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests, of a supplementary budget later in the year, which will have a further catastrophic effect on the general economy.  How anyone can suggest that in present economic conditions, with the amount of taxation imposed in the recent budget, a further budget and further taxation could be tolerated by the economy is beyond imagination.</P>
    <P>The danger is that, because of the financial irresponsibility of the Government, for years to come no real further improvement will be possible until the financial chaos created by the Government has been ended. The Minister for Finance said that the threat of eliminating £300 million deficit over three years will involve, if carried out, not merely no further increases&mdash;such as are in the Bill&mdash;but very heavy spending cuts.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill but we regret that, due to circumstances, not an act of God as the Parliamentary Secretary seems to suggest, but Government incompetence and irresponsibility in the financial field, the Bill is not an advance; a moderate retreat is the only way of describing it.</P>

      <P>I want to advert to the necessity for the expeditious passage of the Bill so that it may become law next week. My reason for that is that it affects the most vulnerable section of our community.  Therefore, my remarks on the Bill before the House will be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, having listened to the two Fianna Fáil speakers I suffer from some confusion on a number of points. On the one hand, their suggestion appears to be that the Government, by introducing in one section the social insurance stamp, will impose a <Col N="1358" /> cost of £20 million.  That will have an effect on employment.  I am at a loss to understand whether the Fianna Fáil Party are in favour of deficit budgeting or not.  The question which arises is a simple one.  If the Government did not borrow now, what would be the level of unemployment? Given the level of unemployment which would arise from not borrowing what then would the social welfare commitment be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says that unemployment has caused all this borrowing.  I am quoting the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this notion of deficit budgeting I want to raise another point which is closely related.  I express confusion as to whether that party stand in favour of deficit budgeting or not.  They want to quote different members of the Coalition Government.  It would not cost me very much effort to quote several leading members of the opposite party, some of whom announced themselves as old-fashioned socialists and others who in the same week denounced the socialist element within the Government.  Let us be clear as to where confusion lies.</P>
      <P>On the subject of deficit budgeting the statement has been made that the books should have been balanced. Have the people who made such statements&mdash;apart from consultation with their colleagues who apparently want everybody to work&mdash;worked out the implications, given existing financial structures, of balancing the books? Who would it have benefited?  Let us be clear on this.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary and I are under any belief that unemployment, bringing the necessity for social welfare, is an act of God.  We have never attributed the fluctuation in the economy to divine acts.  This debate has been broadened into an attack on economic and social planning.</P>

      <P>Three separate quotations were made by Senator Lenihan.  He spoke about the call for economic and social planning by the Tánaiste.  He spoke about the call for economic planning by Senator Halligan.  He suggested that what was required was not planning but action.</P>
      <P>Here again we have a confusion.  A party unsure as to whether they are in favour in the short term of deficit budgeting or balancing the books, with its related unemployment defects, its related social welfare payments defects, are also unsure as to what their attitude should be towards social and economic planning.</P>
      <P>I make another point for the record of this House.  The first economic programme of 1958 to 1963 made no reference to the social component of economic planning.  The second economic programme&mdash;both are programmes, not plans&mdash;had a few flimsy columns which related to the social component of economic programming. The second programme was abandoned, including the few flimsy paragraphs which made reference to social need.  There was a long period available to people in both Houses of the Oireachtas, to make a call for economic and social planning.  I would argue that if this endeavour had been begun and if people had wanted to relate the resources of this State, human, material and entrepreneurial together in such a way as to create a structure which would have employed all of our people, they had plenty of time to do it.  But it was they who believed the economy operated on divine principles.  It was they who invoked the principle that when there was economic growth it came out of some great space.</P>
      <P>There is a consistency between what I have heard this morning and what is available on the records of both Houses.  I pay tribute to the two speakers on the opposite side for that. They believe that social welfare payments should be paid out of a residue. I chose my words very carefully.  The statement was made in the other House.  One speaker spoke about the upsetting country we had created for the poor people.  What have the present Government done?</P>

      <P>Column 1892, Volume 288, No. 12 of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
      <P>They have taken the joy out of motoring.  They have taken the joy out of the pint of stout to the point where now the publican is going on short-time, and many of his staff are working shorter hours.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Opposition would have established their social welfare policy on a society that wanted to retain joy in motoring, joy in the consumption of alcohol.  They would have said to the social welfare recipient, &ldquo;When something is left over we will spread it around as best we can.&rdquo; That is what they did all the years they were in power.  They are confused as to whether you believe in deficit spending or not, confused as to whether they believe in economic planning or not.  I put to them that they are unwilling to transfer resources from one consuming category in the population to another consuming category of the population.  I would expect a curtailment in my type and range and level of consumer expenditure to assure the consumer expenditure of those within the need categories of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>Are the Opposition in favour of indexation? There seems to be an argument between two kinds of statistical interpretation.  On the one hand it has been said in the introductory speech to this Stage of the Bill that there has been a real increase in actual expenditure in social welfare payments.  On the other hand Senator Lenihan suggested there was a shortfall of 18 per cent between projected increase in the consumer price index of 28 per cent and the suggested increase in payments of 10 per cent. Does this mean that all of the time the previous Government were in power they believed in their hearts that social welfare payments should not be paid from a residue but should have been attached to the cost of living index?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  As I see it there is a difference of 18 per cent in the gap between 28 per cent and 10 per cent.  This problem of indexation is a most important one.  I am repeating the phrase made at the beginning: the social policy component of plan.  If you believe in index-action what you do is this: you add an immediate short-term measure; you uphold the social welfare payments not only to their purchasing power but also to the general standard of living.</P>
      <P>I see what happened in the last three years in the real increase in real expenditure and social welfare payments as going part of the way of relieving social distress.  I see it also as having another character, as being to some extent an attempt to create in the insurable population a philosophy which would accept responsibility for the weaker sections.  Therefore, we would not only to some extent keep up with our expenditure but we would gradually begin to create an atmosphere where people would give more towards the weaker sections from those who are generating revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am under no illusion as to what is possible.  A social welfare policy that represents a dynamism in payments, more expenditure, more humane treatment of people is needed.  There are four components in the present Bill.  The Bill is to give a 10 per cent increase in difficult times to people who need it.  It is to extend the maximum period of unemployment benefit.  It is to increase the <Col N="1362" /> rate of social insurance contributions to take up the cost of unemployment. It is to have some specific social policy component.  It does not come well from those who did not go back far to make criticisms against these real gains.  The Parliamentary Secretary has said on a number of occasions that he is willing to review the increase of 10 per cent.  To some extent this takes account of the gap of 18 per cent between the figure of 28 per cent used and the figure of 10 per cent provided in the present measure.</P>
    <P>Nobody should be apologetic about such a review.  The 28 per cent which has been given, is, to my mind, excessive.  We may well have a figure less than 28 per cent and we may have a lesser gap to make up.  If that gap is to be made up and if we need to improve the condition of those who are receiving social welfare, certainly the Parliamentary Secretary should not be apologetic as to the source of such relief.  In so far as reference has been made to it, what could be done in the present times to ensure that there is a social policy component to the state of the economy at any one time?  This is the opportunity seized in the other House again this morning. It is a wonderful opportunity to debate what the poor Parliamentary Secretary can do given that the country is in the tremendous economic mess it is.</P>
    <P>At present capital works programmes exist which could be designed by local authorities, important infrastructural works.  They are more imaginatively designed than ever for the very simple reason that the cost of implementing them has been transferred to central funds by a figure of almost 50 per cent.  Those in charge of designing such schemes have been able to be imaginative.  It is true that the figure of unemployment is at an all-time high.  It is true of the commercial banks that the surplus over savings on deposit is much more now and more than it ever was before. What is missing in putting the three of those together? Reform of the financial institutions, moving dynamically towards financial planning itself, and interfering with the relationship of, for example, central banking to commercial <Col N="1363" /> banking and to adequate planning.</P>
    <P>I would welcome if a Senator on the other side said &ldquo;We are in favour of that,&rdquo; because all the time their banking policy was based on profit to the commercial banks.  The commercial banks amassed huge reserves during all those years of alternative Government.  If there is this great will to put our people to work, let the young people of the community not be disillusioned by having to be unemployed, what imaginative idealism. Is there a commitment to interfere sufficiently with the private banking sector to invest those surplus funds? For many of us who are in that derided section of the present Coalition arrangement, who are on the left wing of it, which part of it speaks, people like myself, it would help out immensely to know that the party which is the bigger party, is in favour of this new equation, the equation that will put the surplus capital, the capital programmes themselves, and the workers to work by saying that they will attack the banking system. To make such a call, the call to put workers to work, without having the political will to interfere and make the economic and financial arrangements, is to indulge in rhetoric.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his speech said that it is out of the question that we should allow our fellow citizens, who have in effect been betrayed by the inefficiency and unequal working of our economic system, to suffer substantial deprivation.  That is a good and correct statement.  What I have just said about the surplus of labour available, the surplus of savings as related to speculative investment outcome, the availability of capital programmes, the non-fit of these three together to create jobs in this country, is exactly what we mean by economic inefficiency.  What economic efficiency would there be if all of these resource elements were put together, creating employment and thereby relieving a strain on social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>We have spent a great deal of time <Col N="1364" /> in this House discussing the corporation profits tax and we are to spend more time on it.  I wonder when I read the debates of both of these Houses how much time is devoted to considering the condition of the poor people and the condition of another minority, the minority who have done well since the foundation of the State in that they have accrued their profits. If this economy is to be regenerated, it should not be regenerated on the principles which allowed that minority their wealth.  I see in the Bills which are before this House an instrument to make sure that even their most minimal social obligations are met by that small minority who are able to evade taxes systematically and carefully and who recruited the best brains in the country to enable them to do so, systematically, carefully and well over a long period.</P>
    <P>The other section which I particularly commend is that referred to as the attackers by the Parliamentary Secretary, those who have attacked the recipients of social welfare.  I am a member of two local authorities, Galway Borough Council and Galway County Council.  On both, members of the party represented in this House have put down motions criticising dole recipients, in an ill-informed way indeed, in the elementary distinction between for example, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, not to speak of that between abuses in urban areas and abuses in rural areas; general in their stigma, general in their criticisms, general in their abuse; not a bit specific in all of their public life.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that for some it has been a brief public life and I hope it will be a brief public life.  They have not made any commitment to employment. The Minister said in his speech that much of the public criticism of the pay-related benefit system has been ill-informed, crude and confused and has come in the main, from persons and groups which have shown little or no concern for the poor or the unemployed.  He continues to be contemptuous of critics who have never faced and who will never face unemployment and its attendant <Col N="1365" /> stresses and strains.  His job is to make provision for those who face these personal hardships and it is my concern to ensure that they are given every reasonable help.  These people must be stopped now from this kind of criticism.  In stopping them, may I say what is at stake?</P>
    <P>In a time of economic insecurity, certain kinds of forces always rise to the fore, such as the notion that a few people are carrying the burden of some kind of general laziness, the notion that somehow or another the 900,000 recipients&mdash;and of those only a proportion are receiving specific employment benefit&mdash;are somehow remiss or lazy.  What about the people who, without economic recession at all work for only a few hours a day or a year?  The people referred to are people who worked for the most part with their hands and sometimes in semi-skilled occupation?  The greatest incidence of unemployment is in the semi-skilled and unskilled category. They reported in the morning and went off in the evening.  But there were people whose capital worked for them, who sat in their seats and worked for a few hours a year.  They could afford to be unemployed, let me assure you, with great social benefits over a number of years, but they never were. When the economy regenerates itself I hope it is these people who will know these fine and important distinctions.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by drawing attention to a few important points. The Minister in this necessary piece of legislation, which I hope will affect people next week, is once again making an attempt to relieve social distress.  Social welfare legislation is aimed in the short term at relieving social distress.  It cannot, of its nature, eliminate inequality.  What can eliminate inequality is planning, and planning has been called for under the headings of economic planning and social and economic planning.  I believe that the call for a social and economic plan is the more responsible one because it is only when you have established the social goals of your community that you can then use the economy as an instrument to achieve <Col N="1366" /> those social goals.  We should have the fullest debate on those social goals, on the egalitarian society we want to create, on the structural changes we will make so as to ensure that the future resources of the community will not be used like the resources previously were to create huge imbalances between those who possessed and used wealth and those who had no wealth and were ground into poverty.</P>
    <P>A social welfare Act cannot eliminate poverty: it can only reduce the effects of poverty, its worst manifestations. We must always draw these distinctions.  Poverty, as I mentioned in another place, is a consequence of inequality and a society will only eliminate poverty when it has eliminated inequality.  We can only eliminate inequality when we have a social plan which stresses egalitarianism, equal opportunity, and as a related economic plan which uses all the financial and fiscal abilities of the State, its individual and public talent for the achievement of social and general goals&mdash;communal goals rather than individual goals.  I hope that when we have finished discussing the different taxation Bills and that when we are discussing the Finance Bill we will have an imaginative contribution from all sides of this House on how the business of planning will be set about.  The difference in our plans will, I hope, give the major impetus to that debate.  All we are doing this morning is improving the conditions of 900,000 people.  We are not improving their condition to a great extent. We are improving the conditions of those to whom pay-related benefit has been extended for a brief period, people who have worked most of their lives and people who are being regularly uncritically subjected to abuse. People have said that what is needed at present is action.  I agree that action is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that the parameters within which the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Social Welfare has to operate are narrow. Those parameters are not narrow because our inflation rate is worse than international standards.  The <Col N="1367" /> parameters are narrow because we, the people, have a stranglehold on him.  Philosophically we have shown ourselves stranded on the rock of individual aggression rather than inspired by the social commitments and social communal responsibility.  That individual aggression has had its manifestation in the tremendous range of poverty which this present Government inherited, with one child in five deprived and an income of under £800 in one household in four.  This commitment to individual values as opposed to communal values, this notion that we could not have social and economic planning to achieve social aims&mdash;it was this and the lack of planning which narrowed the Minister's focus.  I hope that shortly I shall have the opportunity to welcome him back when, after a debate on the Finance Bills, when Senator Lenihan has given more consideration to the description of himself as an old-fashioned socialist believing in full employment, when he has told us how he proposes to achieve this by my suggested recombination of the resources of this nation for social purposes rather than for individual private greed, then when everybody is in agreement on those aims the Parliamentary Secretary will be coming in, not doling out, as Governments did over the years from the crumbs of the rich man's table, but will be creating a context in which people will, by accident, need social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>So, it is only, therefore, not as a replacement or a substitute for an erosion of inequality and thereby poverty but as a necessary and very immediate and urgent step required to relieve people whom he wants to assist next week that I welcome the Parliamentary Secretary's Bill and I support it.  I hope that he has the opportunity of coming in with more imaginative restructural proposals when we have managed to convince the greedy individuals in our society to have more responsible communal values.</P>

      <P>It has been rather a brief <Col N="1368" /> debate on the Second Stage but despite its brevity it has been a very far-ranging and constructive debate.  The contributions from Senators Lenihan and Yeats, following so close on one another, will always stand out in my mind because after 11 years in this House and some years previously in politics at local level they strike me as two of the most politically dishonest and selective distortions I have heard in my time.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan spoke about a 10 per cent increase this year and he related that to a passage in my speech which he took out of context which said that there was a 52 per cent increase in the cost of living from 1973 to 1976.  He also claimed that 10 per cent in these circumstances was totally inadequate.  When I mentioned a 52 per cent increase in the cost of living over three years I did it in the context that, so far as social welfare was concerned, at the lowest level there had been an increase of 96 per cent and at the highest level there had been an increase of 122 per cent. There is no doubt that under this Government recipients of social welfare have benefited quite considerably. But a more significant figure can be used to show that the policy of redistribution to the poorer sections of our society has been achieved in this area&mdash;not fully achieved, to my liking, but very considerable progress has been made.  The figures that reveal truly and clearly that this redistribution has taken place are found when we look at the percentage of GNP devoted to social welfare.  In 1973, under Fianna Fáil, the proportion of our GNP distributed in social welfare was 6½ per cent.  We are now spending 11 per cent of our GNP on social welfare.  This shows a clear distinction between our priorities in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan spoke of things which he convinced the Chair were relevant to the matter under discussion and since their relevance was accepted by the House, I think I should reply, rather briefly, to some of the comments he made.  I have always accepted that social welfare <Col N="1369" /> cannot be taken in isolation; that the people who depend on social welfare payments have their lives, their standard of living, their opportunities for advancement, determined not by social welfare payments but by all the other aspects of our political policies that have a direct bearing on their lives and on their opportunities. Senator Lenihan spoke about some of these issues.  I am inclined to agree with him to some extent but again, we had a sort of hesitant attempt at a smear campaign against the Tánaiste, the Leader of my party, against Senator Halligan, a Member of this House, in regard to a contribution which I made at another venue regarding national planning.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats also referred to national planning.  Just to put the minds of people who have been probing around in this area at rest I should like to make it quite clear what my political philosophy is.  I am a socialist, but I am not an undercover agent.  I did not come in here pretending to be all kinds of everything, as Senator Lenihan and other members of his party did&mdash;and I shall elaborate on that.  I stood as a socialist; I joined the Socialist Party when I was in my 'teens.  I have been a member of that party since that time and I will continue to be a member of it; so, there is no need to fish around as to what I am or as to what the Leader of my party is as regards his political commitment.  It is quite clear, unequivocal; we were elected to the Oireachtas as members of that party, advocating a socialist philosophy.</P>

      <P>When we talk about economic planning we do so because we are democrats and we believe, and it is in our party constitution, in parliamentary <Col N="1370" /> democracy.  We know that in order to have our policy implemented it is necessary to win the support of the people as expressed through the ballot box and we will continue to advocate and recommend to the electorate the policies which we passionately believe are in the best interests of this nation and the people who dwell in it.  We have no apologies to make in that respect.  I hope that has cleared up the issue as to where we stand and what our political commitment is.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan and Senator Yeats spoke about unemployment and inflation. The two are undoubtedly linked.  We heard from Senator Lenihan that the number unemployed was the cause of all our difficulties.  He and Senator Yeats related the unemployment situation to the policies pursued by this Government.  As far as both Senators were concerned, unemployment, apparently, was unheard of in Ireland before 1973.  I shall go back a little further&mdash;but not too much, just a matter of months&mdash;before this Government took office.  Both Senators who spoke not only had the honour of being Members of this House but both of them also have the honour of representing this country in the European Parliament.  One would reasonably be entitled to expect that they would be aware, indeed if not more aware than others, of the unemployment position in Europe.  The figure of unemployed in the nine EEC countries is five million at present.  I know that Senators Yeats and Lenihan would be most generous in attributing all sorts of influences to the National Coalition Government and the influence they can have on the general situation, but I doubt if even these good Senators would suggest for one moment that our influence could have that impact in Europe.</P>
      <P>Senator Yeats spoke about the heavy borrowing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If my own speech, which was delivered only some minutes previously, was taken out of context when it was being quoted, then I will reserve judgment on that.  I think the Senator referred to £300 million borrowings. <Col N="1371" /> Fianna Fáil, as I understand it, not only from the contributions here this morning but from contributions from other Fianna Fáil leading spokesmen, would have balanced the books and I think Senator Yeats said that this morning.  It would have been a very interesting and very tidy bookkeeping exercise but I wonder would the Senator not agree, and would the House not agree, that in achieving this book-keeping exercise the level of unemployment here would have been very very substantially increased&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The policy pursued by this Government in this respect was to ensure that the greatest number of people possible in the general world-wide economic circumstances were kept in employment; and although I personally find the figures of unemployed frightening, I undoubtedly subscribe to the wisdom of the Government in engaging in borrowing to ensure that the maximum number of people are kept in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, over the years, have always had one great advantage&mdash; they never had a policy on anything. The Senator was able to say&mdash; although I doubt it myself&mdash;that he read Labour Party literature, Labour Party leaflets.  I can assure the Senator that I have never read a Fianna Fáil policy document on any aspect of our national affairs because, as far as I am aware and as far as the great Irish people are aware, none exists.  None exists in the field of social welfare.  This is one of the great difficulties that we have in getting a genuine discussion, a serious debate at national level on the whole area of social welfare because both <Col N="1372" /> this morning and yesterday in the other House, I referred there&mdash;and I will refer again here&mdash;to what the situation was in regard to unemployment, with regard to expenditure in social welfare directly related to that unemployment.  We have approximately 116,000 unemployed now. Senator Lenihan asked why should we talk about it; why should we not do something about it as we were the responsible Government.</P>
    <P>In January, 1973, two months before this Government came into office, the registered figure of unemployed people here was 76,000, and in February, 1973, a general election was declared and during the course of that general election unemployment was not a major issue.  To me that is the greatest indictment of Fianna Fáil rule here for a period of 36 or 37 years, that they had lulled the people into accepting a level of 6 to 7 per cent unemployed&mdash;not during an economic crisis but during a time when they were in office and governing this country.  I mentioned that there were five million unemployed at present in the nine member states of the EEC but if you look back to the '40s, the latter part of the '40s after the war, right through the '50s except for one brief period, right through the '60s and up into the '70s, when Fianna Fáil ruled this country, we had 6 and 7 per cent as an accepted level of unemployment when the rest of Europe had virtually no unemployed people.  Not only did they do that, and preside over it and encourage and further the type of economic policy that led to it, but they had conditioned our people to accepting 6 or 7 per cent unemployed to such an extent that it was not even an issue in a general election that was held here in February, 1973.  So I take with a grain of salt the kind of speeches I hear now from Fianna Fáil benches about the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is probably the greatest social evil that we have and God knows we have many of them. It is not possible to devise policies overnight to reverse the damage that Fianna Fáil have done, but it is possible to try to give these people who <Col N="1373" /> suffer and who are the victims of Fianna Fáil policy some dignity and some level of maintenance because they are the victims of the type of society that Fianna Fáil built.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>On social welfare, I heard from Deputy Lenihan and Deputy Yeats that 10 per cent was not adequate.  I do not regard the levels that are paid under social welfare as adequate.  I have stated factually that they have been greatly improved under this Administration.  I and this Government would like to see them improved further and we will see them improved further.</P>
      <P>But what I would like to know is, if Fianna Fáil are calling for an increase over the 10 per cent at this time, how they would achieve it in view of the following facts.  They bitterly opposed the Wealth Tax and the change in the operation of the mining companies here that would make them provide some return to the National Exchequer; they have called publicly for a cut, ranging from £20 to £30 million in social welfare itself.  They have criticised and, in fact, forced a division in the lower House, on the increase in the price of the stamp.  In view of those facts, would they kindly tell me and the Irish people, how they would improve on the 10 per cent increase that is provided for under this Bill?  I know it is an advantage to a political party who want to engage in political opportunism to have no written policy, no stated policy and blow with any little wind that arises in the country.  I have noticed recently that we have this attempt by Fianna Fáil to be the champion of the better-off members of our society and to try to create an impression that they are being victimised, that all their hard work and dedication are being taken away and handed to a crowd of lay-abouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of criticism and political approach that they have engaged in in the area of social welfare. I would ask them to do only one <Col N="1374" /> thing.  They are a big national party. They have reminded us on several occasions that they are the biggest national party in this country.  Surely as such, it would not be requesting too much that in the field of social welfare which affects so many of the lives of our citizens they would state clearly what they want, how they would achieve it and what it would cost other members of the society to allow them to achieve it.  That is a reasonable request to ask the largest political party in the country&mdash;to state, and let the Irish people know, just what they want in the field of social welfare.  God knows I do not know what they want and I doubt very much that they know themselves what they want.  What they want is to be able to hop on any little bandwagon of discontent that may arise.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the House. There has been a lot achieved.  It is undeniable.  As Senator Michael Higgins said, social welfare alone will not cure the ills of our society.  Social welfare payments can alleviate some of the misery and poverty in our society but it cannot eliminate it.  We have to face up to the fact that if we want to eradicate this social evil, the people who are able to pay will have to pay to do it.  We, as a national community, must ensure that that is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this is the first section that brings in the increase of 10 per cent in rates, I would say something about the question put before us by the Parliamentary Secretary as to what we in Fianna Fáil would do to suggest how this might be raised by more than 10 per cent. <Col N="1375" /> Obviously, it is not the business of the Opposition to tell the Government how to do their business.  They are supposed to do their business.</P>
      <P>There is the fairly obvious point that the Minister could have raised the amounts quite a bit further by maintaining in the social welfare sphere the £8 million excess which was put on the stamp and which is just thrown into the general scheme of the budget as an additional piece of taxation.  If that £8 million which is being raised from the workers were to be used for increasing benefits, that is one obvious simple way in which social welfare benefits could be increased further.</P>
      <P>However, the basic and more important point is that the real cause of the shortfall this year, the inability of the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I accept that he would be very anxious to do better than he is doing in this Bill&mdash; to do any better, even to maintain the existing real level of benefits under these schemes, is the incompetent financial policy of the Government which ultimately, and after doubling the national debt in two years resulting in quite simply running out of money, have had to borrow an enormous amount from the EEC on condition that they are not to borrow any more. The reason why they cannot do any better than they do in this Bill is that they have made a mess of the finances of the country.  All I can say is that if Fianna Fáil had been in office for the past three years the country would not have run out of money and it would have been possible to do better than this Bill.  It is a simple plain statement of fact.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question under this section, dealing with the extension of the period of unemployment benefit.  This is a section that <Col N="1376" /> we are entirely in favour of.  I would be glad to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has any figures as to the number of people who were formerly on unemployment benefit and who have had to go to rely on assistance and the number who will benefit under this section and, in addition, the number who have been on the dole so long that they are unable to benefit under this section.  I would be glad to know what the general position is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not precise figures for this Senator in so far as it fluctuates practically every week.  It would not be possible to have up-to-date figures.  I regard this section as one of the most important new developments in the area of social welfare in so far as it extends for the first time the eligibility for flat rate benefit in the social welfare code.  It is something which has been long overdue and I am glad to see that it has been possible to include it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I could not possibly give the Senator up-to-date figures because it fluctuates from week to week.  He could take it that on pay-related benefit there are approximately 33,000.  When you take that off the total unemployed figure you would find that you have the rest either on benefit or flat rate benefit, but I cannot give precise figures in a breakdown between the two of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little puzzled by this.  This is a matter which will arise under the next section on pay-related benefits.  Perhaps I had better deal with this aspect of the matter on this section.  I will not raise it on the next section again.  As I understand it, the period for pay-related benefit is now the same as for unemployment benefit &mdash;12 months in each case.  It will be extended for three months in each case</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Without the extension they are 12 months each.  The Parliamentary Secretary said there are 33,000 approximately getting pay-related <Col N="1377" /> but I think I am right in saying there are 65,000 on unemployment benefit.  I am puzzled as to how there could be so many on unemployment benefit who do not get the pay-related benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The pay-related benefit only comes into operation between £26 and the £50 ceiling.  Unfortunately in our society for a long long number of years we have had 6 per cent to 7 per cent unemployed.  The figures in relation to these people who have been unemployed for a long number of years, although the actual personnel might have varied during that time, remain fairly static.  None of these people would have built up any previous earning capacity to allow them to qualify for pay-related benefit so that the hard core of unemployed we have had over that long number of years would not be in the pay-related benefit element of the total figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear, then, that some 50 per cent or so of all those on benefit do not get pay-related benefits, which is 33,000 out of somewhere around 65,000 to 66,000, and half of them do not get pay-related benefit at all.  I must say I had not appreciated that.  It is certainly an unfortunate situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number who formerly were on unemployment benefit at least until the enactment of the pay-related Bill, it is clear from the weekly figures we get that, whereas those on benefit are up by approximately 2,000 as compared with this time last year, there are some 13,000 or 14,000 on assistance. Would this be a reflection of the numbers who have had to go over to assistance from benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to this point, until the passage of this Bill, the period of eligibility for benefit was only for a 12-month period.  This will extend it by a further approximately three months.  If you exhausted that period of eligibility you go on over to assistance.  The situation under this Bill is that even had a man exhausted <Col N="1378" /> his 12 months eligibility for benefit but was still within the three months extension period, he would come back into unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I was trying to get some concept of the numbers involved.  It would seem that something in the region of 10,000 have already gone over to assistance and some proportion of that will be saved by the three months more provided for by this Bill.  I just wanted to get some idea of the numbers involved. I appreciate the legal position that formerly after 12 months they had to go over to assistance and now there is a further short period under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not raise again the question of the numbers involved and so on but I am puzzled and saddened by the percentages involved under this section.  Whereas in the initial six-month period of pay-related benefit under the original Act, the benefit is 40 per cent, in the last Act which dealt with this the Minister extended it for three months at 30 per cent.  For the third three-month period it is 25 per cent and now in this Bill it is down to 20 per cent. One wonders at the reason for this, because after all, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, when unemployment begins there are likely to be some sort of family reserves which help to ease the position.  But by the time a man has been unemployed for more than a year, it seems unfortunate that he should be reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  After all, after a year's unemployment quite clearly there are no further reserves of any kind that the family can rely on.  Anyone would have thought they need money a good deal more than they did at the start, but we find that under this Bill the amount given for pay-related benefit is only 20 per cent, half the original 40 per cent.  I do not know whether this is just that <Col N="1379" /> the money is not there, but it seems an unfortunate way of doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that unemployed people or people suffering from a long time illness require as much money as they can get.  However, the Bill dealing with pay-related benefits when it was enacted in 1974 was limited to a six-month period of eligibility.  It has been extended now to a 15-month period.  As the Senator stated, people might have some reserves when they commence their unemployment or sickness period.  I personally doubt that, knowing working-class people.  In the main, the amount of reserves they have with which to face these contingencies are very limited indeed, if at all.  However, I think the Senator would agree that people who have responsibility for the administration of the fund must also take into consideration in any developments or progress that is made in the fund that the fund remains financially viable and healthy in order to ensure that it can meet the commitments which it has to meet and foresee any difficulties before they arise in this respect.  The provisions under this Bill, which extends further the eligibility period is a significant advance on the present situation.  The Bill dealing with pay-related benefits since its introduction has played a very significant role in ensuring against the worst financial repercussions on people and their families who have to face unemployment or sickness, because when we talk about pay-related benefits the whole emphasis seems to be that we are paying out to people who are unemployed.  In fact, 47 per cent of the money paid out in respect of pay-related benefit is for illness.</P>

      <P>I should like to clarify one point.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his last statement said quite a large proportion of pay-related payments is applicable to disability benefit. As he now envisages, in this Bill pay-related benefits will be paid on the cessation certificate or the P45.  I welcome that development because I feel this was one of the anomalies of <Col N="1380" /> the pay-related scheme: it only took into account a man's earnings in the previous year.  Now he envisages that it is applicable immediately.  But cessation certificates or P45's are not normally written for people who are just temporarily ill although entitled to pay-related benefits.  How does the Parliamentary Secretary feel that the worker can overcome this, or are arrangements to be made with employers that all employees who become sick or unemployed will have P45s written for them on the date that they either leave or get sick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>There have been consultations between the Revenue people, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Welfare to ensure the successful operation of the transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that a lot of this money&mdash;I think he said 47 per cent&mdash;goes to people who are sick, but the financial problems of the fund do not derive from this aspect.  I take it that the number of people sick this year is much the same as the number last year or the year before.  Obviously there may be slight fluctuations but they would be slight.  The big problem obviously is caused not by sickness but by the increase in the number who are receiving pay-related benefits on foot of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I accept, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that some workers have no reserves when they become unemployed.  Others may have.  But that is not really the point.  In so far as there are any reserves, they would have gone long before the time the provisions of this section come into force.  Indeed not only that, but in many cases families will have run into debt in an effort to try to maintain some sort of standard of living.  In these circumstances, therefore, it does seem very hard even though one welcomes the passage of the Bill&mdash; quite obviously it will bring about an improvement in people's circumstances&mdash;that the percentage of the actual amount paid should be halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that the fund needs to be <Col N="1381" /> kept solvent.  After all, he has in an earlier section brought in a very large increase of £1.53 on the insurance stamp.  The pay-related payment involved per week is quite small.  One would have thought that a few pence extra would have kept the fund solvent while keeping the percentage the same.  Certainly the £8 million which is being extracted from the fund in order to help out the budget would have been far more than is needed to solve this problem. I do not think that shortage of funds or insolvency of the fund is an adequate explanation.  That could be easily dealt with provided the Minister for Finance was willing to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat the question I put which has not been answered, and that is what estimate has been made as to the effects on unemployment of this impost on industry and services generally?  I take it the Department have made some estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will have any adverse effects on employment. The Senator mentioned this this morning and he spoke about the Minister for Labour's speech on the question of equal pay which would cost the country £6 million with the <Col N="1382" /> consequent loss of 10,000 jobs. Senator Yeats equated that with this situation.  The Senator must be aware that the application of an increase in the insurance stamps applies right across the industrial field.  It would not be a fair equation to make. Senator Yeats must also be aware, as a member of the European Parliament, that the social welfare contributions by employers here are the lowest of any of the nine member states. Therefore, the burden being placed on them is by no means onerous although I admit that in some cases it could cause difficulties.  I stated before that I am unhappy with the financing arrangements of social welfare. A study is being carried out in the Department of Social Welfare with a view to finding alternative means of financing social welfare contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is correct in saying that other European countries have much higher insurance stamp contributions and the impost on both employers and employees is much greater than here. I am well aware of that.  This situation has been ongoing for a period of years, perhaps even generations. The additional annual amounts have been long since absorbed in industry and economic activities generally. That is a different situation.  What is happening here is that in this year of very great depression even under a a recession, when a great many industries, and more particularly services, are put to the pin of their collar to survive, when many firms are having losses and others are not making profits, when the employment of a great many people is on a knife edge, to place an impost of this scale on industry in these circumstances can only have dangerous results.  The Parliamentary Secretary, towards the end of his intervention, admitted that he was worried, that there might be untoward effects.  One cannot, therefore, make a comparison with the Continent where these increases have been happening over a long period.  I am certain he will find that in continental countries which are also suffering from depression in various <Col N="1383" /> degrees, they will not impose an enormous increased impost on industry this year.  Far from it.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that an estimate would have been made.  The Minister for Labour was very quick off the mark to come dashing into the public forum with an estimate of 10,000 unemployed as a result of equal pay.  I presume he had some facts and figures to back this statement in the same way as I hope the Parliamentary Secretary's resources will give him some idea as to the effect of this increase.</P>
      <P>I agree, naturally, that the cost of equal pay is centred in limited areas rather than across the board, but as against this the £20 million here is three times the cost of equal pay and is therefore spread wider, but it is a much larger sum.  I wonder if the burden on the individual industries is all that different, although some of the service industries could be badly affected.  However, it seems that the House is not to be given any estimates from the Parliamentary Secretary. One can only hope that one's fears will not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the number of employers who do not pay the required sum.  There are quite a number of employers who do not fulfil their commitments and I should like an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will pursue this matter.  This is the type of situation which creates anomalies in the scheme&mdash;employers who employ nixers, people who are already signing on, avail of the opportunity of not putting on contributions. Naturally, the more people who contribute the better the scheme will work.  The pity is that people can avoid their commitments in this regard. I know the Parliamentary Secretary would not condone such action, so his Department should make every effort to ensure that such employers are caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to one of the points made by Senator Yeats about the cost of insurance stamps to employers, <Col N="1384" /> it is not all one-sided.  They have other advantages.  They are continually trying to reduce labour and to facilitate this operation there is the Redundancy Payments Act which goes alongside the unemployment pay-related benefit and so on. This makes it easier for an employer to negotiate a reduction in staff numbers.  Apart from that, when an employer pays a redundancy lump sum he receives it back.  On the other hand, if he contributes to the stamp, he asserts certain rights to pension schemes in the fund, that he does not necessarily benefit from the social welfare benefit scheme but in the case of a person reaching a pensionable age under the old age pension or retirement pension, many of the companies which have negotiated pension schemes cut back and take their whack out of the social welfare contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Harte.  One of the problems created by this legislation is that there is a natural incentive to employers to let people off.  On the one hand, we have this rather unsuccessful unemployment premium which pays employers to take people on, and on the other hand we have this type of Bill which makes it worth the employers' while to lay people off.  This is a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care a hoot about the employer.  I am worried about the effects on employment.  Employers will be letting them go.  When people talk about employers in this context there seems to be the implication that you can throw an extra £20 million on to the cost of industrialists&mdash; industrialists are rich, they have lots of money in their pockets, fine yachts and so on.  That is not the way life goes on.  They do not take the £20 million out of their own pockets.  It is handed on in price increases to everybody else.  It has a direct effect on the worker. It serves as an encouragement to lay off workers, makes them less likely to take on new workers.  It is the consumer and the workers I worry about, <Col N="1385" /> not the employer, who, I agree in most cases, is well able to look after himself. If he does look after himself he passes it on to everyone else.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to say that in the number of cases coming before Fóir Teoranta it is alarming the number of employers who have departed from their statutory obligations. A number of the people who have gone to the wall show a tremendous reluctance to give priority to social welfare obligations.  I am sure that if an industry saw itself moving into difficulties and said that the new provisions proposed were a distinguishing factor between their remaining viable and non-viable, they would receive an extremely sympathetic treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of employers not living up to their obligations under the social welfare code has been mentioned.  There are two sides to it.  There are employers who do not stamp cards.  There are also insured persons who draw various forms of social welfare benefit or assistance to which they are not legally entitled.  I have said before and I still maintain that the number of people, whether they be employers or insured persons, who are engaged in this practice is relatively small but it does not make the practice any less serious.  It is one that gives rise to a lot of generalised criticism of the whole social welfare code. It is a practice which gives rise to a climate of opinion which hinders progress being made in the whole area of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am seriously concerned with that.  I can assure the House that in the immediate future new legislation will be introduced which will increase very substantially the penalties that can be imposed by the courts on either employers who do not stamp cards or persons who claim unemployment benefit or assistance to which they are not entitled.  I do not want to put this out of proportion.  The numbers involved are relatively small.  However, it does not make the practice any less anti-social or any more desirable. I can assure the House the penalties that will be introduced under the new legislation will not make it worth <Col N="1386" /> people's while and will act as a very strong deterrent to people who may be contemplating engaging in this practice.</P>

I thought it would have been possible to produce this Bill early enough to allow for it to be processed in the usual way.

The section provides that there will be no charge on the transferor <Col N="1388" /> company when it transfers its assets, but the transferee company will be treated as if it had acquired them at the time and at the price at which they were, in fact, acquired by the transferor company.

      <P>This section provides for an exception to section 135.  That section is not to apply where a company leaves a group as part of a <i>bona fide</i> merger.  There are two safeguards to prevent abuse.  Firstly, the merger must be shown to have been for <i>bona fide</i> commercial reasons and without tax avoidance as a main object and, secondly, &ldquo;merger&rdquo; is fairly closely defined.  To qualify as a merger, the arrangements must provide that a company leaves the group, that an interest in that company's business is acquired by an outside company or companies, and that an interest of equivalent value in the business, or the businesses of the acquiring company or companies, is acquired by a member or members of the original group.  At least 25 per cent of the value of these interests must <Col N="1391" /> consist of ordinary shares and the remainder of shares or debentures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the test of a <i>bona fide</i> merger?  One of the attractions of acquiring a company might include the fact, for example, that it has a loss forward that could be utilised by the acquiring company. It could be a <i>bona fide</i> reason for an outside company to take it, and yet it might be coming into the country to carry on that business, <i>bona fide</i> in that sense and attracted to make the acquisition by the fact that there is a loss forward of £100,000 or £200,000, because the company being acquired would have that tax advantage.  If it can be justified by the business that follows, at what stage do they know they are relieved of the provisions of section 135?  We are aware of companies that are being kept in existence through Fóir Teoranta at present for the benefit of keeping employment up. I am thinking of one particular case where we are trying to tidy the company up so that another company with proper management and proper access to non-State capital will come and take it.  Would that be regarded as a <i>bona fide</i> merger, even though there would be&mdash;as there is&mdash;a hell of a loss forward available in the company?  It might be one of the reasons why they are prepared to pay anything to come into this situation.  Some of these sections&mdash;the transfer of capital abroad provision, for example&mdash;catch you if any one of the elements of the operation consists of tax avoidance.  This would make tax-free profits available. For example, you are taken as supplying the home market situation, where there is no question of export tax relief involved.  They may be prepared to do this because they can, in that situation, <Col N="1392" /> by taking this company into its embrace and merging with it, make profits for some years with this loss forward availability.  In fact, Fóir Teoranta would be cleared of a burden of further finance; employment would be maintained by the simple availability of the loss forward.  Are there any circumstances in which this could be seen to fall within this section? Would it cease to be <i>bona fide</i> because it can be demonstrated right from the start, which would be true, that the company being acquired had a loss forward and that one of the elements in the negotiation to have it acquired was that this loss forward would mean they earned profits free for some years?  I do not know whether the section drafted would take care of that case.  I cannot name the company, but it is an industry which gives in its area quite substantial employment. It is being maintained by constant advances by Fóir Teoranta. It is hoped that if a capital reconstruction is done, the balance sheet tidied up, and certain shareholding rights removed, somebody will come in and will want, not to start a new company, but to merge its own business with this company and that one of the elements attracting it will be the tax free loss forward which would be available in that situation.</P>

      <P>It is important to remember that we are dealing with the part of the Bill which deals with capital gains only, not with trading profits or loss.  We are dealing here with the deferral of tax charge where transfers of property take place.  In section 136 we are dealing with a merger situation where there would be a reciprocal exchange of shares between one company and another.  We are not dealing with losses as such here.  I could accept, of course, that maybe some of the factors which Senator FitzGerald has referred to would be observed by people who would be considering such a merger, but this would clearly determine the nature of the consideration and the extent of the consideration given by one company for an interest in another and so forth.  But the principal test would be whether there were good commercial reasons for the merger.  Some <Col N="1393" /> businessmen would, no doubt, look at the tax position in deciding whether or not the good commercial reasons were affected by the losses of the company or by any tax liability of the company but this section, deals only with the deferral of charge to capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>A like situation can arise where capital loss could be made by disposal of the property of the company being taken over and which&mdash;I think I am correct in saying&mdash; is allowable against the taxable profits of the year in which the capital loss has been made.  That is another situation where people could spend more money on a property development than it is now worth.  A justification for somebody taking over the whole business would be that they could judge that straightaway they could make it a profitable business and that there was available the capital loss they would suffer in the realisation of this property.  Again, we are talking about an employment generating situation and therefore we are concerned with the social purpose.</P>

We are preserving a neutral situation. After the merger has taken place there might well be a disposal of the assets and there might be loss or gain at that stage.  Then under capital gains tax principles the right to claim the loss or to pay tax on the gain would arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should qualify my remarks.  I was assuming too much. There is a strengthening of the obligation in relation to supplying information in respect of new companies.  It has been found in practice, and I think some lay practitioners would support this view as well as the Revenue Commissioners, that the obligations in relation to supplying information on the formation of new companies are not being observed as well as they ought and it is considered that they should be strengthened so that the necessary information will be supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister help by referring me to the section which is being strengthened? One sometimes get instructions on the telephone from people in a foreign land to get them a company quickly. You proceed to do this and they give particulars of the general purpose of the company.  If the person who gives you the instructions is a reputable person and has been introduced to you by somebody you know as being reputable. you do it.  Then those people may forget about it for three months. If you have not dealt with the people before, you insist that your office will not be the registered office of the company. But you must get somebody in Ireland to act as secretary.  Often that secretary is supplied by a firm of chartered accountant.  If they have not made a choice of their accountancy firm yet &mdash;and under the law they do not have to&mdash;the solicitor may have to provide a member of his staff to act as secretary. Now under this section he or she may be liable to a penalty of £100 if he or she is unable to supply to the Revenue Commissioners the date of commencement of the trade profession or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners know that many of the companies that have been formed remained in a state of inanimation throughout their entire life.  Perhaps somebody had an idea <Col N="1396" /> and then found that, for one reason or another, it could not be financed, or that he could pursue his idea better in another country and so he does not commence business here at all.  Perhaps he has not finally decided on the type of business he wishes to pursue.  Such people may give you the general drift in the instructions you get when you are drawing up the objects clause of the company, but, as the Minister knows, that is not quite as burdensome a matter for lawyers as it was, because of the ease with which the objects clause of the memorandum and articles of association can now, under the 1963 Act, be changed.  It can be done quite easily provided you know what they want it changed to.  So you are not too worried if you have not given the Revenue Commissioners the precise objects to as full an extent as they may find they require before they can do things that are not <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Where, in the existing Income Tax Acts, would I find out about a company liable to a penalty of £500? Thirty days seems an extraordinarily short period.  Suppose you got a rich man who was thinking of coming over here, and somebody has told him despite what the Opposition has said, that tax-wise this would be a comfortable place to come to and then he disappears to the Bahamas or the Canaries, or he goes on a ski-ing holiday where no servant, least of all his solicitor, can disturb him.  Is the position that there is an existing law which obliges a secretary to do these things?  My experience in practice is that you get letters from the Revenue Commissioners and you get letters from the Registrar of Companies if you do not file the necessary particulars. Would the Minister direct me to the existing provisions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator need not open the book because I am going to make a public confession.  When I was talking earlier I was thinking of the notices that practitioners receive from the companies' offices requiring them to furnish particulars and I have subconsciously put that into the taxation framework.  There is no such obligation <Col N="1397" /> at present to notify the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners have found in practice that the absence of such a requirement has led to a most unsatisfactory situation from the revenue point of view.  This matter was dealt with in paragraph 59 of the 1974 White Paper.  I quote:</P>
      <P>A provision to counter a particular abuse connected with the assessment and collection of taxes imposed on new companies would be included in the proposed legislation. The provision is designed to deal with difficulties which have arisen in tax offices in obtaining such information about some newly established companies as would enable assessments to be made and payment of tax secured in due time.  Companies to an increasing extent have been taking advantage of this situation to obtain the use of moneys which should have been paid over to the Revenue.  The abuse has at time been extended to PAYE and VAT by an omission to register for these taxes. There have been cases where companies, having for a time made profits in business, used the moneys which should have been paid in taxes in ventures which have been unsuccessful so that the companies have been forced into liquidation and recovery of the taxes has proved impossible.</P>
      <P>The obligation to furnish the information is not within 30 days of incorporation but 30 days after the commencement to carry on a trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald is right in saying that in his experience companies can frequently be legally in existence and it may take quite an amount of time before all formalities are completed and the company actually commences to carry on a trade, profession or a business.  However, once it has advanced to the stage of actually trading then it is appropriate that an obligation should exist to furnish the Revenue Commissioners with the particulars so that the Revenue Commissioners will then be on notice regarding the possibility of a tax liability arising, in the same way as a person, once that person commences to work, is under an obligation to furnish the <Col N="1398" /> Revenue Commissioners with the particulars which would enable the Commissioners to raise an income tax assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I on that section refer back to the one relevant to the question of loans?  I draw the Minister's attention to the effect of the provisions of section 98 (6) where a 35 per cent rate of grossed-up income is paid where a loan is made to a company not engaged in the State and where the company which is making the loan has made profit from its export turnover.  Perhaps it is wholly engaged in exports.  It is a practice which exists in many cases, for example the United States, where there is no matching credit given for export tax relief for the company.</P>
      <P>In some situations, which the Minister I know is aware of, they choose, because of the size of the profits they make, to lend them to their parents who are so organised by location to avoid the provisions of American tax. They lend on to the Minister himself. The Minister issues to the lending company a bond which, being held by a person neither domiciled nor resident in Ireland, receives their income free of tax.  For the purpose of that company being able to make that loan, their subsidiary must lend them the money out of their profits.  Under section 98 (6), the loan made by the export tax relief company to the parent, which then intends to lend it on to the Minister in these circumstances and conditions, will now have to pay income tax grossed-up 35 per cent of the loan.  That is one type of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another type arises only in the case of foreign companies who have been attracted here and want to avoid the absence of matching relief.  It is all right in Canada but not in the United States.  This is called, &ldquo;tax bearing&rdquo;.  What many of these do is lend on to other subsidiaries they have around the world.  In all these cases, unless they declare a dividend which gets caught for taxation, they have to put the money in a bank. The point is that they will not be making these loans.  They will not pay the 35 per cent.  It is a burden which <Col N="1402" /> we never told them they were going to have to carry.  They were told that all their exports would be relieved from tax.  They came in on that basis and they regard this as&mdash;it was not intended I am quite sure&mdash;a departure from the assurances and undertakings given to them.</P>
    <P>One whisper of any departure from a promise to provide taxation relief to companies such as those in Shannon which came here because of export tax relief would get around so quickly that it would be difficult to calculate the potential loss in decisions made not to go to that country having regard to that position.</P>
    <P>The same criticism can be made with regard to the issue of securities to a company not resident in the State. This word &ldquo;security&rdquo; has been given a very extended meaning.  I take the Minister's point.  He wants to avoid the Irish tax not being collected by the UK parent as the case may be.  The danger is what I say.  The simplest way of coping with it is to introduce in Part IV and Part V, or to introduce in this section, that the provisions of 84 (2) (d) (iv) and the provisions of 98 (6) shall not apply to the companies within these parts.  The surcharge which is to arise in certain circumstances also should not apply to these. Having been accused by somebody because of this special pleading, may I say I enjoy no export tax relief of any kind.</P>

I am thinking of one particular group which I am told is worth £200 million.  It is private and has a substantial industry in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may not of their own volition impose any fines.  They have to take proceedings against defaulting persons, and this enables persons against whom proceedings are brought to enter a defence.  In practice the income tax provisions impose little hardship, and I see no hardship in cases where people have good and sufficient reason for not complying with the requirement.  Where there is wilful fault it is only right that the Revenue Commissioners should have power to proceed against persons. Otherwise we would be passing a law which would simply melt in the hands and the Revenue Commissioners would not be capable of administration and of taking the proceedings.  The Revenue Commissioners have to be in a position to name the person responsible. The person to that extent would have to be identifiable and identified to <Col N="1405" /> the Revenue Commissioners before any question of a penalty could arise, and if the status of the person was established at that stage then clearly the person in question would have ample opportunity to amend his or her hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has used a phrase which would be lovely if it could be somewhere in the Bill: &ldquo;wilful default&rdquo;.  I am thinking of the poor slob who is selling anything you like to think of around the country and doing it from a branch and has never heard of section 154 and knows nothing about it.  Under these penalty provisions he gets caught.  It is easy enough to discharge the obligation by forming a new company.  There will probably be some ritual giving the information.</P>
      <P>However, the setting up of a branch does not happen all that often.  A branch may be found to be there in circumstances that nobody thought too much about it.  There may not be access in that situation to the kind of advice that would mean that the fellow really knew his obligations.  Are you going to tell me that the Revenue Commissioners would be kindness itself in all these circumstnces?  They have to apply the statute, have they not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the right which the Revenue Commissioners have to issue proceedings to have penalties applied does not impose on them in all cases an obligation to bring such proceedings in the event of default. Similar provisions have existed so far as the Income Tax Acts are concerned. I am not aware that any particular difficulties, even to defaulting taxpayers or their representatives, has arisen under existing legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners are extremely busy people with a tremendous load of work on them.  They are not disposed to rush into litigation and to seek the imposition of penalties by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulties could arise in the kind of cases that Senator FitzGerald refers to, but the usual practice of the Revenue Commissioners is to afford such persons, when identified, a reasonable time to mend their hand and in <Col N="1406" /> the event of failure to make amends. Then the proceedings are resorted to. I am sure that the Senator knows that it is not unusual for the courts, even if proceedings are brought, to allow the person against whom the proceedings are brought a certain amount of time to put matters right before making a decision as to what penalty should be applied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is designed to counter avoidance of tax arising from the diversion into close companies of income&mdash;usually income arising from professional activities&mdash; which would otherwise attract income tax at the higher rate.  The device consists in the setting up of a company for the purpose of carrying on a profession, providing professional services or holding an office or employment.  It may also take the form of the setting up of a company, controlled by persons engaged in a profession, and so on, for the purpose of carrying on a business of providing services or facilities for those persons.  The profits of the company are withheld from distribution and therefore bear tax at the company tax rate rather than at the personal tax rates to which the profits, if distributed, would be liable in the hands of the shareholders.  As these shareholders will usually be liable at rates of personal tax which exceed the company tax rate the non-distribution results in loss of tax revenue.  The section counters this method of tax avoidance by imposing a surcharge of 20 per cent on the company's undistributed income similar to that imposed by section 101 on the undistributed investment or estate income of close companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effective rate of charge following the amendment we made to this in the Dáil is 58 per cent on such undistributed profits.  I gave the House on <Col N="1410" /> the Second Stage some information in relation to the manner in which the existing provisions were being used so as to avoid liability to tax.  I drew attention to the fact that there are several professional and service operations using the device of service companies so as to avoid their due liability to tax.  In the cases to which I referred most of the people involved would be people who would be liable in the absence of such devices to pay tax at the rate of 77 per cent but by the operation of certain devices which we seek to curtail in section 162 would be liable to a higher rate of tax in future than they have been in the past but still not liable to tax at the full rate of 77 per cent.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of representations have been made to me in connection with the proposals in the Bill and the case has been made that a large number of professional organisations need substantial capital in order to maintain their present rate of activities and indeed to provide for future expansion.  I have accepted the validity of those representations to the extent of putting down an amendment in the Dáil on the Committee Stage which reduced the impact of the Bill as originally introduced.  Since then I have received further representations asking for further concessions. As I have already stated in relation to section 101, any further concessions on this front would necessitate a restructuring of the whole approach and the adoption, instead of the approach which we have used in this Bill, of the United Kingdom provision which would involve looking right through all these service companies to the ultimate beneficiaries; in which case the actual rate of tax would be, in many cases, 77 per cent and not the 58 per cent which is proposed in the Bill.  By and large, what we have proposed meets many of the representations already made.</P>
    <P>I accept that the capital requirements of the professions can vary depending upon the nature of the professions, on the ratio between personnel and principals.  They can also vary according to the economic climate.  Sometimes it is easier to get <Col N="1411" /> payment of professional fees than at others.  By and large, a situation such as we now envisage in the Bill, which enables the company to withhold 20 per cent of its distributable profits, is a reasonable contribution to make towards the financing problems of incorporated service companies.  I would again remind the House that we are endeavouring to achieve equity between two sets of taxpayers, one, professional people who conduct their business as individuals and who by so doing make themselves liable to the full rate of tax, up to 77 per cent, and persons who conduct similar businesses but do so through incorporated bodies.</P>
    <P>Clearly, as between these two groups of persons there are no reasons why one should enjoy the benefit of more favourable treatment than the other. As I said on Second Stage, it may well be that there is a case for treating all the same and giving them all the sort of treatment which has been urged by all the representations I have received.  Were that to happen it would create a further anomaly by giving preferential treatment to certain professions which would not be available to other sections of the community whose capital requirements would be at least as substantial as persons engaged in professional activities.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to strike a balance here which would satisfy everybody.  What we have done in the Bill is as reasonable a way of dealing with the problem as any alternative suggestion which I have received.  I again emphasise that if the alternative method is to be introduced then we shall have to introduce along with it all the complex apportionment provisions which exist in the British system.  We will also have to confer on the Revenue Commissioners the right and obligation of making a judgment as to what are the capital requirements of each and every profession seeking the treatment which it has been urged should be given to professions in order to meet their capital requirements.</P>
    <P>I would expect that such a system <Col N="1412" /> would generate as much argument and hostility and dissatisfaction as anything which might emerge as a result of the application of section 162 as at present in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am looking for enlightenment on this point rather than wishing to make a point myself.  What I have to say is rather oblique to the rather technical point which the Minister has been making.  According to the Constitution no act is illegal or can be made illegal unless it was illegal at the time of its commission. This involves a large reverberation of the entire Bill.  As we move through these sections, and particularly on to this section, it can be seen that a mechanism has been devised by which certain forms of avoidance or evasion can be closed off.  These are forms of avoidance or evasion which in the past have been used.  Is there any sense in which this will act retrospectively? If one adverts in passing to section 160 where certain reliefs are retrospectively given.  Is there any sense in which this, or any other section, will in fact retrospectively make certain procedures illegal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister and the House know I am totally opposed to this section.  I could not under any circumstances vote for it if the matter reached that stage.  I do not think the Minister has given his mind freely to the representations that have been made to him on behalf of a number of highly respected professions. He has already closed his mind.  He is discriminating between businesses.  He is meting out one type of tax to participators in one business and a different type of tax to participators in another business.  I guess that the reason why the Minister made what I think was the right decision with regard to tax avoidance for ordinary trading companies was the administrative convenience of avoiding inspectors of taxes all over the country having to make value judgments with regard to a whole host of trading companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> If the position is&mdash;and I fully accept what the Minister has told us&mdash;that a number of people were managing to get out of their companies, money on which they did not have to pay tax, he made a right decision about that.  That was an abuse and it was right to stop it.  But he has I believe already effectively done so by taxing capital gains and the earlier provisions of this Bill with regard to closed companies.  The Minister is aware that I have seen all the representations that have been made to him.  One proposal was to insert a new paragraph between lines 58 and 59:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this section the income of a company for an accounting period shall not be regarded as distributable unless it can be distributed without prejudice to the requirements of the company's business.</P>
    <P>There are only a few professions that can be incorporate at all.  It is not possible to incorporate as a solicitor nor as a barrister nor as a doctor. But in all cases where capital is required&mdash;and there are certain professions where more capital is required &mdash;it is not possible to expand if the tax rate is to be what is proposed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent may just about enable a company to retain enough profit in a professional company to expand. I do not know the position about all these corporations.  All I do know is that there are not many of them.  No great administrative burden will be imposed in discovering whether any of them are retaining profit beyond the needs of their business. The Minister has rightly referred to the cyclical nature of particular professionals.  It is well known, for example, that in the case of architects, engineers and surveyors their whole position depends upon the rate of growth or state of decline of the building business.  If they cannot retain profit at 50 per cent during the boom years, they do not have any income in the bad years?  They must keep together a team and pay them so that they will be ready for the boom.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> The Minister may have found some professional companies&mdash;most, if indeed, not all of which he has captured by his anti-avoidance measures which I wholly support in regard to close companies&mdash;in such a position that they will not be caught as much as he would like to catch them, where there has been an unnecessary retention of money, which will not generate more rental or estate income than the company in question will distribute. The Minister may have found some cases of that kind.  I am not arguing for these cases.  Let him have a special provision to deal with people who have been abusing the position. If it involves value judgments by the Revenue Commissioners, so be it.  In the process they will get themselves informed about the problem.</P>
    <P>These professional firms provide a great deal of service to the community. The Minister referred to various sections of the Bill before the House. Who does the Minister think explains these provisions to people who are thinking of starting an industry here and giving employment&mdash;the very firms who need the money to maintain and educate their staffs?  That is an important element.  Within my own profession they cannot incorporate and, if you are at a particular level of activity, and you employ a number of people, you have to have a service company through which some of the profit is retained.  We find that even qualified solicitors whom we have to pay are not generating from their activities for a considerable period of time as much as they are being paid. That is a necessary part of their education. The same is certainly true of chartered accountants.  Many in that profession and, indeed, some firms of solicitors too go on to provide a service by activity in industry and commerce.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will not accept the amendment which has been offered to him without the apportionment of income consequent on trying to retain more than is accepted, I say introduce the apportionment provisions in the cases of these companies, though I do not see why the general judgement which is being made and accepted by <Col N="1415" /> the Minister that industry in general is not retaining more than it should, should be found not to be true of certain professional practice.  A rough estimate of the situation, as far as my own experience goes, is that they need at least the retention of the entire of the pre-tax profit of one year as capital in their concern.  I challenge the Minister to produce a sufficient number of cases where this is in a cash form.  Some of it may be in a cash form because, for example, they know there is something coming on the market which is going to be absolutely suitable to meet their space requirements.</P>
    <P>If we have the Revenue Commissioners so empowered let them decide whether any company in that position does not need the cash to cover the situation if it is in one of the cyclical professions where it drops down or where it is an expanding concern where it needs it to finance the increased need for working capital.  At some stage in the course of the argument on this matter the point was made: why do the professionals not collect their fees more quickly?  I would ask the Revenue Commissioners through the Minister how easy have they found it to collect their fees and they do not have to preserve goodwill? They long since abandoned any desire to have that.  Year after year their provisions for exacting payment have become stiffer.  They know from their own experience that it is difficult to collect money which is due.</P>
    <P>If you are trying to carry on a professional practice, you do not sue for the recovery of your fees except when utterly and completely provoked.  For example, you are doing a case where the only fee that you will ever get depends on the client winning the case and he can then pay your costs.  It might take two years' work and you are taking a chance that he may never pay you at all.  Is that to be pared out, that kind of service which is made available?  There are lots of commercial companies that need much less capital than many professional companies or service companies associated with the profession. <Col N="1416" /> Professional firms do not get any particular credit terms for whatever is needed.  They have to pay their staff weekly, monthly or whatever it may be.  They may have to wait for years literally, for fees.</P>
    <P>I am obviously disclosing an interest in the matter, though nothing like the interest which is involved for some firms.  Again, for engineers, surveyors and architects, who are their main debtors?  Against whom do they have to make the claim?  It is the State that is the slow payer of these professions.  What kind of goodwill is an engineer or an architect going to have in a Department if he starts suing them for the fee?  I think the thing is wholly unjust.  It is like finding that somebody has committed a murder on the road and if we had capital punishment, you would decide to execute all the other residents. This section should be the subject of a full inquiry before it is enacted.</P>
    <P>In so far as the surcharge affects companies which were incorporated in response to some of the Minister's own amendments made in the law encouraging invention in Ireland, it is also enacting a tax which is not a corporation tax.  It is a surcharge on the profits made by people who were told that if they did make these profits they would have them free of taxation.  There is, and the Minister knows it, discrimination which should be eliminated, the discrimination between the individual trader and the one who incorporates himself; the individual solicitor who does not think of the idea or have use for a service company. There is discrimination between the treatment of two people in partnership, or ten people in partnership, who do not have a service company and those who do.  A way of correcting the matter is to give the benefits related to the requirements of these businesses, whether their business is carried on individually or in partnership or through a corporate form, in so far as capital is required. If that involves value judgments made by the Revenue and if that creates an administrative burden, I am sorry. That burden must be placed on them <Col N="1417" /> if there remains something not already caught by the provisions with regard to distributions by close companies.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister had made an absolutely correct decision in the way he decided to treat close companies other than those affected by this section.  His general assumption is that the trading profits, particularly in inflationary circumstances, made by Irish companies are required to be ploughed back for the most part and that there is not excessive retention.  That is a correct decision.  There should be very substantial evidence available.  Speaking from my certain knowledge, all professional people that I know want the use of their money if they could get it. You cannot spend a typewriter.  You must buy that out of after tax profits. You cannot spend your law library. You cannot spend all the modern type of photostatic machinery which you must have in a professional practice.</P>
    <P>Is it assumed that our position, the position of professional people, is in some way better than a man who can make perhaps twice the money through hardly having an office at all, an agent who makes splendid commission from his imported goods and makes it in the corporate from and is caught only to the extent that he is in precisely the same position as any professional person who is retaining excessively?  But he is treated differently. He may have no capital investment at all and he is not on risk in the manner in which professional people are at risk.</P>
    <P>There has been a very wide extension of the principle of the law relative to liability for professional negligence and actions against professional people are very frequent.  The Minister can say in reply that you can insure against it.  Yes, but when you renew your insurance after you have been caught where is the obligation on the insurers to renew it?  And with the ever-increasing complexity of new legislation, to take the legal profession, it is awkward and difficult to avoid not being negligent occasionally, not knowing what some judge will say reasonably ought to be your knowledge. <Col N="1418" /> It is one of the reasons why people have been forced to amalgamate so that they can pool their skills, specialise their talents, modernise their practices and lessen the risk of being wrong in the advice they give.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that for these and other reasons that have been offered to him in the representations that have been made to him, he should accept the proposal that the income should not be regarded as distributable unless it can be distributed without prejudice to the requirement of a company's business.  If the Minister tells me that, he cannot do that without apportionment provisions. For myself personally, I would say to him to let us have apportionment provisions. All I want is to protect the man who is not just simply after the money and wants to improve the skills with which he is trying to serve the public.  This measure will seriously damage the quality, apart from being extremely depressing from the point of view of the attitude shown by the Revenue and the State to these professional bodies, and failing to note that they are all sorts of limitations on their ability to make the quick penny. Most good professional people are downrated by their colleagues to the extent that they are interested in money.  That has been my experience. They get a rating that does not do them good.  The normal professional man is rated according to the fact that he is not interested in a quick profit, that he is interested in the satisfaction he gets from doing the job, solving the puzzle or the problem, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I have been given various illustrations and examples&mdash;and I am prepared to hand them to the Minister&mdash; where the effect of this proposal could lead to a taxation rate overall of much more than 77 per cent which is the highest rate of what was surtax payable. They have been handed to me since the debate on this Bill started this afternoon and I have had no way of digesting them or examining them, but I am extremely unhappy about it.</P>
    <P>There is another point which the Minister may have overlooked.  As regards value-added tax, have the Revenue Commissioners considered <Col N="1419" /> that there are some professions, because of the nature of their clients, who do not charge value-added tax, solicitors being in the lead?  A solicitor's firm that does not charge VAT to its clients, when it is paying its service company has to pay value-added tax on the gross sum paid to the service company.  So, between corporation tax, value-added tax and surcharge, if this goes through you are nearly in the position where you either, if you can, raise your fees or reduce your staff.</P>
    <P>I do not want to exaggerate this in any way but what is needed is to equalise the position of people who are in business generally, whatever form they are in, so that nobody is in the position where he is not using the money for consumption purposes or paying more than the 50 per cent corporate tax.  If he needs for personal living something that brings him within the 77 per cent range, he is caught by the closed company provisions anyhow and he would be within that range and he will only escape to the extent that he ploughs back.  If he is trying to dodge tax by some method of leaving cash unutilised so that it does not generate deposit interest, if the suggestion I make to the Minister is acceptable, in due course he will get the modern UK equivalent of the old surcharge direction that will be an apportionment.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on this point for myself alone.  It would be the course I would adopt if I were Minister for Finance.  I would not apply it over the whole range: I would apply it so that administratively it could be easily worked.  In the number of corporate bodies we have been talking about there are only a few professions involved that need to have their accounts examined.  I know it would take time and goodwill but I would suggest to the Minister at this stage to withdraw this section and work out a suitable alternative to cope with any situation.</P>
    <P>Why professions should be selected for special treatment I do not know but if there is some feeling about professions let it be tried on them as on <Col N="1420" /> the dog.  There should be a new section in the Finance Bill to allow these companies to continue with their 50 per cent profit and to retain the after-tax profit which is justified by the companies' need for expansion.  It is not needed for expansion.  It is also needed because inflation is increasing the cost of the burden of working capital and there is no provision for relief.  I do not know who abused the previous system but nothing can be done about them retrospectively.  They cannot abuse the system any more. But if there is excessive retention with the view to deferring tax, then there should be a section in the Finance Bill of the kind I outlined.</P>
    <P>There is also the element of imposing a surcharge where companies thought they were going to make their incomes eligible for export tax relief. Incidentally, I would recommend to the Minister the consideration of the National Prices Commission's report, published in January, 1975, on professional fees in the building industry. They did not find them excessive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been litening very carefully to what Senator FitzGerald said about professional people.  I heard Senator FitzGerald speak on this on Second Reading.  He was not quite so expansive in his treatment of it then as he was now, but the quality of sincerity and commitment to his point of view has not altered; it has intensified, if anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The request to withdraw this section should not be taken in any sense a reflection on the extraordinary work that has gone into the creation of the entire Bill.  It is a masterpiece and a monument to the civil servants who drew it up and to the draftsmen who put their creative energies into it.  That is the point that Senator FitzGerald is striking at here.  It is quite clear that the necessity for this Bill has been the result of years and years of neglect.  Free enterprise societies like America have had their gift taxes, their corporation taxes, capital gains and acquisitions taxes down through the years.  Obviously, in a section like this the Minister is closing in on too many fronts upon these professional classes.  In a way it could almost be <Col N="1421" /> taken to be a victimisation of creativity. It seems to me that the really good firm, the committed firm, the firm that wants to expand and improve and refine its activities, is the firm that will be most penalised by this section. Having listened to Senator FitzGerald twice on this subject, I am convinced of the justice of the point he is putting and I urge the Minister to consider finding other means of achieving the end aimed at in section 162.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that unless the Minister had evidence that these close professional service companies were causing serious loss of revenue to the State he would not have introduced this provision into the Bill.  I do not believe that the Minister or his advisers would have acted thus unless there was a serious loophole in the present legislation. Otherwise, the Minister would be acting very irresponsibly and very unfairly. The best way of dealing with this problem would be not to penalise all firms equally, as the Minister would appear to have done, although he has undoubtedly given a concession following on the representations made to him in the Dáil, but I would rather see him standing by his guns as regards the companies that are obviously created to avoid tax and treating the other genuine service companies fairly and equitably on the same basis as any other trading company. The Minister has said that this would present difficulties but he should face up to these difficulties and try the process of apportionment even though it might cause a good deal of extra paper work for the Revenue Commissioners rather than cause injustice to any genuine companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Senators from both sides of the House spoke in favour of certain types of professional service companies. The engineering service was specifically mentioned and the Minister was helpful and receptive and generous in his interpretation of the words &ldquo;civil or engineering services&rdquo;. I do not know what effect section 162 has in regard to engineering services where they got special export tax relief to encourage them to operate outside this country.  We are living in <Col N="1422" /> an age of increasing service-type companies. Almost any business with problems will consider employing a consultancy firm.  I have mixed views on the value of consultancy firms because we have had unfortunate experiences with some of these alleged consultancy firms who approached business people and for very large fees told them what they already knew and if they did not know that they should not be in business at all.  Certainly some of them did not survive in business anyway.  But there is an expanding use of the professional service company and we should encourage rather than discourage this type of growth. Like any other business, a service company must have adequate funds in reserve if for no other reason than to take advantage of expanding opportunities.  I would hate to think that any form of discrimination would have a retrogressive effect by discouraging the right type of professional service company to expand and others to set up.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to suggest how the Minister can resolve this dilemma. He has indicated that he has fairly well stuck his feet in in regard to it. I know that he is anxious and I think everybody in this House is anxious to have this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas and into law as quickly as possible, but as Senator FitzGerald said, I think that this whole matter is worthy of deeper consideration and even if it does, as I have said, entail extra work on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and, indeed, the professions themselves, I would rather see a more cumbersome method of dealing vigorously with the obvious avoiders of legitimate taxation and dealing fairly with the genuine professional service firms.  This may entail a change in the method but I would rather see the change because I think in the long run it would benefit the professions involved, discourage the obvious side-trackers of legitimate tax and in the long run be of benefit to the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I mentioned a number of professions which have engaged in tax avoidance practices <Col N="1423" /> which, of course, the law permitted and would continue to permit until what is regarded as undesirable practices were prohibited, and necessarily the reports of this debate in the newspapers were abbreviated which gave the impression that I seemed to be listing as the principal operators of these avoidance practices the medical profession. I understand that in some radio interview, the adjective &ldquo;many&rdquo; was used more than once.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell is right in saying that, of course, he assumes that the Revenue Commissioners have furnished me with information which gives reasons for believing that avoidance practices have been engaged in and that they are becoming more widespread.  That is so, but I should like to put on record and, I would appreciate if it could be published elsewhere, that I was not saying that many members of the medical profession were engaged in the avoidance practice, nor was I saying that I regarded the medical profession as being the principal operators of the avoidance practices.</P>
      <P>First of all, let us get this thing clear.  One, avoidance is legitimate, the law permits it, but if legislators become aware that certain practices are being used which frustrate the intention of the Legislature they have a clear obligation to correct what they consider to be an abuse, particularly if it is available to people of substantial means and knowledge but not available to the general body of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to say that the information given to me leads one to believe that the practice has been used by a number of auctioneering firms, by estate agents and valuers, by property surveyors, by some architectural and stockbroking firms and by some engineering firms, and also by some chartered accountant firms.  I want to emphasise that the information given to me does not justify the use of the adjective &ldquo;many&rdquo; for any of these particular firms, but the number of cases quoted to me is sufficient to justify me asking Oireachtas Éireann to amend the law so as to prevent the <Col N="1424" /> avoidance practices becoming more frequently used and also oblige me to ask for a change in the law which would ensure that as far as possible people of similar incomes pay similar amounts of tax.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to have regard to and it is my intention, it has always been my intention, to have regard to the need to permit firms which require capital for the continuation of their activities and for the expansion of their activities to be able to retain profits to provide them with the necessary capital.  Most business activities in Ireland are funded by retained profits not by borrowed money and this I think is not surprising having regard to the scale of activities in our society.</P>
    <P>But I want to emphasise that the proposal I have made in this Bill would limit the corporation tax on withheld profits to 50 per cent.  If I accept the representations being made that instead of having the surcharge on retained profits we should allow the Revenue Commissioners to make a value judgment as to what profits are necessary for retention, this will inevitably involve introducing apportionment provisions and charging at the full rate of income tax such portions of retained profits as are not necessary for the purpose of the business, and this could well result in there being a higher tax charge on several individuals and firms that will apply to them by virtue of the provisions of this Bill.  Before I would move an amendment or accept an amendment to achieve that result it would be desirable to afford people who might be affected on opportunity of considering their position.</P>
    <P>Senators FitzGerald and Russell in particular have argued in favour of a change in the system.  They take the view, and I think it is a reasonable one, that the introduction of a code would require value judgment and which would involve apportionment might be fairer in that it would allow the people who legitimately need to retain profits to retain them for the necessary purposes of the business but would charge at the full appropriate rates those who withheld <Col N="1425" /> profits where it was unnecessary.  I should, therefore, like to make this proposition and invite Senators to respond to it.</P>
    <P>It is that we would consider introducing a provision in the 1977 Finance Bill, which would be operative from the 6th April, 1976, to replace the surcharge provision such as I proposed in this Bill, with a system which would allow the Revenue Commissioners to make a judgment as to what profits it was necessary to retain for the purpose of conducting a business and would also empower them to apportion and to charge at the full rate of income tax all profits which were withheld where this was not necessary for the conduct of a business.</P>
    <P>If such an amendment is to be made, it will have to apply across the board.  It would, I think, be indefensible to apply the judgement and apportionment provisions to professional and service companies and not apply them to the trading activities which are separately dealt with in this Bill. The line between a professional company and a trading company is sometimes very difficult to discern.  Senator FitzGerald made this point and it is true.  Therefore, if we did not treat them in an identical way and we were exposing some to the full rates of tax at 77 per cent, then I think there would be grounds for legitimate grievance.  So I would ask Senators to consider that proposition.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to give some details of the kind of avoidance practices which we are seeking to close.  Some of these, as Senator FitzGerald acknowledged, have been closed or curtailed by other provisions in this Bill and indeed by provisions in the capital gains tax legislation and so forth.  But not all.  I am certain that, skilled and ingenious as have been my advisers and draftsmen, it is not unreasonable to assume that people would be able to devise other ways of avoidance.  Some have been closed; others will almost certainly suggest themselves.</P>
    <P>Here are a few examples.  A firm of auctioneers had profits of over £400,000.  The main participators in <Col N="1426" /> those profits to the tune of over £300,000 were four partners who themselves took incomes of £12,000, £30,000, £20,000 and £7,000 respectively, but gave to their family companies £135,000, £28,000, £39,000 and £39,000.  The family companies handled their affairs in such a way as to pay certain directors fees and withhold other profits.  The net position was that there was a tax loss of £62,000 in one year from a firm which had profits of over £400,000.  That was by doing something which the law permitted to be done and which we are endeavouring to close.</P>
    <P>A firm of chartered surveyors operated a similar system on profits of £64,000, again resulting in a loss of tax.  I have been given a number of examples of auctioneering firms who arranged their affairs in a way similar to the one I originally indicated. Either by family companies or by arranging special loan facilities they also avoided thousands of pounds of taxation.  A firm of architects paid no dividends during a period in which the profit was £24,000.  Undistributed profit at the balance sheet date just before the period in question was £64,000, but this was reduced to £10,000 in the ensuing period by the redemption of £5,000 in preference shares at par and 450 ordinary £1 shares at a premium of £103.  The company had an associated service company which was wound up with a balance of undistributed profits amounting to £30,000, which, of course, reached the shareholders in a form not chargeable to income tax.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in trying to explain this system is that the more you explain it the more ingenious and intricate and the more difficult to understand are the operations through which money moves in order to avoid tax.  The tax saved can, of course, be quite substantial.  As I have again and again pointed out, tax saved by one person means more tax paid by others to make up for what some people have been lucky enough to avoid.</P>
    <P>Here is another ingenious device. A certain gentleman had a service agreement with a large concern so he decided to deprive himself of the <Col N="1427" /> service agreement by transferring the agreement to a company.  He was managing director of the company and controlled the company in question through an associated company. One of the conditions of the transfer by the gentleman was that he would be employed by the company to manage the affairs of the large concern in question, which pays the management fee now to the company rather than directly to the person who was originally intended to benefit, but who, of course, will ultimately benefit.  As a result of the transfer of the service agreement and some other complicated associated operations, the company in question now owes to that gentleman on a loan account secured by indentures, half a million pounds. It is not unreasonable to anticipate that the loan account will be paid off out of future profits of the company. These sums would be chargeable to tax in the hands of this lucky gentleman who has been able to arrange his affairs in this very intricate and legally commendable way even though the remaining body of taxpayers have to pick up the bill for his ingenuity in the long run.</P>
    <P>A firm of chartered accountants has working to it a company which provides what are called &ldquo;services&rdquo; for the firm of chartered accountants. The service company in question in a recent year had disclosed profits of £150,000 and the unappropriated profit in the balance sheet was over £190,000.  That was a few years ago. No subsequent accounts have been lodged but it has been revealed that the company ceased business in the meantime.  A predecessor service company for the same accountancy firm ceased business some years ago and £146,000 was distributed by that company to the partners of the firm by way of a bonus issue and its subsequent redemption.  £88,000 was apparently distributed later to the partners in the same firm in the same manner by another such company.  I think it is not unreasonable to assume that the company which ceased business last year would be distributing £190,000 tax free by way of redemption of a bonus issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> Again, an auctioneering company issued a large number of shares, nearly 30,000 shares, to a company which I will call S, for £20&mdash;29,000 shares for £20.  The shares in company S were held by another company T.  By a strange coincidence the directors of company T were also directors of the auctioneering company which issued 29,000 shares for £20 to a company which was owned by T.  Three months after that, remembering now that the consideration paid for the shares was £20, the auctioneering company paid a dividend to Company S on the shares bought for £20, and it was nearly £80,000.  In time, of course, company S paid it over to T. Company T then issued £50,000 bonus shares of £1 each and then by another strange coincidence it redeemed the shares the following day at par, avoiding tax.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that all these operations are legitimate under existing law.  We in government have considered that we have an obligation to terminate practices like that, otherwise you would get yourself into a position that some foreign countries have slipped into of allowing scandalous tax situations to develop causing as a result very considerable social, economic and, indeed, political unrest. Now, I do not know the number of people engaged in this practice.  It does not matter.  But, once an avoidance practice begins, word spreads about it and it can become extremely dangerous to leave it there.  The scale of avoidance which I mentioned, all of which is legitimate, indicates the clear need to close the loophole.  The number I have quoted is only a sample of the number I have available, but fewer than a 100 cases have been given to me.  The Revenue Commissioners do not purport to have given me an exhaustive list.  I want to emphasise this, in case anybody is in doubt about it, that I am not in a position to identify the firms in question.  The Revenue Commissioners maintain complete confidence and quite contrary to what might be suspected the Minister for Finance knows nothing about the tax affairs of anybody in our community.  That is the <Col N="1429" /> way it has always been and that is the way which I hope it always will be. Nevertheless, the Revenue Commissioners have a duty to inform any Minister for Finance about what may be happening under the law.  In turn, if the Minister for Finance is asking for a significant change in the law he has a duty to indicate to people the need for the change.  I think these examples would be regarded as evidence of the need for change.  The undistributed profits in relation to some of the cases that I quoted here are far in excess of what might reasonably be required for the purpose of conducting at least some of the activities to which I refer.  Clearly, the profits have been siphoned off and not reinvested in the firms in question.  The fact speaks for itself.  As a classicist in another House said recently, <i>res ipsa loquitor</i>.  However, I would ask Senators to consider the proposition that I made, that I would consider introducing a provision in the 1977 Finance Bill to meet the points which have been made.  By my announcing it now, saying that it would operate from 6th April, there would be no room for complaint if and when the change is made, that it contains an element of retrospection.  But I issue the warning, because it is only fair that I should do so, that the consequences of making that change might be that some people would pay a greater amount in tax than they would pay if we leave the provisions in the Bill as they are.  On the other hand, some people might pay less tax.  The argument is that those who would pay a small amount of tax are those who legitimately require to retain a large proportion of their profits in order to meet the on-going expenses of business and the possible expansion expenses of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's proposal, particularly in view of the fact that he rightly does not confine it to the surcharge on undistributed income of service companies under section 162.  In addition to that, he would wish such an amending proposal to future finance legislation to embody trading companies, as I suggested yesterday <Col N="1430" /> in our amendment, because it would be altogether wrong to introduce an amendment on the lines suggested by the Minister only for service companies and not for trading companies. If one accepts the principle of the matter, and the principle is appropriate to section 162 in regard to service companies, and appropriate to section 101 in regard to trading companies, one should try to make the value judgment by the Revenue Commissioners in distinguishing between <i>bona fide</i> trading or service companies and trading or service companies that are engaged in tax avoidance practice. Again, I appreciate what the Minister stated.  This requires going the whole way in introducing apportionment provisions.  It may hurt people in the tax sense who are not being hurt under the situation as it is now.  I would welcome that.  I think it is important that, as far as possible, the taxation system in our community&mdash; indeed in any community seems to be a very valid principle&mdash;should lean towards incentive, enterprise, economic development, as well as engaging in the very legitimate business of collecting the necessary revenue for the State.  We should lend our energies to devising an amendment along these lines which would be appropriate both to trading companies and to professional service companies.  As far as this side of the House is concerned, we propose to do just that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was reading out the details of the particular cases it occurred to me that it is quite obvious that the Revenue Commissioners are already in a position to make a value judgment.  Forgive me if I appear to be turning the point back on the Minister a bit because the plea has been made as to why the Revenue Commissioners should have this burden put on them of investigating each case selectively as to whether or not they are <i>bona fide</i> companies retaining profits for business requirements or simply tax avoidance companies.  With the detail the Minister has available to him there, it is quite apparent that the Revenue Commissioners have certainly the matter very much at their fingertips.  If they have that sort of information available in particular <Col N="1431" /> selected cases across the board they are in an excellent position to make the sort of value judgment of which I am talking.  They have that type of data and we are a relatively small country.  They know precisely the companies that are genuinely retaining profits for business requirements. I should like to welcome the Minister's proposal and I propose to take him up on it.  I know it does involve the further apportionment aspect which can be the difficult aspect in regard to administration.  There is no problem in devising the appropriate legislation, or appropriate amendment, to provide for apportionment. There is an administration problem involved and, as the Minister rightly said, some people may be caught who are not caught at the moment.  I welcome that.  Again, on the overall principle of drawing a clear line of distinction between <i>bona fide</i> and <i>mala fide</i> companies in this area.  If that is the Minister's proposal, I welcome it and I propose to take him up on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is speaking to a very small House, but I have no hesitation in agreeing to his proposal. As a matter of fact the examples which he has just quoted, although they are perhaps few in number, are certainly striking in their significance. It is obvious that if he makes the proposed change in next year's Finance Bill, some of the firms who under the present adjustment would pay, say, 58 per cent tax would be paying 77 per cent tax in these cases, as they very justifiably should. The genuine close companies would be paying 8 per cent less, which certainly fits in with my line of thinking anyway.  Obviously some people are going to be caught if you do make the change.  I think that is only right and proper, because taxation, if it is going to be acceptable to a community, must be seen to be just.  The steps the Minister has taken in this Corporation Tax Bill and other steps that have been taken in other legislation by the Government does indicate and demonstrate their anxiety to show the public that taxation has to be raised and that it is the Government's intention <Col N="1432" /> to raise it equitably.  There is in section 162 a certain measure of injustice. The reasons given for deciding on this form of solution are clear enough, but for the longer term it would be better to put the matter in better shape.  I would accept the Minister's proposal in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am only concerned to see that a professional company&mdash;we can forget about the service company because it is only used in the case that they cannot incorporate&mdash;are not taxed any more than a trading company in relation to the money they need for their business. I follow the Minister completely. Obviously, I am not silencing myself for the future in commenting on the precise wording of the apportionment when we come to look at it as to whether it should impose more tax on one individual than on another and I should like to know the reasons for it.  I know that code exists in the UK.  I take the full implications of apportionment as being a just solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan seemed to think that that scheme should extend&mdash;I think the Minister suggested that it would have to extend&mdash;to all trading companies.  I am not convinced of that.  If it proposed to treat professional companies differently from trading companies in the Bill, then, in principle, there is no reason why the Minister should feel obliged to depart from a principle, even if badly applied in this section.  I thought the value of the particular method proposed in regard to trading companies generally was, that a judgment was made that by and large, they need it; there were factors making for distributions which were that the amendments made in the close companies situation take care of them; and that the surcharge element is a simple device which will lessen the burden of duty of the Revenue Commissioners. As a trial on the dog, I should like to see this new section being tried on professional companies.  I wholly approve that the Minister should seek to catch within the net of taxation every one of the transactions he has <Col N="1433" /> described in which the money was not needed in the business.  It was being enjoyed as non-taxable distributions by people who were carrying out legitimate tax avoidance operations. Once the Revenue became aware of them, it was correct that they should be stopped.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that they are almost all caught by the provisions with regard to the close company. There only remains the situation of a professional company or a trading company deferring personal taxation by a retention.  At a certain stage they will have built up such an investment position that they will be caught for the surcharge provisions.  I am not afraid of apportionment.  I simply want these professional companies to be treated no worse than trading companies. It would be a very expensive burden for the Revenue to take on the business of making these value judgments for all trading companies.  I do not think trading companies would welcome it either.  They would prefer this one.  Professional companies, I imagine, would certainly welcome it. I certainly welcome it but I speak only for myself and, in particular, as a legislator.  I believe the <i>bona fide</i> companies will welcome it.</P>
    <P>What is the proposal?  Is the Minister proposing to scrub this and state that notice has been given that, as from 6th April, there will be retrospectively applied the principle suggested which will give us a year to work it out?</P>

      <P>I have a query in regard to the definitions of &ldquo;disposition&rdquo;. <Col N="1436" /> One would have thought that everything was covered.  However, it starts off with a sort of generality:</P>
      <P>(a) any act or omission by a person as a result of which the value of his estate immediately after such act or omission is less than it would be but for such act or omission;.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister give us some conception as to what this might mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Disposition obviously starts the chain of taxability.  It is widely defined and covers in every way by act or omission, directly or indirectly, by one or more operations, that property may change hands or a valuable right may leave one person and end up in the possession of another.  If the beneficiary takes his benefit without paying or without paying for it in full he is <i>prima facie</i> a taxable person, a donee or successor. The disposition must be identified and the financial source of the benefits is the author or maker of the disposition.</P>
      <P>Most dispositions are not within the range of tax, for example, the payment of money.  Ninety-nine per cent of payments of money are normal bargains.  If A pays B £10,000 and gets nothing or property worth less than £10,000 in return there is a benefit to B.  Where a benefit arises it is necessary to identify a disposition of the associated disponer.  The tax depends on what a beneficiary takes from a particular disponer.</P>
      <P>There are various forms of dispositions. A might give his house to B. A could assign his right to a debt due by B to him to another person C.  An example of an omission would be where A has a power to appoint property to himself if he exercises the power within a certain time.  If he does not do so, then the property would pass to another and there that other would be the beneficiary of the omission by A.</P>

      <P>On this section I want to make the point that essentially this inheritance tax is a form of death duty.  One must accept the Minister's point, which he has made several times, that, generally speaking, it is a form of death duty which is less than would otherwise have been paid.

      <P>This is the only place I referred to on Second Stage, on the question of private woodlands which will be caught on the basis of gift acquisition tax every time there is a change of ownership whether it is by sale or a transfer of ownership by death.  I am sure the Seanad has had representations in this regard.</P>
      <P>The base of the case is that woodlands, particularly conifers and other trees which take a long time to mature, could, in the lifetime of the tree, change hands, perhaps, several times. I understand under present legislation tax is chargeable only once on the ultimate sale of the timber.  Tax could arise on a number of occasions during the life of the timber.  There is a case in justice for giving special consideration to this type of case.  I understand the amount of afforestation or woodlands involved is only some 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the entire afforestation of the country.  We would all be anxious to encourage private afforestation as much as possible.  I would suggest to the Minister that this legislation will have the opposite effect of discouraging.  I would like him to take a look at that again.  It is, perhaps, too late now to expect that he would make any change in the Bill as it is before us now, but I think it is something that should be looked into.  These people do have a genuine case in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister has abated the <Col N="1438" /> valuation on the same grounds as agricultural land by 50 per cent, but it does not quite cover this case.  It is quite a unique case and I think a section which deserves encouragement are the people who have private woodlands.  We should do all we can, especially in the circumstances of our country, to encourage more and more private afforestation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Russell in this.  I am sure the Minister has had representations on it.  My recollection is that a longer period was taken into account under the old estate duty code.  There has been a precedent in regard to private timber.  A period of 100 years would be more appropriate than what is proposed here.  The Minister might like to comment on it and he might be able to amend it in future legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what has been said here and the representations which I received in regard to timber and I share the views of many people that timber should get special treatment. Timber has received special treatment under the Government's package of capital taxes as a result of which timber is exempt from wealth tax or capital gains tax.  In other words, no capital tax will be payable while the timber remains in the hands of an owner, and it is only when timber is received gratuitously by a person by way of gift that an occasion to payment of capital gains tax could arise.  In most cases, if not in all cases, the actual tax paid will be less than similar woodlands would have generated under the estate duty code.</P>
      <P>One must bear in mind that woodlands are not planted all together at the one time.  There is constant changing of cuttings and seedlings and so forth.  So the appropriate value to take is market value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Russell has accepted, agricultural property means woodlands. In relation to woodlands an amendment I tabled in the Dáil confers on any recipient of woodlands the same benefit as applies to agricultural property where it succeeds to a person <Col N="1439" /> who is engaged in agriculture.  It does not even require that a person should be engaged in agriculture to get the benefit of the special treatment for woodlands.</P>
    <P>Therefore the application of the agricultural advantages to timber is a significant measure of relief.  The market value of growing timber will reflect the stage of growth and the risks of weather, damage and disease and so on.  In the estate duty field timber was valued separately but it was not taxed until sold.  The House is right in saying that.  If sold its market value up to the value at the date of death was taxed at the same rate as the rest of the estate, which in many cases was quite considerable when we bear in mind that most private woodlands in this country are held by people of very substantial means.  It meant that there was extortionate rate of tax ultimately payable whenever the wood was sold.  In view of the lighter tax burden under the capital acquisitions tax the simpler method of taxation at market value at the valuation date and with the benefit of the 50 per cent agricultural deduction will mean that timber will be dealt with quite equitably.  On reflection, I think that people will see that it is an asset which is being comparably lightly treated under the whole taxation code.</P>
    <P>However, I assure the House that I will keep a careful watch on this matter, having regard to the fact that the national interest, both economically and from the point of view of the environment, is well served by continuing to maintain the growth of privately owned woodlands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The estate duty provisions provided that the tax was not paid until such time as a sale took place, and then the consideration was taxed at the full rate of estate duty, which could be at the rate of 55 per cent.  Under the code now, the capital acquisitions tax, if payable at all&mdash;in many cases it will not be because <Col N="1440" /> of the high thresholds of exemption we have&mdash;will be payable on the market value as of the date of death.  But that would have to take account of the condition of the woodlands at the date of death, and growing trees have a comparatively small value at any time, especially young timber.  So all this would be reflected in the amount of tax which would be a paid.  I would say that in many cases the amount of tax paid would be a lot less than would be paid when mature timber would be sold and then charged at the old rate of estate duty.</P>

      <P>Is it not a reasonably valid argument that, having done so in the case of capital gains tax and wealth tax, one should continue doing it under this Bill?  They are all part of the same package.  It seems rather contradictory that it should be exempt under two pieces of legislation and not exempt under this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are recognising that society has always considered that some tax should be paid in respect of woodlands when they reach the point of yielding profit to the owners.  That is the position under the existing estate duty code.  Now we are providing that there will be a tax payable, no new taxes, no wealth tax, no capital gains tax but an actual tax related to the value of the property on the day on which it is received as a gift.  The value on that date will reflect the ongoing commercial interest of the woodlands&mdash;and woodlands have a commercial interest.  If it had not got a commercial interest then quite clearly its value would be negligible. If it has a commercial interest <Col N="1441" /> then its value will relate to the profit which can be obtained from it.  It is right that it should pay a tax appropriate to the commercial value and profit which can be obtained from it, the same as agricultural land.  When we bear in mind that it will be treated at only half of its value, in the same way as agricultural property, it will be seen that the rate of tax will be relatively small.  The half agricultural value was not available under the estate duty code, and it was the mature timber which created the incidence of tax liability and then it was taxed at the full estate duty rate.</P>

      <P>On the Report Stage of this Bill in the other House I gave an example of the operation of subsection (3) of this section, citing a case where A settled property on himself for life, with the remainder to B and subsequently surrendered his life interest to B.  In such a case A has made a second gift to B.  The purpose of subsection (3) is to exempt this second gift from tax, so that tax would be payable only on the benefit taken by B under the first disposition.  Deputy John Esmonde then asked if there was a different situation, where X settles property on A for life with the remainder to B and I replied that it would be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the speed of the exchanges I gave a wrong answer.  The position in the case made by Deputy Esmonde if A released his life interest to B he, A, having received his life interest from X, would mean that tax would be payable (1) on B's acquisition of the capital under the original disposition of X and (2) also on B's acquisition of A's life interest under A's disposition, the <Col N="1442" /> reason being that there is a different donor.  Subsection (3) does not exempt the second gift which arises in the case postulated by Deputy Esmonde.  I have written to Deputy Esmonde clarifying the position, but for the public record I thought it desirable to take the opportunity of putting the position correctly in this House.</P>

      <P>A lot of recent legislalation that has gone through this House has been vulnerable in terms of its constitutionality, and that is a question that will be tested in the courts soon. I am thinking of legislation regarding security, on the one hand, and on the other of social welfare legislation with regard to wealth tax.  In this Bill a number of almost magical dates keep recurring such as, 28th February, 1969, April, 1975, and various others in sections of the Bill.  It seems to me, as a lay observer of the Bill, that it is just possible that several of these involve some kind of retrospective legislation and perhaps retrospective penalisation of people who have evaded or avoided tax in the past.  These magical dates raise a doubt in my mind as to whether this Bill has at every stage been tested against the Constitution in terms of retrospective legislating.  I should like to ask the Minister if, in fact, at every stage where dates such as these in the past are invoked if he did consider the specific issue of contitutionality?</P>

      <P>The Senator may be assured that we have had regard to our constitutional obligations and we have taken care as best we can, subject to the possibility of human error, to ensure that there is no breach of constitutionality.  I am quite satisfied that there is none in this case, that there is no element of retrospective tax.  All that this date does is to say that any gifts since this date will be taken into account for the purpose of determining the total value of gifts received by any particular donee from a particular donor because that is <Col N="1443" /> what creates the liability to tax.  But there will be no taxation on any gifts made before the publication of the White Paper.  It is only to determine the rate of tax and to determine whether or not the thresholds of exemption have been passed that they look back for five years before the publication of the White Paper to see what property may have passed.  This in fact, is in accordance with the treatment operating under the old estate duty code where any gift of property within five years of death was taken into account and in fact was treated as part and parcel of the estate.  So, we are having regard to the old estate duty principles and have not gone back any further than the law obliges us to go back for the purpose of determining the appropriate property of the deceased and the appropriate rate of duty.</P>

      <P>I am sure that there were other representations about the Bill indicating the upper limits free of tax and various transfers, father to son and so on.  There is just one or two anomalies that I would like to refer to.  Again I do not expect the Minister to do anything and I am sure that he does not wish to do anything himself at this juncture but he might have a look at them.  For instance, an obvious one is the transfer from father to son.  The limit is £150,000 but a son to a father&mdash;it might be unusual but it could happen&mdash;is £15,000.  It could happen that the father might have died in the interim and that the grandfather might wish to leave his possessions to a grandson with no father in between.  Then it drops from £150,000 to £15,000.  There are bound to be anomalies in a Bill of this kind but I think, with experience of the Bill, I would like to have an <Col N="1444" /> assurance from the Minister that he would look into some of these limits. Certainly, the father to son limit is very generous and very acceptable generally, but the drop in the other ones is tremendous in some cases and I think there are certain anomalies, certainly in the cases that I have mentioned.  I would ask the Minister if he would have a look at this again. I presume that they can be adjusted from time to time as the situation might warrant it.</P>

But we will carefully monitor this situation and if we feel that modifications are necessary we would certainly be quite open to consider the need for making those adjustments.  We need, in relation to all these capital taxation measures, some experience before we pass judgment as to whether or not we have done absolutely the correct thing.  I would be surprised indeed if in the light of experience we did not need to make some amendments.  I would certainly not be opposed to them, if circumstances justified it.</P>

      <P>Before the House passes that resolution let me avail of this opportunity on what I am sure is your behalf as well as my own to express our appreciation to the Revenue Commissioners and the officers of my Department for the magnificent work they did on a very complex measure and indeed on related measures.  Whatever views people may have about the legislation in question I am sure we are all at one in admiring the tremendous <Col N="1445" /> work that has been done in this area.  In a comparatively short period of three years we have radically overhauled the whole system of capital taxation and we are, in this area, the first common law country to make such changes.  This pioneering work has had to be done, unlike most taxation measures in this country, on the blind, as it were.  There were no precedents from countries with similar legal systems to go by.  I think very sound judgments have been made.  I am not saying that with any sense of superiority because, as I said in relation to what Senator Russell said I anticipate there will be a need to refine it and adjust it in the light of experience. However, a major piece of work has been done by people who have not spared themselves in doing it.  We all, through the White Papers, the Bills, the explanatory notes and the memoranda that have been furnished in relation to them, know a great deal more about a very complex area.  I can only hope now that those who have worked so hard in preparing this legislation will have satisfaction in working it, and that those who have been critics of it will find that a great deal of their criticism has not been justified.  If they feel that it has been justified and are able to prove it they may be assured of my readiness to make such adjustments as circumstances may require.</P>
      <P>Again, I would like to thank the Seanad for the manner in which they assisted me in the passing of this Bill and other related Bills.</P>

      <P>I would like to agree on this occasion with the Minister's remarks.  There is no doubt that the officials of his Department have put in an immense labour.  We on this side of the House might well wonder whether they would not have been better employed at something else, but leaving that out of account, there is no doubt about it that they fulfilled the task given to them with the greatest degree of expertise and they are to be congratulated on all they have done.</P>

      <P>It is proposed that we adjourn until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31st March, 1976.  I was asked last night on the adjournment about the business for Wednesday. Since then there has been a slight change.  It is anticipated that the business on Wednesday next will be in this order: the Bill dealing with Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Procedure); the EEC motion, which I think is No. 12 on today's Order Paper and the Health Contributions Bill.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31st March, 1976.</P>
