      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that on the motion for the adjournment of the House tonight, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Government to take care, as it is obliged to do under Article 7 of Council Directive 75/117/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, that the provisions adopted pursuant to that directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of employees by all appropriate means, for example at their place of employment.</P>
      <P>I am accepting that notice and the matter will be taken from 8. p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask a question on Senator Robinson's motion.  Before we move to the summer recess, I should like to refer to motion No. 46 on the Order Paper, in the names of Senator Horgan and myself:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the proceedings of the Fourth meeting of UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) <Col N="504" /> at Nairobi and the position taken by the Irish Delegation in particular.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House a question.  It is not one that he might necessarily be prepared to answer today but perhaps he could find out for us.  I am interested in No. 8 which has been on the Order Paper for a long time now &mdash;The Protection of Young Persons Employment Bill, 1974, which is at the Report Stage.  We had extensive debates on this over 12 months ago. There are a number of amendments down for Report.  It has disappeared without trace within the last 12 months or so.  It is obviously an important Bill which one would like to see going through and perhaps between now and the next time we meet the Leader of the House might find out are we ever going to see it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dublin Gas Order, 1976, proposed to be made by the Minister for Transport and Power and laid in draft before Seanad Éireann on the 10th day of June 1976, under sub-section 4 of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy) Michael Pat Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Gas undertakings generally operate under <Col N="505" /> special Acts which authorise them to manufacture and distribute gas in certain specified areas and which impose certain controls on their finances.  Modifications to these special Acts may be made by order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  Before an order of this kind is made, it has to be laid in draft before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft order in the form submitted or they may approve it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given, I may make the order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Gas Company have applied to me for a special order. The object of the proposed order is to extend the company's borrowing powers, at present limited to £1.2 million.  This is substantially below the amount required to carry on its extensive business.  The company's bankers have as a temporary measure continued to meet its current borrowing requirements.  It is, however, desirable that all borrowings by the company should have the necessary statutory authority.  This can be achieved by the making of the order now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have intimated to me that, up to the present, extensions to its borrowing powers have been limited to a definite figure in money terms. Today a borrowing limit in such terms is likely to be reached quickly because of inflation and other developments outside the company's control, such as the vast increase in raw materials costs which followed the energy crisis in late 1973.  The company are, therefore, anxious to obtain an extension of borrowing powers on a basis which will make reasonable provision for future developments without the need for repeat applications within short intervals.  The company is heavily involved in the supply of gas in the Dublin area and has been giving consideration to its future strategy, taking account of the possibility of further finds of natural gas in the Irish Continental Shelf area.  It is only prudent that the company <Col N="506" /> now be engaged in making the preliminary arrangements for such developments. This implies a significant extension of its borrowing powers.</P>
    <P>The company, accordingly, propose that the present statutory limitation on its borrowing powers should be modified to give it power to borrow a sum equivalent to one and a half times the amount of the stockholders' funds as shown in its accounts.  The company say that it is almost universal with companies whose shares are quoted on the Stock Exchange that their borrowing powers are related to the stockholders' funds and that the directors are authorised to exercise such powers provided they do not borrow in excess of a fixed multiple of the stockholders' funds.</P>
    <P>Having examined the company's proposal I am satisfied that the proposal that the borrowing limit as expressed by an amount equal to one-and-a-half times its stockholders' funds is not out of line with general company practice.  The draft order accordingly provides for borrowing power for the company on that basis. The draft order further prescribes the manner in which the amount of the stockholders' funds shall be determined. Based on the company's accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1975, the amount of the stockholders' funds would be approximately £12 million so that in accordance with the proposal to which I referred, the company's borrowing powers would be £18 million.</P>
    <P>Notice of the proposed Order was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in a daily paper.  No objection to the proposed Order was received.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company makes a significant contribution to the supply of the energy requirements of the Dublin area as about one in three households use gas.  In the recent past it encountered financial problems due largely to the massive increases in raw material costs which followed the energy crisis in 1973.  Special arrangements were necessary to tide it over this difficult period including temporary advances from State funds and the nomination by me of four directors to the board.  I am glad to say <Col N="507" /> that events took a favourable turn and the company's financial situation, as reflected in its accounts for the year ended 31st December, 1975, is reasonably satisfactory.  The company is very conscious of the need to improve its performance and I gather that serious efforts are now being made to foster better labour relations and to increase productivity.  As Minister responsible for fuel supplies I welcome and commend these developments and I am anxious to facilitate the company in every way open to me in evolving its plans for the future.  I am satisfied as to the need for this Order and that there is nothing in it repugnant to the public interest.  I, therefore, recommend the Order for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Order has the effect of sending the Dublin Gas Company's borrowing power to £18 million.  As pointed out in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, the need for this is very evident today, particularly in the light of the natural gas finds already established around our coasts and the potential gas finds which are of great interest as far as domestic and industrial gas consumption is concerned. The Dublin Gas Company, of course, is the organisation concerned with industrial and domestic gas consumption in the most developed part of the country&mdash;Dublin city and county.</P>
      <P>One aspect which I would like to refer to which is probably more relevant on the Gas Bill but I think is relevant here as well, that is the utilisation of natural gas.  Dublin Gas Company is getting the increased borrowing powers to engage in the required research and to build the required infrastructure in the way of pipes necessary to convey eventually natural gas to the industrial and domestic consumers within its area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the Government have made a decision&mdash;a very serious decision and a very seriously wrong decision that runs counter to all thinking in regard to natural gas conversion. At present every country in Europe and I think North America <Col N="508" /> as well has made a firm decision based on the most expert scientific advice that converting natural gas for power purposes involves enormous waste and that the most efficient way to convert natural gas is to feed it into a grid for domestic and industrial purposes.  The process involved in feeding it into a power station as in Cork, it is proposed to feed it into the ESB power station there, involves in terms of conversion, on my information up to 50 to 75 per cent wastage.  It is a short-term advantage policy decision designed to give the ESB in the immediate years ahead the required powers easily to avail of the finds so far located off the south coast, but it involves very serious implications as regards the rapid wasting of a natural asset in the form of a natural gas that could be used at a far higher efficiency rate and more gradually over a long period of years if fed into the industrial and commercial use grid for ordinary purposes both in houses and factories.  I would like to get elaboration on this.  We can deal with it in greater detail on the Gas Bill when the Minister will be here.</P>
    <P>My information is that the economics of piping natural gas from the south coasts&mdash;off which the only finds are located&mdash;to the Dublin area would make in the long term far more economic sense than wasting a natural asset rapidly in a highly inefficient method of conversion by converting it to power station purposes in Cork.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and this is very relevant &mdash;is what I have said substantially the advice received from the Dublin Gas Company?  I am told that it is.  I am told that it is substantially the advice that has been received by the Minister for Transport and Power and his Department from all energy experts in this country.  It is substantially the opinion of all the energy experts in Europe&mdash;I am aware of that from reading the papers&mdash;and it is substantially the opinion of energy experts in North America.  The facts of the matter are that, whereas in some European countries they were converting natural gas to power, they have stopped it completely now and there is a complete cessation of any <Col N="509" /> attempt to start any new developments in the way of the conversion of natural gas to power purposes because of the massive wastage involved.  Particularly since the oil and energy crisis there is greater recognition of the importance as far as the western world generally is concerned of conserving indigenous energy resources that are available and the outstanding one that we have positively located, of course, is the natural gas resource already there, some located off the south coast and we will probably have more of it.</P>
    <P>It is nothing short of scandalous in this situation, in this day and age after the experience of the energy crisis, to opt for the very short-term gain involved in relieving the ESB of its responsibility of purchasing oil, thereby utilising natural gas which may be of benefit financially to the ESB and the State Exchequer in the very short run, but in the long run it is a very serious matter particularly if further finds of natural gas are located.  There is evidence that there is more natural gas to be found.  Whatever doubt there is about oil there is no doubt about the existence of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if any studies have taken place on the economics of piping natural gas to Dublin.  This I appreciate is a formidable task, but any studies made of the economics of that <i>vis-a-vis</i> the very serious disadvantageous economics involved in wasting the natural asset by an inefficient method of converting to proper purposes when the maximum utilisation could be obtained from it over a long period of time by conversion to industrial and domestic uses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of Senator Lenihan on the Gas Order.  Obviously the Dublin Gas Company requires substantially increased powers to borrow money. This is the normal procedure in any company and it is a modest multiplier in regard to the stockholders' funds which I take to be the total of the paid-up capital and reserves.  With regard to Senator Lenihan's remarks I would have thought that they would <Col N="510" /> be more in order in connection with the Gas Bill at present going through the Dáil, and I do not know whether it is the wish of the Leas-Chathaoirleach to allow discussion today on the merits or otherwise of utilising natural gas for the production of electricity. If it is I would be very glad to engage in such a discussion, but I would suggest that it is a matter for the Parliamentary Secretary to decide that it is out of order unless Senator Lenihan does not propose to contribute to the discussion of the Gas Bill when it comes before this House.  I would have thought it to be a more appropriate occasion, and with all due respect to Senator Lenihan he is jumping the gun.</P>

      <P>Before I call the next speaker I would like to point out with reference to Senator Russell's remarks that the Gas Bill will eventually come to us and a detailed discussion will take place on the whole question under that Bill.  In the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech on page 2 he did make a reference to the natural gas from the continental shelf.  Therefore I allowed Senator Lenihan and will allow other Senators to make some remarks on the whole position <i>vis-a-vis</i> that.  A detailed discussion is not in order on this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Lenihan I certainly am in favour of this Order and it is one which presumably has to be made in order to enable the Dublin Gas Company to conduct its business in a reasonable way.  However I refer to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks in the third paragraph of his speech in which he explains that, whereas up to the present the company's borrowing powers are being limited to a definite figure, today a borrowing limit in such terms is likely to be reached quickly because of inflation and other developments outside the company's control, such as the vast increase in raw material costs which followed the energy crisis in late 1973.  Of course the huge inflation in energy costs, particularly the cost of oil which is used by the Dublin Gas Company, took place in late <Col N="511" /> 1973.  Since then there has been only a relatively small further increase in energy costs, around 10 per cent.  Certainly in the last three years since the end of 1973 the increased costs of oil have been somewhat less than the rate of inflation that existed in this country, so it is not this which has caused necessity to raise the borrowing limits of the company from the definite figure of 1.2 million to a figure of 18 million.  The answer really appears to be that the Government have despaired of dealing with inflation. The speeches are couched in such a way that there is an assumption that inflation is going to continue in future years.  There seems to be no hope of limiting it on the part of the Government. We are told simply that this very big increase in borrowing limits has to be agreed to because for practical purposes money is becoming worthless and to fix a figure in terms of pounds is useless because by next year or the year after or the year after that they will be worth steadily less money.  We have to agree to this. Basically one can only regret that the Parliamentary Secretary, presumably representing Government policy in this respect, has apparently completely despaired of ever being able to deal with inflation or even to reduce it below its present rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the House that I intend to avail of an opportunity of commenting on the general use of future resources that might be made available to us on another occasion when the appropriate legislation is before this House, that is if legislation is brought before us in relation to gas.  This Order before us deals specifically with the Dublin Gas Company and it would be remiss of me if I did not remember that a motion dealing with the operation of the Dublin Gas Company was tabled in this House some time ago by Senators Noel Browne and Michael Mullen.  On that occasion a situation had arisen concerning the inadequate reserves of oil which had been kept for use in the case of a serious emergency or an oil shortage and the necessity that might <Col N="512" /> be brought about for the usage of such reserves on a rationed basis. This on this instrument immediately gives rise to a very important point, that is the amount of money that should be made available to a company empowered with the provision of energy to a large number of households. One has to look at the kind of households being served by the company in question and by other agencies involved in the provision of energy.  One point which immediately strikes one is that when a national emergency arises concerning the provision of the basic material for the gas it is not equal in its incidence.  It falls in its harshest terms even if they do not indeed quantify the term on those who are domestic users.  On the occasion in question when there were insufficient reserves held by the company in the Dublin area the people who were occasioned the greatest human suffering were particularly the elderly and people who were in the situation of being unable to make quick adaptation to an alternative energy.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that in the debate that has arisen so far in the committees of both Houses and in general public discussions, when people speak about greater resources being made available, that they would not draw a distinction between absolutely socially necessary usage and usage for office or industrial and profit purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the giving of more money to the Dublin Gas Company. I would like to think that the situation is not as cynical as that reflected by Senator Yeats, that this is merely a reflection of increased costs and is more on the line of what the Parliamentary Secretary has suggested and will enable them to carry out research to see what their future needs are and how they might better serve their population of consumers.  I reiterate, however, that their practice so far has been commented on by way of motion stated, even if it has not been discussed, in this House.  It causes us some concern and it is very appropriate that we say when we are discussing measures like this that the <Col N="513" /> case that is made is not an economic case but a social case.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous necessity for legislators on both sides of this House to realise that the principles of social accounting are now accepted in political philosophy in most modern political systems and that the giving away of State money to develop energy agencies is no longer being measured by narrow economic criteria and it is not merely a matter of making a gas company efficient for any purpose. The principal purpose of legislation for a gas company in this situation should be to put it into such a position that it would never again imperil the most vulnerable sections of the community.  When we come to discuss the broader issues it may well be that we will have to look at whether we may need separate pieces of legislation to deal with vulnerable domestic categories of the population and other legislation to deal with, for example, potential industrial usage likely to give profits.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that the Parliamentary Secretary has referred in his introductory speech to the role of the gas company.  I am not as interested as I said in their being given technically the amount of money.  Might I draw the attention of this House to something quite similar?  On an occasion shortly after I came into this House I remember the situation of railways being discussed and once again we all fell into the trap of their justification being again on narrowly economic criteria.  When decisions had to be taken which were harsh economic ones people began invoking social arguments.  It is very useful when one is raising the amount of capital to which a company will have access to say in anticipation that we will cheerfully give this money if we know it will be expended for a social role.  We would also give the money if more were available in order to create economic efficiency.  I am not saying that economic efficiency precludes social responsibility or that the one cannot go along with the other. I am saying that it is high time that a rather primitive form of economic accounting was set aside and a more <Col N="514" /> important notion of social accounting responsibility introduced when orders and measures of this kind are brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned, this order was brought in to satisfy the requirements of the order under section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  I welcome its reception by the House. The questions posed by Senator Lenihan do not relate specifically to the order and can best be dealt with under the terms of the Bill which the Minister is finalising in the Dáil today. Were it not for that position obtaining he would be introducing this order here.  Senator Lenihan's statement about the availability of State money to this company is incorrect.  There is no involvement of State money.  This order does not mean that the State will have to guarantee any loan the company may raise as a result.</P>
      <P>From the information at my disposal, and from the recent annual report of the company, the Alliance and Dublin Gas Consumers' Company, they seem to be a very efficient concern.  They are doing a very good job of work.  They supply some 170,000 householders in this city and have an employment content of 1,240 employees with whom relations are reasonably good.  Not only are they not a liability on the State but they are an asset in as much as most of the recent borrowings by the company from State agencies have been repaid and in the not too distant future balances outstanding will be repaid. That is a very good record.  We could do with many more such companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of disruption of supplies at the time the energy crisis in 1973 was raised by Senator Lenihan. The disruption was a rather mild one. If this company was under public ownership, or a State agency, possibly the disruption would have been as much if not greater.  I do not think there is any necessity to go into any further detail.  I wish to thank the Senators, on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Power, for their reception.  I am sure Senator Lenihan will agree that the questions he raised <Col N="515" /> are more appropriate to the main Bill.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bainne Co-operative Ltd. took over from the statutory Bord Bainne as from 1st February, 1973, on a voluntary basis the central purchasing and export marketing of Irish dairy products, and has to date been purchasing the vast bulk of our output of dairy products destined for exportation.</P>
      <P>In order to finance its purchasing operations each year the board is obliged to borrow on short term large amounts of working capital from banks and other lending institutions. As, since its establishment in 1972, the new board had very little capital of its own and was consequently not in a position to depend solely on its own resources to borrow the amounts of working capital it required.  I sought and obtained in section 6 of the Dairy Produce (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1973, power to guarantee borrowings by the board for the purchase of dairy products up to a maximum of £20 million at any one time.  With the aid of this State guarantee the board has up to recently been in a position to borrow its full requirements each year, which at maximum have been well in excess of the £20 million guaranteed.  This State guarantee has enabled the board to cope with a situation where its purchasing far exceeds income from sales during the peak production months from April to August while marketing takes place fairly evenly throughout the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With increasing milk production and the increases which have taken place since 1973 in the price payable <Col N="516" /> for milk, and consequently for the products manufactured from the milk, a state guarantee of borrowings up to a maximum of £40 million is now needed to induce the banks and lending institutions to advance the board's peak capital needs which this year are expected to exceed £90 million. Section 2 of the Bill in effect increases from £20 million specified in section 6 of the 1973 Act to £40 million the maximum amount of the State guarantee of borrowings by the board.  This increased maximum will apply until 31st December, 1977, when as laid down in the 1973 Act the period over which the guarantee is available is due to expire.  Meantime the board is endeavouring to build up its own capital reserves so as to enable it to operate as soon as possible free of the State guarantee.</P>
    <P>The board is providing an excellent marketing service on behalf of the Irish dairy industry&mdash;often in difficult market conditions&mdash;and this Bill, the terms of which I confidently recommend to the House, will help them to continue their invaluable work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have found this Bill necessary and I am in full agreement with it.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil we accept the Bill and, indeed, we welcome it.  It is true, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, that there is no comparison now with a ceiling of £20 million in 1973 and what would be expected in 1976. Consequently, it is only natural to expect that the ceiling would be raised.</P>
      <P>That is a reasonable amount and we certainly feel it is necessary.  It is only fair to say that Bord Bainne and those people in charge of this have a very difficult task to perform because they are trying to sell our dairy produce, not alone on the home market, where there is serious competition, because butter can be taken across the Border fairly freely but also because of the difficulty we have experienced over long periods of selling our goods on foreign markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought that when we entered the EEC we would more or less have a guaranteed market and the difficulty <Col N="517" /> would not be what it seems to be at present.  I never envisaged a situation whereby New Zealand and other countries could sell their dairy produce in the EEC.  I know some agreement has been made and that it will expire in 1980.  In the meantime the dairying industry will have a difficult problem in trying to dispose of their surplus products.  Let us make no mistake about it: the produce has increased immensely because of the increased price of milk, the increased use of fertilisers over the past nine or ten years and the increase in herds. Dairying, a very difficult occupation to engage in, is the one most small farmers place their trust in for making a reasonable profit to sustain themselves and their families.  Anything that helps to ensure that that position continues is very important, not alone from the country's economic point of view but from the social point of view. It would sustain and maintain many families in rural Ireland who would, in turn, ensure the support of local towns, schools, churches and so on. The drain of the rural population into the big cities would cease and people would not be forced out of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>There have been grave misgivings and annoyance among small farmers for some time that only the big farmers will survive.  That is very disheartening. The co-ops in the past had a very difficult role to play.  The Bill helps the board to ensure adequate and efficient storage of milk powder, cheese, butter and other dairy products, and their sale, as required on the market.  An enormous proportion of our working population are tied to the dairying industry, being employed in milk powder and cheese factories, creameries and various other places. The standard of living is very good and the wages paid are, so far as I know, trade union wages.  These are all very important considerations.</P>
    <P>Our creameries in the past produced excellent quality finished foods in the line of butter and cheese.  Killeshandra, in my area, have won the Reid Cup, as the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, nine or ten times as a result <Col N="518" /> of the efficient manufacture of butter.</P>
    <P>All these things are encouraging. The butter we produce is the finest in Europe.  We had some experience during the war years of imported butter and I do not think very many people in this country found it very palatable or would praise the standard of it.  It is, therefore, tremendously important that we realise that our product is so good that it could sell on its own.  At the same time it is essential for us to have money to buy storage so that the co-ops can store butter when a lean period arrives.  We must have a very efficient board.  Bord Bainne have been doing excellent work over the years in selling our finished product.  That is what is needed.  There cannot be any lay-off even though we realise that New Zealand may be going out of this by 1980.  We have learned from experience in the EEC that a difficult situation can arise from one year to another.  Our Minister, being only one of nine, will not be able to control a situation such as that.  Consequently, it is important in the period of peak production, April to August, that we should be able to hold our supplies in proper condition and to release them on the market as the best opportunity presents itself.  Our industry depends on the prices we can command abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the efforts these people have made down the years to advertise and sell our agricultural produce in England and on the continent.  We have an excellent climate now and there is great room for expansion.  I should like the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary to restore the confidence that seems to be lacking among some of the dairy people because of reports in the media that there are mountains of skim milk in one place and powder in another and that there will be a cut back in the dairying industry.  We have also heard that the EEC will have to reduce this to what they call a realistic level.</P>
    <P>Where will the Irish farmer find himself?  Dairying is not an industry which one can build up overnight.  It takes years.  The dairy farmer is <Col N="519" /> entitled to a projection, at least three or four years ahead, as to the possibility of maintaining himself and his family and making a profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and realise the need for the increased borrowing from £20 million to £40 million. Before I refer directly to the Bill I should like to say that the farmers of Ireland have not lost confidence in the dairy industry.  They are full of confidence as anyone can see from the reports.  Last year there was an increase of 9 per cent in dairy products over the previous year and this year, according to the reports, we expect a 13 per cent increase over 1975.  That is confidence.  I know the producers have confidence because I deal with them daily.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment Bord Bainne for the work they have done in the past and since 1972 that work has enhanced the board.  Bord Bainne was set up by the co-operative movement and the Chairman is a milk producer, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, who is highly thought of in the industry.  He must be congratulated on the work of the board.  I congratulate him and other members of An Bord Bainne consisting of farmers' representatives and executives of the industry.  They are putting together thoughts that are helping the industry and finding export outlets.  It is a difficult job.  As a member of the EEC we are bound by certain regulations.  This makes the export of our products a little more difficult than if we had free trade. However, as far as Bord Bainne is concerned, intervention was never used for butter.  Irish butter never went into intervention because it had been sold by the board outside of intervention at a greater price than they would get.  The easy way out would have been to put it into intervention and accept the price but An Bord Bainne does not accept that.  An Bord Bainne is an organisation that goes out and sells the product.  It has sold all the butter available outside of intervention and must be congratulated for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all heard of the skim <Col N="520" /> powder mountain.  It was only in mid-1974 that any skim powder went into intervention.  We did not help to create the mountain.  Since 1974, because of the demand to pay farmers for their milk, because of EEC Regulation 2690, some skim powder had to be sold into intervention.  I am sure the board are sorry that happened but it had to be done because money had to be got to pay farmers.</P>
    <P>Milk production is really only a six-or seven-month season.  It starts early in April and finishes quickly after September.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that peak production runs from April to August. That in itself presents difficulty because capacity has to be arranged for that type of production.  Bord Bainne has advised producers of milk to extend the lactation period and the creameries have offered bonuses for the early production of milk.</P>
    <P>Recent figures show that farmers are interested in a longer lactation in going into milk earlier and in feeding their cattle better thereby hoping for a longer lactation.  There has been a substantial increase in milk production in February and March this year and that is a good sign.  If the lactation period can be extended, the cost of processing milk will be substantially reduced over the year.  We hope that the farmers will take note of this message and become more involved in longer lactation and early and late production of milk by continued feeding and through fertilisation of grass.  That would mean we would have more feedingstuffs for cattle at the end of the season.  That would be of benefit to An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>We know that the £40 million is intended for the payment of farmers due to Bord Bainne's situation.  They have to buy the produce over a short period of time but the farmers must be paid before it has been sold. Therefore, the money is needed to pay the creameries for the produce being sold to the board.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the board for showing an interest in farming generally <Col N="521" /> and asking producers to produce quality milk and products in large quantities.  The board do not mind if they have an increased quantity of dairy products.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries stated here and in the other House that no matter what quantity of dairy products the farmers produce they will be sold to the benefit of the farming community. Being involved in the industry I can state that the board are correct.  We want more dairy products and the only way this can be done is by the farmers producing more milk.  If we have more dairy products we will be able to improve our balance of payments.  We have been able to do this over the past number of years, especially last year, due to increased production at farming level.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate the farmers who have confidence in the industry. They can be proud of the board.  However, there are some things which bother me.  The supply of New Zealand butter coming on the British market and into the EEC as a whole concerns me.  I know that from 1973 to 1976 New Zealand have not fulfilled their quota.  The average tonnage sold into the EEC by New Zealand was about 120,000.  An agreement has now been reached whereby they will be allowed sell 120,000 tons of butter into the EEC until 1980.  The Minister has fought that as hard as he could, but he seems to be a lone bird, so far as that is concerned, in the EEC.  We know he is well able to fight the farmers' cause.  However, New Zealand are now allowed to sell 120,000 tons of butter in the EEC.  No one is to blame for this.  During our negotiations for entry into the EEC we accepted that New Zealand would be allowed sell butter into the EEC and quotas were arranged for them. In 1973, New Zealand had a quota of 165,811 tons.  The Government cannot be blamed for that, they were not in office during those negotiations. Therefore, they cannot be blamed for allowing New Zealand to export butter to the EEC.  However, we know that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing his best in that regard <Col N="522" /> and he will still be fighting the farmers' cause in 1980.</P>
    <P>My second point is in regard to the cheese industry.  Bord Bainne purchases cheese from the dairies and last year increased the sale of cheese by £14.8 million.  Cheese is a difficult product to sell because there is no guaranteed price; there is no intervention price for it.  An allowance must be given to cheese producers for that.  When an increase is granted on cheese the producers do not get the benefit for a couple of months.  That is not good; it creates an anomaly. Farmers producing butter and skim powder have an advantage over cheese producers.  I hope this point will be heeded by those concerned.  Cheese producers are at a disadvantage.  They are selling their produce at home and abroad and are receiving substantial sums of money which benefit every section of the community.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne asked the farmers to increase the lactation period and to breed their cattle better so that the average yield per cow, which is less than 590 gallons, could be increased. The board would like to see that figure increased to 1,000 gallons.  It will take a long time but the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is doing his best by touring the country and advising farmers to produce more and better quality milk.  From listening to farmers I know they are taking note of his words.</P>
    <P>Skim powder will be a big problem in future.  It appears that penalties will be levied later this year and consequently there will be a reduction in the production of skim powder.  I hope it will not be to the detriment of the farmers.  The farmers must accept the position.</P>
    <P>It is very satisfactory that Bord Bainne are not concentrating on the British market exclusively.  They have satisfactory sales of Kerrygold butter in West Germany.  Kerrygold is available in other European countries.  We cannot sell substantial amounts of butter on continental markets because we are at the disadvantage of having to ship our exports to the continent.  Therefore, our competitors <Col N="523" /> have an advantage over us. Bord Bainne are gradually surmounting that problem and we have satisfactory sales of butter on the continent. I hope we will produce and export more because that will benefit all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>It has been said for the past year or two that the creamery industry had over capacity, but that is no longer true.  This year one of the larger sections of the industry, the cooperative movement, broke down in the first or second week of June.  If the capacity had not been there to convert the milk into powder and cheese, the farmers would have been at a substantial loss.  I congratulate those who were involved in extending the capacity and who were slated over the last number of years, not alone by the industry, but by the milk producers. We need the capacity that we arranged for at that time.  Those people who condemned that decision are now very quiet.  I do not see any of them praising the effort that had taken place during those years.</P>
    <P>Unless the lactation period is extended, we will not have sufficient capacity in the years to come.  We will have to invest in more capacity unless we extend the lactation period. If milk is produced it must be processed. There was an increase of 9 per cent in milk production last year, and it looks as if there will be an increase of 13 per cent this year, and for many years production will increase. As a person involved in that industry, I hope we will have that increase. The Minister has asked the farmers to increase milk production because of the benefits that are there, not alone for farmers but for the industry and workers in the industry. The number of workers is increasing. The nation needs an increase in employment and the dairy industry is providing it.  By increased milk production we can increase farmers' profits and give employment to those in need of it.  An extension of the season will mean that people will be working all year round.</P>
    <P>From October to March, a high percentage of girls employed in the industry are let go.  We in the industry <Col N="524" /> would like to see all our workers in constant work for the 12 months of the year.  The farmers wish this too. Bord Bainne request, as well as everybody else in the industry, that the farmers produce more milk.  As everybody knows, quality milk is required for a quality product.</P>
    <P>I have to criticise the board on one personal point.  I do not think there is a need for An Bord Bainne to be involved in the home trade because that is an extra expense on the dairy industry and the farming community. Creameries are scattered all over the country and each creamery has its own sales service and does the job very well.  I would like somebody to prove that I am wrong but I find it difficult to believe that it is of benefit to the dairy industry and the farmers to have Bord Bainne involved in the home trade.  I would like to congratulate Bord Bainne and their officials on the wonderful work they have done since 1972 when they became a cooperative. I welcome the Bill and hope the board will sell all the commodities produced here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators Dolan and Butler for their constructive contributions.  Selling our dairy products on the export market is a very important job so far as the welfare of this country is concerned. Those who sell them deserve our thanks.  As Senators Dolan and Butler pointed out, Bord Bainne Cooperative measure up to our requirements in that respect.  Under the capable guidance of the chairman and general director, they do this job very efficiently in my view and are responsible for the sale of 80 per cent of our dairy products on the export market. If the position were otherwise, and if I thought the Bord Bainne Cooperative were not doing their work efficiently, I would have no hesitation in saying so, because the dairy industry is the most important industry in this country.  It is the most important within the agricultural sector.  Were it not for the returns from our dairy products, our balance of payments and our economy would be far worse.  By <Col N="525" /> saying that, I am not implying that our economy is in bad shape now.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dolan mentioned, reports on the dairy industry percolate from time to time.  At present, the percolation is from Europe and there are difficulties.  It is our job as a Government to try to overcome these difficulties and for that reason our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has to spend the greater part of his time in Europe to ensure that so far as our agriculture industry is concerned everything we can get from our EEC membership will be obtained for the benefit of the Irish farmer, and particularly in relation to our dairy products.</P>
      <P>The questions raised by Senator Butler are not entirely relevant to this measure because its scope is rather confined.  It is a simple Bill to which this House has signified their approval, giving State guarantee to the board for £40 million in place of £20 million, the present figure.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago the Minister, in the course of the Estimate for his Department in the Dáil, set out in detail all aspects of this industry, with particular reference to the agricultural industry.  So far as the Minister and the Government are concerned, anything that can be done for the welfare of that industry has not been left undone.  The Minister, as every Member of the Seanad knows, is day after day, and night after night, dealing with this problem which means so much to our Irish farmers. We are very pleased that prices for our dairy products are quite good, particularly the price for creamery milk on which so many of our farmers, big and small, depend for their incomes.  There is nothing we can see at present to indicate other than that the price will at least hold as good as it is, or possibly increase to cover any inflation that may arise in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Butler that we should try to get our farmers to increase their milk supplies, irrespective of what reports percolate from Europe.  It is a must so far as our Irish farmers are concerned.  It would be a <Col N="526" /> great advantage if, as Senator Butler mentioned, the lactation period could be extended, and if the yield per cow could be increased.  I think Senator Butler mentioned the figure of 590 gallons, an average figure which is not too creditable.</P>
    <P>The big feature of Bord Bainne sales is that so far as butter is concerned they have not sold any of it to intervention.  Their job is to find the best market available so far as price and conditions are concerned. It is readily recognisable by all that intervention is there only as a last resort.  On other occasions we were exhorting farmers, particularly in the meat trade, to go out and find markets and make less use of the intervention system to dispose of their products.</P>
    <P>Bord Bainne are doing that but, with the peculiar position obtaining in the skim milk trade in the early part of 1975 they were forced to sell skim milk to intervention.  Unfortunately, the position so far as disposing of this milk is concerned, is not too bright at the present time.  Let us hope that the Commission will be able to discover ways and means of reducing what some people like to call this mountain of skim milk and we will be able to sell this product on a free market rather than to intervention.</P>
    <P>A point made in the course of the discussion was that when farmers do well, other sections do well also.  That is an obvious fact.  If dairy farmers are doing well and getting good money for their products, when they go to town they will spend that money. The townsman will benefit, whether he is a draper, publican or a grocer. When they come here to Dublin, Cork or large towns or cities the business people in such places will benefit also.  That benefit will pass to the employees of these various businesses. It is essential in the make-up of this country that we have a prosperous agricultural community, and particularly a prosperous dairy industry.</P>
    <P>If Senators raised any other points they will find the answers to them either in the Minister's introductory <Col N="527" /> statement to or in his concluding remarks on his Esitmate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 37 after &ldquo;fish&rdquo;, to add:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or to render such waters harmful or detrimental to public health, safety or welfare or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational or other legitimate uses.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the definition of polluting matter under the Bill.  This is an extremely important Bill.  It is about time we had an overall regulation of water pollution.  I am not satisfied that the definition of polluting matter in the Bill is broad or adequate enough for the purposes as outlined by the <Col N="528" /> Minister in introducing the Bill some weeks ago in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The present definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; includes any substance (including any explosive, liquid or gas) the entry or discharge of which into any water is liable to render those or any other waters poisonous or injurious to fish, spawning grounds or the food of any fish, or to injure fish in their value as human food, or to impair the usefulness of the bed and soil of any waters as spawning grounds or their capacity to produce the food of fish;</P>
    <P>In other words, the whole emphasis of the definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; relates to fish, spawning grounds for fish, and the health of fish.  When we are talking about control of water pollution, we are talking about a much broader type of pollution.  It would be much too narrow and, indeed possibly highly risky, to confine polluting matter to what would be polluting to fish. There are other forms of pollution which we must be concerned about. Therefore my amendment would add to the definition contained in the Bill the words &ldquo;or to render such waters harmful or detrimental to public health, safety or welfare or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational or other legitimate uses&rdquo;.  I submit that this is a definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; which would allow local authorities, under the scheme in this Bill, to prevent water pollution such as would render the waters unfit as a human amenity, or as a recreational amenity.  This should be the concern of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We promote ourselves as a tourist country.  We promote our fresh, clean water.  We all know that there are very substantial dangers in certain recreational areas as well as areas where the pollution is causing damage to fish life, or to other agricultural uses.  It appears to me that the definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; has been lifted out of the Fisheries Consolidation Act, 1969, and since this is not just a fish water pollution Bill but is a general control of water pollution Bill it would be better to <Col N="529" /> have the broader definition which emphasises the real significance of the Bill and which, in particular, would allow local authorities to consider the recreational aspect which is extremely important for the tourist industry.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  When speaking two or three weeks ago on the Planning Development Bill I referred to what I termed the corpus of conservation legislation in this State. I had in mind the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, the Wildlife Bill, which is now before the other House, and the Planning and Development Bill.  In support of Senator Robinson's amendment I would ask the House to bear in mind that there is evidence of what she has suggested being accepted by the Minister in the case of the discussion which took place in this House on the Wildlife Bill.  When we were discussing the Wildlife Bill in detail one of the better developments on it was when the Minister agreed to accept an amendment which created the concept of marine parks.  In the discussion on that amendment much praise had been given to forestry parks.  It was pointed out that where the community interests warranted it, and where recreational demands suggested it, we should preserve waters.  What this amendment seeks to do is to change the subsection in precisely the same way as a similar subsection was changed in the Wildlife Bill.  For that reason I see sense in it, if it is feasible.</P>

      <P>I too support this amendment.  It is very sensible and is needed if we are to do the things that are envisaged in the Bill.  It is important that drinking water is available.  It is also important that our waters for recreational purposes are reasonably clean.  Where people use waters for skiing and swimming it is tremendously important that the water would be reasonably clean.  So far as animal health it concerned, it is also of immense importance.  Consequently I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Robinson that this is a very <Col N="530" /> important Bill.  I also agree with the views she expressed that it is long overdue. I would like to express my appreciation of the special interest which Senator Robinson has displayed in the Bill.  I have very carefully considered the amendment and I feel it is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill trade and sewage effluents will be controlled by a licensing system, as pointed out clearly under section 4, whether or not such effluents are polluting.  The definition of polluting matter will have no effect on the control of trade and sewage effluents.  The Bill also prohibits, as can be seen by section 3, the entry to waters of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, other than trade and sewage effluents.  It is in respect of this prohibition that Senator Robinson's amendment must be considered.  In view of the fact that the definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; is not exclusive, the term would therefore have its ordinary meaning in addition to that in the definition and the definition includes the Fisheries Act definition of deleterious matter and the entry of poisonous and noxious matter is prohibited. In addition to polluting matter it is not clear what matter not already covered by the Bill could, on its being discharged to waters, give rise to the harmful and detrimental effects mentioned by the Senators speaking to the amendment.  The extension of the definition on the lines proposed and suggested could give rise to considerable enforcement difficulties.  It is by no means clear how even a very polluted river could of itself be harmful to public health.  In view of that I have gone very deeply into this matter.  I am quite satisfied that the amendment is not necessary and perhaps, in the circumstances, Senator Robinson might wish to reconsider the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for the considerable thought he obviously gave to this amendment but I am not satisfied that we have closed the argument.  I do not accept the points made.  Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary began by saying that he did not feel that the amendment was necessary, although he <Col N="531" /> agreed with my point of view.  The last time that happened to me was in the Adoption Bill, 1974, moved in this House, when the Minister said he did not think it necessary to write in a section that said that the welfare of the child would be a paramount consideration. Since I was moving the amendment, and since I felt it was necessary, he reluctantly accepted it. I hate to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but history has proved that it is necessary to write that in.  I submit that it is necessary to add the additional senence in the amendment to this particular definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in his reply that the definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; was not exclusive, that the word &ldquo;polluting&rdquo; would retain its ordinary meaning.  I submit that when you put a legal definition into the definition section of a Bill, you give it an exclusive meaning. You say, &ldquo;for the purposes of this Bill &lsquo;polluting matter&rsquo; means&rdquo; and we have narrowed the possible meaning of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo;, precisely by inserting it here as a legal definition.  In my view, it is very narrow. It relates to the polluting of fish or spawning grounds, that is the emphasis of it.  I do not think that should be the emphasis of this Bill.  It may be that it will not add a great deal to enforcement but it would certainly add balance and would show the intention and the broader scope of a proper water pollution control Bill.  It would emphasise that local authorities, when issuing licences under section 4 of the Act, and thinking about the appropriate grounds, should have in mind that when talking about polluting matter one is talking about matter which can be detrimental to the amenity of that area, matter which can be detrimental to the enjoyment by people of their water resources, even if it is not damaging to fish or fish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know precisely when that might arise but I could think of circumstances where it would arise and it should be clearly within the power of local authority.  By defining &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; very narrowly, and necessarily <Col N="532" /> exclusively, in that it is in the definition section of the Bill.  I would say that local authorities might well approach the function of issuing licences by saying: &ldquo;We are confined to the word as defined in the Act and, therefore, although it might damage or destroy the amenity and recreational aspect of the area, we cannot, at the same time, call it polluting matter because it does not fit into the statutory definition of &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo;.  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has obivously considered this in some depth and in some detail but I would urge him to reconsider it and, if he would be happy with some other wording, to bring in an amendment which makes the point at Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson is correct in saying that by defining polluting matter as the Parliamentary Secretary defined it in section 1 he excludes other forms of polluting matter.  One could make additions that include all these things.  That is not a complete definition.  It would be open to add other items, but they will have to relate to fish.  The fact that it is defined in this way does not mean that no other form of polluting matter could be covered by the Bill.  It would have to be polluting matter relating to fish.  All the phraseology in this definition is in relation to matters that will injure fish. It would be quite impossible, therefore, to import into this Bill any other form of pollutant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said that section 3 says that a person shall not cause or permit any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to enter waters.  It is not, in fact, just polluting matter that is at issue.  To seek only one example, it would be possible to have a swimming place ruined from the point of view of the recreation of the public by a material which was neither noxious nor poisonous and not polluting in the sense that it harmed fish.  It would not be covered by this Bill.  It may be that Senator Robinson's amendment is too wide, so wide that it would be difficult to enforce.  It ought to be possible on Report Stage to frame an <Col N="533" /> amendment which would not be as wide but which would at least cover recreations such as swimming which are not covered at present by the definition. The EEC is considering the quality of water in which people swim. At the moment this Bill does not cover it at all.

      <P>I am most anxious to meet the request of Senator Robinson and, indeed, of any other Senator in every way possible.  I have clearly indicated that the extension of the definition on the lines proposed could give rise to very many enforcement difficulties.  I would be prepared to meet the Senator if the amendment provided did not include the terms safety, welfare or other legitimate uses. If the Senator agrees to such an amendment I would be prepared to put it down for the Report Stage and to tidy up the definition of polluting matter by including poisonous or noxious matter and deleting references to poisonous and noxious matter in sections 3, 12, 13, 14 and 16.  If this would meet the Senator or any other Senator, I would be prepared to consider that for the Report Stage and have it rectified at that stage.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for coming a considerable way to meeting the purpose of this amendment.  It is hard to consider all the possibilities of the latter part of the proposed amendment, removing the words &ldquo;noxious matter&rdquo; from the sections of the Bill in which it appears.  The essential definition is the definition of polluting matter.  If that is adequate there will be ample control of water pollution. The proposal of the Parliamentary Secretary could go a long way to broadening that definition to include, in particular, the emphasis on the recreational use.  I would be prepared to withdraw this amendment in favour of a Government amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 42, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall by order&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Water Pollution Advisory Council envisaged in section 2 of this Bill is on the face of it a very anaemic, powerless and insecure body which may be brought into existence. It is my understanding that there is in practice an advisory body.  I can see no difference between the advisory body in practice and such an anaemic statutory body.  We should be concerned in legislation of this sort, in the machinery to enforce, safeguard and advise on legislation of this sort, to ensure that when we make provision for something called the Water Pollution Advisory Council it will genuinely be worth while and will be set up. When the Bill was being introduced in this House the Minister introducing it said that it would be set up.  It is for that reason that the amendment which I put down makes that imperative on the Minister: the Minister &ldquo;shall by Order&rdquo; and therefore does not have discretion.  I quite honestly think that we should delete this section altogether if it is going to stay as it is because it does not really improve the position from an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory body.  We are deluding ourselves by giving it what sounds to be <Col N="535" /> a relatively important title.  The amendments which I shall move try to go further in creating a role and function and in giving a genuine and consultative power to the proposed advisory council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the better sections of this Bill are the sections which deal with sanction, where it specifies sanctions which do not exist and where it raises sanctions to the level of being genuinely deterrent. If such be necessary, it would seem that advice, rather than being available almost capriciously, should be required.  There are two things involved. It appears to me generally that the entire concept of the control of pollution is being introduced.  The Bill is satisfactory where it stops short of demand and makes suggestions rather than putting in &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. What one may tend to create in the public mind is that the notion of pollution itself is a matter yet to be decided whereas we are well aware of the consequences of pollution across a number of heads as are other international bodies.  I am only making this point once so that it need not be made again, that in general there is a case for strong language.  What is the point of suggesting, &ldquo;Well, the body could have advised the Minister and then the Minister could have&rdquo;?  It may be better to advert to the very real dangers which exist and move to a concept of managing dangers of pollution rather than accepting a notion that there may be pollution dangers in existence.  I would make the point now that in this and in many other cases there is great credit due to those people who have sought to change the language, to make it stronger, rather than to make a weaker form of representation to the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>Once again I should like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his willingness to accept this amendment.  I might just say to him that it is in line with the provision in the Wildlife Bill for the establishment of a Wildlife Advisory Council.  In the appropriate section of that Bill &ldquo;shall by order&rdquo; is the terminology used. This ensures that the desired objective of establishing a water pollution advisory council is effected and is required by the statute.  For example, it could be raised on the adjournment of this House that a water pollution advisory council was not established. As the section stands at the moment the Seanad could not and nobody could ensure it.  It would be desirable that the amendment be passed and I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to accept it.  I do not mind whether it is at this Stage by Government amendment or on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Council may, either of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, make recommendations to the Minister in relation to any matter relevant to his functions or responsibilities concerning control of water pollution; it shall be consulted by the Minister prior to the exercise by the Minister of powers under sections 24, 25 or 26 of this Act and it shall advise him on any specific matter referred to it by the Minister in discharge of his functions and responsibilities under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 also relate to the water pollution advisory council and try to give it a more defined role and the possibility of getting necessary information in order to discharge its role.  The proposal is to delete the present subsection (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council may advise the Minister in relation to any matter relevant to his functions or responsibilities concerning control of water pollution and shall advise him on any such matter referred to it by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and to substitute a new subsection (2) and a new subsection (3).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 reads:</P>
    <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall take such steps as he considers appropriate to keep the Council informed of matters relating to the control of water pollution which are, in his opinion, likely to assist the Council in performing the functions assigned to it by subsection (2) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One problem is to ensure that the advisory body gets adequate information in order to discharge its function. Another problem is to ensure that it is consulted, that it has a role to play.  It is a consultative role but it must be the objective of this Bill in creating the machinery for the control of water pollution to ensure that an advisory council so established will be consulted.</P>
    <P>The sections referred to where the amendment would make it mandatory on the Minister to consult an advisory council relate to the very significant and substantial new powers that the Minister would have under sections 24, 25 and 26, section 24 relating to water quality control authorities, section 25 relating to quality standards for water and so on, and section 26 relating to regulation of passage of vehicles.  Obviously we will be considering these sections later on but the Minister has the power under section 24, after consulting the Minister for the Public Service, by order, to establish in respect of such areas, as specified in the order, a water quality <Col N="538" /> control authority.  The section specifies the functions of the water quality control authority.  Surely before doing that the Minister should be obliged to consult the advisory body which has been established under this Act, the water pollution advisory council. Similarly under section 25, the Minister may, after consulting the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and any other Minister who appears to him to be interested, prescribed for the purpose of this Act quality standards for water, trade effluents, sewage effluents and standards in relation to methods of treatment of such effluents.  If the water pollution advisory council is really representative of the expertise and experience in this field, surely it is a body which is entitled to be consulted and surely the Minister, in deciding to exercise powers under section 25 of the Act, should be required to consult this body and similarly in discharge of his powers under section 26 in restricting the use of certain vehicles.  It would be hoped that the advisory council would be representative of expertise in that area.</P>
    <P>As I have been explaining, the purpose of amendment No. 5 is to require the Minister to consult the advisory council when exercising specific powers under sections 24, 25 and 26.  It also enables the council either of its own volition to make recommendations or requires it to respond to requests by the Minister for advice on specific matters.  The following amendment which has been discussed together with it is the necessary section requiring that the Minister ensure that the council be properly and sufficiently informed on the matters relating to the control of water pollution which it will advise on.</P>
    <P>Both amendments are adapted from similar provisions relating to the Wildlife Advisory Council which was established under the Wildlife Bill discussed in this House some weeks ago.  The provisions strengthen the role of the advisory council and make it clear to the members of the council what their precise functions are and <Col N="539" /> also go some way towards ensuring that the members of the advisory council would have the necessary information. Although it would be difficult in a wording of an amendment, I would have liked to have required that the Minister in establishing the Water Pollution Advisory Council be obliged to appoint as members of the council representatives of bodies who are interested in improving the environment, who are experts in a particular way.  It would obviously be the intention of the Minister to appoint people with expertise and experience.  It is helpful to have such a requirement written if possible into the Bill itself.  It is very difficult to devise.  I would have liked, if possible, in some way to try to set out a list of prescribed bodies which should be represented such as the prescribed bodies under section 21 of the Planning Act.  The present section and the subsection which it is proposed to delete and replace by the first of these amendments makes it a very anaemic body indeed with no specific function and with no possibility of calling for information reinforced by a right to receive the information. What could well happen would be that the role of the Water Pollution Advisory Council would be a completely subsidiary one, that it would be a body with vague consultative powers which the Minister need never consult.</P>
    <P>We should ensure in legislation of this kind where we are taking the step of establishing a water pollution advisory council that we give it precise functions in so far as we can, first, a right to be consulted where the Minister is exercising powers where, in line with all the other people he consults such as the Minister for the Public Service, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he also consults and is obliged to consult the water pollution advisory council; and secondly, we should also give that council the statutory right to the sort of information and services which will be necessary for it to carry out its functions.  It should be able to obtain the sort of information <Col N="540" /> it wants from the Minister even if the particular information related to the activities of a State-sponsored body or some other agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not without sympathy for Senator Robinson's amendment but I would like to point out, while I agree in principle with the idea that the Water Pollution Advisory Council should have as much powers as possible within reason, it is purely an advisory council.  Unless I misread Senator Robinson's amendment it seems to me that it places greater powers in the council than in the Minister.  I quote from the amendment, subsection (2):</P>
      <P>The Council may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It has the alternative of either doing or not doing it.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;either of its own volition or at the request of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In other words if the Minister makes a request to the advisory council it has the option of advising the Minister or not.  That is giving too much power to an advisory body.  It then goes on:</P>
      <P>...it shall be consulted by the Minister prior to the exercise by the Minister of powers under sections 24, 25 or 26 ...</P>
      <P>This makes it mandatory on the Minister to consult a purely advisory body. I would question that.  I agree that it is most desirable that the Minister should consult and make as much use as possible of what I hope will be a representative body with experts on it who are interested in the whole question of water pollution.  I would be rather reluctant to give it such rigid statutory powers.  I would be opposed to giving it the right to refuse the Minister if the Minister made a request.  It is going too far to give that sort of power to an advisory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Replying to Senator Russell it is clear in the proposed amendment that the council is and remains an advisory body. What the amendment tries to do is to be more specific about its precise functions and give it the opportunity through having access to information <Col N="541" /> to discharge those functions properly. The wording, as I said, is adapted from the Government formulation of the Wildlife Advisory Council.  The wording: &ldquo;may, either of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, make recommendations&rdquo; is precisely word for word what was accepted in this House as being appropriate for the Wildlife Advisory Council.  I am not saying that that necessarily means it is appropriate for every advisory council but I think there is an analogy and similarity of function between the Water Pollution Advisory Council and the Wildlife Advisory Council.</P>
      <P>The final sentence, again adapted from the text of the section of the Wildlife Bill states that the council shall advise the Minister on any specific matter referred to it by the Minister in the discharge of its functions and responsibilities under this Act.  Therefore the council may make recommendations or they may not be in a position to make recommendations, but they shall advise him on any matter which he specifically refers to them.  In that sense the Minister can ensure that the advisory council discharge their function of advising him on a specific matter.  The present wording is very anaemic indeed under the section; it is very vague as to what the council would do and it is not clear that the Minister need consult them.  If he does consult them they shall respond and offer advice but they have no power of their own volition to make recommendations. They have no right to be consulted, whereas the amendment would give them a right to be consulted in relation to the exercise of some of the more far-reaching ministerial powers.  Sections 24, 25 and 26 are far-reaching ministerial powers under the Bill.  Many of the other powers can be exercised by other bodies such as local authorities.</P>

      <P>I confidently assure the Senator and the House that the fullest possible consultation will be made with the council.  The Senator need not be in any doubt as to the interest and enthusiasm of members of the council.  The Water Pollution <Col N="542" /> Advisory Council was set up by the Minister.  They held their first meeting on 7th February, 1975. All relevant interests, including industrial, agricultural, fishery, professional, scientific, voluntary and local authority interests, in addition to Government Departments and semi-State bodies concerned are represented on the council.  The council is composed of members who are completely dedicated to their work.  It may be of interest to the House to know that the membership of the Water Pollution Advisory Council includes representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Farmers' Association, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the County and City Managers' Association, the Department of Local Government, the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland, An Foras Talúntais, the National Science Council, An Foras Forbartha, the Department of Health, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the Institute of Engineers of Ireland, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the General Council of County Councils, the Inland Fisheries Trust, the Electricity Supply Board, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Education, the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, the Institute of Chemistry of Ireland, An Taisce, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association and the Industrial Development Authority.  When we see members of State, semi-State departments and important national and voluntary associations of the highest expertise represented on an advisory council of this kind we can understand their keen interest displayed in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, it will be to the Minister's advantage to enter into consultation with them in order to seek their advice and co-operation.  This is the Minister's intention.  If it were otherwise, there would be no need to establish the council.  I have pleasure in giving the House an undertaking that the council will be consulted&mdash; that is the purpose for which they were established&mdash;prior to the exercise of any powers under sections 24, 25 and 26.  In view of this undertaking I <Col N="543" /> would ask Senator Robinson to withdraw her amendment.  I have met most of the personnel of the council and I have no hesitation in saying that they are all dedicated personnel who are at the Minister's disposal, purely on a voluntary basis, to give him their best advice and counsel.  There is no doubt but that the Minister, on every possible occasion will be only too happy to avail of the pool of intellectual guidance offered by the members of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been very conciliatory and helpful to the House and this may make my comments seem a little ungrateful but he knows that assurances given in this House, while validly given, have no legal substance.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to assure us that the Minister shall consult the advisory council before exercising powers under sections 24, 25 and 26 then why not write that into the particular sections?  Then in 30 years' time, when there is a less interested Minister or Parliamentary Secretary trying to take decisions in exercising the functions under sections 24, 25 and 26, the advisory council can say: &ldquo;Look, before you do that we have a right to be consulted; we have a view on that which may be slightly different from the Minister's view&rdquo;.  I was very happy to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that he sees the validity of consultation and the necessity to use the expertise there.  If there are expert, concerned and willing persons who are doing it at present as a non-statutory body to whom we are about to give statutory authority, then I would still be in favour of&mdash;although that is a matter for the House&mdash; putting it on a statutory footing where it was clear that it was the intention of the House in its legislation, and not just the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary recorded in the Official Report, that the advisory council would have the right to be consulted in relation to the exercise of specific functions and powers; that they would have the right of their own volition to make recommendations <Col N="544" /> and would, as provided in the second amendment have access to the sort of information which in the Minister's opinion they would require in order to perform their functions under the section.</P>

      <P>Needless to say, I am not looking forward to the future myself.  Amendment No. 6 is unnecessary because it can be taken that the Minister will continue to ensure that the council will be kept fully informed of all matters in relation to control of water pollution.  It might be of interest to the House to know that the existing council, which has been set up in advance of this legislation, has not voiced any complaints in this respect.</P>
      <P>I repeat the undertaking which I have already given that the council will be kept fully informed of all the activities and that the advice and guidance will be sought.  If Senator Robinson is very determined on this issue there is no reason for her anxiety, nor is there any reason for the anxiety of any Member of the House in regard to this.  I am prepared to accept amendment No. 6 which reads:</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister shall take such steps as he considers appropriate to keep the Council informed of matters relating to the control of water pollution which are, in his opinion, likely to assist the Council in performing the functions assigned to it by subsection (2) of this section.</P>

    <P>Again the Minister can control from time to time who will be chairman.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Minister may at any time remove any member (including the chairman) of the Council from office.</P>
    <P>If one wants a genuinely independent advisory council then I would submit that it is undermining that body to have any member or the chairman removable without cause shown at the complete discretion of the Minister. Subsection (6) just provides for the payment of expenses to members of the council.</P>
    <P>I submit that the form used in relation to the Wildlife Advisory Council would be preferable and it is precisely that format that is incorporated in the next amendment which does reinforce a little the independence and status of the advisory council and therefore gives it a genuine statutory being.  The problem with the wording of the section as it stands at the moment, as I said when moving the first of these amendments, is that there is so little difference between the Water Pollution Advisory Council as it exists at the moment&mdash;in anticipation of this Bill&mdash; and its being given statutory authority, in the present wording of section 2 and in particular the subsections.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide more expressly for the terms and conditions of the members of the advisory council.  It provides:</P>
    <P>(3)  The Minister may by order, made with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service in so far as it relates to expenses for members of the Council, provide for such one or more of the following as he considers appropriate:</P>
    <P>(a)  the constitution of the Council,</P>
    <P>(b)  the period for which and the terms and conditions upon and <Col N="548" /> subject to which the members of the Council are to hold office,</P>
    <P>(c)  the manner in which a member of the Council may resign from office and the manner and circumstances in which such a member may be removed from office,</P>
    <P>(d)  the business and procedure of the Council,</P>
    <P>(e)  the payment of expenses to members of the Council,</P>
    <P>(f)  any matter which is ancillary or incidental to any of the foregoing.</P>
    <P>This may seem to introduce an over bureaucracy into the operation of the council.  If it is genuinely going to perform the important functions in relation to the control of water pollution which I envisage, if it is going to be a body which brings together the type of expertise which the Parliamentary Secretary is outlining, then it would be preferable to have clarity about the constitution and membership and functions of that body.  It should not be left in the discretion of a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary for the time being.  Obviously I have not to stress that this is not in any way a reflection on the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Local Government.  It is setting up a particular council for all time or conceivable time until there is a new Bill either modifying or repealing the provisions, so I submit that it would be preferable to constitute the council in a more formal way on an analogy with the way in which the Wildlife Advisory Council was constituted.</P>

      <P>I have already agreed that the council shall be set up by Order.  When the council is set up it should be borne in mind that it will be an advisory and not an executive body.  It will be composed, as I have indicated, of persons in a purely voluntary capacity, giving their time for the conduct of their own research for the purpose of the views and opinions which they were about to express for the guidance of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) provide for all that is necessary in relation to the constitution and <Col N="549" /> membership of the council, the nomination of chairman, the removal of members from office and the payment of expenses.  There is no need to provide for the manner in which members may resign.  If a member wishes to resign, or indeed to resign from any board or body of which he is a member, I do not think there is any necessity to legislate for the manner in which he should tender his resignation. For that reason it is best that we do not tie up the council in chains of legislation that will make it difficult for them to do their work.</P>
    <P>The business and procedure of the council would be best left to the council itself.  The council is comprised&mdash; we hope all future councils will be comprised&mdash;of outstanding intelligent personnel who are deeply devoted to the tasks and assignments they must undertake as members of the advisory council.  I do not think it is right for us to legislate for them as to how they should do their business.  It could be argued that if we are going to provide ways and means by which members should tender their resignations if they so have to resign, there would have to be a code of rules drawn up on which their agenda should be based for discussions at council meetings.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senator not to press this amendment because I can see a problem arising.  The problem is that the council must be seen to be independent. The council must be left to regulate its own business, draw up its own agenda, discuss its own affairs, and make its own recommendations.  For that reason I would ask that the council be left to carry on its own affairs and business in the highly efficient manner in which a responsible council would conduct its affairs.  For that reason I ask the Senator not to press this amendment.  It is one which I cannot possibly accept and I have given the House the reasons.  My objection to it is mainly based on the fact that the entire business, the agenda, the procedure of the council will be best left to the council without further interference.</P>
    <P>It would be in the interest of strengthening the work and the <Col N="550" /> activities of the council that the council be left to be the masters of their own business and the best judges as to how they conduct procedure. I ask the Senator not to press this amendment which I honestly feel is unreasonable.  For example, there is no need to provide for the manner in which members may resign.  Again, the Senator will see that there is no need for any member to have regulations laid down on which his resignation is to be based.  That is a matter entirely for himself or herself. It is best and in the interest of the advisory council in the long run that they be left to carry out their own procedure in their own way and with the least possible hindrance from anybody.</P>

      <P>When I was moving this amendment I said that it is taken verbatim from the provisions relating to the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Parliamentary Secretary is really accusing the Minister for Lands of being unreasonable in the way in which he constituted the Wildlife Advisory Council.  We are at one in wanting an independent and self-reliant advisory council which will give the best advice in circumstances.  To some extent the Parliamentary Secretary has a point in relation to paragraph (d) which relates to the regulation of business and procedure of the council.  I agree it is better for the council to regulate its own business and procedure.  Having been given an opportunity to argue that this amendment makes precise all that is not precise in the present section of the Bill, which allows the Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, to decide the size of the advisory council, we do not know if it is going to be a council of ten members, 30 members, five members or 60 members at any point in time.  It is entirely at the discretion of the Minister. Nobody has any tenure in it: anybody appointed to it is appointed only for so long as the Minister wishes.  The Minister may remove any member, or the chairman, at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, this is no reflection on the <Col N="551" /> present holders of office; it is a concern about the sort of structures we establish.  It might be that in three years' time, or in 50 years' time, the Water Pollution Advisory Council would feel very strongly about something and give advice about it but the Minister would say, &ldquo;thank you very much, that is you removed, I now have a new advisory council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I propose to withdraw the amendment now and reintroduce an amendment on Report Stage to delete the reference to the business procedure of the council and hope that the Miniser might take a view on it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, betwen lines 31 and 32, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Where a complaint about the entry of polluting matter to local waters has been made by two or more residents of the locality to the local authority, that local authority shall investigate the complaint so made and if necessary shall prosecute as provided in subsection (4) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drafted and tabled this amendment before I was aware of the preceding amendments that we have agreed to. To some extent some of the intention of my amendment is catered for by the Parliamentary Secretary's amendments because it is open now to any other persons to bring a prosecution. At the same time it is not entirely realistic to expect that individuals affected by polluting matter or by the activity of others can get up and start a prosecution.  It requires a very high degree of motivation.  It requires, perhaps, that the neighbours be on very bad relations, indeed, with one another.  It would be desirable to have a possibility of a complaint being made by two or more residents of the locality to the local authority and then an onus on the local authority to investigate the complaints and, if necessary, the local authority initiate a prosecution.  There is a similar sort of provision under section 121 of the Public Health Ireland Act, 1878.  To some extent this would ensure that persons living in the locality would be encouraged to play a watchdog role but it would mean that one would not be setting private neighbour against private neighbour by encouraging one neighbour actually to prosecute the other rather than make a complaint to a local authority.  The local authority would investigate it in the circumstances and then bring the prosecution. <Col N="553" /> There ought to be an onus on the local authority to investigate and, therefore, the amendment provides that where a complaint about the entry of polluting matter to local waters has been made by two or more residents of the locality to the local authority that local authority shall investigate the complaints so made and, if necessary, shall prosecute, as provided in subsection (4) of this section. The local authority, having an obligation to investigate, have the discretion in the circumstances as to whether to prosecute or not.  It would not be desirable that the local authority would have to prosecute if any complaint were made.  The appropriate balance would be that the local authority should be obliged to investigate a complaint lodged by two or more local residents but would have a discretion in all the circumstances as to whether to prosecute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt the sincerity of the Senator in moving this amendment but as one who has been a member of a local authority for the greater part of my lifetime I feel that to accept this would be placing on local authorities an unreasonable obligation to investigate all complaints made by two or more residents, irrespective of the circumstances. Everybody knows that on a number of issues affecting local authorities they are obliged to investigate complaints of one kind or another.  From my experience and long membership of a local authority I know that quite an amount of local authority time is spent investigating complaints for which there are no real grounds and foundation.  In this case, for example, if we were to have a complaint regarding pollution which resulted in the killing of fish the Senator might consider it unreasonable to ask a local authority to investigate such a complaint because the proper body to investigate such a complaint would be the Board of Conservators, in consultation with the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an unreasonable obligation on a local authority and for that reason I ask the Senator to give serious consideration to the withdrawal <Col N="554" /> of the amendment.  It would be wrong to have an obligation laid down by Statute on the local authority to investigate a complaint which might be groundless and not immediately appropriate to the local authority.  For that reason I seriously ask the Senator not to press this amendment because of the unreasonable obligation it would place on local authorities.  This amendment was proposed before official amendments Nos. 8 and 11 were put down. I would point out that it is covered by the fact that reference is made to &ldquo;any other person&rdquo; who may now prosecute for an offence.  This is preferable to a provision which would give rise to imaginary or nuisance complaints.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments moved by the Parliamentary Secretary broaden the category of person who can initiate a prosecution and that meets at least half of the situation. I have to bow to the experience of the Parliamentary Secretary of involvement in local authorities.  The amendment sought to secure&mdash;I will not be pressing it&mdash;that a private individual, instead of having the onus of initiating a prosecuton, would have a local authority to complain to and if there were more than one complainant that complaint would be investigated. I imagine in practice if the complaint is made to the appropriate local body which can prosecute under the Act it will be investigated.  Therefore, with the leave of the House, I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) should be deleted from the Bill.  It says that it shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).  In court, ignorance of the law is not a defence.  Similarly, I do not think that a plea that an accidental discharge took place which could be highly injurious to fish-life <Col N="555" /> and to the quality of the waters involved should be allowed, and that the person responsible should be allowed off scott free in court.  It is far too wide.  It is a device for letting people who infringe the laws off the hook and renders the Bill ineffective to a considerable degree.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) provides that it shall be a good defence to a prosecution for the person charged to prove to the satisfaction of the court that he took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).  I have no doubt that every measure will be taken to satisfy the court that very genuine steps were taken to prevent it.  If, for instance, a farmer, in accordance with good agricultural practice and despite taking all normal precautions, causes polluting matter to enter any waters, he will be protected from prosecution by this provision.  I do not see the dangers the Senator sees in the provision.  If he feels he should put down an amendment on Report Stage, it can be considered then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Seantor Deasy, I am in sympathy with his desire not to have any unnecessary loopholes created where people can avoid sanctions and prohibitions under the section.  There are two choices open in this type of provision. The first would be to provide in subsection 3 (1), that subject to subsection (5) a person shall not wilfully or negligently cause or permit any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to enter waters and the person when prosecuted in court would prove that they did not do it, wilfully or negligently. This, in my view, is slightly stronger than the formula of prohibiting wilful or negligent causing of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to enter waters because there is a prohibition. The only way you can defend yourself is by establishing, that you took all reasonable steps, as in subsection (3), which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>it shall be a good defence to a prosecution under the section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that <Col N="556" /> the person charged took all reasonable steps....</P>
    <P>That means that the onus is on the defendant to prove his defence in an active way, to establish that he took all reasonable care.  In my view, that is a better balance than to provide that a person &ldquo;shall not cause wilfully or negligently&rdquo; because the prosecution must prove that the noxious matter that fell into the water was done wilfully or negligently.</P>
    <P>I certainly share the concern that this should not be a loophole, that it would not be used to evade the main prohibition of the entry of polluting matter, which is one of the primary purposes of this Bill.  Depending on the degree of its enforcement it is better that the section be worded in this way.  I do not think it would be possible for the reasons the Parliamentary Secretary gave to have an absolute prohibition because then there could be a considerable number of innocent parties who accidentally, and where there was absolutely no fault or liability, caused polluting matter to enter the water.  The wording of the section is all right.  It will now depend on the degree of enforcement, monitoring and scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will really depend on the cases put forward to the court.  Naturally, we cannot prescribe to the court what they should or should not do.  That will depend on the evidence submitted.  The section is desirable.  There is an identical section in the legislation in Northern Ireland which is working satisfactorily.  I do not think there are any grounds for the fears expressed by Senator Deasy.</P>

      <P>...entry to tidal waters of any matter from vessels, from apparatus for transferring any matter to or from vessels, or from marine structure;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If polluting matter is spilled while a cargo is being loaded onto, or discharged from, the vessel, will the <Col N="557" /> people responsible for the loading or discharging be exempt from prosecution?</P>

      <P>In subsection (5), line 42, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or may not be made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the scope of the licensing power of the local authority by allowing the licence to be framed in a negative sense.  In subsection (5) of section 4, it is provided:</P>
      <P>(5)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), conditions attached to a licence under this section may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  relate to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the nature, composition, temperature, volume, rate, method of treatment and location of a discharge, the periods during which a discharge may be made, the effect of a discharge on receiving waters and the design and construction of outlets for a discharge;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment would be to provide not only that the licence could have conditions for the periods during which a discharge may or may not be made.  It might be appropriate, in particular circumstances, that the licence be in a negative sense.  In other words, the discharge may not be made <Col N="559" /> between the hours of 12 and 2 on weekdays, instead of saying it may be made between a whole lot of hours. In the interest of facilitating the licensing authority, so that there can be sophisticated control both of times and forms of discharge, the local authority should be given power in a negative as well as a positive sense.</P>

      <P>The amendments do not add anything to the existing power.  Under the subsection as drafted conditions attached to a licence may set out the periods during which a discharge may not be made.

I can assure her that the amendments do not add anything to the existing power, but if she feels strongly about them, I have no objection to accepting them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it adds clarity to the local authority attaching the conditions.  I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary got an expert Parliamentary draftsman's view on it but as one reads it, the periods during which discharge may be made, means, as far as I am concerned, that you may discharge between the hours of 6 and 8 or 5 and 10, or whatever it is. That is a positive licence to discharge. It is not clear from the wording of the section that it is also open to the local authority to say the periods during which a discharge may not be made.  That can only do it if it is made clear what periods a discharge may be made, then obviously in the other period a discharge may not be made. Depending on the type of discharge, he may be setting out very long conditions when setting out the positive hours he may discharge, where the formula could be much shorter and achieve the same objective if it were open to local authorities to say &ldquo;you may not discharge during a particular period&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to accept the amendment which I think adds clarification because it instead of saying that you may discharge between the hours of 5 and 8 on weekdays and 9 and 10 on weekends, and you may not discharge between <Col N="560" /> particular hours on a particular day, it could be a much neater and clearer formula, and better in the public interest, that it be very clear that a person may not discharge between certain hours, as opposed to &ldquo;may discharge&rdquo; during a particular time.</P>

Where such regulations are made, there will be a statutory duty on the sanitary authority or authorities concerned to take steps as soon as possible to ensure that the effluent does not contravene the regulations. Most local authorities have already taken precautions by bringing their treatment schemes up to date. There are a number of proposals from many local authorities and when financial circumstances improve I am sure local authorities will be undertaking work of this kind.  In the case of all modern sewer schemes, and those sanctioned at the present time, steps are taken to ensure that there are sufficient precautions and treatment services <Col N="561" /> made available to prevent any form of serious pollution.

I am aware they are a good deal greater than the present fines and penalties available, but it seems to me that, in particular, a period of imprisonment may be rather unreal if the pollutant is a company, or an employee of a company and it would be unfair in many ways to the individual employee to imprison him. We are really about the fines for contravention of the section.  The maximum on summary conviction is fixed for constitutional reasons at £250.  Is it adequate to fix the maximum at £5,000 if the pollution has caused several hundreds of thousands of pounds' damage, or if it is very serious and detrimental to either animal health, fish and so on?  We should seriously consider that we are fixing the maximum fine that can be imposed.  I am aware that there is also a fine of £500 per day for continuing offences of polluting.  It may be that the offence itself is not continuing, but the damage done has been very dramatic and the penalty is not significant for the polluting company.  One could think of a large company, for which this is just a pinprick, which had caused very serious damage through its polluting. We are fixing the maximum which a court could impose.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for his view on whether the fines are adequate.</P>

      <P>I am looking for clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have read the section several times and I do not have experience of work on a local authority, but it seems to me to be a very vague section.

      <P>Local authorities will have a discretion in regard to the making of water quality management plans but must make a plan if required to do so by the Minister. A river catchment may extend over a functional area of a number of local authorities and it is necessary that plans be subject to scrutiny by the Minister in order to ensure uniformity of approach within catchments.  He may also require&mdash;subsection (7)&mdash;two or more local authorities to co-ordinate their plans and to make joint plans. It is envisaged that initially plans will be made only for the more important river catchments.  Water quality management plans will provide the basis for overall quality management of catchments or groups of catchments. Section 4 (3) (b) requires local authorities to have regard to the plans' objectives in deciding whether or not to issue licences for discharge.  Mainly that will be at the local authority's discretion.</P>

      <P>Could I ask a question following the generous response of the Parliamentary Secretary earlier on to the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; by &ldquo;may&rdquo;, for example, in section 2 of the Bill? Would he be agreeable to its replacement in this and later sections?  What I have in mind is this: I can appreciate that when this important piece of legislation becomes law, unless local authorities feel more and more responsible towards anti-pollution measures in general, there may be a period necessary for local <Col N="565" /> authorities to develop such an awareness. The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in many cases could be inserted rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, in other words, giving it a greater force.  The Parliamentary Secretary agreed to something similar earlier.</P>

      <P>This is not similar.  On section 15 a local authority may, and if so directed by the Minister shall make a water quality management plan for any waters.

      <P>I take the point.  The only thing is the spirit. I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me.  Where a water management plan will eventually emerge, it looks from this section as if it will emerge under the inspired requirement of the Minister rather than the local authority as a matter of course preparing it.</P>
      <P>I want to offer an opinion on the section.  Looking at the near history of local authorities and their attitude towards pollution and water quality management plans, one would expect them to prepare such plans very rarely.  There is almost a pessimism about the section.  It is accepting the situation that it may be likely&mdash;but it is probably very unlikely&mdash;that a local authority will bother to prepare a plan and the Minister might find it very necessary, because of the provisions earlier, to go along and require them.  The section may be accurate in that respect, but pessimistic in so far as it accurately adverts to the lack of spirit that there has been among local authorities to prepare such plans.</P>

      <P>The Senator will agree that this is an additional power to ensure co-ordination and co-operation between a number of local authorities.  There are so many catchment areas that the Minister could not direct that a plan be made for all at the same time.  We hope that local authorities will take <Col N="566" /> their responsibilities in a responsible manner and will prepare the plans on the direction of the Minister.  The Senator's fears are unnecessary.  Local authorities will act responsibly and will prepare their plans in consultation with other authorities concerned within the same catchment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>At all times I have opposed the idea that the local authority should be the licensing body in regard to the emission of effluent. Local authorities themselves must come under scrutiny.  It seems they are a law unto themselves.  This is a retrograde step which may defeat the purpose of the Bill to an alarming degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the House is aware that the sanitary authority are the county councils, the urban councils and the <Col N="567" /> corporations.  I doubt that they have the capacity to carry out this type of work.  Local authorities provide a wide range of services and their resources are stretched to the limit.  I fail to see how they will be able to operate this licensing system in a satisfactory manner. I have said this before and I repeat it now, the people who should do this type of work are not the local authorities but the boards of conservators maybe not as they are constituted at present but with some adjustments. Certainly, the local authorities cannot do a satisfactory job.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to the concept that local authorities should be able to emit effluent without having a licence to do it.  People have to go to local authorities to get a licence but the local authorities can be the source of much pollution and need not have licences.  They can designate certain waters into which they can emit effluent.  If that is practised on a large scale&mdash;and it may be by some local authorities&mdash;the whole purpose of the Bill will be defeated.  I have the gravest reservations about this section, particularly in regard to the sanitary authority acting as a licensing body.  They should be as firmly under the control of the Department of Local Government as any other industry or organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Deasy's point and will add a little to it.  Having read the Planning and Development Bill and this Bill, I am not sure of the extent that water is protected from agricultural effluent, particularly the modern kind of agribusiness effluent.  Even if one were to grant that water had been protected from that kind of effluent, from irresponsible business usage or industrial usage and from other kinds of irresponsibility, it would appear that the sanitary authorities are, as Senator Deasy has pointed out, not the most appropriate bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some minor points to add to this.  In the Bill, frequent reference is made to &ldquo;as may be possible&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;where resources are available&rdquo; is also used.  When legislation involving expenditure is introduced, <Col N="568" /> the plea that money is not available is frequently made.  Therefore, any local authorty will be free to suggest that it lacks resources or expertise. It can use any one of these excuses. That is the case even if it were the best authority in the world.  However, one must look at outside opinion about local authorities' activities.  Such objective opinions as exist have listed local authorities as among the major polluters of water.  Therefore, even on the general principle of their being the appropriate licensing authority, it is difficult to be satisfied.  Maybe there will be a massive injection of capital from central funds to local authorities to enable them to become involved in activities such as monitoring techniques, the quality of water and so on.  I am merely speaking about the situation as it exists.  Local authorities stand indicted by objective evidence as major polluters.  Those people who are ranked with them in the same report may now be curbed by licence by one of their fellow polluters.</P>
    <P>In addition, even if one were to accept that they had to do a total about-face, there are sufficient escape provisions within the instrument to allow them to escape.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has something in mind because I know that this point has been made before.  It has been made in a number of comments in both the public press and by interested bodies, and it has been made here again this afternoon by Senator Deasy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to previous speakers who have made some excellent points.  However, local authorities are very responsible bodies and have been elected by the people.  They provide a system of local government as well as performing many other functions.  They are responsible to the people.  It is probably correct to say that local authorities have been responsible for pollution in the past, but the local authority of which I am a member and other neighbouring ones have in recent years become aware of the tourist potential of certain areas. Regional tourist boards have been established and efforts have been made to attract visitors from overseas. There are tidy-town competitions and <Col N="569" /> various other community activities in which the local authorities have played an important role.  Each local authority in the Midland Regional Tourist Board area pays an annual contribution from the rates in order to promote tourism in the area.  Although we may be critical of local authorities, they are the elected representatives. If they get grants from the Department that is all the better.  I feel that they would be more suitable than a board of conservators, which would deal primarily with the protection of fish stocks.  There are other forms of pollution.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Higgins.  I made the same point previously.  A large amount of money would be required to cure pollution and I cannot see where this can be found locally.  The money should be made available from central funds.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about beaches. The Kerry County Council investigated the cost of a small treatment unit and found it would be at least £1 million, so that the point made by Senator Higgins is valid.  If we are to tackle this problem, money will have to be made available from central funds.  We are now saying that local authorities are the greatest polluters and we all see it.  We see raw sewage on beaches.  We will be facing the problem within the next two or three years of having to licence beaches.  I can forsee the closing of most of our beaches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that we will be able to comply with the EEC standards in this regard.  On the whole question of whether the local authority is the right and proper authority for licensing, we dealt fully with this matter on the Second Reading.  At <Col N="570" /> that time I clearly demonstrated, and I understood that I had the support and approval of the House then, that the local authorities would be the right and proper authorities for the purposes of this Bill.  County and county borough councils will be the licensing authorities for the purpose of the section which we are discussing now.</P>
      <P>It would not be sensible to provide that local authorities should license discharges from their own sewers.  If such discharges were to be licensed the licences would have to be issued by some other body.  The setting up of a system of licensing by the Minister of discharges from local authority sewers is not considered necessary for a number of reasons.  The Minister exercises financial control over the water and sewerage programme of local authorities.  In the exercise of such control he can and does ensure that all new sewerage schemes are equipped with whatever treatment facilities are needed so that the discharge does not give rise to pollution in the receiving waters.  All sewerage schemes provided in recent years&mdash;and I have already referred to this area today&mdash;are so equipped. Therefore, discharges from new sewers will be subject to these new requirements.</P>
      <P>With regard to discharges from existing sewerage systems, which may be giving rise to pollution problems, the main limiting factor in having improvement and remedial works carried out is financial.  There is no lack of willingness or, indeed, no lack of concern on the part of local authorities to put their own house in order.  Every local authority is anxious that the treatment facilities available for all the sewerage schemes within the county should be of the highest possible standard.  I have never seen any unwillingness on the part of local authorities to ensure that this would be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities have been most anxious, particularly in recent years, to see that their own house was in order.  Improvement works have been carried out in recent years to many of the older schemes which were <Col N="571" /> causing, or contributing to pollution, and further works of this nature are in progress.  It might be wise to remind the House that capital expenditure by local authorities on the provision of treatment works is running at an estimated £3 million per year.  A recent survey showed that there were a total of 43 sewerage systems giving rise to unsatisfactory conditions in receiving waters.  Remedial works are already in progress in 12 of these systems. The Minister will have power under section 25 of this Bill to prescribe standards for discharge from local authority sewers and for waters into which such discharges are made. It is better that the Minister should have that power.  The Minister will be in a position to take a completely independent and impartial view.  He will have advisers and it is right and proper that the Minister should have that authority.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Local Government will exercise that authority.</P>
    <P>Where such standards are assessed the local authority concerned will be duty bound to ensure that these standards are complied with and I have no doubt that the Minister will ensure that certain standards are upheld and maintained and that he will follow that up to ensure that his direction will be complied with.  For the information of Senators, as Senator Ahearne rightly said when she was dealing with the question of beaches, many of our sewerage schemes will call for very substantial investments. A very substantial sum of money will be required if every sewerage scheme is to have proper treatment facilities. The capital expenditure on water and sewerage schemes since 1972/73, and the allocations for 1976 are as follows: 1972/73, £8.23 millions; 1973/74, £12.95 millions; 1974 (nine months), £11.45 millions; 1975, £17.72 millions; 1976, £23 millions.</P>
    <P>When you see expenditure of that kind being devoted to the provision of up-to-date sewerage systems and considerable sums being spent on the improvement of older schemes, you will realise the substantial increase in expenditure in this regard.  I have no <Col N="572" /> doubt that we will continue to have a sympathetic approach and sympathetic action on the part of the Minister for Local Government when funds are available, and as soon as we return to what we can describe as a normal financial climate, I have little doubt that priority will be given to updating sewerage systems where there is general need for improvement at present.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely convinced of the sincerity with which the Parliamentary Secretary is approaching his assurance, but it is a very minor point.  Section 16 reads: &ldquo;A person other than a sanitary authority shall not, after such day as may be fixed for the purpose of this section by order discharge or cause or permit the discharge of effluent...&rdquo;. Is there a possibility that a person may apply for a licence to a sanitary authority and on the grounds that one has applied to the licensing authority and a decision has not been given, a pollution hazard might be created?  It is rather like the text of the old Planning Act.  After a building went up there was a certain reluctance to demolish something that stood.</P>

      <P>The person who raised this has been anxious to be constructive about it and find a way out of it.  The point made by the Lough Sheelin Trout Protection Association in their memorandum to Members of this House would be&mdash;I know the Parliamentary Secretary is very keen on this&mdash;to advise the Water Pollution Advisory Council of the necessity of a quick opinion being made available to the Minister and then conveyed perhaps to the local authority.  The point that is being made by Senator Deasy&mdash;and it is a very important one&mdash;is this: it is not just simply a matter of time that is at stake.  For example, when one is speaking about effluent into a water supply what is at stake is the state of flow of the water supply at the time, the volume of water available and the nature of the effluent, so that effluent in a very brief period of time could do irrevocable damage whereas effluent over a long period of time might do rather minor damage.  The ability to specify conditions in which effluent might be put into water at any time is something upon which the Water Pollution Advisory Council <Col N="574" /> might well advise when it comes to the specification of standards.</P>
      <P>The only other point that might make it serious is that there is a startling similarity between this and that part of the Planning and Development Bill in which Bord Pleanála were being asked to give a decision within a reasonable period of time for reasons both of the developer and the people who were affected by the development.  Perhaps the real issue that is touched on by Senator Deasy and this memorandum might be got around if it were given a priority upon which the Water Pollution Advisory Council might advise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely a matter of clarification.  Section 33 of the Bill subsection (c) repeals sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  This is the Act which gave some power to fisheries to act in relation, for example, even to local authorities.  The point is that section 17 subsection (3) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>any such licence may be reviewed at any time by the sanitary authority <Col N="576" /> which granted it where the authority has reasonable grounds for believing the discharge authorised by the licence to be a significant threat to public health or where a material change (which could not reasonably have been foreseen when the licence was granted) has taken place in conditions in the waters to which the sewer discharges.</P>
    <P>Those people, for example, who wrote to Senator Deasy, myself and other Senators would argue that to retain the <i>status quo</i> prior to the repeal of sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation Act), 1959, one would have needed to insert after &ldquo;public health&rdquo; in line 36, &ldquo;or fisheries&rdquo;; the subsection would then read: &ldquo;for believing the discharge authorised by the licence to be a significant threat to public health or fisheries&rdquo;.  If that was so one could argue that one could almost accept the later provision of section 33 and say that whatever was now being given away was being accounted for.</P>

      <P>A point here is one which caused myself some concern where I had seen the local authorities involved in monitoring effluents and so on.  A problem arises which perhaps could not be dealt with in this Bill but to which we will have to address ourselves and that is what, for example, constitutes expert opinion? The section says, &ldquo;shall carry out or cause to be carried out&rdquo;.  This raises the question immediately that the local authorities may not possess the resources, scientific or otherwise, to carry out the research themselves or cause to be carried out or arrange for such monitoring sampling.</P>

I would just like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why this is not being done in sections 8 and 16 and why do the sections not read that &ldquo;the appeal shall be to An Bord Pleanála&rdquo; rather than lying, as they do now, to the Minister but by order of the Minister possibly to be transferred. It seems to be slightly contradictory of the whole purpose of the establishment of An Bord Pleanála. I certainly accept the amendment, and if the Minister is prepared to transfer all appeals forthwith then all we have got is rather cumbersome language in the Bill, but the object is achieved.  It would have been better from the beginning to constitute An Bord Pleanála as the Appeals Board.</P>

      <P>This is the kernel of the Bill because if the work which is mentioned in this section is not carried out the whole Bill is useless.  I take it that the Minister and the Department of Local Government will see to it that the local authorities will do what is prescribed in this section.  I have already stated that I am opposed to the local authorities being involved in the granting of licences and in the monitoring and so on and I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary does this type of work mean that we will have a new section in each county council and local authority?  Just as at the moment we have sections for housing, roads, water and sewerage, are we now going to have a section known as the anti-pollution section in each local authority?</P>

      <P>I gravely doubt if the local authorities are going to carry out the duties mentioned in this section to the extent to which they need to be carried out.  There are such things in county councils as burial ground committees and sheep-dipping committees and they never function, and I am afraid that this anti-pollution section will not function either, so I stress to the Parliamentary Secretary that he will have to crack the whip.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said with conviction that he felt local authorities have shown great willingness to combat pollution.  I would question that.  My experience is that they have done very little in places and unless they are pushed by the Department of Local Government the whole point of this Bill will collapse. To the members of local authorities, it is essential that this service be set up in each local authority area and that we get regular reports on the state of our waterways.  If this section is implemented and the Parliamentary Secretary pushes the local authorities concerned he will do a very useful day's work.  Otherwise the whole thing is a waste of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Leas-Chathaoirleach for having intervened at a wrong stage.  I was making an important point, that I agree with what Senator Deasy has said and I am quite confident, by the way this Bill has been handled that many of the deterrents will be interpreted generously.  We both agree on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I make a point arising directly from a phrase like &ldquo;shall carry out or cause to be carried out&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Shall carry out&rdquo; raises the question of having their own resources which most of them would not have.  Secondly &ldquo;cause to be carried out&rdquo; means that they could contract out for such information. There are two ways of gathering information on pollution.  One is that you can gather a minimum of information so as to assuage people's fears, do a cover-up.  Another way you would gather information is to allow several <Col N="581" /> different options to be presented so that people could make a choice.</P>
    <P>I have become aware in the brief time I have been on a local authority of the tremendous pressure made regularly that no impediment be placed in the way of rapid industrialisation. This kind of pressure is particularly high in times of unemployment so what one could have, if one did not have sufficient finance, is worse than what exists at present.  You may well have what is referred to, for example, in subsection (2).  One may have meters, gauges, manholes, inspection chambers and other apparatus and may have it providing the minimum of information required to meet the least argument. One could have public concern being answered, when in fact there is insufficiency of research information.</P>
    <P>Therefore it would be of the utmost importance that we have sufficient grant or such to enable us to have alternative opinions offered.  For example, even scientists differ on the conditions in which experiments are carried out on the discharge of effluent. It is a moot argument about life in water into which effluent is going as to whether one can ever simulate accurately the conditions in nature.  It may be necessary to have several different experiments.  This section here could be an extremely dangerous piece of window-dressing.  It could be used as that, and a local authority willing to bend under industrialisation would need to be very well financed indeed.</P>
    <P>There is a final point, which is extremely dangerous and that is attached to the Government of the day.  It may be a research institute which carries out such experiments. It may be an established institute which carries out experiments and it might happen that their opinion would in the more usual run of cases be the final arbiter as to what was a valid objection and what was not. The case therefore is that this will require tremendous financing and central monitoring.  Anyone who has been on a local authority knows that industries have been established which found that questions in regard to effluent were not asked by some local <Col N="582" /> authorities and were asked by other local authorities, and that industries shifted frequently from areas where the questions became tough and located in areas where the questions were least.  It is this crucial section 21 which will establish the relationship between people who want responsible environmental development and people willing to bend before the short-term industrialisation pressures at time of high unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best argument that could be made for section 21 was made by Senator M. D. Higgins.  It is absolutely essential that local authorities and sanitary authorities should make arrangements for such monitoring of discharges in receiving waters, including tidal and coastal waters, as is necessary for the performance of their functions under this Bill, including compliance with the licensing provisions of sections 4 and 16 and the discharge of trade and sewage effluents and preparation for water quality management plans.</P>
      <P>It is right to remind Senators that here we have the local authority already set up, a unit organised for administrative purposes in each area. I cannot see by what other means we would implement the terms of the Bill.  First and foremost, by allowing the local authority to administer the Bill you will have greater awareness and greater involvement of the elected representatives.  That is exactly what the Minister for Local Government wants.  He wants elected representatives to become more involved in the working of the local authority.  Whilst we have had in the past numerous pleas by various local authorities that their powers were restricted, here we have legislation giving additional powers and authority to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to Senator Deasy's observations, the local authority are the right and proper people to administer the Bill.  If it were not administered by the local authorities by what means could we set up as effective or as efficient an organisation as the <Col N="583" /> local authority?  The local authorities are already in existence.  There is the administrative note as well as the elected representatives.  The engineering and technical branches are set up. The local authorities are aware of all the rivers and mainstreams within their counties and have full knowledge of every sewerage scheme and plant within the county areas.  With an organisation of that kind already in existence I cannot see what greater means we could have at our disposal than to give them the authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy has already asked if we are going to have an anti-pollution section established in each local authority.  I hope so.  I share his regret and concern that local authorities may not have been on the alert, as they might have been, in order to combat pollution in the past.  If we have an executive officer of the local authority in charge of licensing and the general administration of the Bill with the involvement of local councillors and the engineering and technical staffs, I visualise the Bill being very effective.</P>
    <P>I should hope that local authorities will be most willing and anxious to co-operate in every possible way in providing the controls required under the Bill.  I am sure that I am expressing the anxiety of the Minister for Local Government when I say that we look forward to the fullest co-operation in improving the environment by the elimination, in so far as is humanly possible, of all pollution that comes to notice.  It is envisaged that local authority programmes for monitoring or receiving notice will be co-ordinated on a catchment area basis and integrated with national water quality surveys being carried out by An Foras Forbartha.  May I pay a very well-deserved tribute to An Foras Forbartha for the contribution they have so generously made and the statistics and knowledge that they have provided as a result of their surveys?  Local authority monitoring will be co-ordinated with any monitoring programmes or projects carried out by other bodies such as the IIRS surveys of effluents and hydrometric surveys carried out <Col N="584" /> by the Office of Public Works.  This will enable local and sanitary authorities to undertake sampling and analysis of waters as required in connection with the implementation of a number of directives which have been adopted under the EEC programme of action on the environment.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators have given serious thought and study to the programme of action on the environment and the directives that have already been given in this regard.  These include the directive on the quality of surface water intended for abstraction of drinking water, the directive on the quality of bathing waters and a directive on the discharge of dangerous substances into the aquatic environment.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should have power to direct that monitoring and so forth should be carried out to enable the State to comply with international or EEC obligations in this respect.  Therefore under this section the monitoring and so on is a very great responsibility on the part of local authorities.  This responsibility becomes even greater arising from our membership of the European Economic Community and the obligation to comply with the directives that come from there. Since there are directives concerned with the environment we should be ready to play our part.  We should have our legislation in order and should be highly efficient and effective. Section 21 gives a very generous power to local authorities and I have no hesitation in expressing the humble belief that there will be a very generous response from them and their members.  I feel sure that on familiarising themselves with the full terms of every section of this Bill they will use local authority meetings as a platform for the purpose of soliciting support and co-operation from the public by making them aware of all their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>This Bill will enable us to make great headway if we are all in step and going in the same direction.  The local authority, the Water Pollution Advisory Council, the Minister for Local Government and all of us are together in this.  This is not the concern <Col N="585" /> of the Department of Local Government alone.  This is the concern of all our people.  Community effort involving every local authority is required to eliminate the serious problem of pollution.  The structure already set up based on the local authority is the right and proper structure for this legislation.  I ask Senators to wait and see.  As soon as the Bill is in operation and every local authority is playing its part, there will be practical results.  I have every confidence and trust in the local authorities in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Parliamentary Secretary's appeal to the local authorities to get in behind this and work step by step and bring it to success, I would like to say that apart from calling on the local authority, in some cases it will be necessary to call on Government Departments to help. It has happened especially in the Lough Sheelin area in County Cavan that pig producers who built piggeries in accordance with plans of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and for which they obtained grants were later prosecuted for polluting fields.  If the Department of Agriculture were playing its role in the prevention of pollution this could not have happened. In that regard, the Department will have to come into the picture</P>
      <P>With regard to industrial pollution it has happened that factories have been erected which have not conformed with the prescribed planning permission and have been discharging effluent.  It is a fact that the authorities in the area are slow to do anything about it because it might drive industry out of the area.  I agree entirely with what Senator M.D. Higgins has said in that regard.  It will be necessary to have co-operation between local authorities and Government Departments.</P>

      <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary is right and I am wrong. Unfortunately, I lost faith in the civic spirit of the Irish long ago.  To appeal to the local authorities and the public in general to clean up the country is a waste of time.  It has been done so often and has been ignored so often that I do <Col N="586" /> not see any hope of improving our waterways and stopping pollution in general unless we legislate.  I do not agree that we should depend on the people down the country to see that it is done.  Time and again we heard appeals to stop people throwing litter about the place, to stop the discarding of car bodies on the sides of main roads and various anti-pollution appeals like that but invariably they have been ignored by the majority of people.</P>
      <P>It is our duty to legislate and to see that the state of our waterways does not disimprove.  It is our duty to see that we bring about a vast improvement.  Unfortunately, we have a system of local government which makes it the duty of the public to pay the rates which keep the local institutions going.  From my experience when it comes to striking a rate non-essential matters such as clearing up litter and the elimination of pollution in general are scrubbed out.  While I am all in favour of local democracy and giving elected representatives more power, I want to ensure that they do not get so much power that they can do damage rather than good.  That is why I have reservations.  If one gives them too much power in this regard they can do an awful lot of harm.  They have had the power, in ways, over the years, to stop pollution of our waterways. What has happened?  Local authorities have been the single biggest polluter.  It has been said here before and I say it again.  Now we are asking them to eliminate pollution.  I am afraid they will not do it.  I have every reason to believe they will not do it.  I hope they do; I think they may not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins raised a very important point we come across every second day of the week.  We are told that employment is so important that people will have to put up with pollution.  We should not accept that, but it is accepted.  As he stated, industrialists will shop around until they get a soft touch and then they will go in and pollute, whereas they should be hammered.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="587" /> and the Department of Local Government to press the local authorities and see that they do their duty.  I am not prepared to accept that they should be asked to do it voluntarily; they must be pushed into doing it. We should enact legislation which makes them do it.</P>
    <P>If section 21 is not implemented by the Department and the Minister the whole purpose of the Bill is defeated.  I draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to the last few words, &ldquo;as may be directed by the Minister&rdquo; and I ask him to see that these people are made do it.  When it comes to saving money on the rates this is the type of service which will be scrubbed.  They will not want to know about it and pollution will increase.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates my point of view.  I have not got that much faith in human nature.  Maybe I am wrong, but I have seen it happen in regard to the litter problem and I can see it happening in regard to water pollution.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Parliamentary Secretary raised a question in reply when he asked, what body is better suited to preventing pollution of our waters than the local authorities?  There is an outstanding body which can and should have been chosen to do it and why it was overlooked I do not understand.  The boards of convervators are the natural people to see that our waters are not polluted.  It is their duty to protect fish life and, in my view, the preservation of fish life is a criterion as regards the level of pollution in our waterways.  These boards are made up of outstanding public individuals who are drawn from the ranks of fishermen, the owners of fisheries and the representatives of fishermen.  They do a tremendous job and up to now they have been implementing the majority of the anti-pollution laws.  The main culprits they have been catching are the local authorities who are now supposed to go out and catch everybody else.  I think they will continue to be the main polluters in years to come unless the Parliamentary Secretary puts the squeeze on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> In reply to the question raised by the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;who better to do it?&mdash;I say the boards of conservators.  It may be necessary to broaden their base a little by allowing some members of local authorities and an inspector from the Department to serve on the board, but surely these are the people who are interested. Local authorities, by and large, are not interested in anti-pollution measures.  They are mainly concerned with saving money when striking a rate.  That is why I have these grave reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what the last speaker has said, but I do not agree that the boards of conservators should be the people to implement this or prosecute, as the case may be because there are so many forms of pollution.  The boards of conservators are only concerned with fishing.  Does the Senator appreciate that?  Is that not true?</P>
      <P>All over the country we have slaughter houses, chicken houses and so on.  The boards of conservators are concerned with fish and have no interest in such buildings.  The local authorities are the people to implement this.  They are democratically elected whereas members of boards of conservators are chosen by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be patient with me if I wander for a moment.  I want to draw a comparison with the Road Traffic Act.  We all know how much money is spent on straightening and taking corners off roads but people double-park trucks and cars.  The Parliamentary Secretary is well aware of this and he knows that if the previous speaker's suggestion is accepted the very same set of circumstances will arise.</P>

If there is fish life thriving in water it is a good indication as to whether the water is polluted or not. That is the concern of the boards of <Col N="589" /> conservators.  The boards of conservators are, by and large, elected representatives of the people they represent. The bulk of them are elected; they are not chosen.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to give the Minister this reserve power, to set up special water control authorities for river catchments or suitable groups of catchments.  While it is expected that the adequate co-ordination of functions in relation to catchments or groups of catchments can be achieved under other provisions of the Bill, in particular the provisions of section 23 concerning consultation and the general powers of local authorities to co-operate one with another, the power to set up special water quality control authorities under this section could be exercised in the event of problems arising in relation to water pollution control, for example, in estuaries and catchments where there may be a number of county or county borough councils and other bodies involved, or if county or county borough councils should fail to exercise their functions properly.  This power could also be used, if necessary, for the establishment generally of a larger water pollution control authority if this should become desirable at a later stage.  This power would not be exercised except following consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of making a water quality control authority a joint body within the meaning and for the purpose of the County Management Acts, 1940 to 1972, is to bring the authority within the management system.  Where part of the functional area of two or more county councils or county borough councils is involved, the manager would be appointed by order of the Minister.  The expenses of the joint body would be dealt with in the same way as other non-rating bodies such as town commissioners.  As a local authority for the purpose of the Local Authorities Acts, 1925 to 1974, a water quality control authority will be subject to the same provisions in regard to staffing and procedure at its meetings, audit of accounts as apply to local authorities generally.  The effect of applying the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Acts, <Col N="592" /> 1926 and 1940 to a water quality control authority will be to ensure that an office to which the Minister, with the concurrence of the Local Appointments Commissioners applies the Act, must be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>As a local authority for the purpose of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, a water quality control authority may purchase commodities from officially appointed contractors.  The effect of applying the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956, to a water quality control authority is to apply the superannuation code to officers and servants of the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator M.J. O'Higgins reminded me that I was raising an objection under a wrong section earlier.  Section 25 proposes to establish standards by the establishment of regulations but the proposal <Col N="593" /> to establish these regulations is conditional on the words:</P>
      <P>... it shall be the duty of the sanitary authority in which the sewer is vested or by which it is controlled to take steps as soon as practicable to ensure that the sewage effluent complies with or does not result in the waters to which the effluent is discharged not complying with, any relevant standard prescribed under this section.</P>
      <P>The suggestion made in the communication sent to Members of both Houses by the Galway/Corrib Anglers' Association was this condition, &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;, which will probably be interpreted to some extent on the notion of as soon as funds are available, is a considerable weakening of powers to enforce standards.  It is commented on both by that body and by the other body which has written to Senators and Deputies, the Lough Sheelin Trout Protection Association.  They say that taken with section 33 it rescinds sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  It is the view of these angling associations that given the potential repeal of sections 171 and 172 of the 1959 Act and this section which is restricted by the phrase &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; and the likelihood that a local authority will invoke insufficiency of funds, their position will be weakened. Their suggestion and that of Senator O'Brien, a member of the Lough Sheelin Trout Protection Association, is that if we repeal sections 171 and 172 and merely replace them with the powers given here to establish standards a local authority polluting a lake such as Lough Sheelin will not be able to be prosecuted with the same force as before.  A polluter who pleads that he took all reasonable care&mdash;the phrase is used in the section&mdash;cannot be convicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people will, under other sections, be precluded from the collection of evidence on pollution. Under other sections some waters may well be specified by local authorities as non-protected waters.  The organised angling associations see danger in this loophole which is given <Col N="594" /> to the local authority.  They see immense danger when put with the repeal contained in section 33.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to ensure that water quality is maintained to a proper standard on a national basis it may be necessary to prescribe standards for receiving waters having regard to their existing and potential use.  Such standards would be in the nature of objectives to which local authorities would have to have regard in preparing water quality management plans under section 15.  In addition, local authorities would be prevented from issuing a licence under section 4 for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent which would result in the receiving waters contravening the standards. Such standards may be important in the context of complying with EEC directives such as those dealing with the quality required for surface water intended for abstraction of drinking water and the quality of water for bathing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section also includes power to prescribe standards for trade and sewage effluent.  Our present approach to such standards is that each discharge would be considered having regard to the conditions in receiving waters and in this way to match the quality of the discharge to the capacity of the receiving waters.  It may, however, become necessary at some stage to fix standards for discharges, mainly to facilitate compliance with international obligations, including obligations arising under the EEC programme of Action of the Environment in particular and the directive on the reduction of pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the acquatic environment. The effect of any regulations made under this section in respect of sewage effluent from a public sewer or in respect of waters into which such effluent discharges would be to place a statutory duty on the sanitary authority concerned to take steps as soon as possible to ensure that the sewage effluent does not result in contravention of the regulations.  In this connection I should like to point out that sewage schemes have to be <Col N="595" /> planned, designed, advertised and tenders received.  They are usually processed in the Department of Local Government and tenders examined. The planning of sewage schemes cannot take place overnight; it naturally must take some considerable time.  I can assure the House and in particular Senator Higgins that it will be as soon as is humanly possible.  I qualify that by saying, without unavoidable delay of any kind or nature.</P>

Is it possible that semi-State bodies can emit effluent, as stated by Senator Higgins?  The Senator was referring to section 33.

At least CIE tell us that when the train is standing in a station we should not use the toilets but there is no provision that while a ship is in port refuse or sewage of any description is not dumped into the harbour.

      <P>I am happy with the wording of the section in this regard.  I do not think it will create any problem.  However, in view of the growing use of rivers and lakes for pleasure boating it is considered desirable that the Minister should have power to make regulations, following consultation with the Minister for Transport and Power and the Commissioners of Public Works, to enable county and county borough councils to exercise control over the use of certain types of boats which discharge their waste directly into the water.  This is completely inland.  The types of vessels which it is envisaged will be covered by the regulations are small vessels such as pleasure craft which may cause pollution problems by discharging sewage into confined waters.  The main problem arises in inland waters and the regulations will not extend to their use in tidal waters.</P>

      <P>Because tidal waters are appropriate to the Department of Transport and Power.  The Minister has no function in regard to tidal water.  It is likely that legislation will be introduced by the Minister for Transport and Power to cover matters of this kind.  Certainly, this provision does not concern us.  Sea-going vessels will not come within the scope of this control.  In order to ensure the success of this provision it may be necessary for sanitary authorities to provide suitable facilities at marinas for reception and disposal of sewage from vessels.  General powers are contained in the Public Health Acts to provide drainage facilities and to dispose of wastes.  It is considered desirable however to specify local <Col N="597" /> authority powers in this instance.  I recommend the section.</P>

It makes it clear that the authorised person may enter a premises or vessels for the purpose of performance of the function conferred by the Act on a local authority, sanitary authority, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries or the board of conservators, as the case may be, rather than a function conferred on the authorised officer.

      <P>I want to raise a matter of clarification and I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will advise me immediately on it.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>A local authority may prosecute for an offence.  The authority may so prosecute whether or not the offence occurred in (or in respect of waters in) the authority's functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying to this, he might deal <Col N="599" /> with another point which the Leas-Chathaoirleach might allow.  One needs to be able to pin the offence down and where you are dealing with waters passing through a number of local authorities areas one would need this power.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary mind replying to another point, which is: in Scandinavian legislation dealing with matters of this kind, when a local authority prosecutes a company, it prosecutes an official of that company, for example, a company's secretary, the managing director, or the board.  It is one thing to think of water being polluted and then flowing into many different areas, but when one is trying to track who is responsible for polluting activity, given the nature of industrialisation, one may need to trace the company's responsibility, for example, where the head office of the company is.  Will that be possible under the Bill when it becomes law?  In other words, one would not simply get the local representative of the company but would be able to get at the company's secretary or the board, even if they were outside the immediate area.  I know that it does not strictly arise here.</P>

      <P>If the Senator has strong views as to who should be prosecuted in the event of a likely prosecution, it would have been convenient for him to have put down an amendment to that effect.  On this question of prosecution, it is a matter for the courts. This section makes it clear that a local authority may prosecute for an offence under this Bill whether or not the offence occurred in its area.  I go further in saying that as many river catchments lie in two or more counties, it is possible that an effluent originating in one county could cause pollution in another county.  In a case where the point of discharge is close to the boundary between two local authorities this section makes it clear that a downstream local authority may take a prosecution in respect of an offence occurring upstream but outside its area.  It is giving no loophole.  Once the offence is committed the originator of the offence may be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>This section proposes the repeal of three instruments and my question is one I can quickly ask.  The points we made on so many sections and the point made by Cork Angling Associations is this &mdash;and I offer it as a suggestion that could be borne in mind&mdash;given that we have said that local authorities may when they are able to do so, make all sorts of provisions, would it not be a good step to decide to omit the repeal of sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, until local authorities sewerage treatment plants were in such a state as not to be an environmental hazard?</P>
      <P>Let us look at the phrases in section 25 &ldquo;as may be possible&rdquo;, and &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;.  The argument has been made by people involved in angling associations in particular, that as this phrase probably means that local authorities may need time to make arrangements to put their sewerage management plants in sufficient order to bring about the improvements we all want, might it not be a good idea to forego repeal of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, sections 171 and 172, in the meantime as mentioned in section 33?  This would leave the powers and the penalties as represented by those two sections.  When one had brought about a greater awareness of such things one could go ahead and repeal these sections later.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary performed a very great service of clarification in stopping me putting the word &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; in on another occasion, suggesting that it was inappropriate.  I am not suggesting that the fact that he stopped me putting the word &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo; in means that you would not have a competition between two licensing authorities.  What you would have is a system of sanctions specifically in relation to fisheries under one piece of legislation as a standby until one had improved the circumstances whereby this Bill would have greater force.  I do not see them as competing as licensing authorities now because of the care we have taken earlier.  Rather are they two coexisting systems of investigation and sanction.</P>

      <P>I assume the statements made by the Lough Sheelin Trout Protection Association in their memorandum are correct.  Is it true that because these Acts are repealed the local authority who are polluting Lough Sheelin at the moment cannot be prosecuted?  Is it true that this association, or any member thereof, can no longer take an action in the district court but instead will have to go to the high court where costs will be prohibitive?  Thirdly, they say that their association, the ESB or the Inland Fisheries Trust, each of whom has an interest in Lough Sheelin, can no longer collect evidence of pollution under the warrant of a district justice.  Does the repeal of all these Acts mean that they can no longer safeguard their interests, which is the protection of fish life in Lough <Col N="602" /> Sheelin?  If this is so, there is something terribly wrong with the repeal of these Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the failure of the Government to take care, as it is obliged to do under Article 7 of Council Directive 75/117/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, that the provisions adopted pursuant to that Directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of employees by all appropriate means, for example at their place of employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to draw attention to the failure by the Government, and by the Minister for Labour in particular, to ensure compliance by this country with the provisions of Article 7 of the EEC Directive on equal pay.  Senator M.D. Higgins has indicated that he would like to contribute to this debate and I shall shorten my contribution to facilitate him and also of course to give the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs an opportunity to reply on behalf of the Government.  I thank him for being present to hear the case put forward.</P>
      <P>The particular directive No. 75/117/EEC, on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women, provides in Article 7 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Member states shall take care that the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of employees by all appropriate means, for example at their place of employment.</P>
    <P>This directive was passed on 10th February 1975 and allowed a year for its implementation, so it is fully in force since last February.  It places a specific duty on the Government to draw attention of employees to the provisions of the directive itself and also to the national provision adopted by us as a member state.  In our case that is the Anti-discrimination (Pay) Act 1974, which became law on 31st December 1975.</P>
    <P>Not only is there a duty under this directive imposed on the Irish Government but I would submit there is also a clear duty imposed under the Constitution.  That duty is imposed by the wording of Article 40, section 3, subsections 1 and 2.  Subsection 1 provides:</P>
    <P>the State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen</P>
    <P>and subsection 2 goes on:</P>
    <P>the State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>It is now a right of every citizen in this country to be paid on a non-discriminatory basis in employment for like work.  It is a right which has been further identified and promoted by the European Court in a case on which judgment was given on 8th April last, the Defreene case as it is called.  In that case the European Court made it clear that it is a principle of European Community law, a fundamental principle, that there be equal pay for equal work; that this is a principle which cannot be derogated from by the member states, that it must be enforced and applied in the member states.  Indeed the court made it clear that it was <Col N="605" /> a basic principle of the European Community from 1962, although the judgment itself was not retrospective in its impact or effect.</P>
    <P>So there is a clear duty on the Government arising both from the directive and from the wording of Article 40 of the Constitution, and identified specifically by the European Court in the Defreene case on which it gave judgment on 8th April.  There is an obligation to defend and vindicate the rights of the citizen; to bring home to the citizens&mdash;and in this case we are talking about the female employees affected by the Anti-discrimination (Pay) Act of 1974&mdash;to bring home to them actively in their work places, in every way that it is possible and by all appropriate means, the provisions of the Act.  This includes the fact that they have rights under it, rights which they should enforce and rights which the Government should actively strive to defend and vindicate.  What have the Government been doing?</P>
    <P>First of all, they tried to get a derogation from these rights by tabling an amending Bill and by trying to get authorisation from the Commission for such derogation.  Obviously, that subject is outside the scope of the adjournment debate and I do not intend to go into the details of it.  But the Government still have listed on the Order Paper of the other House today that amending Bill which purports to be a Bill amending the Irish Act implementing the Directive.  I refer to today's Order Paper of the Dáil, dated 23rd June, 1976; the Order Paper refers to &ldquo;No. 25, Anti-Discrimination Pay (Amendment) Bill, 1975, Second Stage (Resumed)&rdquo;. So, it could be ordered; it is still there.  That is not actively promoting the rights to equal pay for equal work as provided in the Anti-Discrimination Pay Act, 1974, which came into effect on 31st December last.  Nor does one get reassurance from the statement made by the Minister for Labour in the other House on 5th May, 1976 in relation to this question. Speaking on behalf of the Government he made a statement in the lower House&mdash;what I would regard as an ambiguous, confused and <Col N="606" /> muddled statement&mdash;about whether this Act which is law since 31st December last is really part of our law and is going to be enforced by the Government.  He began&mdash;I quote from the Report of 5th May, column 687&mdash;by saying:</P>
    <P>When the matter of the Anti-Discrimination Pay (Amendment) Bill, 1975 was raised on the Order of Business on 28th April, I undertook to make a statement to the House on the Government's intentions in relation to that amending Bill, after we had received a formal communication from the Commission in Brussels on the limited derogation provided for in the proposed Anti-Discrimination (Pay) (Amendment) Bill from the EEC Directive on Equal Pay.  That formal notification of the Commission's decision has been received by us and our limited derogation from the provision of the Equal Pay Directive has been rejected by the Commission.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to give the basis on which the derogation was sought, and when asked by various members of that House to clarify the position he eventually&mdash;in a peeved and frustrated voice, one senses&mdash;said, at column 691:</P>
    <P>I thought I had made it clear but I want to emphasise it once more.  If we are not proceeding with the terms of the amending Bill then the Act operates fully.  I would have thought that was quite clear.  I am sorry that Deputy Haughey finds my presentation ambiguous but I thought I had made that clear.</P>
    <P>But, of course, it is not either action or inaction on the part of the Government in introducing and then not proceeding with the amending Bill that makes the other Act fully in force.  It came into effect on 31st December, 1975, is, and has always been, in full effect since that time.  The Government could not in fact derogate either under our own Constitution or under the express ruling of the European Court in the Defreene case from the provisions of that Act.  There is now a fundamental right to equal <Col N="607" /> pay: a right to be paid on a non-discriminatory basis.  It is extremely disturbing that the Government are not promoting and vindicating the personal rights of the citizen, in particular the right of women of this country to be paid on a non-discriminatory basis.  As a first step the so-called and purported amending Bill should be removed from the Order Paper of the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Appropriate means have to start with full Government confidence in the fact that the Act is in force and of full effect as a law on our statute books not by sowing doubts and ambiguity with confused contributions and leaving an amending Bill on the Order Paper of the House.  That certainly does not make for a clear picture.  Let me deal first with what the Government have not done to bring it home to employees in this country&mdash;and of course specifically women workers here&mdash;that the Act is fully in force, and has been since the 31st December last, so that they have rights under it and that these rights are enforceable in the Labour Court and in our ordinary courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have not, for example, put notices or advertisements in the national newspapers giving clear details of what the Act means.  It is common practice for the Government to insert such notices, in particular in relation to EEC matters, such as notices about monetary compensation amounts, notices about particular provisions in relation to the shoe industry, to take a couple of recent examples.  The British Government, which brought in a similar Equal Pay Act, put large notices, huge advertisements paid for by the Department of Employment, in all the British national newspapers.  The notices said in large block capitals: &ldquo;If you employ men and women the Equal <Col N="608" /> Pay Act is your business&rdquo; and the notice went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What are you doing about it? By 29th December, 1975 everyone who employs men and women will have to comply with the Equal Pay Act.  And this applies to every firm no matter how large or small.  If you have not already started making arrangements for equal pay, you would be wise to start now.  Time is moving on.  If you have any doubts about the obligations of employers under the Equal Pay Act you can find out quickly and easily. The Department of Employment has published a booklet&rdquo;<i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The reader could then fill in the form on the advertisement and the booklet would be sent to him.  That is what I call active promotion of the rights of citizens as provided in the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 for this country, and in England in their Equal Pay Act.  That is what the Government should be doing; putting large notices in the newspapers.  Many employers in this country still do not know that the Act is in force and that it binds them from 1st January last.  A great many women workers do not know that the Act is in force and that they can enforce their rights under it.  I do not blame them for their confusion because of the rather ambiguous and confused statements which have been made even in the last couple of weeks and are on the record of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Government have not embarked on television and radio promotion of the terms of the Bill, which I would have thought would have been an appropriate way of bringing it home to the citizens of this country that there is now a right to be paid on a non-discriminatory basis, and that they can pursue that right.  The onus was on the Government having introduced a note of confusion and lack of clarity into the situation, to clarify the position as soon as it became clear to them what was clear to anyone with a knowledge of or expertise in European Community law, that they could not derogate either under our Constitution or under European Community law from the principle of equal pay once it had <Col N="609" /> been introduced.  When that attempt failed the onus was on the Government to use all forms of media coverage to promote knowledge of the existence of the right; to promote the terms of its enforcement in the Act, and to advise women workers how they could pursue their rights.</P>
    <P>There is a specific onus on the Government because of the wording of Article 7 of the Directive to ensure that employers put up a large notice in their work place, to draw attention of employees to the terms of the Act and to draw attention to the fact that it created rights which could be enforced. This notice should include advice about the person to speak to in the firm, the method of going about it, <i>et cetera.</i>  If employers themselves were not prepared to do it voluntarily then I would say the Department of Labour should have sent around notices to employers and required those employers to display those notices in prominent places in the work place.  None of this activity has taken place.  The Minister for Labour eventually appointed two equal pay officers to process claims for equal pay under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act.  It is my understanding that about 20 cases are being processed at the moment by these equal pay officers.  This is an indication of the fact that nobody in an official capacity is really taking this Act seriously.  Is it seriously envisaged that only 20 cases of unequal pay exist here and have existed since last January.</P>
    <P>An Act has been on the statute books for six months and there are apparently 20 cases being referred. That is scandalous.  It shows that there is no attempt to promote or bring home to them the rights of female workers.  It results of course from the confusion which the Government produced, and I believe they are doing nothing to clarify the confusion.  They are, in fact, trying to promote a status quo which they were not able to achieve by seeking a formal derogation from the principle of equal pay from the Community. They are trying to let us drift on and have as little discussion of the fact <Col N="610" /> that we have a law of the land that says people are entitled to and have rights to equal pay.  That is very serious; because if that is the case it means that the Government are not observing the strict rule of law and are, indeed, undermining respect for the law.  There is a very real onus on the Government to clarify the confusion and to take all the more active steps to bring home to citizens the existence of their remedies and procedures. For example, it should be the concern of the Government to ensure that the existence and function of these equal pay officers is known.  Why do these equal pay officers not take part in special programmes on television, explain what their role is, what they are doing and how they meet the few requests that are filtering into them?  There should be an educational programme on Government time&mdash;a Government-sponsored programme&mdash;as to the way in which people can pursue their rights.</P>
    <P>The only step as far as I can see&mdash; it is a very minimal step but it is welcome in so far as it goes&mdash;is that the Department of Labour have recently published leaflets on the terms of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act.  They were distributed this month, six months after the coming into operation of the Act.  I understand that the Department of Labour have brought out two such leaflets or booklets.  One is an explanatory booklet for employers.  The other is a booklet for women workers.  It is a little more explicit.  The explanatory leaflet to employers and employees, which was published at the beginning of this month, is a brief and factual booklet about the terms of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act.  It is not a promotional booklet.  It is not anything like as explicit as the advertisements that I read out which the British Government published.  It does not argue persuasively the rights that are there to be enforced: it informs on the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>The other leaflet is a leaflet which expressly says: &ldquo;This leaflet aims to inform women workers about the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination <Col N="611" /> (Pay) Act, 1974.&rdquo;.  It is more explicit. It does say &ldquo;this affects you&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is how this affects you&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is what you can do&rdquo;.  It is my understanding that there has been a very considerable demand for these booklets now that they are available.  That is an absolutely minimal step.  We are talking about rights of citizens, promotion of knowledge about their rights, vindication of their rights, bringing it home to every employee in every work place.  This means also bringing it home to every employer&mdash; because there are hundreds if not thousands of employers in the private sector in Ireland who do not know that this Act is in force, that this binds them retrospectively and that they may pay later for an apparent lull at the moment in the enforcement of these rights.  They may find themselves with very large retrospective payments to women workers when eventually the Government decide to discharge their obligation to promote the existence of the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>I have a series of questions to put to the Minister here today.  First of all, what monitoring are the Government undertaking to ensure enforcement of the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974?  What advertising are the Government doing, including television and radio promotion of the terms of the Act?  What educational drive is being undertaken to bring home to employers and employees the provisions of it even such as notices in the work places?  Finally, what positive steps are being taken by the Government to redress the confusion and the indirect infringement of the rights of citizens of this country by an attempt to derogate from the principle of equal pay and subsequent failure to clarify the situation and to promote the rights of the citizens?</P>

      <P>Law is good law when it factually and materially changes the conditions of the people that are referred to in it.  The law which referred to lack of discrimination against women invoked constitutional documents which established <Col N="612" /> a basis of right.  I want to make a couple of remarks in the two minutes available to me.</P>
      <P>When one establishes a right and invokes a constitution, no circumstances can then be adduced of an economic kind or any other kind which can take away from the granting of that right.  The confusion which has existed has been brought about by the following: The public in general have not adverted to the tremendous trust involved in the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women and in the Article itself.</P>

      <P>The motion deals specifically with the failure of the Government to do certain things under the Directive, particularly bringing the attention of employees to particular provisions and pieces of legislation.</P>

      <P>I was trying to make the point that Article 7 was being made in an atmosphere in which the public had gone through the motions of suggesting that it was willing to accept changes in the position of women in society but did not advert to the consequences of that. When the Commission's document was discussed, it was my opinion that one could change the position of women by changing the structure of society.  In so far as this Article is in existence there is a comparison as to what we might do.  In 1948, when this country wanted to advertise the necessity for building hospitals and houses, it produced an attractive booklet which was sent to the schools and to the public.  It was a promotional booklet.  It had such language in it as: &ldquo;Ireland is building&rdquo;. If we were sincere about changing the status of women in our society we would be sending attractive booklets, marketed by people on television, sending notices, engaging in the displays that Senator Robinson has mentioned.  I am not introducing the larger issue of the suggested derogation of the Government.  If you want to pass a law and have it meaningless you can bury it.  But if you want to pass a law that is invoking a right and trying to change the consciousness <Col N="613" /> of the people, then you have to advertise widely and well that the position of woman is attempting to be materially changed.  That costs money and sincerity.  It is appalling that we are not more sincere about the legislation we pass and take the measures suggested by Senator Robinson.</P>

      <P>I followed with attention the statements of Senators which will, of course, come to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Labour.  Speaking as I am on his behalf and on behalf of the Government, I should like to confine myself quite strictly to the definite subject matter before us, which is the claim which Senators made that the Government have failed to comply with Article 7 of the relevant Directive. Article 7 reads:</P>
      <P>Member States shall take care that the provisions adopted pursuant to this directive, together with the relevant provisions already in force, are brought to the attention of employees by all appropriate means, for example at their place of employment.</P>
      <P>It is clear, as in many other matters, that there would be room for difference of opinion as to what &ldquo;all appropriate means&rdquo; might be in the particular circumstances of any member state.  Some Senators and Deputies might quite sincerely, as clearly Senators do, take the view that this requires, for example, an expensive and major media campaign: television, newspaper advertisements and so on.  The Government have not taken that view at the present stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that major national advertising campaigns can have bottomless pits of expenditure, very expensive indeed.  The Government do not feel, at this stage of the matter, that it is absoluely necessary to engage in such a major campaign in order to comply with the terms of the Directive.  I appreciate, again, that there can be legitimate differences of opinion on that.  There can be a view that the means which the Government <Col N="614" /> deem appropriate are not appropriate, but they are making an effort in this area and believe that their effort is in compliance with Article 7.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson referred to two leaflets circulated.  This is not quite correct; there are, in fact, three.  There is a printed one for employers and employees and there are separate ones, a check-list for employers and guidelines for workers.  Efforts have been made to get these into the hands of as many interested people as possible.  A printed explanatory leaflet for employers and employees issued by the Department of Labour early in June gives general guidance about the provisions of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974. The explanatory leaflet has been distributed to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and also to the trade unions which have a large membership of women.</P>

      <P>Senators can take different views on that matter but the Leas-Chathaoirleach would not wish me to enter into the whole history of this case or the issues arising out of it.  I should like to tell the House factually what the means are which have been adopted and which the Government consider appropriate so that Senators can then indicate at appropriate times and places whether they think they are appropriate or not, and why, and what further extension in their view might be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaflet in question was sent separately to the education services of the unions.  It has been distributed to employers' organisations and to bodies such as the IMI, AnCO and the IDA. It has also been sent to the editors of the journals issued by trade unions and employers' organisations.  In addition to this printed explanatory leaflet, there <Col N="615" /> is a check-list for the information of employers and guidelines for the information of workers which have had a more limited distribution but which are available on request.  This publicity literature has also been issued to any person or organisation who made inquiry with the Department of Labour about equal pay.</P>
    <P>The attention of all callers is drawn to the fact that there is such literature and copies of this literature are issued following phone inquiries. This distribution included the personnel officers of many firms.  It is freely available on request to the Department of Labour.  It is available in all manpower offices in the country.  A wider distribution of this literature will continue.  At least one large trade union intends to issue the literature to all its shop stewards throughout the country.  The distribution which has taken place to date and which is planned in the immediate future amounts to 25,000 leaflets.</P>
    <P>Under Article 7 there is an obligation on member states to take care that the legislation should&mdash;I have quoted the words before.  It is not mandatory under the Directive to bring the provisions of the legislation to the attention of workers at their place of employment by post or other such means.  This is quoted only as a sample of a method of bringing the provisions to the attention of workers. The wide distribution of the publicity literature is regarded, in our circumstances, as the most effective means of bringing the provisions of the legislation to the attention of workers. Any worker who successfully pursues a claim to equal pay is entitled to arrears retrospective from the date of the claim to 31st December, 1975, the date the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, came into operation, subject to a maximum of three years' arrears.  This retrospective provision means that workers who were late in becoming aware of their equal pay entitlement and in pursuing it successfully will not suffer a monetary loss.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to make <Col N="616" /> two points.  One is, that there is a possibility, in my view, that those who say that this method of informing those interested about the situation, their rights under the Directive and the Act, is not adequate may possibly be somewhat underestimating the capacity of the workers concerned to consult their own interests.  The word that there are rights to equal pay will travel fast in any society to those who have a particular interest in securing these rights.  It is quite clear from the information I have given the Seanad that the Department of Labour have made a genuine effort to get the necessary material, the necessary information, into the hands of people directly interested.  That material has gone out.</P>
    <P>Senators may take a different view, but I do not think that when it is a question of people's interests and of securing those interests, it is absolutely necessary to bombard them by television and by massive national advertising in order to bring those rights to their attention.  The workers, and women workers, are intelligent and sensitive enough to their own interests to be able to follow up a clue.  Furthermore, trade unionists, particularly women trade unionists, will be active in getting that word around.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach may, possibly, in her interior mind agree with me on that point.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government would like to see this information reach the relevant public and an effort is being made to do that.  In connection with that effort, I should like, on behalf of the Government, to welcome Senator Mary Robinson's motion and the support for it by Senator Michael Higgins.  The publicity arising from this motion will probably stimulate further demands for information in this area and I am sure that these demands will be fully met.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the Women's Representative Committee, or the Council for the Status for Women, were asked whether they considered that all appropriate means had been taken to bring home this Directive to workers.</P>
