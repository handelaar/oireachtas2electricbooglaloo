      <P>I know this is always a difficult time of the year but I think the Leader of the House is not being very helpful to Senators who are trying conscientiously to apply themselves to very important pieces of legislation.  I was informed by telephone that the Minister wished to take the Committee Stage of the Family Home Protection Bill today, even though it is still at Second Stage. I have facilitated the Minister in the matter and I have put in amendments that I understand will be circulated. I have not had that opportunity in relation to the Adoption Bill.  I think it is absurd to consider that we are seriously applying ourselves to the work of the Oireachtas if we try to rush through an important piece of legislation like that.  I think that the normal thing is that there is a separate Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a second time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for increased penalties for offences under the social welfare code.  These offences relate principally to cases in which employers <Col N="953" /> do not comply with their statutory obligations in relation to the payment of social insurance contributions and in which persons abuse the benefits system.</P>
      <P>Apart from increasing the maximum penalties for existing offences, the Bill contains one or two new provisions which will enable more effective action to be taken against abuses of the system and which will provide a very real deterrent against offences of all kinds.</P>
      <P>The opportunity has also been taken in this Bill to provide for an easement of the residence test for non-contributory old age and blind pension purposes in so far as it affects non-nationals of this country.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of a necessarily technical nature and I hope that the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated has been a help to Senators in their consideration of it.</P>
      <P>Much of the Bill is, of course, not really new.  For the sake of clarity and convenience it has been necessary for the draftsman to re-enact existing provisions to a very considerable extent. As part of this process, similar, but not necessarily identical provisions in the various schemes have been brought into line with each other as far as possible with a view to simplification and with an eye to a Bill consolidating social welfare legislation which has reached an advanced stage of preparation in my Department.</P>
      <P>Where a new offence is being created, or a new penalty provided, this fact is specifically referred to in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's intentions in these areas were announced in the budget statement on 28th January last when it was indicated that penalties for abuse, whether by employers or by those claiming benefit, would be increased. The purpose was to reflect more accurately in the penalty provisions of the code the large sums of money which can nowadays be involved in such malpractices and great importance was attached to the likely deterrent effect of increased penalties. <Col N="954" /> It was made clear that the Government were determined to see that those who abuse the system&mdash;thereby defrauding the State and their fellow citizens&mdash;would be prosecuted rigorously.</P>
    <P>I have frequently said that the number of cases of abuse, whether by employers or by those claiming benefit, is relatively small, though there is some evidence that the incidence of non-compliance&mdash;that is, failure by employers to pay social insurance contributions in respect of their employees&mdash;is on the increase.</P>
    <P>When one considers the very large number of persons who, in one way or another, are now involved with the Department of Social Welfare, the number, whether employers or beneficiaries, who indulge in these practices is not large.  There are, at present, approximately 88,000 recorded employers and about 500,000 claimants of the wide range of weekly payments available under either the insurance or assistance schemes together with some 405,000 families in receipt of children's allowances.  Compared with the total expenditure on social welfare benefits and allowances, amounting this year to about £430 million, the sums which go astray in these cases are quite small.</P>
    <P>That, of course, does not make the abuses any less serious or any more acceptable.  These offences are anti-social and even on a small scale can have effects out of all proportion to the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>Employers and workers as a whole, as well as the general taxpayer, are contributors to the social insurance fund and a failure, for example, by an individual employer to meet his liabilities is not something that concerns only the Department.  It is also an offence against all the other contributors. When those who fail to stamp the insurance cards of their employees have already collected money from those employees in respect of their contributions an additional, and particularly reprehensible, form of theft is involved.  Similarly, a claimant who succeeds in obtaining illegally a benefit, pension or other payment to <Col N="955" /> which he has no right, is defrauding his follow citizens and workmates no less than the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as nothing short of tragedy if, by allowing a belief to become widespread that such practices &mdash;however few in number&mdash;were on the increase and were being allowed to go unpunished, a climate of opinion were to be fostered which would be hostile to the whole programme of development of the social welfare system upon which this Government have embarked.  No one, I imagine would question the objective desirability of such development having regard to the obvious needs of so many individuals and groups in our community. A large measure of generous public understanding and support will be required if these needs are to be successfully met.</P>
    <P>I see a real danger that the existence of abuses will lead to the emergence of adverse attitudes towards everything that is being done to expand and strengthen the social welfare code and for that reason I regard the protection of that code as a major priority at this time.  The provisions of this Bill are, therefore, designed to underline clearly the determination of the Government to ensure that abuses of the system will be dealt with firmly.  The penalties for the kinds of offences to which I have been referring have in the main remained substantially unchanged since 1952.  The amounts which can be involved either by way of contributions or payments have, of course, increased enormously since then, even making due allowances for changes in the value of money.</P>
    <P>The weekly contribution rates payable by employers and employees have been raised, in line with the very substantial increases in the level of benefits under the social insurance code. Benefits themselves have been increased, in the past three years, by between 92 and 110 per cent.  Failure to pay contributions due, even for a short period, can lead to a very considerable debt and benefit obtained illegally can mount up to a substantial <Col N="956" /> figure in a short time.  The temptation is now much greater for an employer to avoid payment of contributions or for a claimant to take a chance by fraudulently seeking a benefit or other payment to which he has no legal right.  The deterrents must, therefore, be such as will ensure that it is simply not worth while to do such things in future.  The deterrents provided in this Bill will, I believe, have this effect.</P>
    <P>Present legislation normally provides a maximum fine of £50 or, if the court thinks fit, imprisonment for up to three months, or both fine and imprisonment and for summary convictions in the lower courts.  Such a level of penalties and also the limitation to summary proceedings are obviously now quite insufficient, having regard to the very large sums of money which can be involved by way of unpaid contributions and the relatively substantial amounts which are concerned in the case of benefit or assistance wrongfully obtained.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to deal more effectively with these offences by providing a two-tier system in relation to proceedings.  Where the offence is such that it can be dealt with by summary proceedings in the lower courts a maximum fine of £500 or up to one year's imprisonment, or both, is being substituted for the existing penalties of a £50 fine or three months' imprisonment or both.  In other words, these courts will be able to impose penalties up to what I am advised represents the full limit of their powers. For more serious offences, perhaps involving a large number of employees and many thousands of pounds in unpaid contributions, and where it would be quite inappropriate that they should be dealt with by summary proceedings, the Bill allows for proceedings on indictment.  In this case, the maximum penalties which may be imposed are a fine of up to £2,000 or up to two years' imprisonment or both as the court may decide.</P>
    <P>Effective as deterrents of this kind may be against individuals, something more is required in the case of limited companies.  Such companies can, of course, be prosecuted under the law as <Col N="957" /> it stands for failure to pay contributions or for other offences, but while an individual employer can have the full weight of the law invoked against him, including, if necessary, the ultimate sanction of a jail sentence, a limited company obviously cannot be similarly punished.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to deal with this problem by making the directors and officers of a limited company personally liable and punishable for an offence committed by the company unless it can be shown that they were unaware of the offence and had taken reasonable steps to prevent it occurring.  A further weakness in the law in this respect is that companies which have made deductions from employees' wages towards payment of social insurance contributions often go out of business either without having actually used the money deducted for the intended purpose or having diverted it to some other purpose.  This can also happen in the case of individual employers. That money, which is, of course, properly speaking the employees' property and not the employers', then frequently becomes swallowed up in the general assets of the company or individual concerned and is lost to the social insurance fund except in so far as it may be partially covered by the limited preferences provided for in the Acts.  The Bill, therefore, makes special provision to enable money deducted in this way to be recovered in full in preference to all other debts.</P>
    <P>Another result of the substantially increased value of the social insurance contributions is that offences involving already used or stolen insurance stamps are on the increase.  It will not have escaped the attention of Senators that reports of burglaries frequently include a reference to the theft of insurance stamps or stamped insurance cards.  The emergence of forged or counterfeit stamps, often of high technical quality is another feature.</P>
    <P>While it is already an offence to affix an already used stamp to an insurance card, there are no specific provisions in social insurance legislation under which a person involved in the use of forged stamps can be summarily <Col N="958" /> charged.  This Bill accordingly makes it an additional offence to use forged or counterfeit stamps on insurance cards. As might be expected, persons who use stolen stamps not infrequently resort to forged ones also.  This kind of thing must be firmly discouraged and with this in view all offences of this kind are being made subject to the same heavily increased penalties to which I have already referred.  Perhaps I could take the opportunity of putting it on record that if insurance stamps are purchased only through a post office in the normal way, distinguishing between a genuine stamp and a forged one need present no problem to employers.</P>
    <P>To ensure that the law regarding the payment of contributions is complied with the Department have at their disposal the power of inspection of premises and documents and the vast majority of employers are, of course, prepared to co-operate to the full with the Department's inspectors. There is always, however, a small minority prepared to use every possible means to obstruct the Department's inspectors in carrying out their statutory duties.  There are provisions in the Bill which make it easier for an inspector to deal with such cases by widening the definition of the premises or places to which access can be gained in the course of an inspection.  The widened definition includes any premises or places where the inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that insurance cards or other relevant documents are being kept.</P>
    <P>In this whole area of non-compliance one question is frequently raised which is of concern to many workers.  This is that many employees very often do not know if their cards are being stamped and are naturally reluctant in many cases to approach their employer in the matter.  Every employee has the right to inspect his or her social insurance card in order to ensure that it is fully stamped up to date and an employer cannot legitimately refuse to provide his employees with appropriate means to exercise it. However, it has been suggested that groups of employees could entrust their rights in this matter to their <Col N="959" /> trade union representatives.  I am having this possibility looked into in my Department and although, I must admit, it presents certain difficulties, I hope that it may be possible to arrive at a satisfactory solution.  No one, I think, would deny that it is of great importance that employees should be facilitated in such a fundamental issue of information which relates to their rights, and to their money.</P>
    <P>Though I have stated my belief that the extent of fraudulent claiming is nothing like as widespread as is commonly believed, the incidence of fraudulent claiming&mdash;for example concurrent working and signing of the unemployed register&mdash;and the amounts of money which can be involved are sufficient to warrant equally severe penalties on conviction.  The Bill also, therefore, enables the fraudulent claiming or receipt of any benefit or assistance to be punished by fines of up to £500 or one year's imprisonment or both on summary conviction. In extreme cases, involving offences of a particularly serious nature, the Bill allows for proceedings on indictment and fines of up to £2,000 on conviction or prison sentences of up to two years or both fine and imprisonment. As an additional deterrent, the Bill also provides for the application to the other forms of benefit, allowances, pension and assistance, of the disqualification following a conviction, at present applicable only to unemployment benefit and assistance, for receipt of the payment concerned for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>Where a benefit, allowance, pension or assistance was paid on the basis of false information, the Bill also makes it more difficult for the person who gave such false information to escape prosecution.  It is not unreasonable to assume that in such cases the person concerned knew the information was false and intended to deceive the Department and that if this was not so it should be up to the person concerned to satisfy the court on the point.</P>
    <P>My Department have gone to some lengths during the past two or three years, through various forms of publicity, <Col N="960" /> to emphasise the statutory right of claimants.  As a result, people are now more aware than ever before of what social benefits are available to them; of the conditions attaching to such benefits; and of their rights in these respects.  As part of this process it has been made easier than ever before, through simplification of forms and procedures, for persons to seek their rights.  In making things more simple, for everybody there is a danger of making it easier for the small minority of dishonest claimants also. Provision of the kind to which I have referred becomes necessary as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Many of the offences which merit prosecution do not unfortunately, through no fault of the Department, come to notice for long periods after their commission.  In general the various Acts provide at present that proceedings must be commenced within 12 months of the commission of the offence.  An exception is the unemployment assistance scheme where the period is only six months. There is provision in both cases, however, for extending the period by a certificate given under ministerial seal. Sometimes, for example it is the case that it is not until a claim for benefit is being made that it emerges that cards have not been stamped.  In other cases it may not come to light that used or forged stamps have been made use of or that an employee has been working while drawing unemployment benefit until the cards have been surrendered and examined.  This process may not be completed for many months after the year to which the cards relate.  To make it more difficult for offenders to escape prosecution through lapse of time, the ordinary time limit for taking proceedings is being extended to two years in all cases, including unemployment assistance. A uniform method of extending this period by certificate under ministerial seal is also being adopted, this being, with a slight modification, the method already applicable in unemployment assistance cases.</P>
    <P>Where possible the opportunity has been taken in the Bill to bring about a degree of uniformity among the various schemes, in so far as provisions <Col N="961" /> for offences and proceedings are concerned, where those differ at present. The Social Welfare Act, 1952, for example, gave power, in relation to the various social insurance schemes, to provide in regulations for offences and penalties.  Under the provisions of that Act this power was also applied to the various assistance schemes which came into being since 1952.  No similar power, however, exists in so far as the earlier assistance schemes, such as the non-contributory old age pension scheme and the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme and also the unemployment assistance scheme are concerned. The Bill is providing such a power in relation to these latter schemes, though the level of penalties is being confined to those applicable in summary proceedings only.  Higher levels would, I think, be inappropriate to the kind of offence which would be involved in such regulations.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill includes an amendment which relates to the residence test for non-contributory old age&mdash;and blind&mdash;pensions.  I should say, perhaps, that this test requires that in order to qualify for non-contributory old age pension a person must have resided in the State for a total period of at least 15 years of which at least five were subsequent to the attainment of the age 50.  For a person who is not an Irish citizen the five years must have been a continuous period preceding the date of the claim.  In the case of a blind pension, which is, in effect, a non-contributory old age pension payable at an earlier age than age 67, the minimum qualifying age is 21 years, the person must have resided here for five years since attaining the age of ten in the case of an Irish citizen or a total of 15 years in the case of other persons.</P>
    <P>Following our accession to the EEC in 1973 we have been obliged under the articles of accession to afford the same treatment as far as these residence tests are concerned to nationals of the other member states, and also to refugees and stateless persons, as we afford to our own citizens.  Such persons have in effect been treated the same as Irish nationals for the purpose of these residence tests.  There is little point, therefore, <Col N="962" /> in maintaining this discrimination against other non-nationals.  In any event, the abolition of such a definition would eventually be required in the context of International Conventions on Social Security.  The change proposed in the Bill, will have the effect of making the residence tests concerned the same for both nationals and non-nationals will, no doubt, be welcomed by Members of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>These then are the main features of the Bill now before you.  Bearing in mind that it is in the interest of everyone who believes in the necessity of continuing improvement of the social welfare system to ensure that any possible basis for criticism of that system is removed, and how vital it is that it should be recognised that offences against the social welfare code are among the most serious and anti-social of all misdeeds, I feel sure that Members of Seanad Éireann will give the measure their sympathetic and positive consideration.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to develop is a comprehensive and efficient social welfare system which can cope with the immediate financial needs of individuals and groups in need and, at the same time, provide for the solution of a range of more long-term social problems, such as those of the-aged, the widowed and the handicapped or disabled.  Beyond these goals lie the prospect of a system capable of mobilising the resources of society for the task of eliminating the causes of disadvantage and poverty in society.  This will involve a positive redistribution of income as between age-groups, occupational groups and regional groups.  It is, therefore, obvious that the social welfare system must be based on a number of intrinsic elements.  These include the full recognition of the dignity of every individual; the fostering of the rights of both individuals and family units; and the development of absolute openness and accessability in the working of the system.</P>
    <P>Such considerations make the need to bring forward legislative proposals such as those contained in the present Bill most painful.  There is always a danger that in defending and protecting <Col N="963" /> the integrity of the code&mdash;and the money of both contributors and tax payers&mdash;a negative and distasteful atmosphere in the whole operation of social welfare will be created.  This I want to avoid.  There is, needless to say, a continual dilemma in designing anti-abuse methods while, at the same time, seeking to open up the system and to improve relations between the Department of Social Welfare and those with whom they deal from day to day.  That being said, it only remains for me to recommend the Bill to Seanad Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it is an effort to prevent abuses as far as social welfare is concerned, but I wonder whether it will be effective or not.  The Bill is really a Bill imposing higher fines and longer prison sentences for offenders. In the past few years the number of people who have been prosecuted has not been too great.  I feel that if the law was strictly applied three or four times more people would be prosecuted. Therefore, when this Bill is law it will not be of any use unless the Department of Social Welfare are prepared to engage more staff to see that it is not abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made, and rightly so, about employers not paying contributions. We all know that this is something that has been happening down through the years and it is the worker who appears to suffer.  He suddenly finds, after six months, that when he looks for unemployment or social welfare benefits that his cards have not arrived and that he is not entitled to benefits.  It might take six months or even 12 months before this is finally sorted out by the Department and the man has to suffer during that period.  While most employers are honest people, you have the few who, maybe through no fault of their own, do not stamp the cards and allowing it to go for six months without a check is asking for trouble.  It would cost a lot more money but perhaps it would be worth it if the Department had officials who would have a look at those cards, say, once every two <Col N="964" /> months or so, where they feel that the cards will not be stamped.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces very stiff penalties on employers who do not stamp the cards, but the trouble is that most of the employers who do not stamp the cards do not do so because they are in financial difficulties. By the time you find out the cards are not stamped, they are probably bankrupt and gone out of business.  I do not know how the Minister will get his fine in that case.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the worker can ask to see his card any time he likes but I doubt if any worker will do that.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of the possibility of the trade unions or the shop stewards doing it.  If the trade union people were agreeable to do it it would be a very good thing. However, whether it is the trade unions or officials from the Department who do it, it is something that needs to be watched much more carefully. Every other day we in public life have people coming to us with cases of this kind where their cards are not stamped.</P>
    <P>As far as penalties are concerned for those who abuse the benefits by drawing benefits when they are not entitled to them, I do not know how the Minister will get over that difficulty. We all know it is happening and I believe it is happening in a big way.  The man who is employed is grumbling because he knows the other fellow is supposed to be unemployed but is not, and is drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  Unless the Minister is prepared to assign more officers to see that this abuse does not take place, I do not see any way in which the present Bill can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any abuse as far as children's allowances, old-age pensions or blind pensions are concerned. The abuse is in relation to unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits.  There are people drawing those who have work, and worse than that, a card is not being stamped for them because it cannot <Col N="965" /> be.  Their next door neighbour who is working has to pay his portion of a stamp, his income tax and everything else.  This is causing much discontent among the workers throughout the country.  If the Minister can do anything to help that I would be very grateful.  Again, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, to a certain extent, to welcome the Bill. I am not satisfied that it is necessary to increase the fines and penalties. The number of people involved with the social welfare code is quite large; the number who commit offences and find themselves in court is very small.</P>
      <P>People can be uncharitable.  Very often somebody would assist a neighbour. It is not unusual in the country for a man who is drawing unemployment to go into a farm field and help a neighbour.  At present people are becoming uncharitable.  They say: &ldquo;There is somebody working who is drawing unemployment.&rdquo;  That is not always true.  As somebody who lives in rural Ireland&mdash;I am sure many others here are of the same opinion&mdash; I believe those irregularities are not as numerous as people say.  The number of defaults by employers is very small if there are any because every employer is conscious of what would happen if his employee became ill or goes to other employment.  He knows the default would be observed and the charge should be made.</P>
      <P>As regards making false statements in making a claim for old-age pension, those claims are all investigated.  First, you have a local committee which, in itself, is a source of information. Everybody knows exactly what John Walsh or Kate Ryan, as the case may be, has when he or she applies and the neighbours will know, because they are on the committee.  The inspector at a later stage carries out an investigation. I have never yet met anyone who got a pension who did not qualify for it.  On the contrary, I suspect the investigation is too rigid.  I often felt people got a raw deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Uncharitable people talk a lot about people involved with social welfare because they are the underprivileged people.  But very often offences are <Col N="966" /> committed by people who are not living on social welfare.  Government subsidies and schemes are very often abused.  In view of the number of people associated with social welfare and the smaller number associated with other schemes, there is great credit due to the social welfare people because of the very few offences.  We should be more charitable.  I have always found people to be very careful about their claims, even giving information that perhaps would militate against them.  Every public representative from time to time has filled forms for old-age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and so on. People at all times give him the full particulars.  I doubt that it is necessary to increase the fines or penalties.</P>

      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has said, it is largely a technical Bill and detailed examination would really be out of order even at a later stage than the present Second Reading.  The general spirit of the Bill has already been welcomed with reservations, some of which I share.  I agree with the two Senators who have already spoken that rigour of the pursuit of defrauders or defaulters in terms of the old-age pension and blind pension disability area of the scheme is out of proportion both to the malice of their intentions, the clarity of their minds and indeed the amount of money that is ultimately involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I would argue that the increased penalties are to be welcomed with regard to what I would think to be a far larger body of people than either of the other two speakers visualised, those who do defraud. I am thinking particularly of those who are drawing unemployment and are at the same time working.  The two Senators who have spoken seemed to draw their experience from the rural areas.  I would totally agree with Senator O'Brien that the case of a man who goes in to help a farmer in a field in the course of a day is hardly worth talking about, but there are many in the city areas for whom this kind of fraud is almost a way of life.  I come across this in my limited <Col N="967" /> suburban experience in the course of any day, people come in, who are on unemployment and do what is known as &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;.  The philosophy of the &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; is not only a very widespread philosophy but a very widespread practice and involves a very great deal of money.  I support the Parliamentary Secretary in bringing these people to book.  These people are often drawing their money from far less privileged people who are in employment and making far less money and who are paying increasing taxes in order to support them in having the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is no great feeling among us&mdash;this is something which I would emphasise to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;of horror about this.  On page 3 there is a very admirable statement in this very well put speech which reflects a certain amount of natural moral indignation. It reads:</P>
    <P>Employers and workers as a whole, as well as the general taxpayer, are contributors to the Social Insurance Fund and a failure, for example, of an individual employer to meet his liabilities is not something that concerns only the Government.  It is also an offence against all the other contributors, those who fail and so forth.</P>
    <P>Of course it is but I do not think that is accepted by the conscience of the nation as being a serious offence of any kind.  There is a kind of Christy Mahon syndrome at work here; if you can defraud the Government in this way it is a rather clever and an almost glamorous activity.  Here what is needed is a good deal of publicity. The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned in the last paragraph that he wants the spirit of this Bill to be one that does not deter people from their proper rights in the matter while discouraging fraud.  That is the ideal one is aiming at.  It could be argued that an ombudsman and an increase in the citizen advice committees in order to enlighten people with regard to their rights could be a future way of seeing to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> With regard to these increased penalties, there is an opportunity now with the passage of this Bill for the Government to give these penalties their full publicity.  They are very considerable penalties and if only a small number of people are brought to book they will make pretty big headlines if, in fact, it is discovered that they are going to be fined sums or imprisoned to the degree that this measure provides for.  In other words, I would suggest a large range of publicity for the measure, number one, and indeed for the penalties and, side by side with it, a wider sense of publicity and education of the public to the fact that the man who is claiming unemployment and is, at the same time, working has his hand in all our pockets.  Very often he has his hand in the pockets of the most underprivileged of our employees.</P>
    <P>With these reservations, I welcome the Bill.  To sum up, I would say that the people who are defrauding in this deliberate and consistent way should be pursued with more rigour and there should be a little more tenderness shown to those far more vulnerable people who are old, blind or disabled who may be guilty of comparatively small peccadillos within the range of the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Irrespective of what system there is there will be abuses.  There are critics of the social welfare system who lay emphasis at all times on the abuses of the system.  While not ignoring abuses, I think they can be exaggerated.  On occasion these criticisms are made by people who will never have to go to the unemployment exchange or who will never have to wait on a cheque from the Social Welfare Department and it is very easy for them to be critical of recipients of social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary to update the fines and penalties for abuses.  As I said, abuses will occur in any system.  Our main problem is the lack of education and I agree with the last Senator in that.  It is anti-social behaviour. People who abuse the system are bad, but the people who employ them, knowing that they are abusing a <Col N="969" /> system and they themselves are getting away without paying for a stamp, are acting anti-socially too.  We must get the message to these people also.  This non-stamping of cards is fairly prevalent and it is probably because of the occupation I hold that I get so many complaints of unstamped cards. This has also grown in the last few years.  Whether or not a person is entitled to see a card, at times he demands to see his card.  If an employee does not see his stamped card, he should report to the social welfare inspector.  But I know of two cases where no action was taken for several months and the man involved found himself without any benefit for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will go some way towards eliminating some of the abuses.  I think, in the main, anti-social behaviour at any level should be publicised and an effort made to eliminate it altogether.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, with a few reservations.  I agree with the other Senators that those who are guilty of abusing the social welfare code should be punished.  This is something to be deplored by the whole community.  Whilst saying this, I would like to draw to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention the fact which, to me, is far more serious that there are several people who apply for unemployment assistance and especially disability allowance who are waiting for months&mdash;my next door neighbour was waiting for five months&mdash;for some assistance.  Only for the generosity and the kindness of his neighbours that man would probably be in his grave today.  On that side of social welfare I would prefer that we be lenient rather than harsh.  I would prefer five people to escape than one innocent person to be deprived of social welfare even for one week.  I cannot see why there cannot be some emergency system when somebody applies for social welfare and, if it is found that the person should not have got assistance then action should be taken.  Nobody goes to an assistance officer or applies for any social welfare benefit if he does not need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> The point was made about &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;.  There are people who, without doing any &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;, are better off unemployed than working. I know of quite a few cases.  The minute they take a job with a marginal income their rents are increased and their medical card taken away. Where there are marginal cases like that it should be made more worth while for the person to take up work than to be idle.</P>
    <P>I brought to the Parliamentary Secretary's notice previously the case of illegitimate children.  I cannot see why these children cannot get enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe illegitimate children are penalised by not getting this allowance as an orphans' pension.  The point was made by Senator Ryan about over-investigation. I totally agree with him.  I agree also that it is believed that some of the assistance is got out of the assistance officer's pocket.  We should have a certain amount of sympathy for most of the recipients and applicants because they are the poorer sections of the community.  Most of them have not had the educational chances which we have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has tried to make the rules and forms as simple as possible and I welcome this but, simple as they are, I still believe that those who have to seek this assistance are very slow in filling in their forms.  They are not as aware, as the Parliamentary Secretary may think, of their rights and I do not think we should come down on them like a ton of bricks in any case.  They should get every assistance in filling those forms, which they do not get at <Col N="971" /> the moment.  If they were getting this assistance they would not be going to their local county councillors, TDs, and Senators to help them fill in the forms.  While the Parliamentary Secretary might think it is a very easy job to fill in those forms, for those who have not had the benefit of education it is far more complicated than the Parliamentary Secretary believes it to be.</P>
    <P>I still believe that those who knowingly make false statements and receive benefits to which they are not entitled should be penalised but, at the same time, we should have a certain amount of leniency.</P>

      <P>With other Senators I welcome this Bill.  I accept the arguments put forward for it by the Parliamentary Secretary, that it is an attempt to fortify the provisions of the social welfare code by preventing abuse of them.  As always, I welcome the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary introduces a Bill in this House where his speech introducing it sets out the background, the particular intent of the Bill and also a very welcome concern for the possible conflict of interests to which it could give rise.  For example, I think it is important in bringing in a Bill to control abuses, and therefore dealing with penalties and technical legal provisions, that the emphasis should be on reinforcing the code and not creating a climate either of persistent abuse of the code or one which is adverse to the whole structure of the code.  I would very much agree with his concluding remarks where he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, therefore, obvious that the social welfare system must be based on a number of intrinsic elements. These include the full recognition of the dignity of every individual, the fostering of the rights of both individuals and family units and the development of absolute openness and accessibility in the working of the system.  Such considerations make the need to bring forward legislative proposals such as these contained in the present Bill most painful.  There is always a danger <Col N="972" /> that in defending and protecting the integrity of the code and the money of both contributors and taxpayers a negative and distasteful atmosphere in the whole operation of social welfare may be created.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary added that he wanted to avoid this.</P>
    <P>In the way in which he has introduced the Bill he has avoided that particular aspect but there is another aspect of a social welfare Bill of this sort which has not been sufficiently appreciated.  This Bill has been introduced as a technical Bill and has been commented on as a technical Bill by the Senators who have spoken.  By technical in that context they mean highly legal, highly concerned with penalties, prohibitions and with controlling abuses.  This brings me to the substantial point I would like to make before going on to consider some of the provisions relating to penalties, namely, that the whole social welfare system is not sufficiently the province or concern of lawyers.  There are two very decided views on this.  Many people would feel it is inappropriate and wrong that the social welfare code should be dragged into the world of lawyers which can tend to be narrow and legalistic, where there can be delays and emphasis on procedural difficulties and so on.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to appreciate the pervasive scope of social welfare legislation, the immense significance it has in the lives of people at every stage of their development, whether it is children's allowances, old age pensions, pensions for the blind or unemployment assistance.  Most practising lawyers are totally ignorant of these provisions from a legal point of view; they do not get involved in giving advice on them, they do not engage themselves in legal analysis of, or home work about them, or in examining case law on social welfare legislation. We are not the only country where this has happened.  In Britain there is an increasing awareness, among more thoughtful lawyers, that this is a very serious lacuna for lawyers more than for those involved in the social welfare code.  Lawyers <Col N="973" /> are tending to allow themselves to be trapped in their own narrowness, to confine their horizons too narrowly.</P>
    <P>There are exceptions to this and I would like to refer briefly to a very interesting analysis by Lord Scarman, Chairman of the Scarman Commission at one time.  In a series of Hamlyn Lectures he pointed up the challenge faced by lawyers at the moment in responding to the vastly expanding systems of social welfare, the types of claims, the penalties for abuses, the system of rights and entitlements for citizens but with no legal advice or infrastructure there to fortify and proclaim those rights.  On page 34 of the publication of the Hamlyn Lectures under the title English Law&mdash;The New Dimension, he talks about the social challenge and he goes on:</P>
    <P>When freedom was found to leave the problems of the weak and the socially exploited unsolved, the law changed direction under the guidance of thinkers such as Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill.  Then came the changes in the substantive law, e.g. the nineteenth-century development of the rights of men, women and children in the fields of employment, property, and family life.</P>
    <P>But now more is seen to be required; the State has become a welcome intruder into the social life of the community with its money and its administration, erecting the social security system as an integral part of the welfare state.  The management and control of the social security system represent one of the great modern challenges to the law's flexibility in the pursuit of survival. On this aspect of the social challenge the law's response has been, so far, hesitant and confused.  There are two basic problems: is it desirable that the social security system should be subjected to &ldquo;the legal treatment&rdquo;&mdash;i.e. advice, assistance, and control? If it is, has the legal system, as we know it, the flexibility to meet the challenge?  There is the strong possibility of a qualified answer to the first question, which would then raise the consequential question: to what extent should the social security <Col N="974" /> system be tied into the general legal system?</P>
    <P>Then he goes on, and this is the key aspect of what I want to say later:</P>
    <P>First the facts, The truth is that the system of social security is so far removed from the practice of the law that very few lawyers have any but the haziest idea of its nature and content.  Ignorance of the field to be covered is a poor beginning for the establishment there of the rule of law: but this is where we begin.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to analyse the pervasive effect not just of a single system but of overlapping and interlocking systems of social welfare; of the establishing of an intricate code of entitlements to citizens but completely outside the normal range of law as lawyers see it, which they would consider to be concerned with advising citizens on their rights.  Their practice does not impinge at all on this whole area of the social welfare code.  Then he goes on to look at the other aspect of it which is, to some extent, dealt with in this Bill, that the agencies of the social welfare code encroach on citizens in a very significant way.  I intend to come specifically to the degree of encroachment by inspectors, for example, who have reasonable cause to suspect some abuses.  Again this is not coming to the attention of lawyers even in the civil liberties context in a way in which it would if it were not part of what they regard as being completely outside their terms of reference and their experience of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>It is time that more serious consideration was given to this very definite lacuna in the attitude of lawyers.  One illustration of this is posed by the provision of section 3 (6) of the Bill. Section 3 provides for amendments of certain social welfare provisions, in particular, for the inspection of premises and other places where there is a possibility of abuse.  Subsection (6) states:</P>
    <P>The premises and places liable to inspection under this section are any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any persons are or have been employed and any <Col N="975" /> premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any insurance cards or any other documents relating to persons in employment are kept.</P>
    <P>It is the second part of the sentence which is extremely far-reaching.  I have put down an amendment to try to limit its scope.  It means that if an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any person has brought insurance cards or any other documents relating to persons in employment back to his private house, that house becomes a premises or place that can be inspected.</P>
    <P>There is no further legal provisions for getting a warrant or for applying to the courts for permission to enter. So, one is dependent on the attitude of an inspector as to what is a reasonable belief and what are reasonable grounds.  I am all for closing loopholes where there might be abuse of the social welfare code but this provision goes way beyond the normal bounds of one of the basic tenets of civil liberty, the protection of a person's private home from abuses, including over-reaching by State agencies.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that as it stands at the moment section 3 (6) provides for a high degree of over-reaching and of invasion of the private home of a person because an inspector of the Department reasonably believes that that person may be contravening the provisions of the social welfare code or may have insurance cards or other documents on the premises.  I am not saying that the inspector may not under any circumstances have that power but it should be as in the case of a member of the Garda Síochána. If he wishes to enter a person's private house if he believes there is some criminal matter there, a warrant is required.  Similarly, an inspector of the Department of Social Welfare should require either some equivalent of a warrant or the consent of the court before entering a private dwelling. This provision comes quite close to encroaching on the constitutional protection of the dwelling, &ldquo;that the dwelling of every citizen shall be inviolable&rdquo;. <Col N="976" /> As this subsection stands, the dwelling of every citizen is only inviolable unless an inspector from the Department of Social Welfare has reasonable belief that it may contain insurance stamps.  Then it is not inviolable and may be inspected.  Any attempt to frustrate the inspector from the Department gives rise to very considerable penalties.  It is provided in the same section:</P>
    <P>(4)  If any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  wilfully delays or obstructs an inspector in the exercise of any power under this section, or</P>
    <P>(b)  refuses or neglects to answer any question or to furnish any information or to produce any document when required to do so under this section, or</P>
    <P>(c)  conceals or prevents or attempts to conceal or prevent any person from appearing before or being examined by a person appointed under this section he shall be guilty of an offence under this section....</P>
    <P>On summary conviction he will face a penalty of £500 or a year's imprisonment, and on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £2,000 or two years' imprisonment.  There are substantial penalties facing the citizen who may have felt that his home was inviolable and that he could resist an inspector from the Department who had a reasonable belief that social security stamps were in that person's home.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the Bill on which I should like some clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary relates to the minimum penalty on summary conviction.  It is provided in this section, and it is one of the overall provisions of the Bill, that on summary conviction for various offences a person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £500.  Did the Parliamentary Secretary get an opinion from the Attorney General's office or from some other agency as to this minimum fine for a summary offence? The reason for my asking this is that, quite recently in the House, when we were discussing the Family Law <Col N="977" /> (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Bill, 1975 which is now an Act, penalties were provided for in section 20.  On conviction a summary penalty for an offence under that section shall be a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.</P>
    <P>I have not got the precise reference, but I recall the Minister for Justice in moving that Bill and in referring to that section as saying that £200 was the maximum fine for summary offences.  I should like clarification on what is the maximum fine for a summary offence because there is too much vagueness about it.  At a time of inflation it may well be that £500 would be considered reasonable as a minimum penalty for a summary offence.  There appears to be a different view among different people. This point also came up recently at the Joint Committee on European Community Legislation where a statutory instrument had been made under the European Communities Act, 1972, and the Minister only has power to create summary offences. The question of what constitutes the maximum fine for a summary offence was raised.  I would welcome some clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary on that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to reaffirm my substantive point: that this type of Bill brings home the extent to which the social welfare code necessarily becomes a complex code riddled with various types of penalties, obligations and responsibilities, riddled also with rights of citizens and entitlements of citizens.  It is a sad reflection on lawyers and on the legal system if they operate totally apart from the code, and if their role is not flexible enough to respond to and modify some of the legalistic aspects of a narrower approach to law which has excluded it and has created an atmosphere where people try to turn away from a narrow aspect of lawyers and the law expressly to avoid some of the deficiencies in the present system.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary said that his Department <Col N="978" /> have made strenuous efforts in recent times, through various forms of publicity, to bring home the various types of rights and entitlements which individuals can claim.  Is this his own or his Department's off-the-cuff assessment, that there has been a considerable improvement in genuine knowledge about what beneficiaries are entitled to, or has there been a more scientific monitoring, or some sort of broad-based study or monitoring of whether citizens are more aware of their rights, or are more facilitated in pursuing them?  I agree that there has been considerable complaint down the years that the attitude has tended to be a mean one, minimising knowledge of rights rather than encouraging people to explore their personal position and ensure that in making their claim they claim the full benefits they are entitled to under the social welfare scheme.  I would welcome clarification on the points.  I will put in at once the amendment that I have so that it can be circulated without holding up this Bill.  Section 3 (6) is very broad and an undesirable encroachment on civil liberties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers I welcome this Bill in the sense that it is a serious effort to do something about the abuses of the social welfare system by significantly increasing the penalties.  In the past the number of people who were brought before the courts in regard to these abuses has been very small indeed.  Unless the Minister is prepared to put more personnel from his Department into the field to ensure that the people who abuse the system are brought before the courts, I doubt very much whether the increases he proposes will improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all well aware that there are people who never claim social welfare benefits.  The honest-to-God, down-to-earth worker who throughout his lifetime has not had any ill-health, has never had to make application for social welfare benefits.  We also know that there are a number of people who seem to specialise in drawing any benefit they can under the social welfare code.  There is no use in saying there are not abuses.  Every public <Col N="979" /> representative knows that there are. It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to put more personnel into the field to ensure that abuses are wiped out once and for all.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here today by previous speakers that a worker may be drawing unemployment benefit and, at the same time, getting two or three days' employment during the week.  We are all well aware that this is happening.  The Department should ensure that people are not in a position to do this.  It is happening on a large scale, even in rural areas.  This is the fault of the Department in not ensuring that enough personnel are employed in this area.  I know one person who did not realise how well off he could be until he received unemployment benefit.  He had been an honest and hard worker prior to that. Since he has discovered the amount of his social welfare benefits he is a different type of worker.  All he needs now is any excuse to stay out of work.</P>
    <P>This is something that the Department will have to wipe out.  I know that it is on a small scale but it is happening.  It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to ensure that it is discontinued.  I would sincerely ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that more personnel are put into the field to wipe out these abuses.  He should also concentrate on the employers who are abusing the system.  The number of employers who have been brought before the courts up to now is very small.  Indeed, the employers who get into financial difficulties are those who do not pay their contribution towards the stamp. During the present financial recession the number of employers in this category is increasing all the time.  I am glad to see that in this legislation the Minister will be in a position to recoup outstanding contributions.  I would sincerely ask the Parliamentary Secretary to put more personnel into the field to wipe out the existing abuses.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that, in general, all <Col N="980" /> Senators who spoke welcomed the introduction of the Bill with certain reservations.  Indeed, in my opening speech I indicated that I also found it distasteful that it was necessary to bring in this type of legislation before the Oireachtas.  I am convinced that only a relatively small number of people, either employers or employees, abuse the system.  The amount of publicity and the number of general statements alleging certain offences against the system has made it necessary and, in my opinion, at this stage of the development of the social welfare code desirable, to bring in legislation that will reassure the vast number of our people that we are conscious of abuses against the system, no matter how small the number of people engaged in them may be, and that we are determined to ensure that, as far as possible, these abuses will cease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary have any breakdown of figures of actual abuse, even in general terms, and the amount of money going astray or going into the wrong hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give figures for detected abuses.  The ones that we have not detected are the ones that we could not calculate.  There were approximately 450 prosecutions in a 12-month period for abuses of the code. That would not be the full number of abuses that were detected because, in many cases, where we can ensure that there is no continuance of it, where we can recover any money that may have gone astray, it would not be deemed desirable or necessary to proceed through the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was saying that there has been a large amount of publicity and wild allegations have been made against the system.  It is only fair to say that Senator Cowen was the exception in that he made a vague general statement about abuses of the system.  If Senator Cowen or anyone else is aware of a specific abuse against the system he has an undoubted duty to bring it to the notice of the authorities.  If he is aware of a man who is unemployed and who has been offered reasonable employment, that man will be disqualified <Col N="981" /> under the existing law, never mind the new law, from benefits if he refuses to take up suitable employment.</P>
    <P>This kind of general accusation against people on social welfare&mdash;is slanderous.  It is slander against the vast majority of people who reluctantly have to resort to social welfare.  There was reference to people making social welfare a way of life.  I regard people who are unemployed, not as dishonest people, but as victims of the kind of society in which we operate.  One would not be condemned for insuring his house against fire and for claiming insurance in the event of fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said why I brought in the Bill.  Irrespective of the number of people who may be engaged in this practice, it is a highly undesirable and anti-social thing and I do not think we can judge legislation or penalties by the number of people who may be engaged in breaking the law or anticipating breaking the law.  The duty of the Oireachtas as I see it, is to fix maximum penalties so as to indicate to the courts the seriousness with which we view a particular breaking of our legal code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the number of people who abuse the code is relatively few, this does not take away from the seriousness of the offence.  Senator Ryan in his opening remarks mentioned that through the failure and neglect of employers to stamp cards, a grave injustice can be perpetrated against employees in a particular concern.  He mentioned that when someone becomes unemployed or ill, although he <Col N="982" /> has being paying his contribution week by week&mdash;it having been deducted by the employer&mdash;when he comes to claim what is rightfully his, he finds that he is not entitled to it by virtue of the fact that the employer has put the money in his own pocket. Not only is such an employer defrauding the social welfare fund, but he is also systematically robbing his own employees and, possibly, their dependants.</P>
    <P>We have devised a system whereby once we are satisfied that there has been no collusion between the employer and the employee in the non-stamping of cards full credit is given to the employee.  It would not be correct to say that there are extremely long delays before that benefit or credit is established.  I have been impressed by the short duration of the time that elapses before the officers in the Department have been able to establish the fact that there was no collusion and that benefits are paid in full to people who through no fault of their own find that their stamps have not been affixed to their cards.  The difficulty of policing the whole area is emphasised by what I said in my opening remarks&mdash;that there are 88,000 registered employers in the country and somewhat in excess of a half a million people involved in weekly payments from the Social Welfare Department.</P>
    <P>I have reason to hope it will be possible to extend the law whereby in so far as an individual employee has a right to examine his card, this can be extended to allow an accredited representative of a trade union to inspect all the cards on behalf of their members in a particular employment. This will go a long way towards easing the problem.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies stated that while they welcome the Bill they find that the penalties may be too severe in some cases.  Children's allowances and old-age pensions were mentioned in this regard.  The purpose of this Bill, and my earnest hope is, that no one will be prosecuted under its provisions. I hope that by virtue of the fact that this legislation is going through the Oireachtas these maximum penalties <Col N="983" /> may be imposed by the courts, the Bill will act as a deterrent against anyone who in the past, or in the present, or who may be contemplating indulging in any of the various abuses that I described in the provisions of the Bill.  If certain cases arise and if there are extenuating circumstances&mdash; the only thing that we here are doing is laying down maximum penalties&mdash; all the other relevant facts can be taken, and should, indeed, be taken into consideration by the courts.  I am sure that not only justice, but justice tempered with compassion and mercy, will be exercised should any of the cases arise about which Deputies or Senators have reservations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the abuse of social welfare&mdash;it is like everything else&mdash; you can pass laws but unless there is an appreciation by the general public of what is involved, the law in itself will be of very little benefit in my opinion.  I accept Senator Martin's contention that the solution to the problem lies in the area of education. I do not understand why we in this country seem to view anyone who can engage in what is, if not actually illegal, definitely immoral practices&mdash; and I am not using the word &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; in the context of sexual practices.  As a society, we seem to look up to such people.  This attitude runs down through the whole system. The greater the fiddle that one seems to be engaged in, the greater the admiration of the Irish people would appear to be for that person.</P>
    <P>Someone engaged in land speculation, for instance, who might stay strictly within the law but who because of his particular type of operation, will condemn people and whole families to live in debt for 25 to 35 years and who accumulates a lot of money for himself is engaging in an immoral practice but we as a society apparently do not realise this.  Instead, we look up to that individual.  It is about time we realised that these people are dipping very deep into our pockets and causing an awful lot of misery to individual people and families in our society.  There is also the question of <Col N="984" /> mergers, all sorts of very dubious practices engaged in higher finance, in mergers of companies where substantial profits are made overnight for a few individuals, with 300 or 400 people put out of employment.  One must consider not only the effect on them but that on their families also. We do not condemn the people who engage in these practices.  Again, by some curious definition of moral behaviour, we appear to look up to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We seem to think that morality has something to do with sexual behaviour and that there are no other facets whatsoever. This applies also to people engaged in abuses of the social welfare system.  The money involved is not as great; the number of people engaged in it is relatively small.  But the principle is the same and we apparently have exactly the same attitude towards them &mdash;if a fellow fiddles his income tax he is a smart fellow; if a fellow is abusing the social welfare system he is a hard man, a clever boy; if some fellow is engaged in all sorts of practices bringing total misery to individuals and families in our society, he is a very clever fellow; he can make an awful lot of money.  It has gone right through our society and in my opinion is doing our society untold harm.  It is engaged in mostly by people who have had the privilege and benefit, at the expense of others, of higher education, all sorts of advantages denied people who usually have to resort to social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised two issues. One was the involvement of the legal profession in the social welfare code and the other&mdash;in respect of which I understand an amendment is being submitted&mdash;regarding the right of entry by an inspector of the Department into premises in which he believes, or has reason to believe, documentation in relation to social welfare may be kept. I cannot accept the amendment.  I understand and appreciate fully why the amendment was submitted.  On reflection I think the Senator will see a <Col N="985" /> very close connection between the two issues raised.  Unfortunately, the legal profession is not as far removed from the social welfare code as the Senator seems to imply.  As far as employers and people with the wherewithal are concerned, the legal profession is very much involved in the social welfare code.  They are very much involved in advising employers of every possible legal loophole that can be availed of to evade their responsibilities and evade, if not the letter of the law, undoubtedly the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason it is necessary to have this provision.  I accept fully the reservations that Senators may have about it but I would hope also they would accept the very unpleasant fact that it is necessary to have it there. There is also the protection that an inspector must have reasonable grounds for believing that relevant documentation is kept on certain premises and that, in the event of the matter going to court&mdash;to which the occupier of such a premises is entitled&mdash;the onus would be on the inspector to satisfy the court that he had reasonable grounds for suspecting that such documentation was there.  Therefore it is not an open cheque to inspectors of the Department.  Indeed already in our social welfare code, under the law obtaining for many years, inspectors of the Department have the right to enter into private homes to ascertain whether or not a domestic is employed there. It is not an innovation; it is a widening of the definition of existing law under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will accept that explanation while I appreciate their reservations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 20, after the word &ldquo;places&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than a person's private dwelling&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an amendment to <Col N="986" /> section 3, subsection (6), about which I spoke on Second Stage.  As it stands at present, I believe that Section 6 is very broad and encroaches on the area of civil liberties in allowing an inspector, if he has reasonable grounds for believing that any person has insurance cards or other documents in any place, including his private dwelling, to carry out an inspection of that private dwelling.  Subsection (6) provides that:</P>
    <P>The premises and places liable to inspection under this section are any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any persons are or have been employed....</P>
    <P>Then there is the second sentence to which I take exception:</P>
    <P>and any premises or places where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any insurance cards or any other documents relating to persons in employment are kept.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to insert, after that second use of the words &ldquo;and any premises or places&rdquo; the words &ldquo;other than a person's private dwelling&rdquo;&mdash;where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing any insurance cards or any other documents relating to persons in employment are kept.</P>
    <P>In his reply the Parliamentary Secretary said that he would not accept the amendment, in fact before he had seen it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had heard the Senator's terms.  Because of the respect I have for the Senator's ability to articulate precisely what she means, I accept it as being correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a kind way of taking some of the sting out of having an amendment rejected before it has been seen.  Nevertheless I would like an opportunity of putting forward what I believe are very strong grounds why the amendment should be accepted; that is that at present it makes a substantial change in the type of power of inspection it would give to an inspector of the Department. <Col N="987" /> I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary said that the power is already broad.  It is as broad as the first part of subsection (6) that an inspector can inspect a premises where persons are either employed or have been employed.  But the extension in relation to a reasonable belief that certain documents may be in a person's dwelling is, to me far too open-ended. It means that any document about wages of people brought home and put in a drawer at home; it means any reasonable belief that any documentation about or related to either insurance cards or to persons in employment, any information about that, is enough to give the inspector a right to enter and inspect that private house.</P>
      <P>I accept, rather sadly, that there is a great deal of truth in the reference the Parliamentary Secretary made to the role of lawyers in relation to the social welfare code, that all too often it is a role of those with money advising employers how to evade some of the provisions.  I accept that part of the closing up of possible abuses and loopholes is to try to prevent that sort of advice being given and to prevent loopholes being there.  I submit that there is a very important balance to be maintained.  It is right to try and exclude some obvious loopholes and to up-date penalties so that they are meaningful penalties in order to prevent employers evading their obligations under the social welfare code. However, it is not right to allow for an erosion of the protection of the inviolability of the private dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it is an either or situation.  It is possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to give an ininspector from the Department the full powers he needs but subject to a necessary extra procedure when the search is to be a search of a private dwelling.  In other words, this amendment would exclude a person's private dwelling.  It would be open for the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce a specific amendment, a section dealing with the case where the inspector reasonably believes that documents or social welfare cards are contained in <Col N="988" /> the private dwelling or, alternatively, it may well be that if the inspector believes that the type of documentation is, in fact, documentation relating to a criminal offence he may be able to get assistance from a member of the Garda who can get a warrant to search the premises.  It is not difficult to devise a mechanism which upholds the principle of the inviolability and privacy of the dwelling.  That principle has a very strong constitutional base Article 40.5 provides that:</P>
    <P>The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>We are not talking here about forcible entry in the sense of forcible entry with a gun, but nevertheless, the entry of the inspector on a reasonable belief that there is some documentation there would be forcible in the sense that it would not be entry by consent.  It would be entry which could not be resisted without the citizen being open to penalties under this section, on summary conviction, a fine of £500 and a year's imprisonment or on conviction on indictment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect to Senator O'Higgins, it must be in accordance with the law which is in accordance with the Constitution.  In accordance with law in these circumstances means in accordance with the norms of due process.  In earlier cases in relation to a person having a right to liberty save in accordance with law, that in the early 1940s this was given a very limited interpretation, which has been very heavily criticised.  &ldquo;In accordance with law&rdquo; there meant in accordance with the law of the land for the time being.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a considerable amount of criticism of an interpretation by the Supreme Court in <Col N="989" /> the early 1940s of a similar provision of Article 40:</P>
      <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>That was interpreted at that time by the Supreme Court as meaning in accordance with the law of the time being, meaning any statute.  This is in striking contrast to the whole development of an American concept of due process of law and is in contrast with interpretation of other sections such as the protection of the personal rights of the citizen, that there is a core of due process under our law which law must conform to in order to conform to the protection guaranteed there.  If that is accepted, then the interpretation of the particular section I referred to:</P>
      <P>The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>That law must conform to constitutional norms of due process.  It is my contention that the present wording of section 3 (6) goes beyond that.  It gives too wide powers to inspectors from the Department of Social Welfare.  The control is a very nebulous one.  He must believe on reasonable grounds and he has a right then to invade anybody's home looking for documentation.  I do not believe that this would be accepted in Britain.  I am certain it would not be accepted in the United States and I do not think it should be accepted here.  I do not think we should create that kind of imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have an infrastructure of concern about civil liberties in Ireland in the way I would like that we did, and this is, if you like, an unintentional encroachment on civil liberties.  There other areas where the encroachment is more deliberate and intentional; this is an unintentional encroachment on civil liberties.  It is a very dramatic one. It is going far beyond the particular ill the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to cure.  I accept his statement that there have been abuses, including for example, taking documentation and social welfare cards back to a private dwelling in order to try to evade detection. But there are other more acceptable <Col N="990" /> ways of dealing with that which still retain a balance in our legislation between the State and the individual.</P>
    <P>This gives too much power to the Stage agency&mdash;the inspectors of the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;to invade a person's private dwelling, to search a person's home.  It goes past one of the basic principles of common law, that a man is master of his castle, that in his home he is inviolable.  There are other very understandable and reasonable inroads in this, inspection of various fitting and fixtures in a house inspection by, for example, the ESB or other State agencies, and inspection even under the social welfare code where persons are employed in that private dwelling.  This goes a significant step further and allows an inspector to do what a member of the Garda Síochána could not do.  A member of the Garda Síochána could not walk into a private dwelling on a reasonable belief that there might be documentation there that might help him to solve some serious crime.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary now that he has seen the amendment to reconsider his attitude on it and accept that this amendment is necessary in order for the section not to erode an important aspect of civil liberties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my agreement with Senator Robinson's point.  I demurred at it a little when I first looked over the Bill but I was so in sympathy with the Bill as a whole that I let it slide past.  If an inspector has reasonable cause to think that such documents are in a private dwelling he should be reasonably able to persuade the police, and police commissioner, for a warrant to be taken out in order that a search might be made.  The inconvenience of going through that process seems to me to be well worth going through when one considers the principle that is being put at hazard by the statement, the rendering open to search of this kind a house.  If not in the letter, certainly in the spirit this seems to be against the Constitution.  I have felt that about several Bills recently.  We sometimes legislate in this House as if we did not have a written Constitution at all and we belonged in a totally common law area.  I accept <Col N="991" /> Senator Robinson's point, as much as I accept the goodwill of the Parliamentary Secretary in the matter.  I appeal to him to accept her amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary replies, I should like to say that I fully appreciate the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that this legislation will operate in a very effective way.  The point raised by Senator Robinson is one that should be carefully considered. Senator Martin was correct in referring to the fact that it is not uncommon in modern legislation to incorporate this kind of provision.  We have seen it in several Acts.  I am not suggesting it has originated by any means from the present Government from the opposite benches and in the Opposition benches in the other House.  I adverted to this on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied this provision is necessary, and has constitutional sanction in the sense that it is not unconstitutional, well and good.  We would all be prepared to go along with it, provided we have this assurance that he regards it as necessary for the implementation of this Bill.  Senator Robinson made a point that was troubling me, as I indicated by my interruption, that is, the provision of Article 40.5 of the Constitution which she quoted:</P>
      <P>The dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>I was inclined to read that as meaning it was open to the Legislature to alter the position as regards the person's rights in his home by enacting legislation.  Senator Robinson referred to a case decided previously on this particular point.  She is very much more familiar with decided cases than I am on this subject.  Very careful attention should be paid to what she said.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, it seems to me that this whole thing may very well be regarded as being leaven so to speak, and having to be read in context with Article 40.3 of the Constitution which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that one of the personal rights referred to is the right of a citizen of the State to have his dwelling inviolable and not to have it forcibly entered.  If I am right in reading the Constitution in that way&mdash;in other words at the commencement of Article 40 there is a general declaration a general guarantee given in the Constitution as to the way in which personal rights are to be dealt with by the State, a guarantee with regard to the kind of laws which will and will not be enacted&mdash;then one has to look very carefully at a provision in any legislation which may seem to run counter to that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied that the position is in accordance with the Constitution and that it is necessary in order to stamp out the kind of malpractice he has been talking about.  That is one side of the picture we have to see.  It is one of the things to be weighed up.  I certainly am prepared to go along with the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would very earnestly suggest to him that the case made by Senator Robinson on this deserves the very careful consideration of himself and his advisers, both legal and lay, in his Department.</P>

I would not like to see legislation which could possibly unnecessarily infringe on the rights of the individual passing through this House without being questioned, and without some sort of meaningful discussion on it.

All I was really concerned about was whether or not it was necessary in the Bill and if I came to the conclusion, which I did, that it was necessary in the Bill, to ask the Attorney General's Office would it be in conflict with the Constitution. On that point I was assured it would not.  I must apologise also to Senator Robinson for not answering another issue she raised on Second Stage.  I will clear it up now if I may.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also advised&mdash; I specifically inquired about this because different statements have been made&mdash;by the Attorney General's Office no later than last week that the £500 under summary proceedings was not unconstitutional.  It was on the basis of that advice that I acted.</P>
      <P>This House has an obligation to protect and safeguard the rights of the individual.  There is another right we have an obligation to safeguard. It is the right of a worker who allows money to be stopped each week to pay his contribution to safeguard both himself and his family against contingencies such as unemployment, sickness, death.  We have a right to ensure that, while that man entrusts his money to an employer to be paid into a fund to guarantee him those safeguards, that money is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the experience of the Department of Social Welfare that all sorts of ploys are used by employers who are engaged in non-compliance with the regulations.  They have at their disposal the best legal advice on how to avail of every possible loophole that may be in the existing law.  I have no doubt that were I to accept this amendment, any employer who was <Col N="994" /> engaged in this type of practice would ensure that all relevant documentation was kept in his private dwelling, and make it virtually impossible for officers of the Department to ensure that not only the letter but the spirit of the law we are now passing through this House was observed.</P>
    <P>On the basis that I have been assured it is not in conflict with the Constitution, and on the basis of my belief in an individual who is acting within the law, who is paying his fair contribution towards insurance against certain contingencies, as against someone involved in an illegal and fraudulent practice against the social welfare code, against his own employees and against society as a whole, we are entitled&mdash;and there is an obligation on us&mdash;to take whatever powers are necessary within the Constitution to ensure that these laws are observed and these safeguards provided.  There is no question of officers of the Department being given the right of forcible entry into anybody's private home.  At all times the obligation would rest with the officer of the Department to ensure and satisfy a court that he had reasonable grounds to suspect that this type of documentation was being kept in the private home.</P>
    <P>The contributions which have been made in support of this amendment so far would lead some people to think that it was a departure from existing legislation, and that is not correct.  The right of an officer of the Department to enter into a private dwelling has been contained in our legislation for a long number of years.  All this is doing is extending the purposes for which that officer may avail of this power.</P>
    <P>In a very fair and objective contribution Senator Robinson said that she accepts that in certain cases &mdash;the ESB, local authorities and so on&mdash;the right of entry should be there in respect of these matters. Senator Robinson also accepted that, if a person was employed in a private dwelling, the officer should have the right to enter that dwelling to ensure the regulations were being observed in respect of that person. Surely any reasonable person who <Col N="995" /> would accept those reasons for entering a private dwelling will accept it as even far more desirable that we should have that power to safeguard possibly the interest and future wellbeing of 300 to 500 employees.  If you accept it on behalf of one individual I cannot see the logic of not accepting it in the interest of safeguarding the interests of 300 to 500 individuals and their dependants.</P>
    <P>As I said, while there are some provisions which I find distasteful, it is necessary and desirable to include them in the Bill to safeguard the interests of workers.</P>

      <P>While I would like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his full reply to the amendment, I am afraid I am not satisfied, so we will have to pursue this a little further.  On the question that in the view of the Attorney General's office the subsection is constitutional, I accept that that is his view on that, but I do not think that closes the matter.  We must operate not only within the bounds of constitutionality but also within the bounds of a balance between rights of inspection and encroachment on privacy and on the private dwelling.  There is still that middle ground there, and I believe this provision, for the purposes for which it is being introduced, over-encroaches on the privacy of a person and on a private dwelling.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to the fact that employers might avail of the situation and take documentation to a private dwelling and indeed might be advised by lawyers to do it.  I think he will accept that my amendment is not a protection of employers but a civil liberties amendment, if that needs to be made clear.</P>

      <P>The wording of the particular part of subsection (6) to which I take exception bears very close examination.  It is so broad as to give a right to an inspector of the Department, if he has reasonable <Col N="996" /> grounds for believing that any documents relating to persons in employment are kept in a house, to enter into that private dwelling. He does not have to have reasonable grounds for believing that they are documents defrauding the social welfare system as that part of the section stands.</P>
      <P>Where an inspector has reasonable grounds for believing that any insurance cards or any other documents relating to persons in employment are kept....</P>
      <P>I would like to anticipate the sort of assurances I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would give, that it is not the intention to encroach in a general way, that this will not be abused and so on, and to say that I am not at all interested in statements on the record of this House about what the scope of the section is but in the wording of the section showing what the scope of the section is.  Any inspector who could say &ldquo;I reasonably believed there were documents, although I did not know what was in them, relating to the employment of a person in that private dwelling&rdquo; is authorised by the section to go in on that ground and have a general inspection.</P>

    <P>If we are talking about things like insurance cards or other documents relating to a person in employment, we are talking about documents and therefore when we talk about inspection we talk about a right of search, so what do we mean by inspection in these circumstances except a right to go through desks, drawers and inspect all the documents there.  That is a very far-reaching power.  The other Senators who spoke and I do not say that under no circumstances can this power be exercised, but we would prefer a provision which provided an extra-procedural requirement for an inspector who is going to go into a private dwelling looking for documentation relating to employment.  The additional requirement could be either that he get the assistance of the Garda under a search warrant or the consent of a court or some other mechanism under which the inspector would have to do a little more justifying and the burden on him would be a little more than it might be for <Col N="997" /> inspecting normal places of employment. As the section stands it is very far-reaching and open-ended, and it could give rise to an inspector feeling confident that he will find some document relating to employment, be it a notebook setting out the number of employees, letters about employees or any document relating to employment. If he wished to extend, in an administrative sense, the scope of the powers here, an inspector could say that he reasonably believed there were documents relating to employment in the house, and even if there were not documents he still believed it.  It is a very broad scope indeed.</P>
    <P>I come back to my argument about the middle ground position.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that it is necessary to have this provision and that he has the opinion of the Attorney General that it is constitutional. In response to that I would say it is not necessary to have this power in this form.  There are other ways of closing that loophole if it is believed that it could give rise to abuse.  I have no objection to the loophole being closed.  It is the way in which it is being done to which I take exception.  Secondly, I do not believe it is enough to say that there was an opinion from the Attorney General that it was constitutional. There is another aspect to it.  Is it desirable to have this degree of encroachment on privacy and on a private dwelling as broadly trained as that in our legislation?  Should we not, in this House, be very scrupulous to ensure that there are adequate controls and adequately tight wording on a section like this?  Why should we give inspectors of the Department of Social Welfare far greater powers than we give the Garda Síochána?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson, in pursuit of her amendment, mentioned one or two points which I would like to refer to briefly.  The Senator talked about what she described as the &ldquo;middle ground&rdquo;. I think I addressed myself, in my original reply to her moving of the amendment, to the middle ground, not the constitutional aspect of it. All I referred to in connection with <Col N="998" /> the constitutional aspect was that I had inquired from the Attorney General whether or not it could be in conflict with the Constitution. I was assured it was not.  What I said was that before I made any inquiries as to the constitutionality of the Bill I inquired and satisfied myself that not only was it desirable but necessary.  It was necessary in order to ensure that the rights of hundreds of people could be protected. There is no blank cheque given, under the provisions of this Bill, to an officer of the Department of Social Welfare to invade anyone's privacy or home.  While Senator Robinson argued that a member of the Garda Síochána, of any rank, should be approached and asked, on the basis of a search warrant, to undertake the operation, under this Bill an officer of the Department who avails of the powers under this provision must justify doing so in open court, not in the Garda station.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I give my assurances, although Senator Robinson, has anticipated them, that it would not be my intention nor the wish of social welfare officers, who are an overworked group of people, to poke into people's business, where they did not have reasonable grounds to suspect a breach of the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>Nobody will undertake an action lightly without reasonable grounds, particularly when he will have to justify that action in open court.  I am sure the Senator will agree with me from reading the reports of some court cases over the years that the members of the Bench are not always favourably disposed towards people who hold official position. Sometimes these officers are open to the utmost scrutiny and questioning from the Bench as to why they availed of a power invested in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, with all the safeguards, which are automatically in our judicial system, I have no hesitation in making this power available to the <Col N="999" /> officers, particularly if it is to combat the kind of operation being practised by some employers, where they are collecting large sums of money from their employees but are not stamping their cards, thus leaving their employees and their dependants in a very vulnerable position if they are made redundant or become ill.  If the choice is between effectively curbing that type of practice and inserting this provision in the Bill which is adequately safeguarded under our judicial system, I have no hesitation in opting for this provision.</P>

      <P>Because the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude is very clear, I do not intend to withdraw this amendment.  It will be pressed. In regard to the safeguards which might appear to be there in a court, the criticism of the section is that an inspector, under the wording of the section, need do no more than say: &ldquo;I reasonably believed that there were documents relating to somebody's employment in that house&rdquo; and the court, looking at the section, must say: &ldquo;Well, in that case, you were exercising your powers under that section&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I would have thought it would have been better to have worded the last line: &ldquo;any other document relating to the employment of persons&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;any other documents relating to persons in employment&rdquo;. The way in which it is worded suggests that the documents need not necessarily relate to a person's employment. I imagine that what is intended is documents related to the employment of persons and that that is the way in which it will be interpreted and operated.  I appreciate that at this stage in the parliamentary year it is unlikely that the Parliamentary Secretary would send it back to have it amended, but if I am correct in my opinion as to what is intended, an opportunity might arise in the future to change the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree completely with Senator O'Higgins that that choice of wording extends still further the scope of the part of the subsection I was trying to limit.  Senator O'Higgins has put his finger on one of the reasons why there will not be any amendments of this or any other section of the Bill.  It takes a great act of faith to move amendments in the Seanad at this time of the year, with the likelihood of the Dáil being reconvened to process these amendments.  Nevertheless, we have a function in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins is correct in saying that the last few words of the section as it stands extend the whole scope of it.  They provide for an inspector from the Department who believes that there are documents relating to any person and so on, and then there is the slight qualification, provided that person is employed somewhere on something.  It is not in relation to the employment of the person but to persons in employment. Therefore, one could end up with a rather absurd conclusion.  If we were in normal parliamentary time, it is the <Col N="1001" /> type of amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary should feel disposed to accept from the Leader of the House and correct it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, it is worded as it is because it could deal with forged stamps which would not necessarily be used in respect of a person in one's employment but in respect of somebody employed by another person.  It could deal with stolen stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely either forged stamps or stolen stamps, if they were to be used, would be used in relation to the employment of persons?  Forged stamps or the stolen stamps would not in my view&mdash;I am simply expressing my own view&mdash;relate to persons whether they are in employment or not, but they would relate to the employment of persons.  That is the whole distinction.  I think the example the Parliamentary Secretary has given would be, as Senator Robinson put it, in normal circumstances an argument for accepting the change which I suggest.</P>
      <P>I am not pressing this in any way, but the Parliamentary Secretary might see the importance of it even more forcibly if I put it in this way. I think it is quite possible that, certainly in large organisations and maybe even in small organisations, confidential information regarding employees would be given by an employee to his employer.  I can visualise, for example, the work of prisoner aid societies where an exprisoner, through the good offices of some of these people, would be placed in employment on the basis that the employer knows all about it.  If in that organisation it is the standard practice to keep confidential records of employees, they would be documents relating to persons in employment but not documents relating to the employment of persons.  To my mind they should not be documents that an inspector or any other person without an interest should have access to.  That is the kind of thing that I have in mind in making this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too happy about having old age pensioners included here.  It states that if they commit an offence they are liable to a very heavy fine.  If you look back through the last few years you will find that there were very few cases&mdash; only about one each year.  There were no cases last year of anybody being prosecuted for such an offence.  I honestly believe that if a person were able to get his old age pension, after all the examination he has to go through to get it&mdash;and if he eventually got it, fair dues to him, even if he had something hidden away&mdash;he should not be subject to such heavy penalties. I am quite certain that if the same scrutiny were given to people applying for unemployment assistance, a lot of them would not qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am on an old age pensions committee and I happen to know it.  First of all, the pension officer goes out and if the person happens to have a small farm or some small industry of any kind, be it a shop or otherwise, the <Col N="1004" /> whole thing is scrutinised.  Even if that person has a nest egg hidden away, eventually it turns up.  Even if it has gone on until a person dies, then his estate becomes known to the Government and the money has to be refunded at that stage.  Frightening old people to the extent that if they make a false declaration they can be liable to this terrible fine of £500 or even have to go to prison, is unfair, to say the least of it.  Old age pensioners should be omitted altogether from this penalty section.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about the very close scrutiny that people applying for old age pensions are subjected to and to the fact that he is a member of an old age pension committee.  It is only fair to remind the Senator that in 1973 if you had 50p per week you would not have qualified for an old age pension.  One can have up to £14 per week now and qualify for an old age pension.</P>

      <P>If the Senator is suggesting that it has gone up proportionately from 50p per week to £14 per week I do not think he will get many people to agree with him.  These penalties are maximum penalties.  The Department would first become aware of an abuse, they would examine the circumstances surrounding that particular abuse.  If they were satisfied&mdash; and they are not that hard to satisfy, particularly in respect of the people the Senator described&mdash;it was not an intentional attempt to defraud the Department, I doubt very much if we would send it forward to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution. Even at that stage the court, naturally, would take into consideration all aspects of the case before they make their decision.  So, there are those safeguards. But it is desirable to have at least uniformity in respect of penalties to be imposed under the social welfare code.  I do not think that there are any grounds for the fears the Senator mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is provision on which I would like some clarification from the Parliamentary Secretary.  Where the presumption is against the defendant who has filled in an application for a particular benefit, which contains a false or wrong statement, it is provided at the end of subsection (2) that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where in a prosecution for an offence under any of the Acts to which this section applies, or under regulations made under or applying the provisions of any of those Acts, it is shown to the satisfaction of the court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that an application has been made by a person (in this section referred to as the defendant) for benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) that as a result of that <Col N="1006" /> application benefit, allowance, pension or assistance under any of the Acts to which this section applies has been paid to any person (whether or not such benefit, allowance, pension or assistance was that applied for and whether or not it was paid to the defendant),</P>
    <P>the defendant shall be presumed to have given any information contained in the application (or to have caused it to be given on his behalf) and, where such information is false, with full knowledge of such falsity and with intent that it should deceive; but this presumption may be rebutted.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask why this subsection is being introduced which obviously reverses the normal balance where a prosecution is brought against a defendant.  To some extent I can understand it but it seems to me to be rather strongly worded.  There is a presumption of the falsity, presumption of full knowledge of that and presumption of intent to deceive. Does this provision tend to put at a serious disadvantage somebody filling in a complicated form, who may not have intended to seriously mislead, and who would have difficulty in rebutting that presumption?  I know it is difficult to prove that, any more than there is, to some extent, a factual presumption that false particulars were given intentionally.  I have seen other ways of approaching this; where it is a good defence to the defendant to establish that he did do this knowingly, let us put it that way.  I have not seen that strength of presumption before against the defendant&mdash;a presumption that he knew it was false presumption when it was done with such knowledge of its falsity and with intention that it should deceive, with the burden on the defendant, who was the applicant for the benefit to reverse that balance.  I would welcome clarification of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a presumption to falsify.  The Department would have to prove that in court.  There are precedents for this section.  I inquired about this section and was told there <Col N="1007" /> are several precedents for it in the Criminal Justice Act, and the Road Traffic Acts.  This provision has been in existence for quite a considerable length of time.  It is extremely difficult to prove conclusively that someone has wilfully given false information. The Department would have the obligation to prove in court that they were given information with the intention to defraud.  The onus would still be on the accuser to prove that in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be the normal situation, but this section seems to take away the normal onus on the prosecution to prove the intent to deceive and to leave a situation where, if the prosecution bring in the form and say: &ldquo;This is not in conformity with the facts&rdquo;, then there is no necessity to prove intention to deceive because the sections says there is a presumption of full knowledge of that falsity and intention to deceive. Therefore the defendant, once that bald evidence has been produced, has then to start reversing the situation and proving positively that there was no intention to deceive.  I can certainly see the difficulty, but this section goes about as far as I have seen a provision go to create a presumption which aids the prosecution in trying to prove a particular offence.  It aids the prosecution by presuming that it was done with full knowledge of falsity and further with intent to deceive. At the same time, I understand that there is difficulty sometimes in proving intent to deceive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had just commenced to reply to the debate when we adjourned last evening. I was thanking Senators for the welcome which they extended to this important piece of family law.  Senator Eoin Ryan, for the Opposition, welcomed it and made the point, which seems a valid point that by and large the matters that might concern Senators can properly be raised during the Committee Stage and said that the principle enshrined in the Bill is one that is acceptable to his side of the House.  He expressed a worry that there might be room for evasion of the Bill by husbands trying to avoid their responsibilities, but I think the Bill as drafted will render that impossible in practical terms, because the Bill provides a very simple remedy for the particular thing that we want to cure.  It says simply that a husband cannot sell the family home without his wife's consent endorsed on the deed of conveyance.  It is a simple procedure and at this stage I cannot see how there would be any room for evasion.  If there is room for evasion there would have to be collusion and if there is no collusion there cannot be evasion.  Certain sanctions will attach themselves to a husband and to anybody in collusion with him. However, should any loopholes manifest themselves when the Bill is in operation, they will be closed promptly by any amending legislation that may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson welcomed the Bill and described it as a very important piece of legislation in the field of the family.  I agree with her.  She <Col N="1009" /> thought that it would lift the status of the wife within the family and that at the moment the legal position of a wife is not as full as it should be in our society.  The legal position in terms of the legal trappings attaching to the wifely state may be as she described but I would submit to the House that the status of a marriage and the status of the partners <i>vis-á-vis</i> each other do not depend on an Act of Parliament.  It cannot depend on legal trappings.  They arise naturally from the very nature of matrimony itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  If a marriage is a true marriage in the full meaning of that word, it does not matter to a wife whether this Bill is passed or not, because the husband if it is a proper marriage, will not sell the house without his wife's consent, and if she refuses to give her consent after they have had a full debate between them, the sale will not go through, provided it is a normal marriage, as the vast bulk of marriages are.  If the marriage is unsatisfactory, the need for this Bill arises, and that is why we are bringing in this Bill, because we recognise that there are some marriages, but a minority of marriages where the relationship is not the full matrimonial relationship between the parties.  Senator Robinson said that there is an over-large cultural and economic dependence on the part of wives in Ireland.  Again I would take issue with her in that context.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of cultural or economic dependence where there is a proper marriage.  It does not arise because it is of the very nature of matrimony that there is a dependence on each other.  There is no question of one person being subservient, or of having a lesser status <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other partner if it is a proper marriage.  What we are legislating <Col N="1010" /> for here are marriages that are less than full marriages, where there is less than the full matrimonial relationship between the parties, where a spouse is not appreciative of his responsibilities and duties.  In such a situation the law has to intervene.  It is for that type of marriage that this Bill is being introduced.  The Bill or any piece of law will not and cannot make what is an improper marriage or a less than full marriage, a full marriage.  If the proper matrimonial relationship and bond are not present, no Act of Parliament can provide it. No Act of Parliament can provide a cultural independence or economic independence which is not already there, arising naturally out of the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Marriage is not an isolation from society.  The Minister is creating an impression of just two people having an idealistic time together. They are completely conditioned by their society.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking about a healthy marriage. This legislation is really not relevant there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the partners <i>vis-a-vis</i> each other, their dignity in themselves, and their relationship towards each other and their status as between themselves and their family will not in a normal marriage rely on an Act of Parliament.  If it is not there by virtue of the matrimonial bond, no Act of Parliament will provide it.  In essence what we are talking about when we are talking about law in this area is law to deal with the minority of marriages that are less than full marriages and I concede that this legislation is, unfortunately, needed to deal with that type of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the exception to the general rule, where there is not the full matrimonial relationship, where a husband does not consult his wife about the affairs, legal, financial and cultural and so on, that concern them and their family, and where the status between them is not full and free, there is need to protect wives. Again we are talking about wives <Col N="1011" /> being in the weaker position.  When we consider injustice in the marriage, it is the wife who suffers more often than the husband.  This Bill is to cure what has been a scandal&mdash;the occasional sale by a husband of the family home over the heads of his wife and children.  It serves a social need but will not make any difference to the vast majority of marriages, nor will it raise the status of a wife, as she already has that status by virtue of the marriage bond.</P>
    <P>At the moment I am not convinced that compulsory joint ownership is the answer.  I would like to hear further views in other places at other times on that question.  Perhaps the Law Reform Commission may consider this in due course if they are charged to do so by the Attorney General who sets up the programme in consultation with the Government.  It is not correct, to say that that body have not commenced operations as was, perhaps, suggested by Senator Robinson because they are seized with the problem of domicile.  They have advertised for submissions from the public on that question.  They are also considering the reduction of the age of majority and on that too have asked for submissions from interested members of the public, which will include Members of this House, whose views on these subjects will certainly be welcomed by the Law Reform Commission in coming to their conclusions on those subjects.  There is no doubt that the question of compulsory joint ownership would appear to be a possible subject for them to deal with and it may be possible to have it included in their programme.  Again it will be a question of priority as to what is the more urgent business.  I think this Bill will probably reduce the question of compulsory co-ownership to a lower place in the queue of priorities, because the evil that the Bill sets out to remedy, and the evil which co-ownership would also be directed against, that is, the evil of the vindictive sale, is covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, compulsory co-ownership is something that might not suit all wives. <Col N="1012" /> One could envisage a situation where the house might be bought, for example, by the wife.  She might not be a bit keen on having a situation where there was compulsory co-ownership. One could envisage a situation where perhaps due to the wife having separate means, perhaps her &ldquo;fortune&rdquo;, if I may use such an old-fashioned term in the context of this Bill, she applies it towards buying a family home.  If, after a number of years of marriage, it turned out that the husband was improvident or was showing improvident tendencies, she might wish the family home to be in her sole name.  If we were to have compulsory co-ownership she would not have any choice in such a situation.  I mention that as an indication of some of the difficulties that could follow from compulsory co-ownership.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson took the point why is there no constitutional impediment in the Succession Act where we say there might be a constitutional impediment to compulsory co-ownership. There is a distinction there: compulsory co-ownership would, in effect, be taking the property from one spouse and putting it in the joint names of the spouses.  It would be reducing the property in the hands of one spouse by giving it into the hands of both spouses. It would be reducing the quantum of ownership.  The Succession Act does not take property from a party; it merely restricts the right to dispose of property.  That is the distinction to be made between the two situations.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson said that the impact of this Bill would be diminished because legal aid is not available.  That may be but I do not think that will be so in practice.  I cannot see any situation arising under this Bill or under any of the family law reform measures which we have passed where a wife would be deprived of her rights by the absence of legal aid.  The onus on taking proceedings under this Bill by and large rests on the husband.  If he wants to sell the house he has to apply to the court for consent if consent is withheld.  In the case where a wife wants to intervene in relation to a disposition of chattels or where there is some interference by the husband with <Col N="1013" /> the home, she will have to get a solicitor. It would be easier for her to get a solicitor obviously if there was free legal aid but it would be unreal to suggest, in the context of our society, that a wife would not be able to get a solicitor in the case of an emergency such as that.  I do not think there would be any difficulty in her obtaining the services of a solicitor.  If we get down to the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Ireland extends beyond the boundaries of Dublin.  I can say quite firmly that in any country town any solicitor in practice there would take any such case without asking the woman coming into his office to show him the colour of her money. I say that quite firmly and unequivocally. I am sure it is the same in Dublin.  I have no doubt about it. Again, lest anyone might feel that he had to depend on lawyers' charity, it would be desirable if we had legal aid. The fact that the distinguished Chairman of that Committee has other duties should not be taken as the reason why the Committee have not yet reported.  This is a complex subject and one that has led to great difficulties of administration and of expense in the jurisdictions where it has been introduced.  Even if that Committee were to report in the morning I cannot guarantee that their report would be implemented.  It would depend on the constraints on the Exchequer at the particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised other points on various sections which I will leave until we deal with the sections in question.  She asked whether it would be possible to have compulsory notice of marriage in the registry. <Col N="1014" /> I do not know that this would be feasible in practical terms.  How would you enforce the obligation to notify the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds that a marriage had taken place?  What sanction would you apply for failure to give notice?  Again, what point would there be in giving notice if at the time of the marriage the parties did not have any property and did not acquire the family home until afterwards?</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan's problem of a husband keeping his family from occupation&mdash;was that the example the Senator gave?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of barring his family from occupation.  That could be solved by the provisions in the Maintenance Act where the District Court has power to keep the husband out from the family home.  If the husband is so misbehaving himself as to threaten the safety or welfare of his wife and family, they are entitled to go to the District Court and have an order keeping him out of the family home. Rather than a husband barring a wife, she has power now to bar an unworthy husband from interfering with the amenities of the family home.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised on the Second Stage debate.  I will conclude by thanking Senators for their welcome for this Bill which I consider to be an important foothold on the road towards family law reform.  It will end simply and conclusively the scandal of vindictive sales.  These scandals arise only in the minority of marriages.  The vast majority of marriages depend for their security not on any Act of Parliament but on the nature of matrimony itself.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept one brief quotation from the Commission on the Status of Women on that precise point?  It is not true to say that the marriage just depends on the marriage going well between the two individuals.  A marriage is conditioned by the cultural ethos of the society, by the conditioning factors in that society.  That is why I <Col N="1015" /> believe this Bill is much broader than just meeting a particular, rather narrow case of vindictive sale.  The quotation which I suggest meets the point is on page 12, chapter 2 of the Commission on the Status of Women on underlying factors which limit women's participation even in the absence of formal discrimination.  The quotation goes on:</P>
      <P>However, the removal of these actual discriminations leaves untouched a larger and more subtle area of discrimination consisting of those factors which limit women's participation even in the absence of formal discrimination, that is the stereo typed role that is assigned to women, the inculcation of attitudes in both boys and girls in their formative years that there are definite and separate roles for the sexes and that a woman's life pattern would be predominantly home-centered while the man's life pattern will be predominantly centred on employment.  It is from this type of cultural mould that formal discrimination arises and it is only by the removal of such traditional attitudes that women can hope to achieve complete self-fulfilment and equal participation in all the aspects of the life of a community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify the precise scope of &ldquo;dependent child of the family&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill?  The definition of dependent child of the family is quoted as:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;dependent child of the family,&rdquo; in relation to a spouse or spouses, means any child&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  of both spouses, or adopted by both spouses under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, or in relation to whom both spouses are <i>in loco parentis</i>, or</P>
      <P>(b)  of either spouse, or adopted by either spouse under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, or in relation to whom either spouse is <i>in loco parentis</i>, where the other spouse, being aware that he is not the parent of the child, has treated the child as a member of the family.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects of that on which I would welcome clarification. First of all, &ldquo;if being a child of either spouse&rdquo; would presumably include children born out of wedlock to either spouse prior to marriage. Secondly, the question of an explicit reference to Adoption Acts in this way arises.  Why is it necessary to say that a dependent child of the family includes a child under the Adoption Acts?

There could be a situation where, for example, a husband had two homes in one of which the family were normally living.  We will assume that relationships deteriorated and his wife and children on account of the husband's misconduct, departed to the second residence.  For the purposes of this Bill, if there were an attempt to sell it, the second residence would then be regarded as the family home.  It would depend on the construction of the facts in a particular case coming before the court.  There could conceivably be two family homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (6), page 3, line 45, after the word &ldquo;who&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;having made all proper inquiry,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of a doubt which I had, and which I expressed on Second Stage, as to whether there is a sufficient safeguard so that a purchaser of the property from a spouse, where there has not been the consent in writing of the other spouse, will not be entitled just by asking no questions to be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value. The purpose of the amendment is to insert into subsection (6) an additional clause explaining what is meant by a purchaser in those circumstances. Subsection (6) provides that &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; means a grantee, leasee, assignee, mortgagee, chargeant or other persons who in good faith acquires an estate or interest in property.  The amendment would insert before the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; the words &ldquo;who having made all proper inquiry&rdquo; in good faith <Col N="1018" /> acquires an estate or interest in the property.</P>
    <P>The reason behind this amendment is that it is possible somebody would be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser of property which he did not know was a family home as defined by section 2.  That person could acquire that property for full value and then in a court assert he was <i>bona fide</i> and that he had no reason to suspect that the vendor selling the property was married and did not feel any reasonable necessity to make any inquiry.  Nothing in the relationship between them gave rise to any reason to make any inquiry. The purpose of the amendment is, by inserting the words &ldquo;after having made all proper inquiry&rdquo; the onus is on anybody who claims to be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value to say that he made inquiry and was either misled or defrauded in the sense that false information was given that there was no spouse whose consent was required or a forged consent of the wife or some other document.  It is necessary to include expressly a requirement that nobody can claim to be a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value unless he has made full inquiry in the circumstance and, as a result of having put in a specific requisition, he was then led to believe that the consent in writing either did not arise or was forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in this amendment because in the last few days I had in the course of my practice to advise on this particular phrase that Senator Robinson is imparting into this amendment.  I felt that it was quite unworkable, not necessarily in relation to legislation but in relation to the particular query that was put to me.  I would feel the same way in relation to the use of the phrase &ldquo;in legislation&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the section, as it stands, is quite clearcut.  Either a purchaser purchases in good faith or he does not and it is a matter for the court, if it comes before the court, to determine and, in determining that, the court no doubt would take into account what steps the purchaser had taken to ascertain whether the property was free from encumbrances regarding this Act, if you like, as an encumbrance, <Col N="1019" /> or what representations were made to the purchaser.</P>
      <P>He either purchases in good faith or he does not whereas, if these words are imported into the section, it opens up all sorts of avenues which could, instead of clarifying the position either from the purchaser's or the landlord's point of view, cause any amount of confusion.  It puts the onus on the purchaser first to decide what are and what are not proper inquiries. Secondly, it imposes the virtually impossible task on a purchaser of making all proper inquiries.  He may make 99 inquiries which he regards as proper and fail to make the hundredth inquiry and his purchase is then vitiated on that account because someone sitting on the bench holds that one inquiry that should have been made was not made.  It would be quite impossible to operate this section if these words were imported into it.  It would be much more workable and reasonable from everybody's point of view, including the point of the wife who might be affected by it if it were left on the basis of good faith, left to the court to determine, in all the circumstances of the transaction, whether or not good faith existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter is covered by section 3 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882, which provides for the making of necessary inquiries and inspections by a purchaser.  A purchaser in good faith would be bound by the provisions of section 3.  This section in the Conveyancing Act is being applied by section 3 of the Bill, subject to the amendment specified at subsection (7) to the effect that the knowledge of a solicitor or counsel who has himself notice of something, though not as solicitor or counsel, will bind the purchaser.  The law relating to notice is clearly set out in Mr. John Wiley's recent book <i>Irish Land Law.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the 1882 Act says that &ldquo;a purchaser shall not be prejudicially affected by notice of any fact or thing unless (a) it is in his own knowledge or (b) would have come to his knowledge if such inquiries and <Col N="1020" /> inspections had been made as ought reasonably to have been made by him&rdquo;.  In other words, if a person fails to make the inspections and inquiries that ought reasonably to have been made by him, he shall be prejudicially affected.  There is an ordinary conveyancing onus on a purchaser to issue a prudent requisition and he may want it supported by a statutory declaration.  Section 3 of the 1882 Act, which applies to all conveyancing, applies in this case and it puts an onus on a purchaser to make all reasonable inquiries and inspections. The law which the Senator seeks to achieve by this amendment already exists so as to achieve the object of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation of the position.  I had been worried on the Second Stage that a purchaser by not raising the issue, by staying quiet, by not being told that the person was married or by not realising that it was a family home in question, could in fact become a purchaser for value despite the absence of consent in writing by the spouse as provided in section 3.  If I understood the Minister correctly, a person cannot claim to be a person in good faith acquiring an interest in property unless he has actively made reasonable inquiries. That was the purpose which the amendment sought to achieve.  In the circumstances, I would ask leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give some sort of indication of the type of agreement he has in mind in section 3 (2) which reads:</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) does not apply to any conveyance made in pursuance of an enforceable agreement made before the marriage of the spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad of an example of the kind of agreement the Minister has in mind here.  I wonder whether an agreement made in consideration of <Col N="1021" /> marriage would be caught under this subsection; in other words, an agreement of which the marriage itself in some sense is a component part. Some marriage settlements might be made in this fashion, particularly in rural areas.  I wonder if the giving of some sort of interest in a house to a spouse by reason of a marriage settlement would be caught under this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection provides that the sale of a house which was agreed to in an enforceable contract made before marriage can go ahead without the wife's consent.  If there is an enforceable agreement made prior to marriage for the sale of a dwelling and that dwelling after the marriage becomes the family home, the consent of the other spouse is not necessary for that sale.  I could not conceive that, in a marriage settlement, in the type of contract mentioned in consideration of marriage, that it would provide for the giving of a home to the married couple and, at the same time, have a clause in it providing for the sale of the house.  I do not think that would be likely to arise.</P>
      <P>What the section is designed to deal with is the situation where before marriage the fiancé had contracted to sell his house in expectation of later on buying another house for himself and his wife and after marriage the sale has not been completed for some reason.  After they are married, the couple move into the house which he had contracted to sell and it then becomes the family home. If we did not have this subsection the man's fiancé, now his wife, might say: &ldquo;I prefer this house to the one you are going to buy for me; I will not let you sell it now, notwithstanding the fact that before we got married you had agreed to sell it&rdquo;.  It would be that sort of situation that would be covered by that subsection.</P>

      <P>This is obviously a very important section because it is the section which will allow a spouse &mdash;we would use the term &ldquo;husband&rdquo; as being the normal spouse&mdash;to make application to the court to dispense with consent where it has been omitted or refused by the other spouse, by the wife.  There are a few questions which I should like to ask on this.  First, I should like some clarification of subsection (3).  After much effort I have begun to understand it but it is a very complex provision and I would welcome some clarification on it.  It provides:</P>
      <P>Where the spouse whose consent is required under section 3 (1) has deserted and continues to desert the other spouse, the court shall dispense with the consent.  For this purpose, desertion includes conduct on the part of the former spouse that results in the other spouse, with just cause, leaving and living separately and apart from him.</P>
      <P>I think I am beginning to understand it but I would welcome some clarification.</P>
      <P>On this section, and indeed a similar observation applies to several other sections we are dealing with, it seems to me that the type of procedure and inquiry and the type of consideration by the court is not going to be easy for the sort of common law courts, the kind of adversary proceedings we have.  I am aware that the court in question will be either the High Court or Circuit Court, depending on the circumstances.  They have concurrent jurisdiction in this area.  I am also aware that this type of case will be held <i>in camera</i> in these courts. Increasingly in these sorts of provisions for reform of our family law we are introducing sections of Acts giving very unusual and broad powers to our courts which do not lend themselves to the narrow type of adversary proceedings that we have.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The court shall not dispense with the consent of a spouse unless the court considers that it is unreasonable for the spouse to withhold consent, taking into account all the circumstances, including&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> (a)  the respective needs and resources of the spouses and of the dependent children (if any) of the family, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in a case where the spouse whose consent is required is offered alternative accommodation, the suitability of that accommodation having regard to the respective degrees of security of tenure in the family home and in the alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>In what way in adversary proceedings is the court going to have the resources to examine the needs and resources of the spouses and dependent children? Obviously this is to be through the mouthpiece of the applicant or defendant in the particular proceedings. The husband will be trying to establish that there is adequate alternative provision for the spouse and dependent children and the wife who is refusing her consent will say it is not adequate.</P>
    <P>In these sort of adversary proceedings how can the court genuinely and effectively assess the overall family position and that of the dependent children?  This is a problem even now in relation to proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  Far too often it is an adversary proceeding between adults and the court does not at any stage go into the particular needs and welfare of the children. Because of the narrow and inhibiting form of proceedings as they are, and all the difficulties of trying to exercise the very significant discretion of the court in relation to the family circumstances, the court is handicapped by not having itself a power of inquiry into the whole situation.  It is largely dependent on what comes up in adversary proceedings and what is introduced by the parties to the case. Therefore, this section, and other sections even more so, would make it increasingly necessary for us to move towards a family court system which would allow for the full consideration of all the factors so that there will be genuine equity and justice in the types of remedies we are providing for.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister, both in this House and in other forums, has <Col N="1024" /> expressed no enthusiasm at all for the concept of a family court.  He says that people who argue for it never clarify what they think about it.  That is not so.  There are examples in other jurisdictions and working models which we could and should examine. We are strengthening the necessity all the time for the introduction of family courts by the sort of remedies provided in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, by this Bill, which will shortly become law, and by any legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to have a section which, on paper, appears to allow the court genuinely to exercise an overall discretion and concern for the respective needs and resources of the spouses and the dependent children and then lets the mechanism, by which this is done, be common law adversary proceedings, which are suitable to actions in tort and actions in contract which are not suitable to this type of application in the heart of a family situation&mdash;a question of selling or not selling a family home.  I do not think the proceedings, the atmosphere and the way in which evidence is presented or the inadequate resources of the court are satisfactory to determine what we ask of the High Court or the Circuit Court to determine in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a debate on what is still a nebulous concept of the family court.  As to what it should be within this jurisdiction, nobody has yet defined or specified.  It is not that I am unenthusiastic about the idea but I would prefer to keep an open mind on the matter until the advocates of it spell out what precisely they mean by family courts.,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing here with a situation where there has been a breakdown in relationships and where parties are in dispute.  In any situations of disputation a certain amount of adversary proceedings are inseparate from them. I cannot see how, even in a family court, assuming that the vague idea means something, a situation where the parties are in an adversary position <Col N="1025" /> can be avoided.  Two points of view have been put forward and surely each party is entitled to cross-examine the other party to assess the accuracy and validity of its point of view. Therefore, the adversary situation is inherent in any situation of disputation. No particular type of form of proceedings will remove it.</P>
    <P>The adversary system has been devised over many years and has been designed to get out of the dispute the true facts so that the court can make a proper assessment of them.  I do not think that any injustice will be done or anything will be left unsaid or unanswered in our courts by reason of these proceedings being taken under our present system.</P>
    <P>On the question of constructive desertion, suppose a wife owns the family home and her husband behaves in such a manner as to force her to leave then the desertion is his.  The wife having left the family home wishes to sell it.  She should be allowed to sell it despite the husband's presence in it.  That is one example.  On the other hand, if a wife, by her conduct, forces the husband out of the home and he wishes to sell it over her head, the fact that she is present should not be allowed interfere with the sale.  There may be other reasons for this.  The phrasing at first sight may appear awkward but the subsection is so phrased to deal with such situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification of the meaning of desertion in subsection (3).  I take fundamental issue with him in relation to how satisfactory the present court system is for this type of family proceedings.  Of course here would be an adversary element in a situation like this but a family court would be equipped to give a proper assessment of what is best for that family in the circumstances, including taking genuine account of the respective needs and resources of the spouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that the court, at present, in adversary proceedings can take into account is what comes up in evidence offered by either side.  If both sides are legally represented then legal presentation is made.  If not then the <Col N="1026" /> individual is trying to conform to very highly technical court rules of procedure in order to state the case.  We all have experience of being present in court when the individual is frustrated by being told he cannot introduce that now or state something, he cannot make a point at this stage and so on.</P>
    <P>The court itself is not equipped. Our judges are not, in my view equipped on the basis of adversary proceeding to deal as adequately as they should like with the particular types of procedure, the jurisdiction, we are conferring on them.  The judge would not have the benefit of the sort of expertise which our society could provide in these circumstances or have the expert, lay assistance, such as medical or psychological assistance, whatever may be considered appropriate guidance to the judge in the particular circumstances.  I do not say that a family court rules out any adversary proceedings, I say it is the appropriate approach to this type&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think it is relevant on this section as it is relevant on other sections to point to the increasing divergence between the types of jurisdiction which we are conferring in sections like this on our courts and the absence of any parallel court structure to avail fully of this jurisdiction and genuinely to exercise the sort of jurisdiction which we want it to exercise.  It is a very serious criticism, for example, of the Guardianship of Infants Act procedures, that they arise in the adversary context, in the narrow procedural environment of an adversary court.  Very often, although they are supposed to be related to the custody and needs of the child, the child is hardly mentioned.  It is a fight between two adults and it is very adversary but one would question whether it is achieving the guiding principle of the Guardianship of Infants Act, in which the welfare of the child is the predominant consideration. Similarly, I am asking on the section, I think it is relevant to it, <Col N="1027" /> whether the Minister is satisfied that either a High Court or a Circuit Court at present, even sitting <i>in camera</i> with the sort of adversary proceeding we have, is competent to take into account all the circumstances of that particular situation, including the respective needs and resources of the spouses and of the dependent children, if any, of the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section appears to be an interesting one and which relates very strongly to the&mdash;it was not a hypothetical problem&mdash;natural problem which I raised with the Minister in the course of the Second Stage debate.  The case I raised with him was that which seems to be mentioned in this section, whereby one spouse, through his activity, has deprived an applicant spouse of residence in the family home.  I notice under this section that when this is about to happen or even after it has happened, the court is being given fairly wide powers, either to direct payment by the spouse who is at fault to the other spouse or to make such other order, directed to the other spouse or to any person, as may appear to the court to be just and equitable.  These are very wide, blanket provisions.  In the interests of equity, they seem to be quite admirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, it seems to be important to make it absolutely clear what the effect of these provisions will be.  I want to ask the Minister if they represent, to some extent, an extension of the powers given to courts in the Maintenance Act that he was speaking about earlier.  Do they merely replicate them or what?  One of the things in this Bill is that the courts largely concerned are not, so far as I am aware, the District Courts.  They are mostly High Court actions which, of course, are much more expensive for an applicant <Col N="1028" /> spouse, or could be so.  Could the Minister clarify this point for me?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These provisions do extend the powers that are given to the court by the Maintenance Act. There could be a situation where a spouse is behaving himself in such a way, short of being violent or threatening to his family, where perhaps he was negotiating with purchasers or he was failing to maintain the house or taking moves to render it uninhabitable. There are various ways in which a cunning spouse could render the house less comfortable or unsuitable as a habitation, ways in which he was behaving short of the violence that is anticipated in the Maintenance Act. It is to deal with that sort of situation that this section is drafted.  It is drafted in wide terms and it does give the court very wide powers.  These powers are necessary.  There is no point in confining the protection to the stage when the house comes for sale.  It could be that if we had not this power to take proceedings at an early stage the place might have been rendered so uninhabitable, so uncomfortable, so impossible to live in that a wife would have no alternative but to give her consent at that stage. This section provides an earlier remedy for a wife where her husband is misbehaving himself by trying to devise or force a situation where a wife has no alternative but to give her consent.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the provisions of section 5 (2) will be retrospective and, if so, whether there is any time limit for bringing these proceedings? Subsection (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the court, on the application of a spouse, that the other spouse has deprived the applicant spouse or a dependent child of the family of his residence in the family home by conduct that resulted in the loss of any interest therein or rendered it unsuitable for habitation as a family home, the court may order the other spouse or any other person to pay to the applicant spouse such amount as the court considers proper to compensate the applicant spouse and any such child for their loss or make such other order directed to the other spouse or to any other persons as may appear to the court to be just and equitable.</P>
      <P>It seems that, as that section stands, any wife under present Irish law who has had the family home sold over her head would have a cause of action, that she could go in and get compensation for the loss from the court, or any other order for her or for the children of the family as the court thinks just and equitable.  It is my understanding that there are a considerable number of women in Ireland at present who would claim that they have been treated in this way, that the family home has been sold over their heads, so I think it would be important to have clarification of the scope of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>If in the month of June a house had been sold and the woman goes in a week after this Act is in force, can the court not take into <Col N="1030" /> account the circumstances during that month of June, or is that a total cutoff from any rights she might have under section 5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the facts of a particular case.  If the action that is depriving her of her rights is continuing, if it commences before the date it is passed and continues after the passing of the Act it will be a matter for the court then to assess the conduct that took place subsequent to the passing of the Act to see if it gives rise to right of action under this section.  It will depend on the facts of each individual case.  I would imagine that the court, in order to protect a wife, if there is any action subsequent to the passing of the Act, would probably lean in favour of the wife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  I would just like to make the point that the scope and the element of discretion contained in this section reinforced the argument I was making in relation to the previous section, that our courts in my view are not equipped to discharge in any meaningful way the sort of functions which we are giving them jurisdiction to discharge.  The court is not going to be able to get sufficient evidence to exercise meaningfully the sort of jurisdiction that has been conferred on it.  Later on I should like to have much more clarification on the sort of proceedings we are envisaging.  It is provided that they be summary proceedings. What sort of application, what sort of evidence of conduct, what sort of hearing is going to take place?  Is it going to be confined to what is in the grounding affidavit of a summary proceeding or is there going to be a general inquiry once the application has been made, which would give the court sufficient background material about the conduct of the other spouse, about the suitability for habitation of the house, about the relative disadvantage that the applicant spouse claims she is in because of activity? I find it very difficult to see how the court will cope with this.  What happens if the court has to try to assess <Col N="1031" /> what sort of order to make in relation to compensation or what sort of other order as may be just and equitable? How is the court to be sure that it will have sufficient knowledge on which to make that sort of assessment? I do not claim to have a very long and detailed practice in the area of family law but nothing that I know of the present procedures of the courts in this area leads me to believe that they will be comfortable in the exercise of the sort of jurisdiction we are conferring on them in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurred to me on reflection that there is a very slight difference of emphasis between myself and the Minister in our interpretation of the section which could be relevant when it comes to applying it to the courts later on.  My reading of the section is that it is a section which can be applied by a court in widely differing circumstances.  It can obviously be applied within the context of this general Act if the question of a sale or threatened sale is involved. The two sections are so widely drafted as to include the possibility of action by the court, even in cases where the conduct by the offending spouse does not actually involve or provide for the possibility of the sale of the house.  I would be glad if the Minister would confirm if this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Things do not have to go that far before that section comes into play.  For example, an improvident husband who is going to get a second mortgage on the house to look after his gambling debts, some conduct such as that, would bring the section into play and would enable the wife to go to court to seek relief. If I may refer to Senator Robinson's remarks regarding the capacity of our courts.  I am quite satisfied to rely on the experience and common sense of our judges to deal with the problems that come before them in administering this Bill.  There is no doubt that that experience and common sense will enable them to give full and proper consideration to all matters that come before them.  I cannot see anything so difficult and so subtle or so technical as to defy proper judgment <Col N="1032" /> by our courts.  I cannot see a situation where courts would not be able to get whatever evidence they would want.  It is for the parties to produce the evidence for the courts and if the courts feel that there is a lack of evidence they have every right&mdash;indeed they have more than a right; it amounts to an obligation&mdash; to seek it, and in my experience they would not be slow in seeking the information or further evidence that they would want.</P>
      <P>The procedure would involve an application to the courts, making the allegation that the conduct is such as to justify action under these sections. Then it will be for the parties to adduce the evidence to support their application.  The Rules of Court may prescribe how these applications are to be made.  These are necessary, but they will not be restrictive rules of court.  There is no question of technical rules being drawn up so that the party must set out in a preliminary affidavit every fact on which he or she relies.  That would be wrong and that certainly is not the intention.</P>
      <P>Again, the courts will have discretion to go beyond any documents that may be brought to them.  If these documents indicate that further evidence is needed it will be for the courts to seek further evidence and it will be for the parties to give to the courts the evidence the parties feel the courts should have.  So, between the courts and the parties before them, I have no doubt the full facts will be exposed and a competent judgement made on the full facts.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister for clarification on another aspect?  If the court makes an order under subsection (1) directed to the other spouse or to any other person, for the protection of the family home in the interest of the applicant spouse or child, or under subsection (2) for compensation because the family home has been sold or the interest in it some way diminished, if the defendant spouse fails to do that, is that defedant spouse in a position of contempt of an order of the court? Is that the remedy for it or what is <Col N="1033" /> the particular enforcement procedure under section 5?</P>

It states that nothing in subsection (1) shall affect any claim by the first-mentioned spouse against the other to an interest in the family home by virtue of such payment or things made or done by the first mentioned spouse.  Is this a reference to the possibility of equitable claims to having made payment for outgoings on the family home or does it refer to the provisions of the Maintenance Act?

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general <Col N="1034" /> point of clarification on these sections that refer to the imposition where a mortgagee wants to close on the mortgage on the family home and, therefore, he has to accept now payments by the spouse as being equivalent to payments by the mortgagor and the proceedings can be adjourned. In the debate on this in the other House there was some suggestion that this might inhibit mortgagees from creating mortgages over family homes and I should welcome some indication from the Minister of the extent to which it is envisaged that there might be problems if the mortgagees think that their legal rights are being diminished by having to accept adjournment of proceedings and then payment ultimately by a spouse, and so forth.  I am in favour of the provisions but I should welcome the Minister's clarification on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made in the debate in the other House was that the Bill as drafted would not inhibit the institutions from lending on the family home but if it went any further there might be such inhibitions. For example, the point was made that there should be joint ownership so that a mortgagee would not be able to realise against the wife's share of the joint home and, of course, no mortgage company would lend on a home unless they had a mortgage on all the interests.  To go any further to prevent a sale because the wife was not able to avail herself of the rights under this section would be to inhibit the lending of money on family homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we go as far as we can in this.  What is in the section is in the interests of lending institutions because they do not want to have to realise their security.  Their main interest is to have their loan repaid. They do not want the difficult and distasteful procedure of having to realise their security and have the mortgage suit and a forced sale.  Far from this particular section inhibiting lending institutions from lending on the family homes, I think it may possibly encourage them.  It certainly does not discourage them, it does not alter the position.  Subsection (2) represents <Col N="1035" /> an amendment introduced in the other House to deal with a point made by one of the women's committees who made representations to me on this question of notice.</P>

      <P>This is a very interesting and rather far-reaching provision restricting the disposal of household chattels.  It is a provision that I welcome because I think it provides a measure of protection to the spouse who needs protection in circumstances, usually the wife and the dependent children of the family. I raised on the Second Stage the possibility that subsection (2) may create some unintentional offences.  It provides that when matrimonial proceedings have been instituted by either spouse, neither spouse shall sell, lease, pledge, charge or otherwise dispose of or remove any of the household chattels in the family home until the proceedings have been finally determined, unless they have otherwise consented or the court on application permits it.  &ldquo;Matrimonial proceedings&rdquo; is defined in subsection (3) as including proceedings under section 12 of the Married Women's Status Act, the Guardianship of Infants Act and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me that it would be quite possible to have either the sale of a particular item or the pledging of it only to maintain a cash flow position and not with any intention of diminishing the household property in a way that would undermine the <Col N="1036" /> spouse.  There might be an argument that it should be in some way knowingly and precisely to undermine the spouse and diminish the contents of the house at a time when matrimonial proceedings had been instituted. There should be that specific intent and not just any pledge or sale of any household furniture, in particular since, under subsection (7) &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; have been defined to include furniture, bedding, linen, china, earthenware, glass, books and other chattels of ordinary household use or ornament.</P>
    <P>This Bill encroaches very considerably on the family situation.  There is good reason for doing so in some very hard cases where it is not unknown for a wife in such a situation to find that the furniture is sold from under her.  I think it is the intention to control that situation.  But it seems to me that the precise wording of the section may lead to unintentional breach of the provisions.  Then there is the penalty provided for under subsection 4, a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.  One might find that where there had been an unintentional breach of this section by the sale or the pawning of an item of household furniture the other spouse might be vindictive enough to insist on a prosecution.  The reality of some of these situations is that there can be a high degree of spite and vindictiveness between the spouses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the probability of that sort of situation we have to have the section, as drafted, because if there was such a degree of vindictiveness present to have the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; in the section would provide a loophole for the vindictive spouse to come along afterwards and say &ldquo;I did not know&rdquo;.  On balance, it is better left in the strict terms in which it is drafted.  If it is a question that cash is needed, that can be arranged by an application to the court, before the determination of the matrimonial proceedings, for permission to sell.  No doubt if a case was made that cash was needed for the well-being of the spouse and children, the court would permit a sale in advance of the determination <Col N="1037" /> of the proceedings.  Likewise, if relations had not broken down completely, the parties could agree to the sale of some of the chattels.  Therefore, I think it is better without the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am intrigued by subsection (7).  I would not be a bit surprised if we heard a great deal more about subsection (7) in the courts after this Bill becomes law.  It is not unknown, especially among the wealthier members of professional classes, for people to buy items normally described as chattels as a form of investment, for example, silver, modern paintings, old paintings and so on which may, indeed, be part of the household chattels in the sense that they are there, they are hanging on the walls or in a glasscase but which may have been bought, to some extent at least, as a hedge against inflation, as an investment. Even though they may have been bought effectively on the income of one of the spouses, the decision to buy and the nature of the purchase may have been a joint decision.  What category does property like this come into?  A spouse might want to sell a Jack Yeats painting that he had bought for £300 ten years ago.  He is now being offered £3,000 for it. Would that be included under the general heading of &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; or could the spouse in question argue that this was something which he had acquired for business purposes, in a sense that he may have been, in his normal line of business, a professional man, an accountant, a doctor, a lawyer or whatever, he was also in a small line of business as somebody who invested in modern paintings and occasionally resold them when they had appreciated substantially?</P>

      <P>The motive in buying the chattel in question would be irrelevant in determining its nature.  If it comes within the definition of the section it would be a household chattel irrespective of its value or irrespective of why it was purchased. The example quoted by the Senator would be clearly covered by the use <Col N="1038" /> of the term &ldquo;ornament&rdquo; in the subsection. The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section &ldquo;household chattels&rdquo; means furniture... and other chattels of ordinary household use or ornament...</P>
      <P>Therefore, it would be a chattel of ornament.  Quite clearly a painting would come within that definition.</P>

      <P>Subsection (6) of this section provides that</P>
      <P>proceedings under or referred to in this Act, in which each spouse is a party (whether by joinder or otherwise) shall be conducted in a summary manner and shall be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
      <P>For proceedings in the High Court and the Circuit Court there is a provision that they be heard in chambers.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear in some detail from the Minister about what he envisages as being in the summary manner provided for and whether this will necessitate amendment of the rules of court or any other procedural difficulties that might arise.  Certainly it involves a range of new forms of application and proceedings before the High Court and Circuit Court which are substantially different from the normal jurisdiction of these courts.  I would welcome some information on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, summary proceedings involve mainly issue of a summons.  There are no documentary pleadings involved in summary proceedings in the way that there would be in certain types of proceedings particularly before the High Court, to a lesser extent, in the Circuit Court and to a much lesser extent still in the District Court.  Therefore, the intention <Col N="1039" /> is that a simple document will get the parties into court and the matter will then be argued between them.  There would have to be rules of court for all the courts to provide for summary proceedings.  What we want to do here is to have a simple procedure to ensure that parties can come into court quickly and without having to face technical difficulties. If one provides for pleadings and a lot of procedural technicalities one will slow up the procedure and cause delay in getting into court.  It is of the essence of family matters that they be resolved speedily.  That is the motive behind the subsection in question in providing for summary proceedings. Of course there will have to be rules to deal with them but they will be also as simple and as uncomplicated as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister said, I have two further questions.  First of all, will it be a summary summons and an affidavit equivalent to the procedures under the Guardianship of Infants Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that because that would be a matter for the rules committee, the appropriate committee for the appropriate courts.  I do not know quite what form of procedures the committees will devise.  It will be a matter for them and it will be remitted to them to draft the necessary rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question of fact that the various remedies under the Act will require new rules of court in order to be effective, will this be a delay in the actual operation of the Bill?  I note that there is no date as to when it comes into operation. Is there a possibility of delay while the rules of court committees get down to drafting the necessary rules of court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we do not anticipate any delay.  In this connection, I might mention the action of the District Court and other rules committees, particularly the District Court Rules Committee, in drafting a very thorough set of rules and forms <Col N="1040" /> for the Maintenance Act.  They were ready as soon as the Act was ready and I anticipate the same with regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, and again it relates to the question of proceedings being in a summary manner, I should like to get back to the question of cost of proceedings.  When one uses the term, &ldquo;in a summary manner&rdquo;, the intention obviously, and the Minister has made this clear, is that parties can get into court easily on a summons grounding affidavit.  The implication is that these are not very costly proceedings.  Therefore, the absence of a system of legal aid or whatever does not really cause any great hardship because they are summary proceedings. It might be of interest to know that it appears now that under the Guardianship of Infants Act a simple summary proceeding for custody and maintenance of children, where one spouse applies under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, the estimated costs of application would be in the region of £1,200 to £1,500. Usually, it would be the husband who would end up paying these costs because it is now, apparently, relatively normal to have senior counsel and junior counsel involved.  There is something strange if the most summary and, by implication, therefore, the most accessible and cheap remedy we can offer in these family law situations is probably going to cost the losing party in the circumstances something like £1,500.  This money will come out of the overall assets of that family.  Whatever order has been made for custody and maintenance the family will be at a loss to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may try to come back and say, &ldquo;There you are; if you are talking about a system of free legal aid and advice, look what that system might cost in the situation&rdquo;.  That is a different sort of situation.  We could meet that problem by examining where the very high cost in these proceedings comes.  However, if we are providing for various types of application under various sections of this Bill in a summary manner to the High <Col N="1041" /> Court&mdash;obviously, the cost would be less in an application to the Circuit Court&mdash;under this section if the rateable value of the land exceeds £100 or if the value of the personal property to which the proceedings relate exceeds £5,000 then a defendant can insist on it being transferred to the High Court.  It is possible that the High Court will exercise a considerable jurisdiction in practice under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter on which I would like to hear the views of the Minister.  Although we appear to be providing for summary proceedings and the intention is that parties can get into court easily, the costs that those parties face are quite prohibitive. The intention is that a spouse or dependent children who are being protected will get justice but, in fact, what may happen is that after a High Court proceeding the family cake has been diminished by legal costs and whatever order the court may make may become just that more difficult to enforce because of the bill for legal costs at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The example which Senator Robinson has given and which, unfortunately, may mislead a lot of people, is not relevant to this Bill.  She said that we appear to be providing in the Bill for summary proceedings.  We are positively providing for summary proceedings under this Bill.  In contrast, the Guardianship of Infants Act procedure is not a summary procedure.  The Guardianship of Infants Act procedure will generally be taken in the High Court and we all know the High Court is the most expensive court to go to.  There is what in practical terms amounts to unlimited jurisdiction in this Bill to proceed in the Circuit Court, which is a local court and where the costs will not run to anything like the figure mentioned by Senator Robinson.  I want to make it quite clear that to obtain relief under this Bill will not, in my opinion, cost the rather frightening figure which Senator Robinson quoted for a particular case of a different type in the High Court. It is important to make that perfectly <Col N="1042" /> clear lest any people might be misled or inhibited from seeking their remedies under this Bill.  It would be a rare situation where the parties, having started in the Circuit Court, would seek to move to the High Court unless it would obviously be in their interests to do so.  If a party did so with prejudice to the other party I have no doubt the court would take that into account when it would come to deal with costs.</P>
      <P>We have not got free legal aid at present and the parties will have to bear their own costs.  I do not want to go over this ground again.  I did not make the argument that we do not bring it in because of the costs of a particular case.  I did say that the Exchequer may have higher priorities when the time comes that we have a recommendation from the committee. We must not forget that.  It is equally important to keep the matter of costs in perspective and to point out again that the proceedings in this case will be truly summary proceedings.  The proceedings in the case the Senator quoted are not summary proceedings and are generally brought in the High Court where the costs are at the highest.  Proceedings under this Bill can be taken in the Circuit Court which is a local court and where the costs would not run to anything near the amount of costs that could be incurred in the High Court.  We need to remember these things to get the matter into perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to pursue that further because my confusion is a genuine one.  I would like to know in what way proceedings, if taken in the High Court under this Bill, will differ in a qualitative way from proceedings under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act which are on special summons.  I agree that that procedure is confined to the High Court but one has a special summons <Col N="1043" /> and a grounding affidavit.  The idea is that the procedure is supposed to be a fairly quick and relatively cheap one. An assessment in the Law Library at the moment is that the cost of bringing guardianship of infants proceedings before the High Court would be of the order of money I mentioned, between £1,200 and £1,500.  If an application under this Bill is initiated in the High Court, or transferred from the Circuit Court to the High Court, in what way will it be guaranteed not to cost that much money?  What is the difference between them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite obviously I cannot say <i>in vacuo</i> because the costs of a particular case depends on how long it takes and that, in turn, depends on the complications and facts of a particular case.  It could be that some proceedings under this Bill would take longer than the example quoted by Senator Robinson and could cost more.  In such a situation one must assume that the estate is large, that the issues are complicated and that there are very high material considerations involved.  On the other hand, there could be a case where the facts would be very simple.  The court could adjudicate in a very short time and the costs would, accordingly, be smaller.  It is a rather pointless exercise for us to be trying to assess in advance of actual cases what a particular case will cost.  It is not possible. The point I want to make is that the Circuit Court is available and that the scale of costs in the Circuit Court are far lower than the type of figure quoted by Senator Robinson.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which deals with the possibility of registration.  In the other House, and here, the Minister dealt, in some detail and with some cogency, with his reasons for going easy on the concept of registration.  He argued, if I remember <Col N="1044" /> rightly, that this was something which if it was introduced into a marriage situation before the situation had got really bad would only tend to make things worse.  He preferred the particular device adopted in this Bill to the registration mechanism. However, his arguments have validity in respect of private housing that they do not necessarily have in relation to public housing.  In the case of private housing there is very often a substantial sum of money involved in the initial purchase of the house.</P>
      <P>There may be very many complications in trying to ascertain where exactly this money has come from, who has paid it, and so on, which would make the idea of compulsory registration rather difficult to wear.</P>
      <P>However, where local authority housing is concerned, there are no such ambiguities.  The rent as it usually is, at least initially, is not that substantial, and it is contributed to very often by both spouses.  Even in cases where it is contributed to in cash terms by one spouse, it is also contributed to in kind and work by the other spouse.  There is no ambiguity about the source of the support for local authority housing.  I am a great believer in the case that local and public authorities should, whereever possible, and especially where it does not cost them money, set a headline in the matter of establishing parity between individuals, and especially between husbands and wives in housing situations.</P>
      <P>There is a very strong argument in favour of compulsory registration of the existence of marriages where they exist in cases which local authorities convey a leasehold or a freehold interest in houses to people.  In fact, local authorities generally convey only leasehold interests.  Basically they give first of all a house on a lease subject to a weekly rent.  If they sell the house they usually maintain a small ground rent of a shilling, or so, in order to ensure that certain conditions are observed.  I suspect that after the Minister's legislation on ground rent, not even this will be possible.  So they may in fact also be conveying freeholds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> We are dealing with a situation in which in local authority housing a house is usually vested in a certain person as a tenant.  Thereafter, in a decreasingly short space of time, the house is vested in the same person as a purchaser.  I would like to think that the local authorities should set a headline here by registering the fact of marriages where such marriages exist in the same way, as in the case of private property, either spouse may register independently and voluntarily his or her interest.</P>
    <P>I had anticipated that we might have had a day between the conclusion of the Minister's speech and the taking of Committee Stage, which is why I did not get a particular amendment in on these lines.  I have a form of words which I should like to suggest to the Minister.  Perhaps he might consider it before we get to Report Stage whenever that will be. I would suggest a new subsection which would read:</P>
    <P>A local authority shall register in the Registry of Deeds, pursuant to the Registration of Deeds Act, 1707, in the case of unregistered property, or under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, in the case of registered land, a notice giving details of the marriage, if any, of any person to whom it conveys an interest in such property or land by lease or sale.</P>
    <P>A small consequential amendment would be necessary in subsection (2) of the section.  This is an idea which would not cost anything.  It would write large the concept of a joint ownership of what is public property as between husbands and wives to whom public property is conveyed.  It is a course of action which has been urged very strongly by the Free Legal Aid Centre people.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>What was urged, with respect to the Senator, was not so much registering a notice of marriage but that local authority houses should be subject to compulsory joint tenancy. I think that is what the advice centres recommended.  I see a lot of merit in <Col N="1046" /> what the Senator says.  There is one disadvantage to it.  It is putting local authority houses in a different category from the rest of the community.  That is something I should not like to do.  I would like all householders to be on exactly the same legal footing and subject to the same legal obligations with regard to their titles.  If a local authority failed to give notification to the registry, is it to be subject to any sanction?  If you impose an obligation without a sanction, of what value is the obligation?  We can expect local authorities to discharge their obligations with greater consistency than mere individuals.  Nevertheless that would be a flaw in it.</P>
      <P>The second point is, how do the local authority get the information on which to base their notification to the registry.  They would have to depend on the parties to give them the information that they are married.  Again, if the parties refuse to give this information to the local authorities, do we compel them to do it, or do we just allow the local authority to ignore that particular situation?  There may be people who would tell the local authority they are married when they might not be married.  The parties might be married bigamously, one of them having had an ecclesiastical annulment. Is that the marriage that would end up notified to the registry, whereas the real marriages did no appear on the registry?  These are all complications that would arise from what Senator Horgan suggests.</P>
      <P>What local authorities do&mdash;and this is possibly of greater practical benefit &mdash; in their invitation to people to avail themselves of purchase schemes is to recommend that the property should be placed in the joint ownership of the husband and wife.  They actually recommend this in the notice of application to participate in a purchase scheme.  That is possibly more valuable than notifying the Registry, because to have a system of notification to the Registry would bring with it all these difficulties to which I referred.  While it would be desirable in principle, in practice it would be extremely difficult and could lead to serious complications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made the best possible case against what I am suggesting, although he agrees that it would be a good thing if it could be brought about without all these complications.  The first point I should like to address myself to is his contention that this would put local authority housing in a different position from other housing, and that he would like to see all housing more or less on the same plane.  We have to face the fact that local authority housing is different from other housing in that it is directly subsidised by the taxpayer to a very large extent.  Given that that is the case, it is important that public policy should be observed to the maximum possible extent in the allocation of public housing.  That is the reason I would suggest an amendment on these terms.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems suggested by the Minister could be avoided if we were to make it optional on the local authority to register in such fashion, and leave it up to the democratic sensibilities of the local authorities in their own particular situations to do it if they see it necessary to do it and, if they do see it necessary to do it, to devise whatever sensible and modest administrative procedures may seem to them to be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Just two brief points on this section.  First of all, there seemed to be some confusion about what I said on Second Stage about this particular section from what was said in the Minister's Second Stage reply.  I think that the balance achieved by this Bill is better than to have a system of compulsory registration, although I am very much in sympathy with the view put forward by Senator Horgan.  If he wishes to table that amendment for Report Stage I will be happy to second it for him.  For private housing, a system which provides for the necessity for consent for sale of the family home, combined with a system of voluntary registration, is a good balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I said on Second Stage was that I hoped it would become a very acceptable part of normal practice for a solicitor that the advice given <Col N="1048" /> would be that the voluntary system of registration should be used at the start of every normal marriage without any possible inference that there was likely to be any trouble in that marriage and that it would become the norm that the fact of marriage would be registered either in the Registry of Deeds for unregistered land or the Land Registry under the Registration of Title Act in the case of registered land.</P>
    <P>I want clarification on a second point.  What would be sufficient evidence offered to allow a person to register notice of a marriage? Presumably there would have to be some form of proof.  I wonder whether this has been considered by the Minister.  Would mere production of the marriage certificate be sufficient or would there have to be a sworn affidavit by the person registering the notice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a matter for the Registrar to decide what type of notice he requires.  He may require that the notice be authenticated by a marriage certificate exhibited in the notice.  He may further require it to be by way of statutory declaration, but essentially it will be for the Registrar to make rules to satisfy himself that the notice is authentic. As a matter of practice over a comparatively short time, I imagine there will be a large number of marriages notified to the Registry.  The fact of marriages will be notified to the Registry and will arise in this way that every alienation of property, and that includes mortgage lease and sale, from the passing of the Act will have to be endorsed with the wife's consent. That fact will be available in the Registry for the knowledge of subsequent purchasers.  Therefore, after a comparatively short time, every dealing lodged in either the Land Registry or Registry of Deeds where the consent of a spouse was necessary will have that spouse's consent endorsed and thereby subsequent purchasers will be alerted that there was a marriage on that particular title.  In practice what is set out to be achieved by this section will be <Col N="1049" /> achieved through conveyancing and conveyancing practice.</P>

      <P>I do not know if there is any great advantage in that.  We are not protecting the local authorities. It is the spouses we want to protect. If local authorities have notice of marriage in some cases and not in others and there was no legal obligation to give it in all cases, the chances are that local authorities would decide to opt out of giving notice in any case.  The best role they can play is to continue to inform people of the advantages of joint ownership and urge them to take the local authority house in both names.</P>

      <P>No.  There would certainly not be any legal objection to a local authority deciding to notify, on a voluntary basis, the fact of a marriage in relation to a house provided it itself has knowledge.  But how does it satisfy itself that it is getting accurate knowledge?  There are practical difficulties, and as far as we have gone in the section is as far as we need go.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 14 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to <Col N="1050" /> welcome this provision.  It is slightly different from some of the other provisions of the Bill so it is probably worth drawing attention to.  It provides:</P>
      <P>No stamp duty, land registration fee, Registry of Deeds fee or court fee shall be payable on any transaction creating a joint tenancy between spouses in respect of a family home where the home was immediately prior to such transaction owned by either spouse or by both spouses otherwise than as joint tenants.</P>
      <P>There are now a number of spouses who would like to convert the property into a joint ownership and who have been prevented from doing so by the costs that this would have involved, and, similarly, solicitors who would otherwise advise on the desirability of converting property into the joint names have been deterred from giving this advice because of the stamp duties and so on which have had to be paid.  It is most desirable that it become the norm in marital relations in Ireland that the property be held jointly.  Until we get a provision providing for compulsory co-ownership all we can do is use every opportunity and possibility of increasing the incidence of voluntary joint ownership.  This provision should be widely advertised, and husbands and wives should be encouraged to become aware of it and to transfer the family home into their joint names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This goes back to what was relevant to the background to legislation of this sort.  It is one of the reasons why I regard it as potentially a very far-reaching Bill.  I do not think that one can really take a marriage, abstract it from a society, and start classifying it as a happy or successful marriage. Irish marriages are very much conditioned by the atmosphere prevailing and the cultural ethos of our society, and the average Irish marriage is one where the wife is not, on the whole, consulted or given financial responsibility and a right to share in decisions. The dependency of Irish wives in the marriage, even for marriages which appear from the outside to be successful ones, is an imbalance in our <Col N="1051" /> society and prevents the marriage being the degree of partnership between two equal and adult partners that it should be.  I would hope, therefore, that section 14 will be availed of by as many husbands and wives of what are happy and successful and normal marriages&mdash;whatever term one wants to use&mdash;in order to reinforce that marriage relationship by giving the underpinning of co-responsibility, co-legal rights and, therefore, copartnership in the whole venture.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that this type of active encouragement as part of our public policy is irrelevant to the normal happy marriage. The normal happy marriage in Ireland is a conditioned Irish marriage.  Conditioned Irish marriages need to be prodded and encouraged by sections such as this and by a public policy in relation to it to have better, more equitable and more reasonable provisions in relation to the holding of property in those marriages.  There is a great backlog to catch up on, a great redress of the sharp and narrow conditions of women and, indeed, of men in our society so that they have seen their roles in a very narrow and restrictive way and this is reflected in their attitudes within marriage.</P>
    <P>The compulsory parts of this Bill and also the voluntary parts, like the voluntary registration of the fact of a marriage by notice to the Registry of Deeds or the removal of financial handicaps to transferring the family home into joint ownership, are very welcome and very significant parts of this Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Before section 16, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The costs of any proceedings under this Act shall be in the discretion of the Court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is necessary in order to confer on the courts in question, be it the High Court, the Circuit Court or, in some instances, the District Court, a general discretion in relation to costs.  It is necessary because the normal rule in the circumstances is that the costs fall on the party who loses, but there are a number of applications that could be made, particularly by a wife, under various sections of this Bill where, for example, she may make an application under section 5 in relation to conduct leading to the loss of the family home, she may not win in the sense of establishing what she was alleging.  She may say that the other spouse was engaging in conduct which may lead to a loss of an interest in the family home and the court may say, no, the conduct has not gone so far as to actually succeed in an application under section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very strong grounds in all these applications in the area of family law for conferring the discretion on the court to decide whether any costs will be awarded against the party or who will bear the costs in the circumstances.  The particular provision is similar to one in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act.  Section 26 of that Act provides that the cost <Col N="1053" /> of any proceedings under that Act shall be at the discretion of the court. We are in a similar situation here.  If anything, there are stronger grounds for arguing for the necessity of such a provision in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not necessary because the costs will be in the discretion of the court.  The present Court Rules, 1950, provide that:</P>
      <P>Unless otherwise provided by statute or by these rules the granting or withholding of the costs of any party to any proceedings in the court shall be in the discretion of the judge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A further section provides that:</P>
      <P>The costs following the trial of an action by jury shall follow the event unless the court otherwise awards.</P>
      <P>Order 99, rule 1, of the Superior Court Rules says:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of the Act and any other statutes relating to costs and except as otherwise provided by these Rules,</P>
      <P>(i)  the costs of and incidental to every proceeding in the Superior Courts shall be in the discretion of these Courts respectively...</P>
      <P>Again, there is an exception in the rules for costs following the event where there is a trial by jury.  In these particular cases there will not be a trial by jury and even if there were the court would still have power to award the costs, notwithstanding how the event might turn out.  Therefore, the amendment is not necessary because the costs are already in the discretion of the courts in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel much more confident that this amendment will be accepted.  I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Before section 16 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An agreement entered into between spouses shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of excluding or limiting the operation of any provision of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment would be to prevent attempts to evade the key provision of the Bill, that the written consent of a spouse is necessary for the sale, disposal, mortgaging, leasing or whatever, of a family home. It may sound contradictory, as it <Col N="1056" /> reads, but one must view this Bill against the background, overpowering in many circumstances, of a wife in a family breakdown situation.  I think it is frequently the case that a wife does not have the power to resist either the mental attempts to overpower her by her husband or, quite a common phenomenon, the physical attempt to overpower her, and we have a sufficient incidence of wife-beating and brutality to wives to know that these pressures can be exerted. Similarly, some notorious cases have reached court in recent years in Ireland.  I am thinking particularly, for example, of a case where a wife was so bullied and overpowered by her husband that she appeared to consent to a divorce being had in England.  There was collusion between the spouses, between husband and wife.  The wife had no free will in the matter.  She was forced by her husband to appear to consent to the divorce and to make it appear to the English court that they were both domiciled there.</P>
    <P>It is this type of situation which we must be aware of as a possible loophole on the provisions and on the content of this Bill.  For example, it would be quite possible that husbands would try to either bully or persuade wives to enter into a written agreement with them that they would not have to give their consent in writing for the sale of the family home.  This could be done in various ways.  If two young people were thinking of getting married and if the fiance were to say, &ldquo;Well, I was thinking of marrying you but I am afraid that I will only do so if you will enter into an agreement that we will forget about any question of the necessity for consent in writing&rdquo;.  Or the agreement might be entered into after the marriage had taken place, several years afterwards, when there was a family home and the husband could overpower the separate will of the wife in the matter and could so bully her that she could enter into an improvident agreement with him, an agreement which would negate the protection offered by this Bill, and agreement which would persuade her that she would by agreement forego her rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> On the Report Stage of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Bill the Minister introduced a somewhat similar amendment to that Bill, that is the insertion of a new section, section 27, which provided that &ldquo;an agreement shall be void in so far as it would have the effect of excluding or limiting the operation of any provision of this Act other than section 21&rdquo;.  That provided for a very desirable exclusion of any improvident or, probably, bullied agreement by a wife that she would not demand her legal rights, she would not require that her consent in writing would be necessary for any sale or mortgage and so on of the family home or, in the case of the Maintenance Act, foregoing her claims for maintenance under that Act, or other particular claims.</P>
    <P>Just as I think it was desirable to have that amendment in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Bill&mdash;indeed I specifically referred to it and commended the Minister for it when we were discussing that Bill&mdash;so I would hope that this amendment would be accepted in order to exclude the possibility of a wife being bullied or persuaded or just foolishly or thoughtlessly entering into an agreement with her husband that she would not enforce the rights under this Bill, that she would not insist on her consent in writing.</P>
    <P>I think this is very necessary because we are not just talking about a wife in the particular circumstances. We are also talking about the dependent children.  Since the type of proceedings under the various sections of this Bill are proceedings which arise on application by a spouse are adversary proceedings, the needs and the position of the dependent children will not be catered for unless they are catered for through an application being made by a spouse.  Therefore it is most important not to allow opting out by agreement, whether an improvident type of arrangement, under the influence of infatuation, love, whatever one might call it, or under physical threats or under some mental cruelty threats of the other spouse that a wife would forego her <Col N="1058" /> rights through entering into some agreement.</P>
    <P>Therefore the amendment provides that any such purported agreement would be void to that effect, that whatever else was in the agreement, if it was an overall arrangement between the spouses, all the other parts of the agreement would be valid but the agreement would be void in so far as it would try to exclude or limit the operation of any of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The danger of contracting out to which Senator Robinson referred in my opinion cannot arise under this Bill because let us recall what the right is.  The right is to withhold consent to the sale of a family home.  That is in effect the right given by the Bill.  If you have an agreement not to give consent, or rather to contract out, the agreement would have to be an agreement to give consent, and then the wife in effect would be contracting out.  In other words, a malicious or vindictive husband would not need to have an agreement in writing for his wife to give her consent.</P>
      <P>As drafted, I do not see how contracting out could be possible.  A wife can always consent to the sale of the matrimonial home and an agreement to do what she can do under the Act is not of any value.  It will not interfere with her rights.  The provisions of the Bill make it clear that the consent must always be obtained subject to section 4 regarding an appeal to the court.  You cannot prevent a wife from agreeing not to exercise her rights under the Bill any more than you can prevent her, say, from renouncing her rights under the Succession Act.  Where she agrees not to withhold her consent and then withholds it, this will have to be taken into account under an application under section 4.  A sale or other disposition of the home will not be valid without the wife's consent unless the court dispenses with her consent and this is true irrespective of any agreement that might be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is very positive in its provisions. I cannot see how contracting <Col N="1059" /> out could arise under the Bill as drafted.  I have not got the Maintenance Act before me but from recollection of its general provisions there would be room for contracting out because it is not a case of the wife's withholding of her consent to a particular thing or giving her consent to a particular action.  There are more substantive matters in that Act where she has a positive right to move.  If I thought there would be any need for this I would accept this amendment but quite frankly I am satisfied that there is no need, that contracting out of the rights under the Bill is not possible as it is drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is because it has been a difficult afternoon that I put my arguments in a very obtuse and unclear way but I do not think the Minister has quite understood the purpose of the amendment. If one goes back to section 3 (1), it provides that where a spouse without the prior consent in writing of the other spouse purports to convey any interest in the family home to any persons except the other spouse then subject to the particular qualifications of it the purported conveyance shall be void.  The sort of agreement that I have in mind is an agreement entered into at the time of the marriage, on the honeymoon or a few weeks after that or at any time subsequent to it where there is an agreement between the spouses which is to the effect: &ldquo;I undertake not to withhold my consent from any disposition of the family home&rdquo;&mdash;that is, written consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I could see many circumstances where the husband would draft the type of agreement, put it under the nose of his wife, and say: &ldquo;Look, sign that&rdquo;. The wife would sign it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same sort of contracting-out type agreement. There could be consideration.  He <Col N="1060" /> could say: &ldquo;I will give you £1,000&rdquo;. There could very well be consideration for that type of an agreement. The point I am trying to make is that in the situation where very often the wife is very vulnerable.  She may be improvident and may enter into an agreement in writing which makes it clear that her consent will be forthcoming for any disposition in the future of the family home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>If the husband is going ahead with the sale or lease or mortgage and has prior consent in writing, then he has prior consent in writing.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. Maybe it was an obvious point that escaped me but I was not aware that the section prescribed in such explicit terms that the actual deed of conveyance or mortgage instrument itself on the face of it, contained the reference to the prior consent and the endorsement by the signature of the spouse.</P>

      <P>It is more a matter of conveyancing law that when the obligation is laid down here, conveyancing will prescribe how it will be effective in practice.  As a matter of conveyancing, the method I have indicated to Senators would be how it would be done.  Anything less than that would not achieve the purpose of this section and would render the title faulty.</P>

      <P>In the light of that clarification and my better understanding of the scope of section 3, my amendment, which would have tried to prevent an earlier improvident agreement where a wife would forgo the possibility of refusing her consent to a sale or mortgage is not necessary.

      <P>Before the Minister introduces this Bill, may I raise one matter?  We have this afternoon in this House passed through all Stages, two quite important Bills.  I would ask that the Minister not ask for all Stages of the Adoption Bill this evening.  It will be preferable, to have time for consideration of amendments, to have a separate Committee Stage.  I would <Col N="1063" /> welcome the Minister's view on my introductory remark.</P>

      <P>The Senator is aware of the urgency of this Bill to cure the position revealed in recent court proceedings. The urgency arises from the need to cure that position, but even more importantly to reassure people who are needlessly worried because of that decision and who think it might affect them when there is no chance of it affecting them.  It arose from what was probably an unique combination of circumstances and consequently there is no need for worry.  Nevertheless, the worry exists, and that is why I am extremely anxious to have this Bill on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  I appreciate what the Senator has to say and I am aware of her interest in this subject.  Perhaps we could start the Second Stage debate without committing ourselves to when we will take the next Stage.  As the debate goes on, the Senator might like to have it finished this evening.  If she has strong objections, I would certainly give way to her in regard to having a later Committee Stage.  My anxiety is to have the Bill law as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In a case decided early in June the Supreme Court declared an adoption order made in 1971 to be invalid and awarded custody of the child to its natural parents.  The court decided that the board had not discharged the statutory onus that is on it to be satisfied that the mother of the child was informed of her right to withdraw her consent to the making of the adoption order up to the time the order was actually made.  The fact that the board did not ensure that the <Col N="1064" /> mother was aware of what in one of the judgments is called the date of the hearing was also criticised by the court.  The point also arose that the mother did not know or may not have known her rights and that she was entitled to know them.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in his judgement emphasised that the combination of factors in the case decided by the Supreme Court was very unusual. Nevertheless, some of the defects on which the decision of the court was based may have been present in some of the adoption orders that have already been made.  The intention of the Bill in this regard is to validate all of the orders concerned to the extent that they may be invalid by reason of the defects in question.  I hope, therefore, that the Bill will be accepted as an adequate response to the immediate problems that have been raised. The Bill, as introduced, was designed to do no more than this.  It was of necessity prepared quickly to meet an urgent need.</P>
    <P>The first substantive provision in the Bill, section 2, is that&mdash;provided a consent was duly given&mdash;the board shall be deemed to have discharged the onus I have mentioned notwithstanding that it had no evidence that the persons who gave their consent were aware that they could withdraw it at any time before the adoption orders were made or that they knew the dates on which the board proposed to make the orders.  I might add that the board's practice not to seek information in respect of these matters was based on the assumption that it was unnecessary for it to do so.  A further provision in the Bill, linked with the first, proposes that the fact that a person who gave consent to the making of an adoption order was not aware that he could withdraw it up to the time the order was made or was not aware of the date on which the board proposed to make the order or of his right to be heard by the board shall not invalidate the order.</P>
    <P>As regards future cases, the problems that arose in relation to the case recently decided probably could be completely avoided by changes in procedure on the part of the board but <Col N="1065" /> the difficulty is that the changes in procedure that would appear to be necessary if the board were to be sure that it was fully complying would be changes that virtually everybody involved in adoption work would undoubtedly regard as very undesirable. Consequently, the Bill has to authorise the board to adopt procedures which the present law, according to the court's decision, would not allow. The main difficulty arose from the obligation which, on my reading of the judgments, the Supreme Court consider lies on the board under the existing legislation to inform a consenting party of the date of the hearing. I think I should explain at this juncture, that there are, in fact, no procedures before the board at which the various parties to an adoption arrangement are present or represented. The board's practice is, first of all, to scrutinise the formal documents namely, application form, consents, and so on, and then to seek and study various social reports on the placement.  These include reports from welfare officers who have visited the home, and so on.  Towards the end of the procedure, all going well, the board interviews the prospective adopter or adopters.  This interview takes place in all cases.  If any other interested person has indicated his wish to discuss the case or if the board wishes to interview some other person, the interview takes place on a separate occasion.  The board, for obvious reasons, wishes to maintain this practice. The intention is to permit the board to continue its practice in this regard but section 3 provides for the giving of additional information to persons who consent to the making of orders.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the board may authorise suitable persons to make inquiries on its behalf and may act on the basis of their reports.  It would appear from the Supreme Court decision that it is not sufficient for the board to have before it the sworn affidavit of consent and that, even if the consent from were to show on its face that the person giving consent fully understood the nature and effect of an adoption order, and of the consent&mdash;including the fact that <Col N="1066" /> he or she may withdraw the consent&mdash; it would still be necessary for the board to have that fact confirmed independently.</P>
    <P>The provisions I have mentioned are intended to deal with the problems raised directly by the decision of the Supreme Court.  There are, however, two further provisions which deal with wider issues connected with adoption orders and determination of custody.  Section 5 provides that in proceedings for a declaration that an adoption order is invalid, the High Court, having regard to the interests of the child and to the rights under the Constitution of the persons concerned, may decline to make the declaration if it so thinks proper, and section 6 is intended to ensure that if, nevertheless, in a particular case an adoption order is declared invalid, no order relating to the custody of the child will be made without adequate notice to the adopter or adopters and then only on the basis that the decision will be made in accordance with the provisions of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, which specifies that the welfare of the child is to be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>I accepted a suggestion made in the other House for the inclusion of a provision relating to the status of adopted children.  As appropriate provision which has nothing to do with the Supreme Court decision has been included in the Bill as section 7.  It has been thought prudent in a number of enactments, notably under the tax code and the social welfare code to stipulate that an adopted child shall be regarded as the child of its adoptive parents for the purposes of the Acts.  Section 7 will render this provision unnecessary in future legislation.  A further proposal which I introduced in the other House by way of amendment is contained in section 8.  This section proposes that if an application is made to a court for the disclosure of information in the board's records, or in the index kept by an tÁrd Chláraitheóir which makes traceable the connection between entries in the adopted children register and the corresponding entry in the register of <Col N="1067" /> births, the court may make an order granting the application only where it is satisfied that the best interests of the child concerned require that such an order be made.  As far as I know, this situation has never arisen in practice.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, this Bill was primarily designed to do no more than respond to the immediate problems raised by the Supreme Court decision.  I recognise that there are other areas in the field of adoption that merit consideration but I think that the present Bill serves a useful and necessary purpose.  I should like to remind Senators that I have announced that the Government intend to bring forward proposals for an amendment of the Constitution to ensure that in any adoption situation the best interests of the adopted child shall prevail. This is intended to ensure that no matter what the facts of a case may be, the interests of the child alone will determine whether or not an adoption is upheld.  I am not, at this stage, in a position to give particulars of what the proposed amendment will contain.  I ask the House to give its approval to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I believe that there is no reason to go into all the details of the Bill before us because it is well summarised where the Minister has said that the intention of the Bill in this regard is to validate all the adoption orders concerned and finally in the last paragraph where the Minister said that the interest of the child is of primary importance.  This is a very excellent explanatory memorandum. Already all sections of the community have welcomed the fact that the Minister has acted so rapidly in bringing this Bill before us.  It retains the main objective which we went through in the various debates in 1972 and 1974, that is, to the extent that the good of the child takes precedence over everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all regret the circumstances that have brought about this Bill, <Col N="1068" /> and with the Minister, I sympathise with the adoptive parents who have been greatly upset and worried since this verdict from the Supreme Court.  Indeed, some of these parents who are excellent people have been greatly hurt by reckless statements to the Press and reckless articles in papers that do not show up the Irish people in their best light. The very fact that the public have reacted so spontaneously to this case is in itself a tribute to our adoption bodies.  Here I would like to pay tribute to all these voluntary bodies, both Catholic and Protestant, who have given such wonderful service down through the years.  This fact is admitted by the Adoption Board's report, which tell us that 80 per cent of adoptions are arranged by adoption societies.  I know that health boards also arrange for some adoptions but girls in trouble favour the voluntary agencies more than any other source.</P>
    <P>I must refer to statements that have been made and the criticisms we have seen in papers.  I suspect these criticisms have been made just because there is a nun and a priest involved in this adoption case.  At present many people and groups in our society avail of every opportunity to have a crack at both nuns and priests who served nobly in the fields of adoption and education when very few of these who are so vocal today were in the least concerned about either adoption or education.  The nun and priest in question were two highly qualified and widely-experienced people.  I deplore the fact that, while their names were not mentioned, they have been dragged into this in the way they have been.  The court itself paid tribute to the way the case was handled before and after the woman's pregnancy.  I cannot understand why that situation was not highlighted in the media.</P>
    <P>I have here before me something that I deplore and I am very sorry that it is a woman Senator who said it, that in this country adoption societies are like adoption factories and are operating as such.  It is most <Col N="1069" /> uncharitable and uncalled for and it cannot be substantiated.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn recently that a survey will be done on adoptions to date.  I hope it will cover the mothers who did not consent to adoptions and opted to keep their children.  When we spoke about the adoption code here in 1972 and 1974 we all admitted that it was one of the finest pieces of social legislation that we have on our statute books. Nothing has happened since to change our opinion of that.</P>
    <P>Every section of our society has been worried about the Supreme Court decision.  I welcome the Bill because it is designed to give more precision and strength to our adoption boards and societies.  I am also glad that there is to be a constitutional amendment and if there are any more loopholes in the adoption code I am sure the Minister will take immediate steps to close them.  I wish to pay tribute again to our adoption societies and to deplore the fact that they have been described as adoption factories which is most unkind and unfair and cannot be substantiated.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that once an adoption order is made it may not be challenged within a specific period, say six months, without the assent of the Attorney General. Everyone believes that a limiting clause like this is necessary because of the uncertainties that might be there for adoptive parents.  Many thousands of children have happy homes from adoptive parents.  In every society you have people who do not conform to accepted standards. We have this in our families; there are family homes that are not all that they should be.  I do not think everyone should be slammed because of the exception.  I am glad the Minister has acted so promptly and I think everyone in the country is thankful to him.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few words on this.  This Bill really comprises a very natural and worthy reaction, but necessarily a very hasty reaction, to the Supreme Court <Col N="1070" /> decision referred to.  Within the time available to them, and having regard to the fact that the reaction was necessarily a hasty one, the Government and the Minister have done an extremely good job in the preparation of this Bill.  I do not think the Minister claims&mdash;and I am sure the Government would not claim&mdash;that this Bill is or can be the last word on adoption laws or procedures in this country.  The Bill must be regarded in the context of the concluding sentences of the Minister's introductory statement where he referred to the fact that the Government have also decided to introduce a Constitutional Amendment Bill which, of course, will come for discussion before the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I have, in one sense, a reservation regarding the Bill and the constitutional amendment but I think the provisions which are written into section 5 of this Bill meet the point of view which I have in mind.  It is very important that we should regard the family as the primary and fundamental unit of society.  That is laid down in the Constitution. If we are to have a healthy society, we should continue to give primacy to the family unit.  At first when I read this Bill and saw the proposals in it, I could see all the justifications for the various points that were urged on the Government following the Supreme Court decision.  I wondered if a declaration in the Bill that the rights of the child concerned were to be of paramount importance and if a constitutional amendment designed to bring about that situation in relation to adoption would not give rise to something in the nature of a conflict between what I believe is the ordinary Irish concept of family life and the family unit as the fundamental unit in society, and the position of adopted children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I felt that the position of the adopted child should be viewed in the general family context, in the context of the welfare, not merely of the adopted child but of the family unit of which, by reason of his or her adoption, he or she has become part and this was a question I certainly could not&mdash;I do not believe anybody could&mdash;give a glib answer to.  It is a deep question and <Col N="1071" /> one, to my mind, for very weighty consideration.</P>
    <P>In section 5 of the Bill the Minister has provided that an adoption order shall not be declared invalid by a court if the court, after hearing any person who, in the opinion of the court, ought to be heard, is satisfied (a) that it would not be in the best interest of the child concerned to make such a declaration. If it were left <i>simpliciter</i> there it would mean that virtually the sole deciding factor would be the question of the interest of the child.  The section goes on to provide in subsection (b) that it would be proper, having regard to these interests&mdash; that is, the interests of the child&mdash;</P>
    <P>...and to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned not to make such a declaration.</P>
    <P>Subsection (b) coupled with subsection (a) does take into account the kind of thoughts and concepts that are important in Irish life, important having regard to what I might describe, without appearing to be nationalistic or chauvinistic about it, as the Irish view of family life.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the urgency of the matter and the haste with which they necessarily had to deal with the situation the Government and the Minister have done a very good job in a short time in trying to allay the fears of adoptive parents and remedy a situation which, through no fault either of the natural parents or the adopted parents&mdash;it is certainly no fault of the child in the case in question and I feel quite sure, having regard to the Minister's speech, no fault of the Adoption Board&mdash;came to light in this case. The Government have done a good job.  I would like then to see the next step being taken where we can consider the question of the Constitutional amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third Adoption Bill to be debated in this House in the last four years.  The first was a Private Members' Bill&mdash;<Col N="1072" /> the Adoption Bill of 1971 put forward by Senator John Horgan, Senator Evelyn Owens and myself&mdash; which was withdrawn in June, 1972, because of the Government promise to bring in legislation.  The second Bill was a Government measure&mdash;the Adoption Act of 1974.  The third Bill then is this Bill arising out of the particular tragic circumstances referred to by the Minister and by other Senators.</P>
      <P>I share deeply the concern expressed by the Minister and by other Senators to have the position with regard to adoption clarified and the law amended.  The particular tragedy of that case evoked horror and dismay that our adoption law could lead to a situation where a child, who had formed a family relationship with an adoptive mother and father, would now be taken out of that environment and returned to natural parents who had not seen the child for five years.  This shock and dismay have rightly prompted the introduction of urgent legislation to correct the particular deficiency and to amend the law.  However, it would be wrong for us to regard the need for change in adoption as confined to responding to particularly serious symptoms when they occur from time to time.  I am afraid that there is a danger, because of the urgency of the present situation, that it will be treated as one particular, difficult symptom to which we must quickly respond and then feel confident that otherwise the situation is all right and there is no necessity to delve deeper.  There is every necessity to delve deeply and to examine, with responsibility and with great seriousness of purpose, the reasons why we have an adoption law which could lead to such a tragic event. How was this possible under a system of adoption on which we apparently prided ourselves?  We have certainly had successive Ministers for Justice and a number of Senators priding themselves on having &ldquo;the best adoption system&rdquo;.  How was it possible then that there could be such a tragic circumstance which shocked not only the public in this country but also shocked people outside this country to discover that our laws could lead to such a situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> Like other Senators and, as the Minister has stressed, I am aware that this Bill is an urgent one.  I am personally very aware of the heartache, the apprehension and the sleepless nights that are being suffered by a very considerable number of adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents.  Because I have been involved in trying to get reform of adoption law I have been more aware than the average Member of this House of the situation relating to adoption and of the particular problems, such as they are, in regard to our adoption system.  I am very substantially aware of the vulnerability of the whole procedure and of the necessity for clarity and certainty and humanity in our adoption law.  However, that sense of urgency and seriousness should not prevent us from considering responsibly and seriously and in depth the adoption system we have and whether this particular Bill is an adequate response to the immediate case and an adequate response to the general need for reform.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that a good part of the public reaction to the Supreme Court case was to reinforce the fairly-widely held view of those involved in adoption work that there is a substantial need for reform and not just in regard to adoption but in our general law relating to the rights of children.  I am glad to say that those involved in the community take a broad and serious attitude towards the need for reform.  The viewpoint has been very well expressed in a proclamation on children's rights.  This proclamation was sponsored by an organisation known as &ldquo;Children First&rdquo; and supported by other organisations.  It was adhered to by a very considerable number of voluntary organisations concerned with the welfare of children and by a large number of individual members of the public.</P>
    <P>I would like to put the text of this proclamation on the record because I think it is a background against which we should consider this Bill and any future legislation to amend the Constitution in this respect.</P>
    <P>The proclamation reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> We the undersigned, representatives of organisations concerned about the welfare of children, on this National Children's Day, June 13th, 1976, demand that the Government take necessary action to ensure maximum protection, security, and happiness for the children of the State.</P>
    <P>The United Nations' Declaration of the Rights of the Child (1959) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The child shall enjoy special protection, and shall be given opportunities and facilities, by law and by other means, to enable him to develop physically, mentally, morally, spiritually, and socially in a healthy and normal manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity. In the enactment of laws for this purpose, the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We demand that legislation be introduced to provide that, in any case in which the care and custody of a child is at issue, the welfare of the child shall be the first consideration.  In the event that the enactment of such legislation is thought to be repugnant to the Constitution, the Government should take steps to have the Constitutional issue decided, and, if repugnant, to make the appropriate Constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Special attention must be given to the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The interests of a child require that he receive continuous, loving care in a family.  He should remain with this caring family, and it should get support where necessary.  Particular attention should be paid to helping single parent families.</P>
    <P>2.  The State must protect the interests of a child whose family cannot or will not provide the care he needs.  To this end, a comprehensive child care system incorporating adoption, fostering and residential care must be provided.  Each child should receive the care that is <Col N="1075" /> appropriate to his own particular needs.  Legitimate children should not be precluded from adoption.</P>
    <P>3.  In order to support family care, the State should ensure that its policies with regard to income maintenance, housing and education should take account of the special needs of children, particularly deprived and handicapped children.</P>
    <P>4.  Children should not be accountable under the criminal law.  Any system for dealing with young offenders should protect their interests and take account of their needs as children.</P>
    <P>5.  In any situation in which a decision is taken about the welfare of a child, he should have appropriate representation in his own right.</P>
    <P>6.  The Government should give priority to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report of the Task Force on Child Care Services.</P>
    <P>There was a recent letter in the national newspapers giving an indication of the degree of support; something like 28 to 30 broad based countrywide organisations have signed this proclamation and have lent their names and support to its implementation. Therefore, although we discuss this Bill against the background of one particular tragic case, we also discuss it against a background of an increasing pressure and call for reform in our law relating to children.  There is a very serious onus on us in this House to be aware of that public disquiet on a much wider basis than just in relation to the Supreme Court case, and of the need for broad based reform on the lines emphasised in that particular proclamation.</P>
    <P>I should like to consider now the particular case which gave rise to the fact that we have an Adoption Bill before us today.  In that case it appears that the Supreme Court found that the Adoption Board had not discharged their legislative responsibilities in ensuring that there <Col N="1076" /> had been real consent to adoption by the unmarried mother in the case, and that the adoption order was null and void in the absence of that real consent.  The Adoption Board had not expressly informed the single mother in those circumstances that after she had given her consent by signing the appropriate form she could at any stage, before the adoption order was finalised, withdraw that consent.  Neither was the single mother informed of the date of the hearing in relation to the adoption proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment, of which I have only been able so far to read to newspaper report, is reported to have said that this was a most unusual case but, in fact the practice and procedure adopted by the Adoption Board in relation to those two matters was the standard adoption procedure.  It was standard practice not to inform the single mother that she could withdraw her consent at any time before the adoption order had been completed and it was standard practice not to inform her of her right to appear at a hearing.  It was not an unusual case, it was an overall finding by the Supreme Court of an inadequacy and an imbalance in our adoption code.  Hence the necessity for emergency legislation: first of all to validate existing adoption orders, secondly, to cater for the situation of adoption applications in the pipeline and thirdly to provide for the future in relation to this type of procedure.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus on that element of the situation, the fact that the practice condemned by the Supreme Court of not ensuring the real consent of the single mother was the standard procedure by the Adoption Board in discharge of their responsibility under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974.  I think the Adoption Board felt that they were discharging, in all good faith, their responsibilities under those Acts and their role and function in relation to adoption.  I think the members of the Adoption Board are as <Col N="1077" /> conditioned as are the vast majority of the people of this country and also Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, by the broader Irish society in relation to the whole question of adoption and of the position of a single mother who wishes to keep her child.  Since 1952 I think there has been a very decided imbalance in our adoption procedure and the board only reflected this imbalance in implementing the legislation and procedure. They have discharged their responsibilities carefully and with due intent to perform their functions properly, but they are totally conditioned by that background.</P>
    <P>The recent decision of the Supreme Court only highlights this imbalance. It does not create one single anomaly; it just highlights a continuing imbalance in our procedure.  The reason for the imbalance is that since the original Principal Act of 1952 was introduced there has not been a serious fundamental appraisal of the whole system of adoption, of the position of the single mother or of a child who may be going to be adopted.  There has never been a proper fundamental appraisal of the rights and interests of all parties concerned and of the appropriate and proper approach of society to these problems.  Despite the urgency of this Bill and the fact that some of us have been involved in this House for several hours this afternoon on other legislation&mdash;it being that time of year&mdash;I think we should take time to carry out that fundamental examination.</P>
    <P>What are the basic principles underlying a just and fair adoption procedure? I believe it is necessary for us to identify them and to promote them in the legislation.  The first principle is the welfare of the child.  When the last Government Bill was introduced, the Adoption Bill, 1974, I moved an amendment in this House, and I was supported by Senator Horgan, to insert a section into that Adoption Bill which would provide that the welfare of the child was the paramount consideration. Although the Minister had not shown very much enthusiasm for the proposed amendment on Second Stage of that <Col N="1078" /> Bill in that he felt it was not necessary, he nevertheless accepted it.  I venture to think that he is probably glad now that he accepted that amendment and had that section written into the 1974 Act.</P>
    <P>That assertion in the statute is a guidance to a court when exercising jurisdiction to interpret the law.  It was not sufficient, as we saw, in the case of the particular, tragic recent Supreme Court decision to prevail upon the Supreme Court to place the welfare of the child in a paramount position, probably because of the constitutional provisions, which do not appear to place the welfare of the child in the same paramount context.  Saying that the basic principle is the welfare of the child and writing in a provision to the 1974 Adoption Act to the effect that the welfare of the child should be paramount in adoption proceedings is not sufficient.  The welfare of the child must be predominant in deciding on what will be the future of that child. That child must not be discriminated against by a choice of its future.  This point brings me to one of the neglected aspects of the subject, not so much of adoption procedure but of the single mother with her child who decides that it is in the best interests of her child not to place it in adoption.</P>
    <P>At present, because the welfare of the child is not the paramount principle there, that child will be disadvantaged legally and disadvantaged economically and socially.  If the mother's conviction is that she should keep her child with her and bring it up in her family context, her child will suffer the slur of illegitimacy, the legal disadvantage of illegitimacy.  The child will be at a considerable social disadvantage in our society and the single mother, like any other single parent with a child, will have economic difficulties in providing for that child.  We have not yet got a society where the first principle has been safeguarded, namely, that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. If we had that principle, then we would have a different sort of attitude, both towards adoption and towards the single mother who keeps her child.</P>
    <P>I think things are moving in that <Col N="1079" /> direction.  There is a great deal more sympathy and understanding of the aspirations and of the role of a single mother with her child.  Some very encouraging evidence of this attitude was shown by a contribution to a seminar in November, 1975, by CHERISH, the organisation of single mothers, in a speech by Dr. Éamonn Casey, the Bishop of Kerry, on that occasion.  The seminar was on helping the unmarried parent and child and it was held in Cruises Hotel, Limerick on Sunday, 2nd November, 1975.  At that meeting Bishop Casey referred to attitudes towards the single mother with her child.  I quote from a Press release issued by Bishop Casey, which incorporated his interpretation of his remarks at that meeting.  Under the heading &ldquo;Attitudes&rdquo; he says:</P>
    <P>There has been always an ambivalence on the part of society and the Church to the unmarried mother.  On the one hand they responded in charity to the needs of the unmarried mother and her child but on the other hand they did not want to appear &ldquo;too accepting&rdquo;. Evidence of the response of the Church is clear in the many Religious Sisters who devoted themselves to this work by establishing and running homes for the unmarried mother and setting up adoption societies.  He wished personally to pay tribute to those Sisters and to the Adoption Societies without whose help he could not have resolved the difficulties of the hundreds of unmarried mothers who came to him in his Pastoral work. He wished also to pay tribute to his many fellow priests both in England and Ireland to whom nothing was an inconvenience when contacted to help in these matters.</P>
    <P>There was also, however, a hesitancy to appear too accepting lest it might (1) undermine moral standards, (2) threaten the stability of the normal family, (3) or even create a climate in which too many children would be born outside of normal wedlock.  This ambivalence, this hesitancy, however, was not justified since the rights of an unborn child are paramount, <Col N="1080" /> particularly in a Christian community where so much stress is laid on the uniqueness and dignity of the human person, created by God in love and in His Own Image. He thanked God this ambivalence is passing and a true accepting attitude is becoming evident both in society and in the Church. Evidence in the change in attitude in Society is to be found in a survey of 300 people representing all social classes in an Irish town. The respondents were asked the question about different groups of people, such as the old, the poor, etc. including the unmarried mother and her child, as to whether they should be given help with conditions, without conditions or not at all. Eighty-seven per cent of those people replied that the unmarried mother who keeps her child should be given help without conditions.</P>
    <P>This is from the Public, the Client and the Social Services by Dermot Clifford M.S.C.</P>
    <P>This change in the attitude of the State is evident in the granting of the allowance to which he had already referred.  The statement on Family Law Reform published by the Council for Social Welfare which is a Committee of the Catholic Bishops' Conference is evidence of a more accepting attitude in the Church.</P>
    <P>He goes on in his Press release to quote the statement of the Council for Social Welfare which recommends a change which would, for the first time, reflect in our laws the constitutional principle that all persons are equal.  The particular quotation from the report of the Council for Social Welfare provides as follows:</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the rights of all children and that they shall be treated equally.  We regard it as unchristian that children born out of wedlock should, as a result of the actions of their parents, be victimised by legal distinctions between them and children born to married parents.  Consequently, we wish to urge that the legal disabilities imposed on these children should be removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> They then go on to make specific recommendations to that effect.</P>
    <P>I hope that Bishop Casey is right and that attitudes throughout Ireland are changing in relation to the welfare of the child being the right to equality in considering the future of that child, whether it be a future with adoptive parents or a future in remaining with the single mother.  If we enforced that basic principle and had the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration by removing all legal discrimination against that child and removing any social or economic discrimination, which might ensue, if the range of choice is exercised in relation to that child, then we would have gone a very significant step towards having a fair and balanced adoption law and procedure.</P>
    <P>The second principle in relation to adoption is that it can only work if it is based on a genuine choice.  At present far too many single mothers have been forced by economic and social pressures and without any real consent or desire on their part to hand their children over to be adopted.  Our society has been slow to help a young Irish girl faced with that particular problem.  During the pregnancy she has to cope with the very considerable difficulties and tensions, the problems of being pregnant and unmarried.  She has to think of the future of the child that will be born and what is best for that child.  In present circumstances she has probably resisted the temptation to go to England and have an abortion. So she has decided to have the child, and she is faced with the responsibility and choice as to the future of that child.  Of course we think of the single mother as the only party in the circumstances. But, as we know&mdash;at least at the present stage of things&mdash;it requires two parents for the child.  It would be unfair to leave out the unmarried father from the circumstances.</P>
    <P>In far too many cases the unmarried father has been the mystery man in Irish society.  We seem to have an increasing number of mothers but we do not seem to have a significant number of unmarried fathers.  They are the unknown quantity, the shirkers of responsibility, the children of our <Col N="1082" /> society in a pejorative sense.  They are the adults who never grew up; who are probably in many ways conditioned by the attitudes in their own family, particularly by the role of the mother in traditional Irish society.  They have not been educated and encouraged to face up to their responsibilities.  For the single fathers who do accept responsibility and acknowledge parenthood there may be the same sort of response to the situation as faces the single mother in thinking of the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The single mother gets very little assistance from our society.  There is no adequate counselling for a single mother in those circumstances. There are one or two minor exceptions to that, but on the whole there is no proper network of State agencies that the single mother can go to and know she can get the sort of counselling and support that she should be entitled to receive from our society.  I know that very much from <i>Cherish</i> the single mothers organisation, which on a voluntary basis fills a very significant gap in our social services in this respect.  The number of people coming to this organisation is evidence of the need for it.  Yet, as a voluntary body, it could not possibly cover all the demands made on it and it is not a replacement of a state involvement.  It has a role to play as a voluntary organisation but should be supported and paralleled by a proper service to the single mother, a proper service of counselling and help with her particular situation.  The tendency is to think that the single mother in those circumstances can go to an adoption society for advice, but the very fact of going to an adoption society is foreclosing the options.  An adoption society will be disposed to advise on adoption in almost all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Senator Aherne to an apparent quotation. I appear to have been quoted as having referred to adoption societies as factories.  I have not seen the particular newspaper from which she was quoting.  If in any way I <Col N="1083" /> suggested anything of that sort, it was only in the qualified sense that adoption societies are there to promote adoption of children, so they necessarily have that background consideration.  Even the most equitable, fair and responsible adoption society is there for the purposes of adoption and needs a turnover of babies who are going to be adopted.  That is the whole purpose of it.  I am very much in favour of a good and fair adoption system.  I commend the good adoption societies and the very good individuals concerned with adoption here; but an adoption society is not the place that a single mother should go to before she has made up her mind about what she wants to do with her child.  She should go to an agency where she will get a more balanced range of advice and support in coming to her decision and this she certainly does not get in Irish society.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the pregnant girl has to cope with an incredible range of reactions, even within herself.  She is a very vulnerable person because she is a woman in Irish society and, therefore, she starts off with considerable disadvantages if she is going to have a separate existence with responsibility for a dependant.  The sort of job that she can hope to get will be lower down the scale than her male opposite number.  She will have the problem of trying to provide economic support for the child and at the same time look after the child.  She will try to do this in a society where we have not yet sufficient support for working mothers the facility of creches and other support which would make this a reality.  There is also a very significant psychological problem for an Irish girl in those circumstances; that is the fact of being Irish, the mother of a child and unmarried.  It is a situation where the particular individual has all the disadvantages of being a single Irish girl trying to make her way in society.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if I am making any sense to a relatively empty male Seanad on this subject, whether it is possible to convey the subtle discriminations <Col N="1084" /> against the single girl in Ireland who wants to make an independent living, who wants to be an adult member of that society, who wants to take on the responsibilities of citizenship, just the simple, normal earning of a living, setting up a home. They are very considerable and very deep for a single Irish girl who wants to go it alone and avoid or break out of the strong conditioning.  This conditioning points to the norm: that her future is to have a job for a short while and then to get married and devote herself entirely to the home, her husband and children.  It is difficult for a single Irish girl to break out of that.  It is difficult for a single Irish girl to do the same things that are not at all difficult for her male counterpart&mdash;to acquire a home, be it a flat or a house or whatever it may be; to enter into mortgage arrangements; to set herself up in business and so on.</P>
    <P>If that single girl is pregnant, or if that single girl has a child to look after, then the difficulties become even more substantial.  I think that the first important process that the single mother has to go through is really a process of coming to terms with herself as a single girl in Ireland in these circumstances.  If she does come to terms with this and wants to keep her child with her, there is the gravest responsibility on our society to provide economic and social support and to remove any legal discriminations or disabilities that exist.</P>
    <P>This is something that has not been considered openly in the various pieces of legislation that we have considered recently.  Is it possible to conceive of a society that would deliberately disrupt a mother-and-baby relationship and take a child away from its natural mother in preference to leaving that child with its mother? I think it is a very fundamental question which we should pose for ourselves. There will be circumstances where a single mother will not want to keep her child, and will want to place her child out for adoption or fosterage; but if the single mother wants to keep her child, then what sort of society have we if that society <Col N="1085" /> does not facilitate, encourage and support the single mother in her choice about keeping the child?  Yet, that is something which has been considerably blurred and is not as clear as it might be in relation to the attitude of society towards a single mother, and indeed, in the attitude of the public towards adoption.  There has been a very considerable bias in favour of adoption which undermines the relationship of the single mother with her child, particularly the single mother who wants to keep her child.</P>
    <P>If the balance were better, if the welfare of the child were paramount, if the consent were a real one based on counselling, based on a genuine sense of choice, a genuine help with coming to terms with the psychological and other problems that the individual faces in those circumstances, there would undoubtedly be a drop in the number of children being offered for adoption.  But, also there would be a much better, fairer and balanced adoption procedure.  That is another aspect which our society has to face. There is, in this country, as there is in <Col N="1086" /> other countries, a queue for adoption. There are more prospective adoptive parents than there are children available for adoption.  Therefore, there is a certain pressure to keep up the level of the flow of children coming into adoption societies and becoming available for adoption.  It would be better for our society to envisage the possibility of fewer children becoming available for adoption in this country but of an adoption code where the paramount consideration was genuinely the welfare of the child and, secondly, where there was real consent based on a free and well-counselled choice by the single mother in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>A third principle of an adoption code would be that it should operate evenly and with high standards and strict controls throughout the country and in relation to all adoption societies.</P>
