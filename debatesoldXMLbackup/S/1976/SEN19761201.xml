      <P>This is a matter that should be debated in the House.  It has been there for a long time, as Senator Browne was just saying.  Apart from going into the merits and demerits, which I am not allowed to at the present time, I would certainly support him in having a specific date set aside for a debate on this issue, which is of very real social concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained on a number of occasions the position in relation to this, that when the Tánaiste is available it can be taken.  The Tánaiste is the Leader of the Party of which the proposer of the Bill is a member and of which Senator Browne is in some kind of loose association, and I suggest that they might discuss the matter with the Tánaiste if they want to get a date fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan has asked me to elaborate.  The point is raised by Senator Browne.  It is not a matter really for me to elaborate, but I have explained the position as regards the question of fixing a date.  Whenever the Tánaiste is <Col N="723" /> available to take the Bill it can be taken here.  It is a Private Members' Bill.  If any Members want to propose either a fixed date or that it be added to the Order of Business, obviously it is open to them to do it.  Subject to this&mdash;I think the Chair would correct me&mdash;in this House we deal with the Order of Business each day as it arises and I should imagine that, unless a proposal is made to add it if it has not been ordered, it would not be open to the House to fix a date sometime in the future for the taking of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say as a point of explanation that I am in the House in my capacity as an Independent Senator? I do not take and have not taken the Whip in the lifetime of this Dáil.  It has not been withdrawn from me, as has been said by a number of people.</P>
      <P>In regard to the reply of the Leader of the House, in deference to the Tánaiste it was agreed by this House to leave the matter until the Drug Abuse Inquiry where he was required to attend was completed.  That is now completed and therefore we believe&mdash;I believe certainly&mdash;that he should attend this House and deal with this long overdue reform in relation to family planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious that this Bill should not only be debated but passed.  I would suggest that perhaps Senator O'Higgins, as Leader of the House, would indicate to the Tánaiste that the Seanad would like to debate this Bill.  I think it is fair to say that the Members of the Oireachtas Labour Party will directly communicate to the Leader of the Labour Party our concern that the Bill should be debated.  This Bill, and indeed many other items, have been on the Order Paper for a very long time.  I regret the fact that we are only meeting now on 1st December to discuss business which this country badly needs.</P>

      <P>That is exactly my approach too.  If the Seanad is to be regarded as a serious assembly matters of this kind, which are lying there for a number of months, should be debated as expeditiously as possible, and perhaps the Leader of the House would indicate that to the Tánaiste.  This is one matter of major social importance and should be debated.  This is what democratic assembly is all about.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is simply to secure that, where a criminal court is sitting without a jury, the court shall have the same power to make any determination as if the court were sitting with a jury.  The Bill is therefore a technical one.</P>
      <P>The kind of determination chiefly involved is a verdict that the accused is guilty of an offence different from the offence specifically charged.  Verdicts have also sometimes to be given as to the sanity or insanity of the accused or&mdash;very occasionally&mdash;as to whether he has already been tried for the offence charged.  The Bill will apply to all these kinds of determinations; but as the first kind I have mentioned&mdash;that is to say, a verdict that the accused is guilty of a different offence&mdash;is the most important, I shall deal with it first.</P>
      <P>The powers under which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead of offence B are commonly referred to as the powers to give &ldquo;alternative verdicts&rdquo;, and they are a familiar feature of jury trials.  Some of the powers are common law ones, others are statutory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By common law a person charged on indictment with a felony may be convicted instead of a lesser felony whose ingredients are included in the felony charged and a person charged with a misdemeanour may be convicted of a <Col N="726" /> lesser misdemeanour included in the misdemeanour charged.  For example, a person charged with murder may be convicted instead of manslaughter and a person charged with robbery may be convicted instead of larceny.  This is because the allegation in the indictment that the accused committed murder necessarily implies an allegation of manslaughter and the allegation that he committed robbery necessarily implies an allegation of larceny.  The lesser offence is included in the greater; and if the accused is convicted of the lesser, this means that the jury were not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his conduct amounted to the offence specifically charged but were satisfied that it amounted to the lesser offence.</P>
    <P>In addition to the common law rule there are several statutory provisions by which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead of offence B. In some cases the reason for the statutory power is that, although the ingredients of the lesser offence are included in the offence charged, the offence charged is a felony and the lesser offence is a misdemeanour and, as I have said, the common law power applies only where both the offences in question are felonies or both are misdemeanours.</P>
    <P>Examples of statutory powers given for this reason are the power under section 5 of the Prevention of Offences Act, 1851, by which a person charged with the felony of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm may be convicted of the misdemeanour of unlawful wounding, and the general power under section 9 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1851, by which a person charged with committing an offence may be convicted of attempting to commit that offence.  The need for the latter provision is that, with few exceptions, an attempt to commit an offence is a misdemeanour even if the offence attempted is a felony.</P>
    <P>Besides this class of enactments there are several enactments by which a person charged with offence A may be convicted instead of offence B when, although the ingredients of offence B are not necessarily included in offence A, the two offences are by their definitions so closely related that it may be <Col N="727" /> difficult for the prosecution to foresee, in advance of the evidence, which is the appropriate offence to charge.  Examples are the provision in subsection (1) of section 44 of the Larceny Act, 1916, by which a person charged with robbery may be convicted instead of assault with intent to rob and the provisions in subsection (2) of the same section by which a person charged with embezzling property may be convicted instead of stealing it and a person charged with stealing property may be convicted of embezzling or fraudulently converting it.</P>
    <P>So much for the general rules as to alternative verdicts.  I come now to the particular reason for introducing this Bill.  It is that most of the statutory provisions allowing alternative verdicts are in terms of what &ldquo;the jury&rdquo; may do. This applies to all the statutory provisions that I have just instanced. Leaving on one side for the present summary trials, this method of drafting was appropriate for trials on indictment, because at the time when the enactments were passed these trials always took place with a jury.  But now unfortunately some cases have to be tried before the Special Criminal Court, which sits without a jury.  In the case of The People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. Rice a man was tried last year before the Special Criminal Court for robbery and was convicted of assault with intent to rob.  This was in reliance on the provision in section 44(1) of the Larceny Act, 1916, to which I have referred; but the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction on the ground that under that provision the power to convict of assault with intent to rob was exercisable by &ldquo;the jury&rdquo; and so was not available to the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>This situation is unsatisfactory, because the Special Criminal Court should clearly be able to give whatever alternative verdict a jury can give. Indeed before the Rice case this was thought to be the law.  The Bill seeks to remedy the situation by providing&mdash;to state the matter shortly&mdash;that a criminal court sitting without a jury may make any determination that could be made if it were a court sitting with a jury.  In particular, this will enable the court to <Col N="728" /> convict of an alternative offence in any case where a jury may do so.</P>
    <P>The main provision is in section 1 (1), which assimilates the powers of a criminal court sitting without a jury to those of a court sitting with a jury in the respect I have mentioned.  The subsection will apply not only to the Special Criminal Court but also to the District Court.  In general the powers of juries to bring in alternative verdicts are not exercisable by the District Court.  Therefore, if the District Court considers that the evidence shows that the accused should be convicted of a lesser offence than the offence specifically charged, a fresh information must be issued charging the lesser offence. There is an exception in the case of dangerous and careless driving.  By section 53 (4) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a person charged with dangerous driving may be convicted instead of careless driving, and this applies both to jury trials and trials in the District Court.  Now that the Bill proposes to ensure that the Special Criminal Court should have the same powers as juries to give alternative verdicts, it seems desirable that the powers should extend to the District Court.  This will simplify the law, even if the occasions for exercising the powers will be less frequent in the District Court.  Therefore subsection (1) gives the powers to any court sitting without a jury.  Paragraph (b) of the subsection is included in order to secure that the District Court shall have the necessary powers not only in the case of a summary trial of an indictable offence but also in the case of a trial for a purely summary offence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is purely procedural.  It ensures that, in any case where a person is charged with offence A and can be convicted instead of offence B, he can plead guilty to offence B.  The result, if the prosecution are willing to accept the plea of guilty and the court approves, is that the accused is convicted only of offence B and dealt with accordingly.  This is the procedure at present under section 39 (1) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914, in respect of trials on indictment, and subsection (2) will ensure that the procedure applies to all courts.  The subsection will cover all criminal trials <Col N="729" /> and will therefore supersede the provision in the 1914 Act, which subsection (4) repeals.</P>
    <P>So far I have referred mainly to the powers of convicting of alternative offences.  But I mentioned briefly at the beginning of my speech two other classes of issues which juries may have to determine in trials on indictment in the ordinary courts.  These are, first, issues in relation to the sanity or insanity of the accused and, second, the issue whether a person is exempt from trial on the ground that he has already been convicted or acquitted by a competent court of the offence charged. The second class of issues rarely arises and need not detain us.  The Bill will enable the court to decide the issue as a jury can.</P>
    <P>Issues as to the sanity or insanity of the accused are, however, important.  At present an issue of this kind may arise at three stages.  First, before the trial begins there may be a question whether the accused is so insane that he cannot be tried at all&mdash;that is to say, whether he is what is called &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo;. Second, a similar question may arise during the trial.  Third, the accused's defence may be that, although he may have committed the act in question, he was at the time insane so as not to be responsible in law for his action&mdash;that is to say, that the verdict should be &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;.  In all these cases the issue of sanity or insanity is determined by a jury&mdash;in the first two cases under section 17 of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act, 1821, and in the third under section 2 of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.</P>
    <P>In a case where the issue of fitness to plead arises before the trial a jury is specially formed to determine the issue. Under the Acts of 1821 and 1883, if the jury finds the accused insane, the court orders him to be detained until he is found fit to plead, or to be detained in a place suitable for a person who has been found guilty but insane, as the case may be.  The place in which he is detained is determined by order of the Minister for Justice.  Under subsection (1) of section 1 of the Bill the functions of a jury in deciding the issue of sanity will be exercisable by the Special Criminal Court in a case tried before that court.  But subsection (3) ensures <Col N="730" /> that the powers under the Acts mentioned shall not be exercisable by the District Court.  This is because the issue of the sanity of the accused does not arise in practice in that court&mdash;even in the higher courts it rarely arises except in cases of murder&mdash;and it would not, in the Government's opinion, be appropriate to include in the Bill a provision that would, in theory, empower the District Court to make an order involving the possibility that the accused would be detained indefinitely in the State mental hospital.  For this reason the Bill extends the powers of courts sitting with juries in these respects to the Special Criminal Court only.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill to give the Special Criminal Court the same powers as jury courts in cases of insanity has been criticised on the ground that issues as to insanity should be decided only by a jury.  I think this criticism must be owing to a misunderstanding. For in the nature of things the Special Criminal Court must decide whether the accused is insane if the question of his sanity in fact arises.  If the question is whether he is fit to plead, the court must consider the question before it can try him; and if it decides that he is unfit to plead, this means that it cannot try him. If the question is whether the accused was insane at the time when he committed the act in question so as not to be criminally responsible for his act, then again the court must consider this question; and if it decides that he was insane, it cannot convict him.</P>
    <P>The result, if the Special Criminal Court is not given the powers proposed, will be this: if the court considers that the accused is unfit to plead, it will have to release him; and if it considers that he did the act in question but was insane so as not to be responsible for it, it will have to find him simply &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; and, of course, to release him. Once this is understood I cannot see how it can be disputed that the Special Criminal Court must have power to order the detention of the accused in either case in the same way as if he had been found insane by a jury.  I might add that the Court of Criminal Appeal, which of course is also a non-jury court, has power, on an appeal against <Col N="731" /> conviction, to substitute a verdict of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is technical in many respects but, at the same time, there are certain points of principle involved.  In regard to the first aspect referred to by the Minister, the question of alternative verdicts, that is of course a commonsense proposal; it should apply to the Special Criminal Court and, in particular, to the District Court.  The jury situation confined to finding alternative verdicts, which has been there for some time in legislation, is of course outdated.  I welcome it in particular in regard to the District Court and the efficient functioning of it.  It is quite obvious that they should have this alternative verdict power.  It is there already under the Road Traffic Act and may be there under other legislation.  It is in ease of the accused in many cases that this should be so and that this alternative verdict avenue should be open to a judge without a jury in the District Court or Special Criminal Court at the lower or minimum offence level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister also on the <i>autrefois aequit</i> aspect.  That is not likely to be that important.  The only matter really on which I would like to take issue with the Minister and like to hear his views&mdash;and indeed he referred to it in the last page of his brief&mdash;is on the question of the insanity provisions proposed in the Bill, the unfitness to plead&mdash;during trial it does not arise often&mdash;mainly before the trial, and secondly, the plea during the course of defence that at the time of commission of the offence the accused was insane. The transference of that area to the Special Criminal Court raises some doubts.  The very fact that the Minister and the Government do not transfer that particular aspect to the District Court, as they do in the case of the alternative verdict area, is, I think in ease of the accused, and rightly so.  The Minister and the Government and his officials are obviously aware of the dangers in transferring this whole <Col N="732" /> insanity area to a district justice.  The Minister states quite plainly in his brief that it is not proposed&mdash;and it is not in the Bill&mdash;to transfer it to a district justice.  I would apply the same reasoning to transferring these particular powers to the Special Criminal Court. That is the only point on which I would like to take issue with the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are very sound reasons why the question of unfitness to plead or the question of insanity at the time of commission of an offence should be tried by a man's peers.  I take it that is the reasoning behind the Minister not transferring that matter to the District Court.  He is also aware of the problem involved in transferring it to the Special Criminal Court.  It is on this that I would take issue with him.  In broad principle I agree with many aspects of the Bill, but perhaps the Minister would look at the possibilities at a future date of having a medical assessor provision written into this by way of regulation or legislation.  It would be very desirable that the Special Criminal Court should have some independent medical assessor along with the actual court itself, and not just evidence alone.  I appreciate that the evidence can be given by prosecution and defence, but some sort of medical assessor giving independent evidence should be available to the Special Criminal Court in the absence of a jury in that type of situation.  I put that forward as a suggestion, not making a major issue of it.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on whether something of that kind could be incorporated either by way of regulation or legislation at a future date.</P>
    <P>In general principle, I go along with the Bill.  I just make these few reservations and in particular the reservation about the insanity issues being decided by the Special Criminal Court as such without a jury or without any medical assessor being available to the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate fully the reasons for the introduction of the Bill as regards both aspects of it, the alternative verdicts and the question of sanity.  I regard Senator Lenihan's approach to the question of the sanity issue as a constructive one and as one which I think the Minister might <Col N="733" /> consider generally in relation to this kind of legislation.  Certainly, I can see the reasons why the Bill is required so far as the Special Criminal Court is concerned, and I can see the kind of difficulties that would arise in a situation where, if the law was left unchanged, the Special Criminal Court would have no alternative in certain circumstances but to order the release of a person, perhaps whom they regard as dangerous, possibly dangerous on the grounds of mental health, for example.  If the law is allowed to stand unchanged that situation could arise.  The Minister has in the last page of his speech pointed out the dangers more clearly than I have made the case.  At the same time, most of us would feel that there is something abhorrent about allowing a situation where a person can&mdash;and the Minister has used the phrase himself in relation to the District Court&mdash;without a jury be detained indefinitely in a State mental hospital by reason of a decision given by judges sitting without a jury. That is the dilemma in which the Minister, in the first place, and the Legislature after him, find themselves in trying to deal with this situation. Some of the suggestions put up by Senator Lenihan show a constructive approach to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to stand out against the Bill at this stage, but I would like the Minister to assure us that he will continue to examine this question. Obviously the court must be empowered in some way to deal with the kind of situation I spoke of at the outset and that the Minister has referred to.  As things stand, they might have no option but to release a person whom they regard as insane and regard as being dangerous.  Nevertheless, it does seem to me that possibly machinery could be devised without making the thing too cumbersome, that, instead of having to make an order of release, on the one hand, or a finding of insanity, on the other, the Special Criminal Court would be empowered to make a temporary detention order pending the empanelling of a special jury to consider the matter after hearing medical evidence, something on those lines which would provide a safeguard.  I certainly do not want to go on record <Col N="734" /> as believing for a moment that the judges sitting in the Special Criminal Court would act in any arbitrary fashion or act without due regard to their own honest findings in these matters.</P>
    <P>However, as a legislator, I do see that a case can be put up when the law is being changed in this way when heretofore there was a requirement for a jury to adjudicate or to come to a decision on these matters.  I do think it reasonable to argue that some intermediate course might be devised whereby a safeguard such as the one Senator Lenihan or I have suggested might be written into the legislation.  I would like to think, putting it very briefly, that this is not the Minister's last word or last thought on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I accept that there is an anomalous position which the Minister proposes to try to remedy, but I would have reservations about the actual method chosen. I will come to the position regarding unfitness to plead, but first of all I would like to talk about the Bill itself.  It is entitled the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, 1976.  Its main purpose, however, is to extend the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>I think it is undesirable that we extend the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court by way of ordinary legislation which is intended to be permanently on our Statute Book so that in 80 years time it will still appear as Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Act, 1976. We cannot lose sight of the basic distinction: that the Special Criminal Court is an extraordinary and unusual court, a court which we have most reluctantly and with due precautions introduced at a time when there are the strains on our system, when there are the reasons necessitating its introduction. It is not an ordinary court.  It is an extraordinary, unusual and very regrettable court to have as part of our system.  We have to remind ourselves of the wording of Article 38.3 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>18 Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the <Col N="735" /> ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>2º The constitution, powers, jurisdiction and procedure of such special courts shall be prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred if the Minister had chosen to adopt a literal aproach to that constitutional provision, and literally&mdash;if he wished to extend the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court to cover an anomalous position and to provide for alternative verdicts&mdash; that he had done it by a Bill to amend the basic provision which establishes the Special Criminal Court, namely, the Offences Against the State Act of 1939.  It would have been better to amend section 43 of that Act relating to the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court, in order that there could be no possible construction that we are somehow bringing the Special Criminal Court into the mainstream of our administration of justice, that we envisage it as a permanent or long-term institution in our State.  I think that line cannot be drawn carefully enough, cannot be borne in mind explicitly enough, and is a very important fundamental principle.  Therefore, I would have preferred if the Special Criminal Court had been given the power to bring in an alternative verdict in a Bill entitled the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill.  The Minister could have come before us and made the same submissions about the anomalous position, referring to the case of the DPP v. Rice and to the need to extend in this specific way the particular jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court.  Consequently, when that part of the Offences Against the State Act comes to an end so would this extension of jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>In reply to the point I am making the Minister may say that this particular Bill, the Criminal Justice (Verdicts) Bill, proposes not only to cover the Special Criminal Court but also refers to the District Court.  This is not really a satisfactory answer.  First of all, I doubt whether it is necessary in <Col N="736" /> fact to introduce a statutory provision giving the District Court power to bring in alternative verdicts.  Persons charged before the District Court with a summary offence should know precisely the summary offence they are charged with.  I do not think there is a genuine problem here.  I have not heard of any case of difficulty arising in this instance.  Even if there is a difficulty the particular extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court should itself be done by a statutory amendment which makes it clear that this is an amendment of the jurisdiction of the District Court.  It should be done by a separate provision to the provision which extends the jurisdiction of the Special Court, which must in my submission be clearly and totally divorced from the normal administration of justice in our land, be regulated by a special statute called the Offences Against the State Act.  Any extension of that by a further amendment of the Offences Against the State Act should be regarded as separate and apart and for a limited period only, an exceptional jurisdiction, regretted by everybody in this country who regrets the reasons why we have to bring in non-jury courts to try criminal offences in this country. As soon as the situation comes about that we do not have to have special courts of this nature we should be able, by allowing a whole separate block of legislation to lapse, to end the operation of the Special Court in this country.</P>
    <P>On the question of giving the Special Criminal Court jurisdiction to find a person unfit to plead, I was very heartened by the contributions of Senator Lenihan and Senator O'Higgins.  I, too, would feel grave apprehension about extending this type of jurisdiction to the Special Criminal Court.  It is a very dangerous extension and I would query whether it is warranted, and whether this is the appropriate way to meet the particular problem outlined by the Minister in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the proposal of Senator O'Higgins because I had intended to suggest another possibility. That is, if a person proposed to raise a plea of unfitness to plead, of insanity on arraignment, that that person would <Col N="737" /> not come before the Special Court but would be directed to go before one of the ordinary courts so that a special jury could be empanelled and the necessary medical evidence could be obtained and so on.  This would not arise in very many circumstances, but it is a very important principle that the assessment of whether a person is fit to stand trial be an assessment by a jury.</P>
    <P>Also it is important to bear in mind&mdash; and it has not been mentioned in the debate so far&mdash;that the jury which tries the issue of insanity on arraignment, whether a person is unfit to plead, is then discharged and does not go on to be the jury of the trial of that person if he goes forward for trial.  It is important that a person should not have the same jury trying the issue on the merits once that jury has decided that a person is fit to plead.  However it will be the same special court that will try the issue on the merits if that court decides that somebody is fit to plead.  There is that aspect as well.</P>
    <P>In the light of the comments made here today I would ask the Minister to consider the implications of conferring this type of jurisdiction on the Special Criminal Court and whether he could meet the particular problem another way.</P>
    <P>This is a grey area in our law where a person can be found unfit to plead and detained indefinitely, detained until subsequently he may become fit to plead.  There seems to be an implication in that, an implication of permanency in the Special Court itself, because it would be that court which would decide that the particular accused was unfit to plead and that the accused should be detained until he had become fit to plead.  As I understand it, the normal system would be that the person would come back before that court again.  Is it envisaged that the person found unfit to plead by the Special Court has the possibility of coming back again before the Special Court?  Is that not in itself an indirect admission of permanency in the Special Court, an indirect admission that it is part of the permanent court structure in our country rather than an exceptional measure which must be terminated at the first possible opportunity? Again, I think that it is undesirable <Col N="738" /> for the accused person to risk being detained indefinitely by a Special Court.  It certainly is a different adjudication on the issue of fitness to plead than adjudication by a jury and it is an undesirable extension of jurisdiction by the Special Court for these reasons.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill before us proposes among other things to extend the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court, I would like to seek some information from the Minister about the degree to which the operation of the Special Criminal Court is monitored by the Department of Justice.  I would like to know whether it is possible to obtain fuller information on the working of the court; on the parties that come before the court; on charges; on the length of time between when the person is charged before the Special Court and when that person will come for trial; and much fuller information generally than is available from the Department of Justice when somebody seeks statistics and information about the Special Criminal Court.  On the last occasion on which I expressly sought this information from the Department of Justice I got immediate assistance from the particular officials I approached.  But all the actual information I could get was a sort of statistical sheet updated to 31st July, 1976, giving a list of the types of offence, the number of persons convicted and the pattern of sentences before the Special Criminal Court.  The total up to the 31st July, 1976, was 772 persons convicted and 270 acquitted&mdash; in all 1,042 people dealt with by the Special Criminal Court in this way.</P>
    <P>I maintain that if we must allow the existence of an extraordinary court, a &ldquo;non-ordinary&rdquo; court which can convict and sentence people for very serious offences, without a jury, that we must as a democratic country very carefully monitor it at the official level, and provide very full information on the operation of the Special Criminal Court. It would be appropriate for the Minister to ensure that this type of study and overall control of the court is going on. I do not mean control over how the judges are operating but control over the way in which the court functions; ensuring that the cases are brought on in proper time; that the book of evidence is served in adequate time; <Col N="739" /> that there is adequate opportunity for legal advisers to consult with their clients.  Whatever the stresses, and I do understand the stresses and strains of the security problem&mdash;I think the reality of the security problem was evident from the blowing up of part of the court itself in recent months&mdash;I think the major burden on a democratic state is to provide the adequate information and careful monitoring of the operation of that court.</P>
    <P>When we have a situation that in the last few years more than 1,000 people have been tried before it, then we should review carefully the operation of the Special Court.  We should do this publicly and courageously, and not be afraid to have full public assessment of the operation of the court.  In particular, we should always maintain an approach towards it that it is not part of the normal administration of justice; that it is not a court that we want to set up except with the greatest reluctance and under the sort of pressure that we are under in this State at the moment; that it will be our intention as a country to terminate it at the first available opportunity, so that, while the Government are of the opinion that it is necessary under Article 38 of the Constitution and have invoked that part of the Offences Against the State Act to establish it, it is not tolerated casually by our society but is deeply regretted, and that very careful monitoring is maintained over it.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I repeat my regret that this Bill, which the Minister has described as a technical measure, which in many ways does correct a technical anomaly in the earlier position, could have this undesirable implication of regarding the Special Court as only one of the criminal courts administering justice in this State, so that it is normal to provide for extending the jurisdication of that court and the District Court and any other court in the same Bill, in the same permanent part of legislation. This could have the effect of cementing into our system a different sort of recognition of the Special Criminal Court that the Constitution itself allows, because the Constitution makes it clear that the Special Court is only to be <Col N="740" /> established where the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure effective administration of justice and that the jurisdiction and procedure of such Special Courts should be &ldquo;prescribed by law&rdquo;. I would submit that the spirit of that section means it should be done by different law, by special law, by exceptional law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that most people are agreed that there is a need in a limited sense, for the provisions of the Bill, that is, the extension of jurisdiction arising out of the Rice case. However, the Minister will have to forgive many of us for being chary about accepting without very critical examination anything that he brings before us now.  It seems to have been his unfortunate job in the Government to continue to restrict the right of individuals and citizens, always under the same plea that this is necessary in the interests of the preservation of the security of the State.  The fears everybody expresses arise from the fact that the power refers to the Special Criminal Court, established under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, the fact that this court is a court which is not surrounded by the safeguards which we have come to expect from our judicial system since the State was formed.  Any attenuation of the protection that the citizen had have always been justified on grounds of the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sitting without a jury and hearing these very difficult and tragic cases, as most of them are for the youngsters involved, is obviously not an ideal judicial system, because if it were we would not have the jury system.  Where we have a court of this kind which does not really meet what would be the requirements for an ideal or perfect judicial system, then, when we grant any power to the Minister to extend that particular court's powers, it must be scrutinised with very special care. Whatever one may say about the quality of mercy or the quality of understanding or the level of understanding of the judges involved in the Special Court, at least they have a special training and a special knowledge and a lot of experience, and one mus assume that they do their best under the very difficult <Col N="741" /> circumstances of their distasteful job. Nevertheless I think it has been noted that it is possible under this same Act to substitute for the judges a court of three Army officers, three laymen, with as much experience or knowledge of the law as I have, which is little or none in the technical sense.  This has happened before the establishment of that court in which three military men became the judges.  Without impugning their personal integrity, quite obviously they were put in an invidious position in their attempts to arbitrate on difficult issues, some of them amounting to the death penalty or long terms of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It seems that this is the part of it which must be most closely watched, because unfortunately the general impression, in spite of the effects of the peace movement, is that we are still in a perilous state in relation to the Northern problem.  Therefore, one must envisage that whatever powers are given we are anticipating that they could be used by a lay court of military officers.  That being so, it seems that one cannot accept the Minister's plea&mdash;is a valid one to a limited extent&mdash;that the person who, for instance, pleaded guilty but insane must be released under the present law.  Obviously there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for giving the court the right to go on from there.  That is the argument being put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I see a number of dangers.  One that appeals to me especially as a psychiatrist is this question of the ability to plead and the guilty but insane verdict.  This brings in the whole question of the MacNaughton Rules, their interpretation and so on.  I am sure the Minister knows as well as I do, and probably better, how absurd this whole medico-legal paraphernalia is and how badly it needs to be dealt with in order to try to rationalise the behaviours of the courts and the medical profession in these terribly difficult questions.  I am not doubting that for a moment.  At the same time, where it is before a judge and a jury, at least we are protected from ourselves.  The jury protects us from both the weaknesses of the judge and the members of the psychiatric profession. Speaking as a psychiatrist, there should be supervision over our arrogance in <Col N="742" /> deciding that somebody is unfit to plead or is guilty but insane.  I have never really felt that these things could be put down in such simplistic terms. We must all know that there is an enormous amount of doubt in the courts surrounding this whole question.</P>
    <P>We are including under this Bill the possibility that a military court will be faced with attempting to assess the evidence put forward to them, presumably by the psychiatric profession, without the protection of a jury and without the experience of a presiding judge in the ordinary sense.  That seems to be a very dangerous concession to make to the Minister.  I have to say it in the context of the reality that, if the decision rests with psychiatrists, and it must do&mdash;the three laymen know little or less than psychiatrists do about the MacNaughton Rules or their interpretation, and I would not care to attempt to interpret them except in the very broadest way&mdash;clearly one is thrown back on the psychiatrist as the final arbiter on these very serious issues.  We must all know of the conflict in the world in terms of the new development of imprisoning one's political opponents with the help of the members of the medical profession, psychiatrists in particular.  One would not dream of saying that kind of thing or making that charge were it not for the fact that a very great part of the time of this House has been taken up by those of us who do not share the Minister's present attitude to these things attempting to defend any verbal encroachment on the civil liberties of individuals from the demands of the Executive.  The Minister told us of a threatened Judiciary, a series of assassinations and so on.  As the Minister said, events would demand a military court.  Then this enormous power is put at the disposal of three laymen advised by members of the psychiatric profession.  In the broadest sense, you all know that this power is abused on both sides of the Atlantic.  In the United States somebody like Ezra Pound is put into a lunatic asylum.  In the Soviet Union, various people, dissidents of one kind or another, are put into asylums&mdash;this is the word for them; &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; is the present Minister's word for them.  Whatever <Col N="743" /> word is used, both sides find that after a certain point, where they simply cannot just lock people up under their laws, it could be useful for them to have yet one more power, a respected power, rightly or wrongly, within the community. That is the power of the medical people, psychiatrists in particular.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of the profession, we are the last people to trust with power of this kind, not because of any lack of integrity or honesty, or attempt to be utterly fair and just, but simply because there are so many divisions between us as to what is right, what is wrong, what is fair, what is unfair.  For instance, if I were called before these people I would plead the case I have often made here of the influence of education on youngsters and their effective innocence in certain respects.  I would plead, that all crimes are crimes of society.  I would plead that all the people in our jails are political prisoners. This happens to be my particular philosophy.  One would then get the complete antithesis of all the genuinely held views and the sincerely held beliefs. Are these the right people to whom we should entrust the powers under the Lunatics (Ireland) Act, 1821?  The Long Title of the Act reads:</P>
    <P>An Act to make more effectual provision for the establishment of asylums for the lunatic poor and for the custody of insame persons charged with offences in Ireland.</P>
    <P>They may be kept in custody, taken care of at the pleasure of the Lord Lieutenant and so on.  Who is that now? The President or the Government?  I do not know.  It is the effective right to imprison for life, if we decide so.  If I was hostile to the point of view expressed before the courts I could advise the people concerned that the person was unfit to plead and should be held indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I am not theorising.  This is possible where one sees the development of a kind of hysteria.  We have emotive words used about people like this.  In the Soviet Union they are &ldquo;hooligans&rdquo;; here they become &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo; and feeling is built up against them.  Psychologists and psychiatrists have been involved <Col N="744" /> in devising the terrible torture of sensory deprivation which breaks people completely.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, we are giving considerable powers other than those stated on the face of it&mdash;the power to extend jurisdiction, which I concede is needed but which should be protected in respect of the Special Criminal Court.  The main case I am making is that there must be alternative devices as suggested by the Leader of the House and Senators Robinson and Lenihan.  This would be all right if the Minister were asking for powers, for instance, in the District Court, which we all know and respect and for which there are so many protections. But in this case there is the great danger that wittingly or not&mdash;I suspect it is offensive to tell an intelligent person that he is unwitting in doing something wrong; the Minister must know what he is doing&mdash;the Minister is asking for powers which should not be given to him in the context of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, under which the Special Court was established and on which it is possible to do the switch-job of changing the reputable members of the Judiciary who may be supervising the court with three well-meaning but inevitable defenders of the Establishment.  That is their brief, their function, and what they are paid for. On top of that there is the total innocence of the real implications of what they are doing when they would accept a case of unfitness to plead in court.  While most people are prepared to give the Minister the simple power he is asking for in relation to the extension of jurisdiction, there must be some other way in which it is possible to restrict that power in respect of these situations particularly where there is unlimited extended custody under the &ldquo;unfit to plead&rdquo; appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could not be expected in the present circumstances, following the decision of the Special Criminal Court, to do anything other than to introduce this Bill to deal with the question of alternative offence.  While it might be, as Senator Robinson said, desirable that there be some set of Acts where all the provisions <Col N="745" /> relative to the Special Criminal Court could be found, what is most desirable may not be practicable to achieve, particularly when the Minister has taken the step of simplifying the whole question by extending the power to the District Court.</P>
      <P>I am not a criminal lawyer but I should have thought that the anomaly referred to is the distinction between the treatment of felonies and misdemeanours. On the latter point, I share the unhappiness which has been expressed by Senators who have spoken, although we must place it in the perspective of the situation in which the Special Criminal Court operates and why it operates.  It operates because juries, at this time, for reasons well known to everyone, cannot cope with the type of offences which are dealt with by the Special Criminal Court.  If they cannot deal with that type of offence I do not see how they can deal with any of the problems attendant on them.  I am extremely unhappy with the idea of an indefinite detention, whether it arises by virtue of the Special Criminal Court's decision or by virtue of anybody else's decision, notwithstanding all Senator Browne has said in the light of greatly increased knowledge of psychological conditions.</P>
      <P>I am not sure how juries operate in relation to lunacy matters, whether they operate satisfactorily.  I do not know how many people have been found insane by juries established under the Lunacy Act.  I would be surprised if there has been one in a number of years. I am not opposing this Bill, because it is a situation which has to be dealt with. However, I think the Minister ought to explore the suggestion of Senator Lenihan, supported by other Senators, of devising some machinery to prevent abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not quite sufficient&mdash;I think Senator Browne is right in this&mdash;to say, as we probably all would, that the personnel of the Special Criminal Court have our entire confidence as human beings.  The solid fact of the matter, not being distracted by Ezra Pound or by comparing the dissidents in Russia with the people who are being brought before the Special Criminal Court, remains that psychiatrists have been used in <Col N="746" /> Russia and in the eastern world generally as a method of political punishment. We do not want to have on our Statute Book anything that appears to tolerate or to permit such methods in any circumstances which may arise in the future, when other people may be there, not merely different Ministers but, as Senator Browne said, perhaps people without even judical training not alone psychological knowledge.</P>
    <P>This whole area irrespective of the Special Criminal Court, is worthy of an examination to see how it could be improved.  This might be the sort of matter the Law Reform Commission will deal with: this whole question of the relationship of psychological condition to guilt, the whole question of what happens when a crime is being committed.  What is the treatment for a person who is not really guilty if he was insane when he committed the offence? What ought to be the method&mdash;adoptting Senator Robinson's words&mdash;of monitoring this position to prevent a situation of neglect arising or of any kind of abuse?  I would support the Bill, with this expressed unhappiness on this aspect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept much of what is in this Bill.  There is a good deal of common sense in it.  There is a good deal in it which will merely make for administrative convenience and I have often opposed parts of Bills which were there for administrative convenience when that seemed to be the only purpose of the section or the amendment and when the fact that it would interfere with the right or liberty of the citizen seemed to be ignored.  But where you can introduce into a Bill something that is for administrative convenience and which at the same time does not in any way impinge on the citizen, then I am all in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have the situation which the Minister mentioned in his speech where a person is charged in the District Court with a major offence and where the evidence shows that in fact he is not guilty of that but he is almost certainly guilty of some lesser offence.  It seems to me quite undesirable that the State should have to issue fresh proceedings &mdash;undesirable from the point of view <Col N="747" /> of the State and indeed undesirable from the point of view of the accused, because certainly the accused, I am sure, would prefer to have whatever charge or whatever charges were being brought against him disposed of on one day rather than to have to come before the court on two different occasions.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill makes for administrative convenience and in so far as that can be done without impinging in any way on the rights or liberties of the citizen, then I think the portion of the Bill that does that is a good thing.  Generally speaking, I think, not only in the District Court but elsewhere, where the court can find somebody not guilty of a major offence but guilty of a minor one, this is nearly always in ease of the accused, because by and large juries are inclined to compromise if they have any doubt and are inclined to compromise by finding the person guilty of the lesser offence rather than the major one.</P>
    <P>I suppose the most frequent example of this is in case of driving offences where people are charged with the offence of dangerous driving and where in many cases the end result is that they are found not guilty of dangerous driving but guilty of careless driving. Generally speaking, the provisions of this Bill will in fact be in ease of the accused person, and Senator Robinson, in talking about the extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court, was, I think, using the terms in a way which is not quite justified.  It does not seem to me to extend the jurisdiction of the District Court where you merely allow the court to take two possible offences into consideration, a major one and a minor one, and to find the person guilty of the minor one if the major one is not justified.  It is not a question of giving the District Court any new jurisdiction over an offence with which they were not already capable of dealing.  To refer to that as extension of jurisdiction is, I think, hardly justified.  Certainly, it is not an undesirable extension of jurisdiction, if it can be called that at all.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have expressed unease with regard to the question of insanity. I certainly share that unease.  To give <Col N="748" /> this power to the Special Criminal Court must make us think seriously about whether it can be avoided.  We are slow to give this power because the Special Criminal Court is a court about which we have reservations.  It is not a jury court and we are concerned with the composition of it.  We are concerned that the Special Criminal Court is there at all.  It is an undesirable court, but most people feel that in the present context it is necessary.  In these circumstances we are talking about whether we can or should give the court the power of deciding the fitness of an accused person to plead in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Again, if we could find a means of having this question decided in a case which is before the Special Criminal Court without leaving the decision to the Special Criminal Court, then that way should be adopted.  But it seems that it would be almost impossible to devise a means of doing this because if one removes this decision from the Special Criminal Court the possibility, indeed the probability, is that the Special Criminal Court will be undermined because this issue would constantly arise.  It would arise in cases where it would not be justified at all.  The case would have to be removed from the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court to have this issue decided and, in fact, we would be back in the position of having something coming before a jury.  The probability of the jury being intimidated would arise and the whole purpose of the Special Criminal Court could be avoided in this way.</P>
    <P>While I certainly share the unease about the situation, if one is convinced that in present circumstances the Special Criminal Court is necessary, then I cannot see any way of dealing with the situation which would get around the problem about which so many speakers have expressed misgivings.  Apart from the Special Criminal Court the question of pleas of insanity and so on is something which needs very comprehensive review.  It needs review in all the situations in courts which arise at present and I hope the Minister will in the near future give attention to a comprehensive review of the question of insanity in <Col N="749" /> the light of modern day psychiatric approaches and techniques.  Obviously, this is not the Bill to introduce amendments to deal with this because it is a very comprehensive matter and one which needs a good deal of study, debate and discussion when it comes before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  One could talk at great length about this problem but this would not be the Bill to do it.  However, I hope the Minister has plans for a Bill in which it will be comprehensively dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The views expressed in the debate fell under two broad heads, in relation to the question of alternative verdicts and then in relation to the question of findings on insanity.  Both of these two themes are linked more or less by reference to the Special Criminal Court. Many Senators also touched on the question of the law of insanity and, as Senator Ryan so pertinently pointed out, this is an immense question with many legal, medical and social complexities about it.  It seems to have been overlooked that my predecessor took action in this regard when on 24th January, 1972, he set up an informal inter-departmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons.  I should like to read to the House the terms of reference of that committee:</P>
      <P>To examine and report on the provisions, legislative, administrative and otherwise, which the committee considers to be necessary or desirable in relation to persons, including drug abusers, psychopaths and emotionally disturbed and maladjusted children and adolescents, who have come or appear likely to come in conflict with law and who may be in need of psychiatric treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that they are very wide terms of reference and would permit a study of the various matters that have been touched on in the course of this debate.  That committee has a distinguished judge of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Henchy, as its chairman, and has many distinguished people in its personnel, people representing the various disciplines interested in examining and reporting on those terms of reference.  It has published <Col N="750" /> two interim reports and they are to be obtained in the Stationery Office and were published in July last year.  I regret that the committee's existence does not appear to be more widely known.</P>
    <P>The problem with which that committee is faced is one of immense complexity. It has been meeting regularly since it was set up and I am hopeful that, eventually, it will report in a manner that will enable some of the matters referred to here to be satisfactorily dealt with.  I am sure Senators will agree with me that the terms of reference of that committee embrace the whole field of insanity in relation to the law.  I have no doubt, too, that one of the matters with which it will have to concern itself will be the MacNaughton Rules and their modern application.  I am hopeful that this committee will bring in a very valuable report in due course.  I am not in a position to say when it is likely to report because, as I have already indicated, the complexities of that subject are enormous; but I have every confidence in the committee because of the distinguished nature of its personnel and its terms of reference that it will bring solutions before us for many of these problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan and Senator O'Higgins, on the question of insanity, suggested that the idea of a medical assessor might be a useful safeguard in cases where not merely the Special Criminal Court but also&mdash;I think&mdash;the ordinary courts would be dealing with these issues: either the preliminary issue of fitness to plead or the substantive defence of insanity at the time of the commission of the offence.  I can see some merits in that suggestion but, when one looks on it, it also has defects. The court at the moment has medical evidence adduced to it by the prosecution and/or the defence and the court is free to seek, apart from that medical evidence, all the assistance it needs.  I wonder is it desirable to introduce a second or a third medical presence sitting with the court, possibly cross-examining professional colleagues and then going into secret conclave with the court to assess that professional evidence. I do not know that this would be a desirable state of affairs.  I would be <Col N="751" /> inclined to think that it would be more desirable that the court consisting of&mdash; one has to assume&mdash;people of intelligence and common sense would hear the professional assessment and then make its own assessment on foot of that.  Again, this is to open a debate on matters which come directly within the terms of reference of the Henchy Committee and I do not think this would be a desirable thing to do.  Several Senators raised the theme of the danger of indefinite detention following a finding of unfitness to plead or a finding of guilty but insane. Senator Browne raised it in the sinister context in which psychiatrists are abused in Russia and this a ploy to deprive people of their liberty for political reasons.  Other Senators were wondering would a person just be forgotten about.  Senator Robinson raised the point, what would happen if the Special Criminal Court was disestablished and a person was still in detention following a finding of unfitness to plead?  All Senators who made those points overlooked the active and strong presence within our code of law of the principle of <i>habeas corpus,</i> and relief under <i>habeas corpus</i> would be available to any person who felt he was being detained unnecessarily and felt his case should come before the courts for review.  That is the short answer to those objections and worries.  As the courts have so frequently demonstrated, this is a remedy available to any citizen in the most informal way.  The courts will fully investigate any matter touching the liberty of an individual.  This is the answer to anyone who might suggest that this could be some sort of a back door internment, or some sort of an Executive imprisonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this in the context of the argument that, where a person has been found unfit to plead and has been detained, he could be forgotten about and be left there indefinitely or could be kept there and not allowed to see the light of day, so to speak.  The answer to that charge is <Col N="752" /> that <i>habeas corpus</i> is available.  When the court comes to consider whether continued detention is lawful or not, the court will have to consider the facts of the case and will have to be guided by professional evidence from psychiatrists. I will not give my opinion of that particular medical discipline.  Senator Browne has given a very jaundiced view of it.  I am not going to say whether I agree or disagree with him.  I am sure that, like everything else in this world, it resembles curate's eggs.</P>
      <P>In the absence of anything else I do not know what other evidence the court could look for in deciding whether such a person should be continued in detention, whether the insanity has come to an end, or what the general medical prognosis, or medical position relating to the person is at that time.  Whether Senator Browne likes it or not, the courts, and the rest of us, must depend on psychiatrists to guide us in these areas.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that we have no other choice, but that is the way the world is made and there is not a thing we can do about that at this stage.  I dread to think what kind of discipline would be substituted for that of psychiatry in examining in this particular area.  Perhaps the cure in that regard might be a lot worse than the present desease which Senator Browne speaks of in that scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I want to take issue with Senator Browne, when he made this point, that this is something which&mdash; I should say, unwittingly&mdash;smears are made of.  He said that in my vocabulary subversive equals dissident.  In making his point, he said that in Russia dissidents are imprisoned on phoney psychiatric evidence and he was worried that my version of dissidents&mdash;as subversives&mdash;might find the same thing happening to themselves.  I want to reject the implication in that.  I support the right of any citizen to dissent but I do not support the right of any citizen to subvert the democracy of this State. To equate subversion with dissident is altogether false.  I never do so.  When I speak of subversives I do not mean dissenting people; I mean people who are determined to subvert and destroy the democratic institutions of this <Col N="753" /> state.  I make no apology for taking a strong line against them in the knowledge that in taking such a line I have the support of the Irish people.  I want to put clearly on the record that I do not equate subversion with dissent, as Senator Browne tended to suggest I do.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson was worried that the giving of these powers to the Special Criminal Court would somehow institutionalise or make permanent that court.  Underlying her references to the court was the implication that somehow it is a less worthy court than other courts, that there is something of the Star Chamber about it, that it is something at which we have to look with great caution and, perhaps, a little fear.  She says it has within it implications&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>And we give them powers most reluctantly and in a very limited way.  Senator Robinson was overlooking the central fact to which Senators Alexis FitzGerald and Eoin Ryan referred, that the Special Criminal Court has had to come into operation because of the danger to jurymen.  The Senator also overlooked the fact that the Special Criminal Court is one of the courts of our land, one of our constitutional institutions, one of the institutions of our democracy, to serve a special need at a special time.  To suggest that it must be looked at very carefully and in a somewhat different light from the other courts is to do a disservice to the Special Criminal Court and to the people who sit on it.  I want to defend the Special Criminal Court from the implications that may be made about it in suggesting that it is somehow less judicial than other courts, that the <Col N="754" /> law and justice administered there are different or less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Special Criminal Court is a full court in the meaning of that word, as we know it in our democracy, and that it has been staffed by judicial people of the highest integrity, very conscious of their role as judges in our legal system. I am satisfied that no citizen's rights have been abused in that court; that it is in all senses of the word a judicial court, on all fours and exactly the same as the other criminal courts of our land, with the exception that it does not have a jury for the very good reason that we have, within our society, subversives&mdash; and I use the word in the proper meaning of that term&mdash;who would be prepared to intimidate and terrorise jurymen from doing their duty.  So long as we have that situation the Special Criminal Court is completely justified.</P>
      <P>The powers proposed in the Bill for the Special Criminal Court with regard to findings in relation to insanity were criticised in that these are matters which should be left to a jury and that when such a question is raised in a case coming before the Special Criminal Court it should be transferred and a special jury empanelled.  Senators FitzGerald and Eoin Ryan put the finger on the fallacy underlying that particular argument because the same constraints that had to lead to the suspending of the juries would apply in exactly those situations too.  Senator Ryan said that to take this power away from the Special Criminal Court would undermine it and that the use of pleas of insanity would become a ploy to get cases away from the Special Criminal Court and before a jury where all the difficulties and dangers would again ensue.  We still have the rule of unanimity in criminal trials, so all that would be necessary for a determined person with subversive associates who would not be above intimidating or terrorising juries would be to intimidate one juryman and the whole effectiveness of the jury system would be set at zero; it would be completely undermined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> The reasons which led to the setting up of the Special Criminal Court in the first instance&mdash;the fear of juries being intimidated and terrorised&mdash;apply equally to this question of the issues of insanity&mdash;findings of unfitness to plead or findings of insanity at the time of the offence.  Unless we had the powers in the Bill for the Special Criminal Court, the court would have to let the people concerned go free.  If we did not have the powers here, but reserved them for jury courts, the danger and prospect of intimidation would loom as large as ever with the same result.</P>
    <P>I feel no sense of inhibition in giving to the Special Criminal Court the clarification of their powers as contained in this Bill.  I have complete trust in the integrity of that court and in the persons composing it.  I am completely satisfied that it acts entirely in a judicial way and this is well known and recognised among persons who have had occasion to practise in that court.  There have been no complaints about its methods or standards of procedure.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked to what degree the Special Criminal Court has been monitored by the Department of Justice.  It is not being monitored to any degree because it is not the business of the Department of Justice to monitor any court in our land.  It would be improper and unconstitutional for it to attempt to do so.  On the question of keeping statistics: there are certain statistics kept and they are available to any person who is interested in acquiring them.  I reject completely any suggestion of attempting to control the court.  I have a quotation here from Senator Robinson&mdash;maybe I have it written down wrongly&mdash;in the context of monitoring the court by the Department of Justice.  The quotation is: &ldquo;Overt control of how the court functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I qualified that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Senator does not mean that I or my Department should have any control over how the court functions.  Certainly, we would keep statistics and the extent and numbers of these statistics would be a matter <Col N="756" /> of what would be determined to be administratively necessary for purpose of record and for purposes of administration of the courts generally.  These statistics would be available to interested persons.  As to whether to keep statistics of the depth and complexity the Senator seems to suggest, I do not think the administrative time necessary would justify them.  I see the danger that, in the absence of these, people who are interested in this court might be tempted to make assessments of it on, for example, the basis of newspaper reports which are necessarily abbreviated and when not every case is reported. Assessments made on the basis of newspaper reports must necessarily be invalid. I am afraid we would have to await a full set of statistics before we could have such a study of the Special Court as suggested.  Quite frankly I do not know that it would ever be justified in terms of the time in my Department to keep the voluminous statistics and information that would be necessary in that regard.</P>
      <P>The giving of these powers does not tend to make the Special Criminal Court permanent or to institutionalise it.  The Special Criminal Court will end when it is disestablished and that will happen when the security situation permits.  Irrespective of what powers the court might have when that happy day comes, whether they are given under this Act or under an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, will be quite irrelevant.  The length of life of that court does not depend on the powers or the jurisdiction given to it from time to time, it depends on the security situation pertaining at any particular time.  It is fallacious to suggest that giving extra powers like this tends to make the Special Criminal Court more permanent or tends to institutionalise it.  It is part of the courts of our land and I make no apology for saying that because that is a fact.  It is regrettable that it has to be without a jury but that is not a reflection on the court.  That regret is connected with the security situation which makes it necessary.  It is no reflection on the court or on the eminent persons who compose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Browne made the point&mdash;it was also raised in the other House&mdash;<Col N="757" /> that these powers could be drastic powers should the Special Criminal Court ever come to be composed of Army officers.  I agree that there would be some unease in the event of the Special Court having to be composed of Army officers, but the unease, I suggest to the House, would not be directed against the Army officers but to the situation that would be existing in the country that gave rise to it. Senator Browne indicated the sort of circumstances in which that would arise and, of course, such circumstances would be quite horrifying and would be in a very serious situation.  I share his hopes that this will not happen, but should that situation happen and should that court have to be composed of Army officers, then the jurisdiction which the court would have would be precisely the same jurisdiction as it now has.  It would still be a criminal court of the land.  It would be served by Army officers.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Browne as to how they would see their role.  He would see them as paid figures of the Establishment to do the Establishment's bidding.  I would not agree with him in that regard.  I take the view that such people would be cognisant of their role in a judicial capacity and that in exercising that role they would give proper and due consideration to their duty as people acting in a judicial capacity.  It would be an unwarranted reflection to assume that they would act purely, and see themselves having to act, as representatives of the Establishment to determine a matter in a particular way.  Again, too, he raised the question of how they would be qualified to deal with any legal matters arising out of the question of pleas of insanity.  Of course, the same problem would arise if there were a jury, because the juries would also be laymen in the legal sense.  They would have to make an assessment on the evidence coming before them of psychiatrists.  I do not think the presence of Army officers would compound what would be a difficult situation anyway in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne made a statement about all crimes being crimes of society. This, of course, is a point of view.  It is an unnecessarily one-sided point of <Col N="758" /> view and totally overlooks what is now the old-fashioned concept of individual responsibility.  If the viewpoint that all crimes are crimes of society and that nobody is responsible were to become widely held, it could very shortly lead to chaos and anarchy.  We must realise that individual responsibility is always present, irrespective of how it may have been blurred by a person's environment or a person's history.  These would be contributory factors in weighing up how much responsibility a particular individual should have exercised.  The kernel of criminal liability must be individual responsibility.  All other matters are extraneous and would be merely of relevance to the court in deciding how he exercises that responsibility. That question is to be judged in the context of that crime and in respect of the punishment to be awarded for it.</P>
    <P>These powers&mdash;the alternative verdict powers&mdash;are needed for the Special Criminal Court in order to give it full jurisdiction as a criminal court, which is what it is.  In order to be like the other criminal courts in the land it needs these powers.  It needs them in order to uphold that principle.  It also needs them for the very practical reason I set out in my speech in opening this debate. These powers are also needed in the District Court because the District Court should have power to make alternative findings in appropriate cases. It is not a power that will fall to be exercised very frequently in the District Court, but nevertheless it is a power that must be there so that when it does come to be exercised the court may do so.</P>
    <P>The question of deciding pleas in relation to sanity must also be given to the Special Court so that it can be on all fours with the other criminal courts in our land.  Again it is necessary to maintain the principle that it is an ordinary criminal court of the land.  It is also necessary as a matter of expediency, because of the dangers of jury intimidation which gave rise to the Special Court in the first instance, that juries should be relieved from trying any question of unfitness to plead and from dealing with the defence of insanity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> As I indicated, Senators will know that the Henchy Committee is examining this whole question of insanity in the law under very wide terms of reference and I am hopeful that many of the problems that are touched on here&mdash;but, as Senator Ryan said, this was not a suitable debate for going into them in detail&mdash;will be the subject of recommendations which in turn can lead to amending the law to deal with them.</P>
    <P>There are no other points that were raised by Senators.  The Bill, as I said at the outset, is a technical Bill designed to close a loophole exposed by the Rice case.  To read anything more into it is unreal and not justified by the facts.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill put through Committee, received for final consideration, and passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Begley) Michael Begley">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Begley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Seanad may not generally appreciate that this is not the first occasion on which such a proposal has been debated in this House.  As far back as 1950 a motion was introduced and discussed here which proposed:</P>
      <P>That a Joint Committee, consisting of members of both Dáil and Seanad, should be set up to consider and report on what steps, if any, should be taken to provide for a periodic review of the operations of companies in which the State holds the majority of the issued shares.</P>
      <P>When, at the end of the debate, the Minister for Finance of the day indicated that the review of State-sponsored bodies was under active consideration by the Government, the motion was, however, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that this active consideration has taken a very long time indeed. Since the early 1950s, Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and many others have frequently expressed dissatisfaction about the lack of accountability to Parliament of State-sponsored bodies.  Over the years frequent calls for more parliamentary participation in the review of these bodies have been heard. At the same time more and more bodies have been established mainly because it was thought that this form of organisation would enable the business to be conducted in a freer atmosphere than in the civil service system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is useful to look back at the growth <Col N="764" /> of the State-sponsored bodies from their begining some 50 years ago and to trace briefly their evolution.  The general structure of the Irish public service was originally laid down in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, which assigned the administration of the public service among Departments of State each headed by a Minister. Departments were staffed by civil servants by whom all public business, apart from that assigned to local authorities, was carried out.  The concept enshrined in the 1924 Act of having all public business discharged by civil servants responsible to Ministers was first changed in 1927 when the first two State-sponsored bodies were established.  These were the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
    <P>As I said just now, the form was originally designed to enable public commercial activities to be carried out with a degree of freedom from parliamentary and ministerial involvement in day-to-day administration.  This, it was thought, would be unsatisfactory for the civil service proper.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the growing State involvement in these activities, previously regarded as being outside the State's ambit, was an increasing public demand for services that private enterprise could not satisfy.  After the development of the State's interest in the commercial sector, the practice developed of assigning to non-commercial State-sponsored bodies responsibility for the discharge of certain other executive functions of Government which might have been assigned to branches of Government Departments.  Such has been the growth of the State-sponsored sector in Ireland that today a total of almost 100 such bodies of one type or another now exist employing some 65,000 people.</P>
    <P>While there may be some borderline cases one can normally distinguish between commercial and non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  Commercial bodies, which are included in Schedule A the the motion, are regarded as those which derive the greater part of their revenues from the sale of their goods or services.  With one exception the non-commercial bodies are, in effect, <Col N="765" /> the remainder.  This exception is Gaeltarra Éireann, which for many years were a commercial body but have, in the past few years, extended their activities to the non-commercial, promotion area, to such an extent that they are now primarily a promotional body. Because, however, they still have a fairly substantial commercial arm, they are included in Schedule B to the motion as a body whose trading and/or commercial aspects will be subject to examination by the Committee.</P>
    <P>When one examines the State-sponsored sector one is immediately struck by the variation in the organisational form of the bodies, in the method of their financing and by the diversity of tasks undertaken by them.</P>
    <P>Some of the bodies are statutory corporations while others are public or private companies.  Their functions vary from filling gaps left by private enterprise in the industrial and financial sectors or in the communications area to assisting private enterprise to develop further.  Despite the great diversity in their characters, in their objectives and in their methods of operation, the State-sponsored bodies constitute an identifiable group.</P>
    <P>Their employment constitutes a relatively large proportion of the total number of gainfully employed in the country.  However I think that it would be wrong to measure the importance to the country of the State-sponsored bodies merely in terms of the numbers they employ or, indeed, of the total State investment in them. Of equal importance in my view is the fact that many State-sponsored bodies, because they operate in key sectors of the economy, have a direct effect on the lives of all our people.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the reason why the Government think this Committee should be established.  In the 1920s and 1930s it seemed reasonable that the public should not be too worried about the lack of parliamentary control of such bodies as the number of State-sponsored bodies was relatively small.  In the intervening period both the number and range of activities have increased greatly.  Some bodies are paying their way; others have to receive substantial amounts of money <Col N="766" /> to keep going every year.  This is not to say that there are not often good reasons for the losses; all I am saying is that a large amount of taxpayers' money is tied up in the bodies.  When the motion which I have already mentioned was being discussed in the Seanad one of the speakers cited a sentiment expressed by Francis Bacon which is, I think, particularly applicable to State-sponsored bodies.  Bacon said &ldquo;There is nothing makes a man suspect more than to know little&rdquo;.  People are frequently suspicious of State-sponsored bodies.  This, I suppose, is not altogether surprising since they got a few opportunities to learn about the work being done by those bodies.  Indeed, Deputies and Senators are in almost a similar position since the annual reports and accounts of State-sponsored bodies are often not very enlightening and since their affairs are rarely debated in Parliament.</P>
    <P>In the private sector shareholders have ultimate control of the companies in which their money is invested.  At annual general meetings and elsewhere they get an opportunity to dictate policy, and if they feel that their interests are not properly served they are in a position to replace the Boards.</P>
    <P>Parliament, on the other hand, which votes taxpayer's money for State-sponsored bodies, is given little opportunity to protect the citizens' legitimate interests.  In spite of the fact that State-sponsored bodies are in the last analysis owned by the people, they are for practical purposes largely exempt from public control.  The present motion which has now been passed by the Dáil is an attempt&mdash;some, I am sure, would say that it is long overdue&mdash;to ensure that State-sponsored bodies are more accountable to the Oireachtas and through it to the people.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be wrong if our desire to render the State-sponsored bodies more accountable were to lead to excessive interference in matters of detail.  I would like to stress here that the motion for the establishment of the Joint Committee provides that it should examine the reports and accounts and overall operational results of the State-sponsored bodies.  The Committee will, therefore, be concerned <Col N="767" /> with assessing the general effectiveness of the bodies being reviewed and will not become involved in operational minutiae.</P>
    <P>A point which will be of paramount importance to the success of the Committee is mentioned in paragraph 3 of the motion.  This provides that if a State-sponsored body so requests, the Committee will refrain from publishing information about that body which for sound business or commercial reasons should remain confidential. I have already explained during my remarks in the Dáil the reason for this provision and I would like to reiterate here that the bodies to be reviewed need have no fears that their appearance before the Joint Committee will put them at a disadvantage relative to their competitors.</P>
    <P>The motion before you provides that the 27 State-sponsored bodies listed in the Schedules will be examined by the proposed Committee.  These bodies employ about 60,000 people and have a combined annual turnover of well over £500 million.  Their combined net assets total over £1,000 million.  The motion provides for the addition of new bodies or the deletion of existing ones.</P>
    <P>Initially I intend that the Joint Committee should restrict its inquiries to the bodies in the Schedules.  The position as regards other State-sponsored bodies will be examined in the light of the operation of the Joint Committee in relation to the bodies being reviewed.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Joint Committee will be able to produce reports about the State-sponsored bodies which will set out concisely the relevant background information about the bodies and the main problems which confront them.  The Committee's reports will, I am sure, provide members of both Houses of the Oireachtas with the information which they rightly require without interfering with or jeopardising the efficient operation of the State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The State-sponsored bodies have made a notable contribution to the economic and social development of this country.  They have been responsble for much of the improvement in <Col N="768" /> the quality of the lives of our people over the past 50 years.  The motion for the establishment of the Joint Committee to examine the reports and accounts of the State-sponsored bodies is not being put foward because of any serious defects which have become apparent within the bodies themselves. Rather it is proposed as an integral part of an attempt to develop the total system of public administration as it adapts to the pressures of changes in Irish society today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This, of course, is a measure that is welcomed by all Members of Dáil and Seanad in that &mdash;putting it at its lowest&mdash;the exchange of information between State-sponsored bodies and Members of the Oireachtas is very important; and if it leads to a greater understanding, both on the part of the executives and the board members of State-sponsored bodies and also on the part of the Members of the Oireachtas, of the functioning and workings of State-sponsored bodies, well, this cannot but be good.  The view has been expressed to me by a number of executives and board members of State-sponsored bodies in the past that they would welcome this type of exchange of information and that it is essential in leading to a greater understanding of their activities.  Any comments or observations I may make are not to be taken in any way as disagreeing in principle with the motion that is before the House here and the establishment of just such a committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point of view was put in the other House and it is one that I feel rather strongly about, having had to deal with the two categories of State-sponsored companies myself as Minister for Transport and Power.  It is this distinction between the commercial company and the non-commercial or promotional companies.  Broadly, the various State-sponsored bodies can be separated into those two categories, though there are also other categories. I am candidly disappointed at the emphasis here in the Schedules to the motion on the commercial companies. I would have thought that the commercial companies under the State umbrella are out in the market and carry the profit and loss risk and the accountability <Col N="769" /> involved in profit and loss operations.  It is quite plain from their annual reports what the situation is. They are out in the open market and the accountability is very evident for everybody to see, Members of the Oireachtas, the media and the public at large.</P>
    <P>In my view the companies that really need to be looked at within the State umbrella are the promotional companies that are not subject to the accountability of the commercial State companies.  Here it is very difficult to get the measuring rod right.  The measuring rod of profit and loss is quite plain in regard to the commercial State companies.  It is an open matter and everybody can see it.  But the measuring rod of accountability in regard to the non-profit making or promotional companies, such as the CBF or Bord Fáilte, to mention two of them, is really not plain and is one that requires far greater examination than the accountability of the commercial companies, where one can see in the annual report the profit and loss situation.</P>
    <P>I agree that the matter is again made much more difficult because we have some companies which have both a commercial and a social aspect, companies like CIE.  Again, in regard to CIE, we are in a situation where we have a high degree of social content in regard to public transport, which I approve, and there are also certain commercial elements as well.  What does one do in that category?  I see Aer Lingus is listed here as a company to be examined. B &amp; I, Bord na Móna, Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann and so on are companies that are really out in the open market place, subject to the commercial criteria of which I speak.  They are subject to the accountability of profit and loss. I would not have thought that they are the operators most immediately needing investigation compared to operations such as those I have mentioned.  The IDA are at the moment disbursing enormous sums of money and the very real question arises as to whether these sums of money are being disbursed with a view to employment aspects.  Are they being overdisbursed in capital-intensive areas of investment or should <Col N="770" /> they be switched to the more employment aspects of investment?  A similar justification for investigation would apply to Bord Fáilte and to other of these promotional companies that are not subject to the commercial criteria of which I speak.</P>
    <P>Having mentioned that, I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say on that aspect.  My experience has been that the State companies who have been in the market place and have had to fight their corner in the market place are the ones that are least open to criticism.  They have had to prove themselves, they have had to do their thing, and their accountability is quite open.  Personally, the only problems I ever had, as Minister for Transport and Power in particular, concerned the companies which did not have that type of open accountability and open commercial criteria which one could apply to their companies.  I am thinking in particular here of the promotional companies.  One passes legislation giving them an open-ended function in a promotional operation that does not have the basic profit and loss commercial measuring rod applied to it.  It is in that sort of State operation that there has been over the years a certain degree of fat obtaining and a certain degree of soft option taking on the part of executives and board members, and it is quite obvious why that should obtain in the case of operations of that kind.  In strict commercial operations&mdash;in the case of Aer Lingus, for instance, which is a highly competitive commercial operation&mdash;they have to work hard, cut to the bone and deliver the goods because of the very commercial environment in which they are functioning.</P>
    <P>That strict sort of measuring rod does not apply to companies not in that category.  That is why I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what exactly is going to be gained by a Parliamentary Committee looking at, for instance, the affairs of Aer Lingus, of Bord na Móna, or the affairs of the British and Irish Steampacket Company, which again operates in a highly competitive freight and passenger area. These companies have tremendously good boards, they are highly commercially <Col N="771" /> orientated and have excellent executives.  While I do not dispute that the information can be helpful to us as Members of Parliament&mdash;indeed I am sure the executives of these companies would be delighted to come along and explain matters to us&mdash;I do not see how we are going to improve their operations to any event.  I do think that as Members of Parliament we have an obligation to look into areas that do not have the commercial measuring rod applied.</P>
    <P>They are the only reservations I should like to express.  I think it is good for all of us in the Dáil and Seanad that we should have this committee established because it would make for much more informed and constructive criticism in regard to the workings of these bodies.  The present system of having the annual Estimate debates and the occasional Bill coming foward in the Dáil and Seanad is a very inadequate manner in which to have a detailed and informed knowledge of the operations of these State-sponsored bodies.  They have been a particular response on the part of our State to a real requirement, a requirement posed by an emerging State that did not have the private enterprise infrastructure. The party to which I belong played a major part, and the late Seán Lemass in particular, in ensuring that this void was filled by the establishment of such companies. The strength of the companies heretofore in the commercial area has been their independence and their freedom to operate and to function.  I am certain that any parliamentary supervision will not interfere with that capacity.  This is very important because they cannot function viably unless they have commercial freedom, and that applies to other companies that may be established in the future.  If we adopt any attitude of bureaucratic direction in the way of excessive control, it would be catastrophic and very serious.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the whole purpose behind the establishment of these companies was to provide a State investment to give employment in neglected areas where private enterprise was not doing the job, giving these companies the same type of commercial <Col N="772" /> viability and freedom which private enterprise had.  To that extent it was a unique contribution towards the development of the mixed economy we have here today.  I am glad to say it was socialism, without calling it socialism, in a very practical manner.  The way in which these companies have operated is practical socialism at its very best.  I should not like to see any bureaucratic interference with the valid commercial decisions that may be made by these companies.  That could be a very dangerous development.  Provided the committee&mdash;and I am certain this will be the case&mdash;operate in the sort of responsible and constructive way I have mentioned, without getting into the operational area of the companies, and provided they can make suggestions in regard to policy changes, whatever Government are in power, then I believe they can function fruitfully in that direction.  By not getting involved in bureaucratic interference with operational details but by concentrating on sensible proposals of policy changes of direction, the Oireachtas Committee can function best and most fruitfully.</P>
    <P>I would also reiterate what I have said about the commercial companies.  If there are State operations functioning well in the commercial environment, then I think it is important to leave well enough alone in that area.  There are other bodies where I think a parliamentary examination might prove more fruitful and where the measuring rod of the commercial environment does not apply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would welcome the motion and look forward to this committee working fruitfully along lines of policy suggestions and policy opinions rather than any excessive operational investigation or looking over the shoulders of executives and board members in State companies.  That sort of thing can be counterproductive and lead to imposing another bureaucracy on organisations on whose shoulders we have by statute laid the responssibility of handling a particular function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the setting up of this committee. I think it could, provided it does its job properly, supply a very <Col N="773" /> useful link between the State-sponsored bodies and the public and the taxpayer. As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated quite clearly in his speech, policy is a matter for the Minister concerned and the Government of the day, but there is somewhere along the line a gap which normally in private enterprise companies would be filled by the shareholders at an annual general meeting or an extraordinary general meeting, where they would have an opportunity of voicing criticism of the work of the directors in certain cases and, if thought fit, removing directors and certainly having a useful function in providing or criticising the policy of the company and possibly changing its trends.  Such a set-up is not practicable in regard to the State-sponsored companies.  Of their very nature they cannot operate along similar lines to a private enterprise company.</P>
      <P>I must say I go along with a lot of what Senator Lenihan has said.  I think that this Joint Committee should not be a group of busybodies interfering in the day-to-day operations of any State-sponsored body or company.  I think it would be intolerable from the point of view of interfering with the degree of independence which State bodies have, rightly enjoyed up to now. Their role should be one of assisting, encouraging and advising in situations where they are competent to advise and, generally, of securing the co-operation of the directors and staffs of these companies. Under no circumstance should there be any suggestion of a heavy-handed attitude towards them, which would be a very unwelcome development.</P>

    <P>State-sponsored companies play a very important role in our economy since the foundation of the State. Looking back, it is interesting, for those of us who can, to recall the doubts expressed in the early 1920s about the establishment of State companies such as the ESB, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Irish Sugar Company. Now we take State-sponsored bodies as a fact of life.  There is no lack of encouragement for the establishment of more State-sponsored companies on the grounds that private enterprise has failed, a view to which I <Col N="774" /> do not ascribe.  We have rightly decided on a mixed economy and, with the efficient operation of both the private sector and the public sector, we should, in time, resolve our current pressing problem on unemployment.  This needs efficiency and adequate investment. Above all else, it needs good management.</P>
    <P>I noticed on the discussion of this motion in the other House that the Minister was very emphatic that this committee should in no way have any influence in regard to the policies of State companies.  I have some reservations about the Minister's attitude in that regard.  Merely reading profit and loss accounts and balance sheets is not sufficient.  We can do that at present as Members of the Oireachtas. Members of the public can do it if they acquire copies of the annual reports of the State-sponsored companies, some of which are models of clarity and information, while others are shrouded in mystery.  If this committee do nothing else but set aside the veil of mystery which surrounds some of these companies they will have performed their task well.</P>
    <P>I agree that the Minister, in the final analysis&mdash;he has made this point himself&mdash;must be responsible for the policies of State-sponsored companies, with the backing of the Government. The whole idea of the development of State-sponsored bodies and their further development must be a matter of Government policy through the Minister for Finance and other Ministers concerned.  Somewhere along the line, this committee should have the power to recommend changes in policy where they find that the wrong policy is being wholly or partly pursued.  That would overcome the Minister's concern about handing over responsibility to the committee from himself, which action I would strongly oppose.  If the committee are experienced and competent, which I hope they will be&mdash;though not necessarily composed entirely of one profession but of a broad selection of classes concerned with the public company&mdash;and perform their task adequately, they will learn a great deal about the operation of State-sponsored companies.  They should perform their <Col N="775" /> task methodically and take the companies in rotation, not altogether.  It would be impossible to take on 27 large State companies and deal with their operations at the same time.  The committee should apply certain standards with which they think the companies concerned should comply.</P>
    <P>At the end of a certain period, one or two years, this committee will have accummulated quite a vast store of knowledge about State-sponsored companies. Arising out of that, I should like the committee presenting a general report on the operations of State sponsored companies, touching on the question of policy and making recommendations with regard to further development or changes in development that might help the economy.</P>
    <P>The question of assistance to the committee is referred to in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement and was debated at some length in the other House.  It is an important point and I share the views expressed by some Deputies in the Dáil that expert assistance should not be confined to that drawn from within the civil service.  In saying that, I do not wish to be disrespectful to the civil service.  I have a high regard for their ability, competence and integrity.  If the committee are to serve a useful purpose they should be able to beam an external, expert eye on the operation of these companies and should be free to call on anybody outside the civil service or even outside the country to assist them in their examination of the companies' operations.  If they cannot get the best people to assist them their work will not be a success.  If we are to establish this committee we should ensure that they will be a success.</P>
    <P>It will not be a popular task for any man in public life who is charged with investigating the operations of public companies which employ large numbers of workers.  It may affect his position in public life if he makes honest recommendations in this regard. We know that a number of the companies are efficiently operated, their costs are kept under strict control, while others are in a different state. Senator Lenihan mentioned one company <Col N="776" /> which is very much in the public eye and is severely criticised from time to time, that is, CIE.  That is unfair to CIE, because they are charged with providing what is to a large degree a social service, not a commercial service. One task which I hope this committee will be competent to perform is to segregate from their other activities, in the case of CIE, their commercial operations, which should be profitable, given the opportunities in a normal commercial climate.  Under no circumstances, having regard to the situation in the country&mdash;a small population, the number of road and rail lines&mdash; could CIE pay their way, but because of the national interest they are required to carry on these operations.  This distinction should be shown clearly, that, for instance, this is a national service, a necessary one which CIE cannot do away with, and therefore the taxpayer must bear it.  On the other hand, their operations should be closely scrutinised and every endeavour made to ensure that CIE operate profitably. That is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan made reference to some of the State-sponsored bodies which are included in the Schedule.  I go some of the way with him in that regard but I question whether at this stage it is worth bothering about these smaller fry.  According to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech the 27 State-sponsored bodies which this committee will be looking into employ 60,000 and again, according to another section of his speech, the total number of State-sponsored bodies which we have in the country is somewhat less than 100 or thereabouts, employing 65,000.  It means in effect that some 70 or so companies, including those of a promotional or a commercial nature, employ about 5,000.  I do not know what amount of money is invested in these companies but they may be worth looking into at some future date when the committee have time enough to do it, and I doubt very much if they will.</P>
    <P>The 27 concerns listed are what you might call the commanding heights of the public sector.  They are the ones that really have it in them to expand, to give employment and to influence policy, not only the policy of their own companies <Col N="777" /> but policy of a much wider issue. The ESB, apart from supplying power, energy and light, are responsible for the operation of thousands of concerns all over the country.  They have a vital effect on the economy and on the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>They are excellent. There is no question about it.  I would say it would be a pleasure for the committee to have a look at the affairs of the ESB, others perhaps not so pleasurable.</P>
      <P>By and large I think the idea is a good one.  I think the committee can provide a very useful function.  It would help to allay&mdash;and this is a point that was stressed in the Dáil too&mdash;some I would hope, if not all, of the ill-informed criticisms that is directed from time to time against our public companies. You hear people talking about the cost of this, that and the other thing.  If people took the trouble to look into the private enterprise sector, they would find that the accelerating cost of oil and other materials affect them too.</P>
      <P>It is getting almost impossible nowadays to control costs.  Any businessman will tell you that, and the same latitude should be given to the public companies in that regard.  By and large over the last 50 years the State-sponsored companies have done this country well, many of them taking on tasks that private enterprise could never have engaged in.  Either it was too big for them or they might not regard it as yielding a sufficient return on their investment.  They are going to have an even more important part to play in the future development of the country particularly in regard to, say, natural resources of which I hope the State will have a large slice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now is the time to have a look at the whole set-up here.  We have the public companies for 50 years now.  We know the good things they have done.  The public are still somewhat critical.  This committee will, I hope, help to allay that and also help to keep the Members of the Oireachtas more informed about the running of these State-sponsored bodies, because they are ours.  The taxpayers and the electors put us into office <Col N="778" /> to represent them here in the Dáil and Seanad.  One of the ways we can represent them most effectively is ensuring to the best of our ability and satisfying ourselves to the utmost extent that the State-sponsored bodies are well run or if they are not well run, that the committee will offer fair criticisms as to how things might be changed.  It is a challenge to this committee.  I do not think they are going to get through their work as expeditiously perhaps as some others might think, if they do their job properly.  There is going to be several years' work ahead of this committee, but I wish them well and feel it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House is a very interesting one and obviously everybody would support it. The difficulties the committee will have are very considerable, and I am sorry Senator Russell, who is a very experienced businessman, could not have told us a little bit more about the possibilities of a small committee like this dealing with companies of this size with assets of a thousand million pounds and a turnover of £500 million.  I cannot help feeling that it is a rather polite genuflection towards the ideal of this most important question in all societies, in mixed economies, socialist economies and straight private enterprise economies; the attempt to see that enterprises, however they are funded, shall be responsible to the people who pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell will probably agree that the say of the shareholders at the annual general meeting is a rather plaintive bleat without any real powers, no more power indeed than the average individual has in our type of mixed economy with State capitalist-type institutions, which all of these things really are.  They are not socialist, although I agree with Senator Lenihan they are moving over towards the socialist concept. But the underlying philosophy, I am afraid, is expediential and pragmatic. The philosophy of the great pragmatist, Seán Lemass, was certainly not a socialist philosophy, but that is not too important.  The past is past and it is a question of what one learns from what has been done, whether it is in <Col N="779" /> private enterprise or in the public sector.</P>
    <P>I notice that nobody has made any serious attempt to defend the appalling morass of despair in what you might call the monopoly capitalist camps these days, not only here in Ireland but all over Western Europe and in the United States, the great home of the whole idea of monopoly capitalism, and the terrible human suffering which is involved in this failure&mdash;the unemployment, the consequential effects of low productivity, the inability to develop proper services, whether health, education, old people, housing, communications or whatever it is.  The record here of the pragmatic State capitalist-type of intervention is that of undertaking jobs that private enterprise would not or could not do in the first instance; possibly capital was not there.  Since a number of the enterprises had a very high social content, investment could not have been justified if one is concerned with the profit motive, which is the driving force of monopoly capitalism. Therefore we had what the poor Americans seem to be so frightened of, creeping socialism.  We have creeping socialism; and it is obviously very welcome even in the form which it has taken, because there is no doubt that our infrastructure of State enterprises is a very considerable one indeed, and extending all the time.</P>
    <P>Of course, private enterprise has failed in our society to provide the services except to a limited extent.  It has succeeded totally in its limited objective of making a lot of money for a few people, but in the general objective of a society such as ours its interest is a very narrow and selfish one.  Therefore, as the aspirations of people and their expectations are expanded and as people become more enlightened and become more demanding in the things they want for themselves and their children, for their old own people, quite obviously the State sector becomes more and more important and is brought more and more into action perforce, without it being wanted, in the face of the obscurantist opposition, the kind to which Senator Russell referred. It is a mixture of direct opposition by vested interests of people, for instance, <Col N="780" /> the private bus companies, carriers, who might feel threatened from the beginning by CIE or the old State bus company.</P>
    <P>But there is no doubt that the whole of these enterprises have developed and expanded in a very hostile&mdash;at worst&mdash; and certainly in a very unfavourable, unenthusiastic society, a society which resented and resisted the intervention of the State all along the line as long as I can remember.  One does not hear nowadays to anything like the extent that one used to hear the danger of red tape and the inevitability of bureaucracies, the inefficiency of the State and so on.  That is not heard virtually at all now because quite obviously anybody can look up in the air and see Aer Lingus in action or look around and see the various other enterprises, Bord na Móna, the ESB, which Senator Russell so rightly praised for the wonderful work they do, and the many other companies in their various degrees of efficiency&mdash;and inefficiency; I am conceding without a doubt efficiency and inefficiency and this, of course, is said to be the reason we are presented with this motion.</P>
    <P>This question of accountability&mdash;and that is what the Minister is attempting to bring about by this motion&mdash;is a problem for everybody whether it be private enterprise or a State concern.  A lot of countries have failed to achieve serious accountability and even in the socialist countries there have been many instances in which one did get the complete slowing down through the intractable bureaucratic inertia because of the way in which some of the companies were established.  I suppose one has two contrasting pictures on the socialist side, of the democratic centralism of the Soviet Union, with the tendency towards bureaucracy and frequently the inefficiency associated with that kind of thing, going over to, unfortunately on a very much smaller scale, the Yugoslavian kind of approach where there has been an attempt to involve the community all the time in most of these enterprises, and one has attempted devolution of power from the centre to the periphery, instead of as in the Soviet model, in order to involve the public. Then again in Mao Tse Tung's China he <Col N="781" /> tried to develop his socialist ideas involving the community the whole time in discussion and consideration of desirable aims, all the time trying to push back to the periphery, to society as a whole, responsibility both for the good and the evils of whatever kind of society they are involved in.</P>
    <P>In my experience in practically all the activities in which I am involved, both as a professional person and as a politician, this has been the regret I have over our 50 years of government, the fact that we have moved away from public accountability and that we have moved more and more towards the Soviet style of control of our affairs. The reasons are very complicated and I will not dwell on them; but, unfortunately, our people do not appear to be encouraged to accept responsibility.  We tend all the time to look towards the centre, the leader, to look for guidance and we appear to have provided a community where there is an enormous amount of dependence by the community generally on some central oligarchy or, in one phase of our lives, a benevolent dictator who seemed to know all that was right and good for us.  I regret that&mdash;the moving back from the local authorities and county councils, the development of the managerial powers.  I know there were practical reasons for this kind of evolution when it took place but, in effect, it was a retrograde decision.  It was a decision that you could not trust the ordinary people.  This led ordinary people to feel that they could not be trusted, that they need not be trusted, that there was somebody else who knew all about this at the centre here in Dublin, in Leinster House, and that everything would be all right if we left it to them.  However, it did mean they, in effect, opted out of any responsibility or any sense of involvement in the particular enterprises in which they took part.  This obviously applies to the whole political establishment in our society.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in a mixed economy there are very grave difficulties, because if one is going to support the idea of private enterprise side by side with State enterprises and if, regrettably, the majority of our public representatives <Col N="782" /> and the majority of the products from our schools and colleges and universities are committed to the State and private enterprise-type of society, one must have the private monopoly capitalist-type block side by side with the State enterprises.  This creates many difficulties for both sides.  In ways it is remarkable that the State companies have done so well, considering that they have developed in such a hostile <i>milieu</i>, as was inevitable, whether it was that the Ministers in charge of State Departments or many of the people who were appointed to become chairmen of the boards and many of the directors who were appointed to the boards, had no interest whatever, certainly no respect or regard or sympathy for many of the enterprises with which they were associated.  It is miraculous that so many of these enterprises have done so well, in spite of the way we have managed them rather than because of the way we have managed them.  This is one of the factors which will arise in the creation of this small body.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell, as an individual, is a man of considerable integrity.  But how does a business man of that kind sit on a committee such as this?  I am not denigrating him in any way.  There must be great difficulty for a person like that in trying to reconcile his ideological or philosophical beliefs with the operation of a system which he does not despise but in which he has no serious or deep faith.  This applies to most of the people in these companies.  Many of the directors are committed private enterprise people and many of the Senators and Deputies who will be on this committee will certainly not be committed socialists.</P>
    <P>This is one of my reasons for not having much faith in the committee. Even if the committee could do more in the sense of a continuing review of the activities of these companies than what Senator Russell suggested, that is, if they could be objective about the analysis, investigation or assessment of what has been done or what these companies have failed to do, they might come back in three or four years with an examination of value to all of us in the assessment of the merits and demerits of these companies, whether <Col N="783" /> some of them should not have been put to do the work they were given to do and whether some of them did it extremely well.  If they could do that task alone, it might be the only useful function they might have.  I really do not see how these people&mdash;busy Deputies and Senators&mdash;can take on any serious examination in the continuing sense of such complicated exterprises as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the Agricultural Credit Corporation and so on.  I would have valued Senator Russell's contribution in that regard.</P>
    <P>Is it physically possible for a business man, with the best will in the world, to make any kind of useful examination of enterprises as complicated as that?  I have very little experience of this beyond a few companies which I set up a few years ago.  I accepted the principle of the Blood Transfusion Board, mass-radiography, BCG, cancer hospitals and so on.  I took the general line then of no interference.  I felt it was wisest to set up a company in which one had a certain amount of trust in the members. That, again, is a subjective thing: why should my trust necessarily be relied on?  But, as the Minister, I had the power to do that.  I doubt if it is a power that we should allow to any single individual.</P>
    <P>The general feeling of attempting to keep some sort of hold on the company was undesirable for two reasons.  As Senator Russell said, if there was a day-to-day continuing interference it might slow the activities of the company. Secondly, if one has not got direct responsibility in the House for the activities of the company&mdash;and this comes to the danger question of accountability&mdash;then one can say that this is a matter for the company.  To that extent is one evading one's responsibility?  I simply do not know. This factor was referred to.  I must admit I did not give it any deep consideration at that time because it was done rather hurriedly.  Were I doing it again I am not sure what I would do in relation to these companies.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in the Dáil to a Minister having responsibility for a company, say, Telefís Éireann, CIE, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna.  CIE and <Col N="784" /> Aer Lingus would be the ones which most of us grouse about.  Any Minister can say that it was a matter for the company, <i>simpliciter</i>.  Either that should be so and seen to be so, or the company should have total independence to get on with the job.  In my case the Blood Transfusion Service were given the money and were allowed to carry on their business without interference from their Minister.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is this lack of accountability in respect of a number of very important companies.  For instance, the present row about whether Prionsias Mac Aonghusa should be made director of Radio na Gaeltachta.  There appears to be a certain amount of thimble breaking in Radio na Gaeltachta between the director of Telefís Éireann and the Minister.  Who is responsible?  Can one of the Deputies put a question?  If he does, what will be the response of the Minister, acting presumably, within his rights?  In relation to the present CIE strike, were the company right to behave in the arbitrary way they did?  The trade unions and I think it was an arbitrary way.  Were they correct to behave in this arbitrary way of imposing these particular services and bringing about the present dreadful strike position?  Who is accountable?  Is anybody accountable in relation to that?  Can one ask?  Can somebody put down a question to the Minister for Transport and Power, or whoever is responsible, asking about these things?  If not, what is the position? How does this motion alter that situation in respect of the running of these powerful institutions?</P>
    <P>We have talked about Senator Russell and his shareholders, but we have even less control than his shareholders. Surely that is wrong.  We have this extraordinary anomalous position of the ownership without the control.  We fund State companies through taxation. There is not serious accountability in respect of any of the Ministers and the position has worsened over the years.  I remember the times when you could question Ministers about various services that were not given, whether Local Government services, Posts and Telegraphs, CIE, Bord na Móna or whatever it might be.  It seems to be happening less and less now.  The ordinary <Col N="785" /> Deputies and Senators are getting less power while more power is being vested elsewhere, whether in the boards of directors of State companies, or whether the Minister really has the power and uses it when it suits him&mdash;he stops a particular broadcast he does not like but he has no responsibility when somebody is wrongfully dismissed.  They appear to be having it both ways.</P>
    <P>This motion does not seem to deal with this issue at all.  I do not know if it is meant to deal with any issue seriously beyond the one which Senator Russell forlornly suggested it might do&mdash;take three years having a look at the whole principle underlying the State companies and then come back and tell us what you think.</P>
    <P>The idea is not an answer to the criticisms, and there are many criticisms. I have made some criticisms.  I remember being one of a group of Deputies who tried to see one of the directors of CIE.  He told us he would not talk to us.  At the time there was some trouble with CIE, but he would not even see us, a group of all-party Deputies.  There have been criticisms of State companies and I, as a socialist, do not resent it.  There must be criticism, but I resent the fact that we cannot deal with the criticism and cannot organise these companies which do such wonderful work in so many aspects of our life. Everybody agrees that we cannot try to increase accountability.  Everybody would agree that we are moving closer and closer to a centralist approach, in spite of all our protestations about the democratic ideal.  This has always been my difficulty in our society.  I am a fanatical democrat and believe in the right of the individual to hold a point of view and to express it, but we are getting to a situation where there is a retraction towards the centre on the part of all the Government Ministers in all aspects of their work, particularly in relation to these State companies, and that is a very retrograde development.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the peculiar segregation of the companies, why they are segregated on the commercial principle and promotional principle.  I do not know the value of going into a commercial company with the idea that you are going to have some interest or <Col N="786" /> responsibility.  Theoretically they are meant to come back to us and tell us what is going on in these companies, whether they agree or disagree with what is going on, or approve or disapprove of what is going on.  I assume they can do all those things without having the right to discuss policy.  I do not understand why we should give the name or status of a Seanad-Dáil Joint Committee to a group to examine the reports and accounts and overall operational results of the State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities referred to in the Schedule, and the trading and/or commercial aspects of the reports and accounts and overall operational results of the State-sponsored bodies referred to in Schedule B.</P>
    <P>Beyond reading the accounts and the annual reports it seems that this is a mild variation on what any of us can do. As Senator Russell said, we can buy the reports and read them.  Sometimes we are little the wiser and sometimes we do know a little more.  These people should have some authority beyond the authority simply to ask for more information than one gets in the accounts.  The information given should relate to its consequence.  We should ask why are you going to close down a particular line, or what is the profit and loss, and have you appreciated the significance from the social point of view.  Surely it must be permissible for this committee to ask questions of this nature: are you right to do this kind of thing?  Do you think you are justified?  Do you think that the cuts that you are imposing are warranted?  That surely is a question of policy.</P>
    <P>The question of policy is inseparable from an examination of the operational activities or results of these companies. For instance, in the recent CIE dispute all these services are being reduced on predominantly actuarial grounds.  The main thing involved appears to be certain saving of money by the company. What about the social consequences of this kind of thing?  Surely this is where we could be of help to a group trying to run this on strictly actuarial grounds, because the social content of a transport policy is absolutely fundamental to it. As long as they have been talking about <Col N="787" /> transport policy, and many of these other things, there is this social content which is immeasurable.  It is quite impossible to say that if somebody wants to get from Kilmacanogue to Roundwood, there are no buses going there and that they must stay forever in Kilmacanogue.  The public service has to run at a loss.  Many companies who have this social content will have to run at a loss and will have to be funded from central funds.  We are a community. Some of us live in out-of-the-way places, some of us need a postal service, a television service, or an electricity service.  This is obviously the most important one, light and power.  If one is left with the facility of simply examining the accounts on a strict profit and loss assessment of success or failure, there is nothing to be gained.</P>
    <P>The company will say &ldquo;This is what we did.  This is the service we ran.  This is what we paid out.  This is what we took in&rdquo;.  If the committee are restricted to that kind of information and cannot say, &ldquo;Because of the need in this particular area, you have to put in electric light.  You have to run a service because there are people there, children have to be brought to school and so on&rdquo;. The school bus service could never be justified on actuarial grounds.  &ldquo;We think you should do some particular thing.&rdquo;  That is a policy declaration.  If they are to be prohibited from taking that kind of part in the operation of these services, then I suspect they are wasting their time.  Their function cannot be any better than simply getting more high level accountants to look at the figures and to examine the reports. They will be little the wiser.  Little value can be added to the power that any of us have either of reading the annual reports or of doing our best to get information from the Minister by letter or by parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>If top quality people are put on the committee by both of the parties&mdash;as I am certain they must be&mdash;their time will be wasted on this kind of committee with such limited powers.  The important aspect from the Government's point of view is that there is a fundamental division between themselves and the Opposition on the <Col N="788" /> interpretation of the terms of reference. Therefore, it starts under a great disadvantage because the main Opposition made the case in the Dáil that the question of policy is inseparable from the interpretation of &ldquo;... to examine the Reports and Accounts and overall operational results of State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities...&rdquo;.  They believe that this is inseparable from the question of policy making.  Whether they agree or disagree with this right being vested in the committee is another thing.  They believe that it is implicit in the wording of this motion.  Therefore, one has an immediate conflict.  Why is it that the Government have not said they either believed the right to policy decisions must be included or, specifically, that the right to policy-making is excluded.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the interpretation of the words in this motion is the operative motion in respect of the activity of this committee.</P>
    <P>A curious decision is that they may include in the Schedule from time to time the names of further State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities.  First of all, there is nothing peculiar in the right to include new State-sponsored bodies in the Schedule.  That is understandable because there are so many, and a number of them should obviously be included.  Why is it necessary to specify the trading or commercial type of State body rather than leaving it open to the Minister to include anybody he wishes to?  Why does he specifically exclude non-trading or non-commercial companies?  A reasonable fear that a number of us have about this motion arises from recent speeches made by three main Fine Gael speakers&mdash;The Taoiseach, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly and the Minister for Finance&mdash;all tending to denigrate the whole State concept in relation to the further funding of their activities in the community.</P>
    <P>This was particularly noticeable in the response of Deputy Kelly, the Parliamentary Secretary, to the suggestion by the then Secretary of the Labour Party that there should be considerable expansion in State spending in relation <Col N="789" /> to State corporations in order to try to increase badly-needed employment.  One has to consider this motion and every word in it in that context where you are dealing with people who are notoriously hostile to the socialist idea or to the State enterprise idea.  This has been very recently and cogently argued.  They have argued very cogently against this to their satisfaction, I might say, in the light of a cascading collapse of monopoly capitalism on all sides.  It defies understanding how people can still talk about the merits of private enterprise, but this is possible, I suppose, a kind of bigotted attitude in an intellectually closed mind.</P>
    <P>In this situation one has to examine this motion and find out why they specifically exclude bodies other than those engaged in trading and commercial activities.  There are other bodies. The IDA, which is an extremely important body was set up to create employment or expand employment.  It has done extremely badly in that job over a long time.  One would imagine that it should be included for examination to see whether it should continue with its capital-intensive type of industrial development instead of the employment-intensive kind of development which is so badly needed.  They are spending millions of pounds on industries which employ half a dozen people.</P>
    <P>The disastrous policy decision in relation to Bord Iascaigh Mhara, changed the emphasis from a State type of company to a private enterprise company.  The result is, of course, that these unfortunate fishermen are going around in tiny boats, while on the periphery we have the fleets of the world fishing away to their heart's content, raping and pillaging the sea and the enormous wealth in it, because a handful of small traders or businessmen in the fishing industry made enough to buy themselves whatever baubles they wanted.  They have left the community bereft of a serious fishing fleet or the capacity to defend our Atlantic fishing rights.  One of the most dazzling achievements of successive Governments in this country has been their failure to use our natural advantages and resources.  With our climate, our <Col N="790" /> arable land, the seas around us, any other country would have built a paradise without any great trouble.  But we have continued to stumble on, poverty stricken, near bankrupt as we are at present, with all the wealth there is in the country, instead of developing it for the majority rather than the handful who now own it.  This kind of mentality is behind this motion and is a frightening one.</P>
    <P>The Irish Productivity Council are another body which it should be possible for us to examine in regard to the extent of their success.  Mianraí Teoranta is another company which it would be worth being able to do much more about than we have already done. Senator Russell, as a practical and successful businessman, gave us enough information to tell those of us who do not know as much as he does that the committee cannot be a serious communications link between us and these semi-State companies.  It cannot function like that because it is physically impossible.  In various other ways, from the point of view of trying to assimilate continuously changing information, in a disastrously changing economic world, the committee could not possibly discharge that function.  This committee should allow us to say at any particular time that a director of a board is exceeding his functions and should concern himself with the job we set up the board to discharge.  It is not going to do that either.</P>
    <P>One is compelled to return to the belief that there is, as we all agree, a certain amount of discontent and a certain amount of concern.  We have, for instance, Gaeltarra Éireann, with £4.5 million invested and a return of of £1.5 million&mdash;an enormous amount of money spent and a relatively small amount coming in.  There is this peculiar privacy that Gaeltarra Éireann are looking for.  They have not apparently got out of their earlier functions in the Gaeltacht and are involved in taking shares in other companies.  For that reason, we are told, they should not be subjected to any kind of serious scrutiny, but the shares in the other companies were bought with our money. Whatever the companies, even if they <Col N="791" /> are private companies, the majority shareholding in some of them is held by Gaeltarra Éireann and, therefore, we must be able to subject them to the kind of scrutiny any shareholder in a private company expects.  We are not getting that from anybody.  We are not getting it from the Ministers in the House or from the companies.  We are told it is not our business and we are only private citizens.  I do not believe for one moment that the committee set up under this motion will do that.  I am not terribly interested in the committee because I suspect it can do very little.  It will be rather importent in its influence except in one sphere.  Here I share Senator Russell's belief that it could be of some use in regard to a long-term survey.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 states:</P>
    <P>That if so requested by a State-sponsored body, the Joint Committee shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why that is included. It appears that the committee may come into possession of confidential information about the activities of the company.  Obviously, I can see, just as everybody else can understand, that there must be confidentiality in relation to the operation of a complex business, especially where one is dealing with competitors.  That sort of explanation is a little like the one we had from the preceding Minister about the need to get extended jurisdiction.  It is not really as simple as that.  While it is true that one should have the right of confidentiality when running a big enterprise, at the same time if we appoint a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas why should they not be trusted, first of all?</P>
    <P>I can give some of the answers myself, that some of them have a vested interest in not helping these State companies. But the record has not been too bad as far as we know it.  Most people who serve on these kind of committees tend to do what they think is best for the community, the company or whatever it may be.  When we have a committee of responsible people, responsible Senators and Deputies who will be <Col N="792" /> handpicked, top level people of their parties, and assuming that a certain level of integrity will be observed by them, how can we say that if they are given confidential information which they believe should be conveyed to the Minister and to this House and if the board of directors or the chairman says this confidential information should not be transmitted to this House, or to the Minister, then their word is to be operative?</P>
    <P>This is what I have often talked about, this inability to trust people who are carrying out a particular job and who have a standing in society.  They are handpicked for the fact that they can contribute their knowledge, their experience and their dedication to their job, like those who sit on the Public Accounts Committee.  Those who continually do these kind of things on those committees, and growingly will continue to do that, why should they be impugned in this way by the suggestion that they would act in an irresponsible way in disclosing information which would be damaging to the State-sponsored body they are investigating?  Surely this is suggesting that they would act in an irresponsible way and that they cannot be trusted.  How can one take a group of men from all parties, with the exception of the Independents&mdash;I saw a reference by Deputy Kelly telling Deputy Colley that he could deal with the Independents, that they would be delighted to dispense with them also&mdash;and ask them to do a job, and then tell them that implicitly one does not trust their judgement, if the company being investigated suggests one should not do so?  If the committee decide this should be published, it is the kind of information that should be published and be made available to the Minister and to the House.</P>
    <P>It seems to be the most up-ended kind of logic, where one has a body which everybody has said will be a very exclusive group, of top quality intellectually from an industrial and business point of view, to tell them at a certain stage they may not do a particular thing they feel should be done.  The motion states that, if so requested by a State-sponsored body, the Joint Committee shall refrain from publishing <Col N="793" /> confidential information regarding the body's activities and plans.  I do not question the right of a body to ask that this should be done and their right to attempt to establish a case that it should not be done.  But this Committee should have the final say as to whether the information shall be conveyed to this House.  This is the most important consideration of all.</P>
    <P>It seems that this is the most important consideration of all, that we should know something which they think we ought to know but which the others would like to withhold.  We had, for instance, I do not mean it in the same way because it is relatively unimportant in the sense that I am talking about major policy decisions, things that are going wrong in a big way and which are being suppressed by the directors of the company or the chairman of the company or whatever it may be&mdash;the recent Irish Life type of situation, where I am sure the Minister would like not to have had this thing blow up in his face.  It would be in the public interest that we should be able to probe it right to its roots in order to see that it would not happen again.  I would prefer that the Joint Committee should be completely trusted or not at all; or, alternatively, that they should have a right to report to the Minister and he could make the final decision.  I do not think it should be left to the State-sponsored body to make this final decision in such a situation.</P>
    <P>Clause 5 which states that the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such a report together with, as it thinks fit, any evidence and other such related documents given to it. Are they not in conflict with one another?  If information is given to them, related documents are given to them, evidence is given to them and they have that information, then it simply cannot be taken back.  The information is available to them.  It seems it can, under that section, be published and be damned, as they say, in relation to the company, whatever they might have decided to ask them to do.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary has not, under clause 5, the body we are setting up the power to publish anything they want, anything they have <Col N="794" /> heard, any evidence they have got under the last paragraph of that clause (5) and does that not negative clause 3?  However, if it does not, it should, because I still believe it is wrong that a body of this kind should be set up and subjected to the limitations imposed in it.</P>
    <P>For the Government to set up this poor little group of five, or whatever it is going to be, to carry out this enormous task displays an extraordinary sense of naivety or innocence on the part of the Government.  It surprises me that they have got away so easily in relation to serious criticism because of their total impotence and inevitable ineffectiveness in the fundamental question that the public is interested in, the accountability of these semi-State bodies.  This motion adds virtually nothing whatever to establishing serious accountability.  It is wrong always when one is dealing with an intelligent opponent to say to him that he does not realise what is happening.  I believe the Government know damn well what they are doing.  They are leaving these companies the way they are because they are as hostile to them now as they have always been in their lives and they have no intention of diffusing power in any way from the centre.  They intend to retain the anti-democratic centralist basic philosophy which seems to colour all their attitudes, whether in politics, in industry or in business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Government have seen fit to introduce this motion.  I do not share Senator Browne's pessimism about its effectiveness. However, unless the committee of 11 people begin to define at the outset what their terms of reference empower them to do, the role of the committee could become very negative.  It could, in fact, inhibit enterprise within the State sector by giving&mdash;they are protected at the moment&mdash;the power to Deputies and Senators to probe into their day-to-day affairs or policy decisions they may take.  Senator Browne has referred to the Irish Life furniture contract.  That is the sort of thing which would be very attractive for a Deputy or Senator to pursue because it has all the nice, neat, precise roundness of a good press story, but it has got nothing <Col N="795" /> to do, in the long term analysis, with the role of the State sector in our society.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Lenihan say&mdash;in totally contradictory terms&mdash;that there was no problem in measuring the performance of the commercial and trading State companies because one had the profit and loss account.  He went on to say that the reason they had been set up was because private enterprise could not operate a profit and loss account because basically private enterprise could only produce a loss in that situation. He was proposing, and Senator Russell similarly was suggesting, that the normal criteria of private enterprise, of profit and loss, would not be applied to the private sector because the private sector had got out of it on the basis that it could not by definition apply that criteria but now they want it to apply to a State company.  It betrays the kind of ambiguous attitude that has been shrouded over by people who are opposed to the State sector and who say &ldquo;We will only put it in those areas where private enterprise has failed&rdquo; and then lash it up and down the newspapers because it happens to make an operating loss.  They conceal the fact that private enterprise depends totally upon the commercial infrastructure that the ESB, Bord na Móna or CIE or, indeed, any of the other enterprises have set up for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to return to the terms of reference of this motion because I believe that the primary job of this committee rests not so much in examining the report and accounts of the semi-State companies listed in Schedule A and, indeed, in B, but in the operational results.  I have read the debate in the Dáil and of the Opposition's attempts to get the word &ldquo;policy&rdquo; included in the motion.  I was interested to see that Senator Lenihan did not pursue that point here.  I do not think it is reasonable for a committee to take on to itself responsibility from a Minister for policy where it is clearly laid out that the Minister is responsible ultimately for the policy of the company. However, it is reasonable for a committee like this to participate in finding a framework in which policy can be <Col N="796" /> defined and formulated.  That is a different concept altogether and is one this committee should set about attempting to define.  It puts the chairman in a very critical position, depending on what reading the chairman takes of both the terms of reference as set out here in a brief form and, indeed, of the debate conducted in this House and in the other House.  In fact, I recommend that the chairman be requested to read in detail and analyse the debates in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan spoke with some experience of having been Minister for Department of Transport and Power. However, he was not properly forthcoming in attempting to explain to us the difficulties any Minister charged with a large number of State bodies must face.  Let us rationally analyse the time a Minister of State has during a week to conduct his strictly cabinet affairs, his own departmental administration affairs, the policy affairs within his own Department and then the other party and constituency business which naturally fall upon a Minister, including the odd prize-giving and the opening of this, that and the other.  In reality, the amount of time available to a Minister to sit down and even read himself into a policy discussion, let alone begin to formulate options or discuss it in any consequence, is very short.  While legally the Minister is responsible for the policies of many of these companies, I do not think that in reality that can possibly be the case.  CIE have been quoted in the debate and many of the difficulties which afflict that company at present are due to the absence of any clear-cut policy from the Minister.  That is not because the Minister or the Department do not want to provide them with one but, the formulation of an integrated transportation policy, whether for urban areas or the country, is a very difficult task.  It cannot be done as a part-time nixer, and, in a rather crude sense, it might be described as such in terms of the available time allocated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I see this committee as participating constructively in defining a framework for the formulation of policy based on a specific interpretation of the words, &ldquo;operational results&rdquo;.  I <Col N="797" /> should like the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate what the Minister's attitude might be to the line of thinking I have developed in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are 27 companies listed and, as been stated by the Minister for the Public Service in the Dáil, it would be unrealistic to expect the committee to examine all of them or even a substantial number of them between now and the dissolution of the present Dáil. I should like to see the committee consciously look at sectoral areas of the economy and take the State companies involved in those areas.  For example, they could look at energy or at transportation and examine the role of the State companies in that sector and consider how complementary their activities were.  There are three energy enterprises and I wonder how complementary or contradictory some of their activities are.  It does not appear to be an item which is discussed in other parts of our public administration.  A committee, creatively led by the chairman, could look at areas in which detailed policy discussion could be formulated and debated, thereby providing for the Minister some kind of framework in which he could ultimately formulate policy.</P>
    <P>There will be a danger&mdash;and it is something about which this committee should be warned&mdash;for Deputies and Senators to use the committee as a device to get into the personnel workings or <i>minutiae</i> of a particular company. This should be strenuously resisted. The need to make that kind of representation on behalf of the public would be considerably reduced by the progressive introduction of industrial democracy within the State sector. Much of the personnel problems or, local development problems associated with some of our State companies would be resolved and accommodated within the democratisation of the State companies.  To that extent the Minister for Labour's Bill on worker participation in, unfortunately, a very small number of State companies, is a welcome advance.</P>
    <P>The implication of the Minister for Labour's initiative in this regard will be quite considerable with regard to the the role and the internal workings of the <Col N="798" /> State companies.  Therefore, it is an added impetus to direct the energies of this committee away from probing the day-to-day policy or personnel decisions of State companies.</P>
    <P>There is much confusion in the public mind about the inefficiency of State companies or nationalised companies, as they are called, a term borrowed from the British experience which does not transfer correctly to the Irish situation. A great disservice has been done to these companies because the fault is not in the nature of the ownership of many of these companies.  The fault, in my view, is in their size and in the inevitable consequences of bureaucracy in large organisations.  It was logical that these companies, set up as State monopolies, should be large undertakings.  We now have considerable experience in the western world, and in eastern Europe, showing that very large undertakings, whether publicly or privately owned, develop an unacceptable form of bureaucracy.  There are substantial numbers of people in these organisations paid to oversee the activities of other people.  This activity slows down decision-making in a real way.  One cannot say that a company is inefficient because it is publicly owned or that a company is efficient because it is privately owned.  We have examples in Dublin of the Gas Company, which is privately owned, and the ESB which is a non-private company.  Their relative efficiency, in a number of measurable areas, comes down favourably on the side of the State enterprise.</P>
    <P>That is an argument which is constantly thrown up against the State sector, but it is a false argument.  Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary might in his reply say how he would see, in more precise terms than outlined in his speech, the areas of concern he would like the committee concentrate on. Unless some form of direction is given explicitly to the committee at their inaugural meeting we run the risk, because the pressures will be very strong, of their going off in a direction that will be counter-productive in the short-term and against the spirit of this motion.</P>
    <P>Clause 4 of the motion states:</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee shall <Col N="799" /> have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purpose of particular enquiries.</P>
    <P>That clause is of considerable importance and I should like to discuss with it the whole question of the workload on backbenchers in this and the other House.  Allied to the directives I seek, or the kind of policy framework I hope the Minister for the Public Service will see fit to produce at the first meeting of this committee, I should like to see a realistic budget indicated for the employment of specialist services.  In this day and age we must bear in mind the pressure of work on Members of the Oireachtas and the extraordinary complexity of much of the area the State sector has involved itself in, which results in a difficulty for Members to brief themselves sufficiently in order to participate in any constructive fashion in discussions with middle and senior level management from State companies on the role of that company.  Unless a realistic budget is provided for this committee and unless their structure in terms of a permanent secretariat is similar to, as the Minister has already indicated, the Joint Committee on EEC legislation then the committee cannot perform the task we are charging them with.</P>
    <P>The kind of specialist advice that we need is not simply managerial or that of accountancy firms.  I think we are going to need specialist advice from technical institutes.  I have in mind coming back to the area that I would like to see discussed in real terms in a very substantial way&mdash;the question of energy.  We would quite possibly be referred to the fact that the IIRS have that kind of technical expertise and that the committee could go to them and employ the IIRS to assist them.  I would hope that the committee would be in a position to go outside the State altogether in some instances and get a second opinion because of the position of many of our State agencies charged with <Col N="800" /> providing specialist advice.  While in no way wishing to infer that they are not independent in their viewpoint, their position relative to the different Ministers is quite obvious.  Therefore I would suggest that a special budget should be provided and that the committee should be empowered to go overseas if necessary to get a second opinion or to get an alternative technical opinion.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I feel that the Government have to be congratulated in introducing this motion.  I think that the committee can do a lot of very useful work if it recognises the limitations that face it.  I feel that the role of the State sector as outlined in Labour Party policy and by Labour Party speakers, including myself, is a role that, despite the objections of many people, is going to be expanded anyway, because there is no other sector within our economy capable of responding to the challenge that our population increase places before us.  But I feel that we have a very serious task ahead of us in monitoring and developing the effectiveness of that sector in a way that we have not done to date.  In particular there are areas where the secondary effect of certain companies should be looked at in the light of overall social objectives.  I have in mind, for example, the decision of Bord na Móna, totally outside their charged field of energy and energy creation, to locate their headquarters in Dublin in a particular area and having subsequently lost a particular battle with regard to Pembroke Street they consequently opted to invest in the one sector of the city that was quite capable in the private sense of sustaining its own commercial viability.  I should like to see, for example, the attitude of Bord na Móna queried in relation to the Government's policy, as set out in the 14-point plan, of being opposed to socially harmful urban development.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it is unfortunate that a company in the State sector could not be requested or directed, as has been set out in the draft provision to the city development plan, to put its money into areas of the city that have not had the benefit of private capital investment.  Bord na Móna, because of the recent upturn in the cost of fuel and <Col N="801" /> so on, is in an immensely strong financial position.  It could in this context have helped to boost the area in the northern part of the city, which in turn would have provided some kind of framework that would have made it easier for private capital to invest in the city.  This is a secondary area, and I use that simply as an example.  There are similar secondary areas that one could look at with regard to Irish Life, for example.  Its role as a property developer could be looked at as secondary to its primary role as an assurance company, owned 99 per cent by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>These areas overlap.  In many cases they run in line with the objectives of local authorities and yet there is no way of co-ordinating what I have described as the secondary activities of the State sector.  I would see this committee looking in some detail at the way in which State-sponsored bodies carry out their affairs and the social impact of much of their work and much of their activity outside their primary task.</P>
    <P>Those are basically my concerns with regard to this committee.  I hope that it will be inaugurated as quickly as possible. I should like some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether the provision would be made in the common budget for the specialist studies that I am talking about because if the committee is to do any work in the next year then it will need some kind of financial resources.  I strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate, if he can, what kind of secretarial facilities will be provided for the committee or whether they will be similar to the support services that have been set up for the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation.  I am not looking for any kind of permanent structure. Depending on the life of this committee, we could go into the question of a permanent secretariat.  But it is the scale and the commitment of resources at this stage that I find important.  Perhaps, if he is in a position to do so, the Parliamentary Secretary would reply to that question too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to speak after Senator Quinn who obviously has a feeling of the importance of the semi-State bodies in our economy and has made some very important points on the way in which this committee should operate if it is to have any effect.</P>
      <P>We are talking about 27 semi-State bodies, a tremendously large sector of our total economy, and we are talking also about a committee which is to be set up at a time when a general election is due in a year.  I am less optimistic than he is about what this committee can achieve because the committee will be elected, will work for six months&mdash; or nine months probably at the most&mdash; and then will totally change its composition. We want to keep our feet on the ground when we talk about this whole operation because the role set out for this committee in the Motion we are debating is so enormous and so important and so stupendous, if one is allowed to use a Hollywood term, that it is difficult to see what one can do in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of this committee being set up and I am in favour of the strengthening of the services of this committee along the lines on which Senator Quinn has spoken, but I am really not as optimistic as he is.  I do not think it is a great thing that the Government should have done it at this stage. If the Government were really serious about doing something about the semi-State bodies&mdash;and I am not talking <Col N="803" /> about this Government because this sort of motion has been before previous Governments; it is not a case of this administration <i>versus</i> previous administrations&mdash;this body should be set up at the start of a Dáil session so that it has some chance to take on the enormous task it is faced with.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  People who are interested in semi-State bodies and who are going to serve on this committee are not going to treat it as a joke. If it is just for the optics, then it can be set up with a few months to go.  We have got a semi-State body set up with six months to go.  We have worker participation in semi-State bodies.  It is great for the Government in power; they can say they have implemented something from the points they put before the electorate.  But the unfortunate people who are going to serve on the committee will be there for six months and then wiped out after that.  What can they achieve?</P>
    <P>I am a person who has always had an interest in the operation of our semi-State bodies.  I have tried to speak on every debate which has come up in this House on semi-State bodies and one of the points I have made is that it is remarkable how supportive is our attitude to semi-State bodies in this country.  Every time a motion comes up in Leinster House for an increase in the borrowing powers of CIE, Aer Lingus or the National Stud or whatever body, it is passed with a certain amount of debate.  The basic thing is that everybody is in favour because everybody here believes that semi-State bidies are an essential component of our economy and must be supported.  This is rather strange if one thinks, as the Parliamentary Secretary has thought and has written in the press on a number of occasions, that one of our problems is that we ape the British system, that we cannot get away from the things we have inherited from Britain, that we are a sort of permanent &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo; for the UK.  The Parliamentary Secretary has written with a great deal of feeling about getting away from the UK umbrella, and one of the most important ways in which we have got away from the United Kingdom's administrative <Col N="804" /> system is by setting up the semi-State bodies.  They are a total divergence from anything that has happened in the UK.</P>
    <P>I have had an opportunity to look through the early debates&mdash;I think it was in 1927&mdash;when Mr. McGilligan, who was a very distinguished Minister for Finance, was attempting to set up the Shannon scheme.  He was taking a tremendous gamble, as he saw it and as he said afterwards.  At the time when the Shannon scheme was set up it was the precursor of semi-State bodies in this country.  He was setting up a scheme which was to do away with private enterprise.  There were various private enterprise electricity systems in the State at that time.  He was taking a gamble on certain expertise that was at his disposal, on certain expertise that was at the disposal of the firm he eventually employed, Siemens-Schukert, to set up the Shannon scheme.  This was a total divergence from the sort of tradition he had inherited and Mr. McGilligan, to his eternal credit, brought this legislation through Dáil Éireann.  It took him months and months of debate.  He was opposed vigorously by the Labour Party of the day.  He set up the Shannon scheme as a semi-State body.  It contracted out its work to Siemens-Schukert.  The Shannon scheme was built and it was one of the most far-sighted events in the foundation of the State.  Mr. McGilligan backed this scheme to the hilt, against the views of his colleagues on many occasions.  It took months of the most harrowing debate, but he set up this scheme.  It turned out to be a tremendous success.  The whole ethos of the scheme was opposed to the free enterprise, do-it-yourself, small company system of electricity generation, which at that time was the philosophy in Britain and was the philosophy among various companies who were already generating electricity in the Republic.  He was one of those far-sighted people who saw over the top of the hill, set up this company and the Shannon scheme came into being and from that sprang the ESB.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about that particular debate and Mr. McGilligan's part in it was that it was the only <Col N="805" /> debate to establish a State-sponsored body in which there was very strong opposition from the floor, and I would remind Senators Quinn, Horgan and Harte that it was the Labour Party who opposed it.  I do not think they were necessarily wrong at the time because they had a point of view and there was a very strong point of view to be put against that particular scheme.  I am not going to give the Labour Party's policy.  I am an Independent.  I am just trying to give my view of the whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway I should like to thank the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly obviously supported that.  He has written very strongly about our inheritance of the British tradition.  I might remind the Parliamentary Secretary that one of the first and most important breakaways from the British bureaucratic tradition was the setting up of our own companies. This was tremendously important and its success led to other bodies being set up in the same sort of way, with a minimal amount of debate in many cases.</P>
      <P>To be absolutely fair about this&mdash; before the Parliamentary Secretary gets in and gives himself a party plug&mdash;the other person who deserved credit in this matter was Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He was the person who introduced the new wave of semi-State bodies and he was the person who again saw over the hill.  In my reading of history, as far as Dáil debates are concerned particulary, the two people who really deserve credit, who were not just looking at the achievements of the day and could see somewhat into the future, were Deputies McGilligan and Lemass.  They were the people who really saw what was needed. The gap was that private enterprise and private capital could not supply what was required in very many areas of this country&mdash;that was the crucial thing. What was required was that the State should step in, put up the capital and organise the enterprise in a way in which it would work commercially and work beneficially for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These bodies were set up and given <Col N="806" /> boards of directors.  They were given two tasks.  One of them was to generate electricity, for example, in the case of the ESB and to sell it at no cost to the taxpayer.  After the capital investment was made they were meant to be commercial enterprises.  But, later on, a second facet entered this whole operation. These bodies acquired, whether they were given it or not, a social role. We do not have to look very far to see the tension between the commercial role on one side and the social role on the other.  It is absolutely clear in the ESB and CIE.  This has been one of the great problems about these bodies when it comes to terms of public accountability.</P>
    <P>On one hand CIE, for example, operate very many services which are clearly uneconomic.  Are they purely a commercial operation?  The terms under which they operate would indicate that they are a purely commercial operation. But everybody knows, and every Member of this House knows, that they are not a purely commercial operation, that they need to keep services going particularly in the parts of the country in which they do not get a great return. This is one of the great problems of bodies like CIE, the ESB and a number of the bodies we are considering.  This is setting the background for a committee like this.  What criteria have we got to judge these semi-State bodies?  This is going to be the most difficult task for a committee of this nature&mdash;under what criteria will it work?</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that the private sector is in a sense an easier sector to judge.  If a firm in the private sector fails to make a profit, then the shareholders kick up a hell of a row and the firm takes certain precautions; it cuts down its staff or cuts back its expenditure in various ways and repairs the damage.  But when a public body is in a situation like this there is no way in which one can judge whether it is being efficient or whether it is doing a good job.  Many of these bodies like CIE or the ESB are providing a social service, on the one hand, and are trying to make some attempt to break even, on the other.  It is virtually an impossible task to judge under what criteria are they operating successfully. For a committee to take on this sort of <Col N="807" /> task is asking a great deal in a very short time.</P>
    <P>One of the things that worries me about this committee is what exactly it will achieve.  What does the Government want it to achieve?  Governments look on bodies like this rather differently from the rest of us, not only the present Government but any Government who set up a body like this.  This is not a special baby of the Coalition&mdash; if the Coalition Government were really serious about this they would have set up the body a long time ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of suggesting anything.  If you wait a moment I will make a few good suggestions. What I am saying is that the Government may look on this&mdash;I do not know how Senator Markey looks on this&mdash;as an operation to keep the problems of the semi-State bodies a bit further away from the Government so that the large CIE deficit or the problems of the ESB will not be blamed on the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about the present Government but any Government who set up a committee like this could look on the committee in those terms.  They could say &ldquo;We are faced with CIE losing £30 million&rdquo;.  Of course, the whole phrase &ldquo;losing £30 million&rdquo; is a phrase which needs to be examined, because CIE could say that it was the social cost of maintaining the railways, the buses and other forms of transport.  To see newspaper headlines stating that CIE have lost £30 million is tragic because we are not looking at CIE in the right way.  We should do some sort of social costing and say that, if CIE are going to keep operating, this is the cost and that is it.  To talk of CIE losing £30 million is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Government can look on this as fending off the problems of semi-State <Col N="808" /> bodies, putting them one step further down the line.  So far as I can see, this committee can be effective only if it can really get away from the nuts and bolts, and the day-to-day problems of the semi-State bodies.  The committee has nothing to do with them.  Its role is to assess the place of the semi-State bodies in Irish life.  It must not act in any sense as an adjunct or a separate part of the Public Accounts Committee, just going through the accounts of semi-State bodies.  That would be absolute nonsense.  It is only too easy for them to be snowed by expert opinion on one side or the other.  What this committee has to look at is the overall role of the semi-State bodies and their position and importance in Irish life.</P>
    <P>The committee will have to look at the sort of problem that Aer Lingus face on their trans-Atlantic route, which is costing the country £2 million or £3 million a year.  Do we, as a country, need to have a trans-Atlantic service? Are we prepared to put a Government subsidy into a trans-Atlantic service? That is the sort of problem a committee like this should be looking at.  It should be putting forward a development policy for the various semi-State bodies to the Government.  The whole point of this committee&mdash;and I want to make this point very clearly to the Minister as he is here&mdash;is that this committee must act as an all party committee talking about semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I said earlier on that there is a supportive feeling in Leinster House generally for semi-State bodies.  What the committee must do is to look at the ways in which the semi-State bodies play a crucial role in Irish life and they must support that.  It is no use trying to go through accounts and talk about cutting off £1,000 here and £5,000 there. That is not what this committee is about. The committee should be basically on the side of the executives in these bodies, putting forward programmes to the Government and putting forward a way in which the semi-State bodies can continue to play a crucial role in Irish life.  The committee should be basically supportive.  If the committee turns out to be one of these niggling, hair-scratching, committees which is going to examine every item of expenditure, <Col N="809" /> then what will happen?  The semi-State bodies will come in with their accountants, the committee will produce its accountants and they will cancel each other out.  Nobody will get anywhere.</P>
    <P>It is no use looking at the nuts and bolts.  That is for the executives of the various semi-State bodies.  There has been a good deal of discussion about two points.  Firstly, which bodies should be in and which bodies should be out. I have some sympathy for the Minister on this.  It is a very hard decision to make.  Once the committee gets going, after a couple of years of operating it will become fairly clear which bodies should be in and which should be out.  I am not going to talk about that.  This committee must look at things in the long term.  They must help the executives of the semi-State bodies to think about their policy and their relation to Irish life in the long term.  Otherwise it is just another weapon of bureaucracy to slow everything up, to slow up applications for expenditure, to slow up development of semi-State bodies.  If the committee takes that sort of role it would be much better if it was never formed at all.</P>
    <P>One of the things which worries me greatly is that this body could turn itself into something examining the nuts and bolts instead of looking at the overall policy, which it must do.  In a sense, even in those terms, the ultimate arbiter of whether the taxpayer's money is being spent correctly or not is, of course, the Oireachtas itself.  This is a committee of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, so ultimately the problem of whether public money is being spent rightly or wrongly rests with us as Members of the two Houses.  This committee could play an important role.  The problems it faces are not obvious and on the surface, they are subtle and difficult problems that require a great deal of thought and consideration.</P>
    <P>With 27 bodies to consider, the mind really baulks at how the committee will work.  Perhaps the Minister would say something in his reply to this debate as to how he thinks, in technical terms, this committee will work.  How many of these semi-State bodies will it tackle at a <Col N="810" /> time?  When a committee of 11 is faced with, for example, a problem of the ESB or Aer Lingus or CIE, the whole structure of these organisations is so complex that it will take a layman&mdash;and all members of the committee will be laymen going into this <i>ab initio</i>&mdash;weeks and months to really get to grips with the situation.  It is absolutely out of the question to think that in the life of the present Dáil the committee could deal with more than one or two of these bodies. I would like the Minister to say what sort of time scale the Department of the Public Service has in mind, because that is the Department that has concocted this committee.  What way does the Department think it will operate?</P>
    <P>I am one of these people, as I have said to the Minister, who has a considerable interest in semi-State bodies and I have had discussions with officials of some of the bodies on this panel here. The problems they face are complex&mdash; for example, the problem we all face currently of getting home on the buses. That is a union problem as far as CIE are concerned.  Will the committee look at the problem of labour relations in the semi-State bodies?  It is a tremendous area.  Both the unions and the semi-State bodies need to up-date their ideas in this whole field.  There are all sorts of opportunities for doing this, but will this committee look into that sort of problem? The unions themselves should look into their special relationship with the semi-State bodies, and the semi-State body management should be prepared to go along with the unions and say &ldquo;Let us see what we can do as State bodies. As State bodies, we have no profit or loss criteria.  We have no warning signal that goes up, as if we were quoted in the stock exchange that the shareholders are going to withdraw their money.  We just cannot make people redundant as if we were a private company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is the real relationship between the trade unions and the semi-State bodies?  This is a deep and subtle question.  If I might refer to something that Senator Quinn has said, it is not going to be solved by the Minister for Labour's Worker Participation Bill. Just putting workers on the management of these boards will not solve the problem.  In the first place the workers <Col N="811" /> will be voted on by the other members of the staff.  The danger is that when they get on to the boards of semi-State bodies they will be cut off from their colleagues because they are acting as directors and because they are not, on the other hand, going to act as proper directors.  They will not fulfil their function there.  That situation is for the optics.  It is for the next election.  Very many trade unionists would agree with me that the way this worker participation in semi-State bodies is being done is not the way it should be done.</P>
    <P>Where does the committee come in on the great problems?  Senator Harte, for example, will understand such problems, the great problems that exist between the management of the semi-State bodies and the unions involved. What I would like to see is something being done to get the unions, management as a whole and the State sector to look at these problems again, because we have got to a stage where the semi-State bodies are very big and so powerful, and such a big sector of our economy, and the unions are also very big and powerful, and it does not matter what Government are in power, the unions can exert their pressure.  They would want to look at the whole situation again.  They have much more in common than appears.  The whole trick is to have the unions fighting against management, but in fact it is greatly to the benefit of the workers if a semi-State body is running properly and efficiently and reasonably well.  Ultimately it is the taxpayer who has to put up the money to keep these bodies in business.  It is to the benefit of the workers and the management that the body runs efficiently and well, and the time has come for both workers and management to realise this, instead of one appearing doing one thing and another doing the other, and one holding off and not making agreement.  It is about time we re-examined this whole situation.  This is the sort of thing this committee is bound to think about.  It is going to be one of the great problems.</P>
    <P>My real fear is that this will just end up as another piece of bureaucracy, that the committee will not be in a position to put any new ideas forward. <Col N="812" /> Its only real value is if it puts new ideas forward, if it can essentially help the relationship between the public and semi-State bodies, which at the moment is, in many cases, fairly poor.  In every debate in which I have talked about semi-State bodies, I have said &ldquo;Do something about your public relations&rdquo;. It is often very bad.  In some cases it is non-existent.  It has got to do something about the public and semi-State bodies; it has got to do something about the relationship between the Oireachtas and the semi-State bodies; and then it has got to, in some sense, think of the taxpayer and the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Worker Participation Bill that is coming up is not satisfactory because it puts the workers in an impossible position, and I think in many senses makes the situation worse than it is, I have said, and I have written in the press, that I think a two-tier system on which the workers were represented with other representatives such as local representatives, consumer representatives, taxpayer representatives, Members of the Oireachtas on semi-State bodies, would be a good idea.  We want to think about these semi-State bodies in a new way.</P>
    <P>My worry is that this committee will not achieve what it should.  I should like to see the development of a two-tier system in which Members of the Oireachtas could be upper-tier supervisors or directors of semi-State bodies and I would like to see this committee being in a position ultimately to be a nominating committee to semi-State bodies for a couple of Oireachtas Members.  There is no point in putting down an amendment to this effect because it would totally change the function of this committee.  It might be one of the things that emerged out of its deliberations.  However, I see great opportunities.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn has talked about the back-up, and it is absolutely essential if this committee is going to fulfil its functions that there should be proper backing.  If the committee cannot call on the experts that it needs, if it is in a situation in which it is us <i>versus</i> them&mdash;I hope it will not be&mdash;if the semi-State bodies immediately go on the defensive and say these people are <Col N="813" /> leaning on us, breathing down our necks, they will snow the committee with documents; all they have got to do is produce so much paper that nobody knows where they are.  As Members of the Seanad we get so much paper per week that if we were to read it all we would be in St. Patrick's Hospital.  It is nonsense the sort of rubbish we get, statistics this long, and if the semi-State bodies start sending it into us, we are dead.</P>
    <P>If you do not have a proper back-up service and if you do not have people who can in some way sift this sort of thing out, the thing is a dead loss.  I do not want this committee to be set up so that it is us <i>versus</i> them, so that the managers of these bodies feel that we are breathing down their necks and must push us into the sea with mountains of paper.</P>
    <P>I would hope to see some team work. I would hope to see the managers of the semi-State bodies coming one at a time, and saying: &ldquo;Look, these are our problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public.  These are our problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  These are our constraints and our problems.  In what way can this committee help us?&rdquo;  That is the way I would see this committee achieving something.  As Senator Quinn said, there are various hook-ups whereby the various semi-State bodies cooperate, but I do not think it can really do much unless the managerial side, the executive side, of the semi-State bodies are very open and say, &ldquo;These are the problems and what we would like to do is develop an overall strategy.  In developing overall strategy we need some commitment from our Minister about expenditure.  That is what counts as far as the semi-State bodies are concerned.  The committee would then have to ask &ldquo;Is this really in the public interest?&rdquo;  I think then it would be fulfilling an absolutely essential and crucial role.  Any other way of operating it will be just another Dáil Committee which will be buried under mountains of paper in the basement of Leinster House like many of them are.</P>
    <P>As long as I have been in this House I have been a supporter of the committee <Col N="814" /> system, and I am very pleased to see the Coalition Government really begnning the introduction of committees. We have had Committees on the Wildlife Bill and the Drugs Bill. That is a splendid move forward, because I do not think these things can be dealt with in committee by the full house.</P>
    <P>One of the constant complaints when you read the Dáil debates, particularly the Dáil debates on this motion, is that there are so many Deputies and so many Senators involved in committees, involved as representatives in Europe, involved in this or in that, that there are no Deputies or Senators&mdash;I do not think there are half enough Senators involved&mdash;left to serve on these committees. This situation has occurred before and I, on behalf of the Independents, put in a very strong plea that an Independent Member be included in all these committees.  There are a number of Independents here, perhaps in the spirit and not in the flesh now, apart from myself and Senator Brosnahan, but Senator Browne has just been speaking.  The Independents would be happy and willing to serve on these committees.  We have made this plea before in those happy and far away days when both Senators Horgan and Robinson were Independents, before they saw the light and transferred to the opposite benches.  We managed by dint of persuasion of this Government to convince the Government that it was worth while putting Independents on these committees.</P>
    <P>The committee for overseeing European legislation was duly nominated and Senators Robinson was the Independent nominee.  I would say that Senator Robinson has fulfilled a very distinguished role on that committee, and I would like the Minister to remember that she came on as an Independent. Some time ago the Fine Gael Chief Whip in the Seanad approached me and asked me to nominate an Independent to sit on this committee.  The Independents were consulted and a name was put forward.  I hope that, in view of the constant complaints from Dáil Éireann that the Deputies do not have time to serve on committees and that there are not enough of them, there will be an <Col N="815" /> Independent on this committee.  The Independents are in a position to do this; they are prepared to play a really full role on all these committees&mdash;you have only to look at the case of Senator Robinson.  She is not an Independent anymore, but that is her business.  She was an Independent on the EEC Committee for a long period and she played a very full and constructive role.  So when the time comes, I hope the Minister will see fit to nominate an Independent on this extremely important committee.  It is only fair, seeing that there are eight or nine Independents in the Oireachtas, that they should be represented.  They should have an opportunity and should not be totally excluded by parties who, on the one hand, say &ldquo;We do not have enough people to serve on committees&rdquo; and, the other hand say, &ldquo;We want all the places.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister for the Public Service to bear in mind that the Independents are ready and willing to serve on this committee and they hope that when the time comes they will be represented.</P>

      <P>There is far too much taxpayers' money involved in semi-State bodies to leave them outside the ambit of an examination under this Parliament.  Any bodies which employ about 60,000 people and have a combined turnover of well over £5 million must have public accountability.  It must also be borne in mind that the taxpayers are the parallel of shareholders in private industry and as such they should have at their disposal, through their elected representatives, full accountability from bodies which obtain such a large amount of finance each year through Parliament.  Contrary to what Senator West tried to suggest was the main objective behind the setting up of this committee, I think the motive behind this exercise is to allay the public unease, the public frustration, scepticism&mdash;even cynicism&mdash;which has grown up over the years as a result of having a situation where there were so many semi-State bodies which were not accountable for their overall operations to their elected representatives or the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many reservations have been expressed in regard to this move.  Reservations <Col N="816" /> will, I suppose, always be expressed in regard to something which is new. The only surprising feature of the establishment of this committee to me is that it has taken so long for it to be established.  The reservations embrace such things as that now is not the most practical time for it, that it should be established, say, in the first year of a Government's term of office.  That is fair enough, I suppose, except that this motion has been on the Order Paper for some time and this Government are only three years into their term of office.  The fact that they have proposed this motion is to their credit.  There have been previous Governments which had a much longer period of time to put forward such a motion and they failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Reservation was expressed in regard to non-commercial bodies not being sufficiently within the scope of this Joint Committee.  This committee will have enough work on its hands in looking into the operations of the bodies which are set out in Schedules A and B, bodies such as Aer Lingus, CIE, Agricultural Credit Corporation and RTE, without having to bother in the initial stages with other semi-State bodies.  If this committee functions as we hope it will, given a sufficient amount of time, knowledge and experience, I do not see any difficulty about bringing non-commercial semi-State bodies within the ambit of its surveillance as time goes by.</P>
    <P>This is altogether a new departure in parliamentary procedure and, as such, I think it is right that in the debates not only in this House but in the Dáil sufficient thought should be given to ensuring that it has, when it commences its operations, as precise as possible terms of reference and that the mechanics of its operations be as exact and as reasonable as possible.  I think the Minister for Finance has veered from his original stance in regard to what this committee should look at.  He has, as is evident from his comments on the debate on the motion in Dáil Éireann, gone a little bit further than perhaps he originally intended in regard to the committee looking at the policies of the semi-State bodies.  It is no harm here to read into the record what he said, and I <Col N="817" /> quote from column 685 of the Dáil Official Report of Wednesday, 24th November:</P>
    <P>We are allowing them to examine reports and, as we know, reports of trading and commercial bodies frequently cover matters other than the trading accounts and the profit and loss accounts of the concerns in question. We are going beyond the reports and accounts and allowing the committee to examine the overall operations and results.</P>
    <P>Now comes the important sentence.</P>
    <P>Examining these will inevitably involve a study of policy, albeit past policy, but one cannot debate the results of past policy without forming a view as to whether or not the continuation of such policy would be proper in the future.</P>
    <P>I think we can rest our minds at this point&mdash;policy will be discussed, and rightly so.  If one takes a figure from a balance sheet of a semi-State body and asks some of the officials &ldquo;Do you feel you have spent enough money in the execution of your responsibilities, or do you feel that the money you have spent was spent in the right manner?&rdquo;, this is going into the field of policy and the answer which emanates from such questioning will perhaps lead to an amendment of the policy of that semi-State company for the future.  It is therefore important that we should get as precisely as possible the terms of reference.  We want to avoid at all costs a defence being able to be put forward by an official of a body in Schedules A and B that it is not within the jurisdiction of the committee to go into such and such an aspect.  We have had this in the past when the Minister was not able to deal with questions in the Dáil on certain aspects of semi-State bodies, and we want to get away from that situation. Therefore it is important that we should set out the criteria for the functioning of this committee as precisely as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mechanics of operation of the committee, we have again to try and be both comprehensive and reasonable to ensure that we are not imposing on the members of this committee what would amount to an impossible task.  Yet we must ensure that <Col N="818" /> we are giving them work which will result in positive conclusions coming forward.  I think the mechanics of operation must start from a base; and the base is that this committee must have a positive legal and constitutional standing as regards both the coming forward of witnesses and the production of documents for its surveillance.  No matter what other facilities and rights it is given to enable it to exercise&mdash;such as a secretariat, such as even allowing it to operate from public and private stances, or allowing it to break up into sub-committees to enable it to concentrate more adequately on a greater number of semi-State bodies&mdash; unless we give it without demur, these teeth, the power of being able to produce as it wishes all the witnesses and all the documentation, then we could well find ourselves with a mountain producing only a mouse from all that work.</P>
    <P>I have no great fear about this committee excessively or unduly interfering in the operations of the bodies it will be examining.  Public representatives have so much work already laid on their shoulders that they will neither have the inclination nor the time to indulge in trivial matters in regard to the operations of semi-State concerns.  But it is important that we should avoid a situation which would lead only to a cursory examination of these bodies.  The most important aspect here would be, if we are to provide a secretariat, not to provide civil servants who will be facing semi-civil servants, as it were.  We must have a fresh outlook brought into this whole matter of committee work.  If management, professional and financial experts who can assist the public representatives in their work are needed, they should be brought into the committee from outside the civil service or semi-State service field altogether.  That, I think, is probably the most important aspect of the secretarial or professional assistance we want to see in the operation of this committee.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there will be operational problems.  There is no committee which has been established that has not had such difficulties.  The criteria under which this committee will function may perhaps be a bit hazy <Col N="819" /> at the moment, but I have no doubt that when the State bodies which they are going to investigate were established the criteria by which they operated were also somewhat hazy.  It is only as time goes by and experience is gained that we will have very positive and definite guidelines coming forth and establishing themselves.  It is a developing matter and we should not look upon it as something which must be set down initially as being perfect in its operation and which we would not wish to see varied in any way, because it will be varied through experience and the passage of time.</P>
    <P>All Senators welcome the establishment of this committee.  It is enabling this House to launch itself into operations which we have looked forward to performing.  Under our constitutional position we have a limited investigatory function in regard to Money Bills.  This will enable us to examine the accounts and financial management of semi-State bodies with all the implications involved in that.  I am quite certain that every Member of this House welcomes the establishment of this committee.  It only remains for me to extend to it good wishes in its onerous duties.  I am confident it will easily repay the Government for what they are putting into its establishment.</P>

      <P>Senator Browne said two things at the beginning of his speech, both of which could not be true. He said the Government were naïve in putting forward this motion and then, virtually in the same breath, he said that she Government knew damn well what they were doing in regard to this motion.  I would have thought that Senator Browne, as a former member of a Government, would prefer to believe that Governments knew damn well what they were doing than that they were being naïve in what they were doing.  I would agree with the latter interpretation, that Governments know very well what they are doing.  Whether they are right or wrong is another matter.  It could be argued that the wording of this motion could be changed to improve it or to make it <Col N="820" /> more flexible or more specific, depending on the way you look at it, but I am happy with the wording of the resolution. The committee which the resolution will set up will be a major adjunct to the work of Parliament and of the semi-State bodies themselves.  It is a matter of concern that it has taken so long to set it up, but now that it has been set up it is not much use talking about it as a mere cosmetic or window-dressing affair.  The Minister's expression of hope that this body would become a permanent one will relegate such criticisms very rapidly into limbo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I would like to say in broad terms about the motion before us is in relation to the general concept of accountability.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when he was introducing this, said &ldquo;In the private sector shareholders ultimately control the companies in which their money is invested.  At annual general meetings and elsewhere they get an opportunity to dictate policy.  If they feel that their interests are not properly served they are in a position to replace the boards.&rdquo;  I smiled when the Parliamentary Secretary made this statement because he must know as well as anybody who knows anything about the world of business that this statement about accountability, while true in theory, has important limitations in practice.  In practice, in the private sector accountability is strictly limited.  Certainly it is accountability to shareholders, but shareholders are not necessarily as many or as powerful as this sort of thinking implies.  This sort of thinking is the ultimate <i>rationale</i> of the economic system we have today.  The argument is that, because ownership is so diffuse and the unit of participation in ownership is so small, we have effectively created a society in which everybody holds someone to account.  In private companies, as anybody who knows anything about private companies will confirm, the important fact is not whether there are 25 shareholders or 25,000 shareholders, but how many shareholders control how many shares.  This is as true in business as it is in politics.  Even though the Parliamentary Secretary may have talked about shareholders having the opportunity to dictate policy, many of <Col N="821" /> us will be familiar with newspaper accounts of meetings at which shareholders turned up to protest about the way in which companies ran their business and at which they are virtually after much sound and fury, voted into insignificance by massive block votes held by a comparatively small number of controlling shareholders.</P>
    <P>Accountability in the private sector is not by any means what it might be. This is why I am glad that in the public sector we are taking the word &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; seriously and are making provision for a committee which will institutionalise the concept of accountability, which is a fundamentally democratic one.</P>
    <P>The question of what the companies concerned should be accountable for is also a relevant one.  There are substantial differences between the private and public sectors.  Most companies, whether public or private, produce goods or services.  In the private sector the emphasis is almost fully on efficiency, whereas in the public sector this need not&mdash;in some cases must not&mdash;be the sole criterion.  The other major criteria affecting public companies, especially if they are involved in the provision of essential goods or services and are in a monopoly situation, is not only efficiency but equity.  Private companies are concerned very little with equity.  They are concerned that the goods and services they produce should be efficiently produced and sold.  They are not particularly concerned with the distribution of these goods or services. One of the fundamental thrusts behind the creation of the semi-State bodies in certain areas has been to ensure that the provision of essential goods and services is informed by the concept of equity as well by the concept of efficiency.  I would see this overlying pattern as one which should inform all the committee's activities.</P>
    <P>I would disagree with Senator Trevor West and with other speakers who charged that the committee would have no teeth and would be virtually powerless. We have had a lot of information during the course of the debates in both Houses about ways in which the terms of reference might be interpreted. Ultimately, the committee would have <Col N="822" /> a major job of interpretating the terms of reference itself.  Even within the terms of the motion there are some fairly important clauses that cannot be ignored. Clause 1 of the motion reads, &ldquo;...to report to both Houses of the Oireachtas and make recommendations where appropriate.&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Make recommendations&rdquo; is a very important phrase. We are not going to find ourselves recommending to this House that a semi-State body should buy a computer rather than use long division in the preparation of their accounts.  The members of this committee, of whom I hope to be one, will be making recommendations of a far more deep-seated and far-reaching kind.  In clause 2 there is the provision, &ldquo;That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records ...&rdquo;. This is a power which I believe will be responsibly used by the committee and will not be resented by the executives of the semi-State bodies to whom it might refer.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the particular terms of reference which caused some alarm to Senator Noel Browne is contained in clause 3, which allows the executives or directors of a commercial State-sponsored body to ensure that the joint committee shall refrain from publishing confidential information regarding that body's plans.  This is, if you like, a fail-safe provision, but it has been interpreted as tying the hands of the committee in such a way as to ensure that they will effectively be neutralised, that they may be privy to the greatest possible scandals within these semi-State bodies and will not be able to inform either House of the Oireachtas or the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>The situation will be quite different in practice.  There will be a face-to-face situation between the committee and the executives concerned.  If the committee become convinced that the power which is given to the executives of semi-State companies under section 3 is being abused by them, I have not the slightest doubt that the members of this committee, either jointly or severally, will make this fact known, without necessarily breaching anything which they are not allowed to, to the Minister for Finance, so that, if necessary, the <Col N="823" /> terms of reference of the committee may be changed.  I do not see this, in practice, occuring, but the safeguard is there that if there is any danger that this power will be improperly used, the committee can ask the Oireachtas to extend their powers.</P>
    <P>There are some negative reasons for supporting the establishment of such a committee, the chief one being that hopefully it will reduce&mdash;although it will never bring to an end&mdash;the uninformed criticism of semi-State companies which emanates sometimes from within the Oireachtas and often from without.  The second reason for the establishment of such a committee is that it will strengthen the position of the State-sponsored bodies in many regards.  One Senator brought up the spectre of members of this committee being in a particularly strong position to influence executives or directors of semi-State bodies in a political fashion. I see it acting in the other direction. The mere existence of this committee with their powers will be a powerful adjunct to executives and directors of semi-State companies to enable them to fight pressures of any kind on them from any source, commercial or political, to exercise their powers and functions in an improper way.  The threat of exposure is a substantial one. Executives of these companies, especially of the companies with a high employment content, have better things to do with their time than to fight off improper requests of one kind or another.  The existence of this committee will be one of their strongest weapons in the fight against this activity.</P>
    <P>I now turn briefly to the positive reasons for the creation of this committee. In broad terms, the committee will be supportive of these State-sponsored bodies.  I speak for the Labour Party when I say that our attitude to the State-sponsored bodies is a supportive one.  One of our few arguments with the concept of State-sponsored bodies might be that there are not enough of them in certain areas. Senator West has the advantage over us in that he was not around in 1927 to <Col N="824" /> say things which he might live to regret having said.</P>
    <P>The other main positive area of support for this motion derives from the accountability factor.  I have already made my opinion clear that it should refer to accountability, not only in terms of efficiency in the operation of these companies, but in terms of equity and the distribution of the goods and services they provide.</P>
    <P>There is another area which has not been mentioned very much up to now, that is, these companies' relationships with the public.  Most of these companies can be divided into two groups those which sell goods and services directly to the public or are directly in contact with the public, and those which are one or more moves from the public.  One of the important functions of this committee, or of a sub-committee of this committee, could be to examine consumer relations in certain areas.  I know that a well-run State company have nothing to fear from this sort of investigation.  I believe that there are possibilities for considerable mutual misunderstanding which may need to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Another important area is the policy area.  Senator Markey has already referred to it.  I will not go into it in any detail except to quote from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech when he introduced the motion.  He made it clear that the committee should examine reports and accounts and overall operational results.  I cannot emphasise those last three words enough, &ldquo;overall operational results&rdquo;.  You cannot examine and analyse results without examining and analysing objectives. You cannot examine objectives without examining policies.  This is where policies come in.  It is absolutely at one with the terms of reference of this motion and, indeed, the speeches made by the Parliamentary Secretary, that this committee should find themselves in the policy area.  In this policy area we will see, not a nitty-gritty, foot-in-the-door sort of direction by the politicians who will be on this committee but the overall elaboration of political guidelines within which these companies will be encouraged to make their own decisions, responsible as they must always be, to <Col N="825" /> the Minister.  Many of these companies have in the past been the worse off for the absence of such guidelines.  This will be political input in the best sense.  It will be one of the finest creations of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If this is to be done, it must be done well.  I will do no more at this stage than echo the pleas which have been made from all sides of both Houses for the appropriate services to be provided to the members of the committee.  I suspect that both Houses of the Oireachtas are very low in the European league when it comes to providing themselves with either salary or back-up services.  I do not propose to make a fuss about salaries because there is never, as somebody has said, a right time to make a fuss about parliamentarians' salaries. There is always a right time to make a fuss about parliamentarians' back-up services, because if they are not provided on time, the salary question becomes immaterial.</P>

      <P>I am most grateful to the House for the encouraging way in which Senators have received this motion.  There were doubting Thomases; that is natural and it is a healthy sign of democracies that people who have doubts should express them. I would share the view of Senator Horgan and others that this committee will, with a little experience, turn out to be one of the most effective weapons forged by the Oireachtas since its foundation.</P>
      <P>The Committee will only be as good as its Members.  If we were to spend another couple of years drafting the motion, or redrafting it, or amending it to meet all the wishes of people in both Houses and outside, we would still be left with the reality that the committee will only be as good as its members and chairman.  A great burden of responsibility will rest on the first chairman and members because they will set the pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West and other Senators have asked me what would be the criteria.  The committee must determine the criteria within the mandate given to <Col N="826" /> them by both Houses.  The criteria will not be the same for all companies.  What I would desire is that the committee would be concerned with getting an adequate return for public moneys.  By an adequate return I mean, if possible, sufficient return to remunerate capital which has been given to several of these semi-State bodies, because an inadequate return is paid by quite a number of them and there are few reasons, other than traditional ones, for not giving an adequate return.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I consider it important that the committee should endeavour to see whether the companies are given an adequate return for the payments made by the public for their services.  Remember, the criterion that we adopted in determining what State-sponsored bodies we would bring within the ambit of this committee and which ones we would leave outside at present, is that we would review concerns which sold goods and services to the public.  It must be our aim to ensure that the public get the best possible return for what they pay for those goods and services.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the committee will be concerned to identify what might be regarded as the non-commercial activities of some of these concerns, non-commercial to the extent that they are activities which are not self-financing but which the committee in its wisdom may consider to be desirable from a social viewpoint.  I think it desirable that such activities be identified in fairness to the public who have to pay for such services possibly by paying a higher fee for other services or else through general taxation because the community should know what services are found profitable and then in due course decide whether or not they wish to continue to pay for them either through taxation or by transfer of cost to other services.  In fairness to the semi-State bodies themselves they have in the past had to accept a certain amount of criticism which was unjustified and some times they suffered a harmful reputation because people visited the cost of social and unprofitable services on the whole concern.  One can think of a number of such concerns; CIE is one.  Some of its services are profitable though they are fewer now <Col N="827" /> than they used to be because of the competition of private transport.  Other services which are conducted by CIE are highly unprofitable and the cost of those unprofitable services which are being inadequately used are met today by people who use the profitable services paying more than is necessary for the profitable services.  The general body of taxpayers also pay to the tune nowadays of £32 million direct subsidy and that is not small cheese.  Other indirect subsidies are paid for out of general taxation.  There is a case for recent direct subsidies like the subsidy in respect of transport for our senior citizens.  That itself is a subsidy to CIE and is an identifiable one as it happens. But were it not paid, then CIE's overall deficit would be even greater.  So while it is a service which is charged against the Social Welfare vote, in truth, it could just as easily be charged against the Transport vote because the services for old people are provided only in the valley periods.  If CIE did not get remuneration especially for those valley periods there would be even fewer vehicles operating during that time of day.</P>
    <P>I do not want to name any particular company because there are 27 scheduled to the resolution which would be the mandate for the committee.  The question has been asked here and elsewhere why are non-commercial concerns being excluded.  For a very practical reason. In the first instance I think this committee has more than enough to look at for some years to come.  In the lifetime of the present Dáil and Seanad there is little likelihood that the committee can get to look at even more than a quarter of the bodies which are scheduled.  We deliberately put them all in so as to allow the committee to make its own selections in regard to which concerns they wish to examine in the first instance.  Experience elsewhere indicates that the committee would probably work in this way.  It would, at a particular time, decide that within, say, the following year it would look at three or four companies.  It might, on the other hand, take two or three or four large ones and a number of minor ones and on completion of that work <Col N="828" /> would take a look at others.  Again, it might possibly start the research work on a second group or the secretariat might commence looking at this second group while the committee was seized of the first.</P>
    <P>The mere knowledge that a concern is subject to scrutiny by the committee would undoubtedly bring about a different approach in a number of State concerns and I believe&mdash;as a number of Senators have expressed&mdash;that it will be a positive approach.  I share entirely the view expressed by Senator Horgan that the establishment of this committee will relieve these concerns of political pressures and undesirable approaches. Many years ago&mdash;long before I assumed my present responsibility in the Department of the Public Service&mdash;I had discussions with chief executives of a number of semi-State bodies about the possibility of the establishment of a committee such as this and what their approach would be if it were established. I was encouraged by the pleasure with which they received the idea.  It was not one of resentment; it was not an expression of fear; it was not one of caution in most cases but rather one of delight that at last two things would occur.  First, they would be free from the secret directive given by Departments of State to companies but not revealed in Parliament.  Secondly, they would be free from other approaches which hindered their commercial viability and thirdly, they were all looking forward to the prospect of explaining their activities at a level which would be meaningful.  We all know the frustration of Members of either House in endeavouring to obtain from a Minister a detailed explanation for some particular policy and even with the greatest of goodwill on the part of the Minister and if the Minister is totally forthcoming there is the probability that he is unable, in the short time allotted in Parliament for any particular topic, satisfactorily to answer any question.  There is always this danger too, and we know this as politicians, that if a question is asked in Parliament it may become emotionally coloured and histrionics may tend to enter into the discussion.  That is not the best way of getting at the facts.  But across a table where everybody sees it and where people are sharing the one <Col N="829" /> piece of furniture there is a greater probability that the truth can be arrived at than in the course of public and sometimes colourful debate.</P>
    <P>The committee will be reporting in due course to both Houses and making recommendations as they think fit.  The question has properly been raised here and elsewhere as to why we did not specifically speak of policy in the mandate and both my reply in the other House and what the Parliamentary Secretary said in opening this debate indicates our thinking on this topic.  I would like to expand a little further.  It is proper in a democratic system that Ministers should be responsible to Parliament for the overall policy of companies.  If we were to transfer that responsibility to the committee then Ministers could shelter behind the committee in relation to policies.  I do not think it is a bad thing therefore that in regard to current policy or immediate future policy the direct responsibility for it should lie still on Ministers who must be accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>But as I said in the Dáil, the mere fact that the committee would be seized with a review of the results of past policy and would probably be issuing recommendations as a result of that consideration is bound to colour current thinking and future policy.  Maybe in the light of experience we may be able to bring the idea of ministerial responsibility and parliamentary review closer together but clearly, if we are to have democratic institutions with Governments ultimately responsible for directing the country and answerable for their own mistakes and getting credit for their own successes, then we must maintain that policy is for the time being the prime responsibility of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn and probably others asked me about the servicing of the committee.  This is above all a parliamentary committee with members of Parliament asking questions which are being asked by the general public.  It would be undesirable that no matter what the pressures of work may be on us we should allow the leadership, as it were, or the pace setting of this committee to pass into the hands of a <Col N="830" /> secretariat, no matter how efficient or dedicated that secretariat might be.  I am saying that by way of an introduction to what I want to say about the servicing of the committee.  It would be open to the danger that, if we had too good and too well staffed a secretariat, Members of either House on the committee might tend to leave too much of the thinking to the secretariat.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that it is accepted I would be anxious that the committee would be well serviced and that is why we specifically provided in the motion that people with specialist and technical knowledge and experience might be engaged by the committee.  We are well served in this House, and throughout the public service, with very dedicated servants but because of their career in the public service they at times have not the specialist and technical knowledge which would be necessary for a proper examination of several of the semi-State bodies which are engaged in very specialist and technical fields. I would not visualise that all the specialists brought in would be brought in on a permanent basis.  Indeed, it might be desirable that they would be in on a contractual basis and be replaced by others so that we would have a continuing refreshing of the waters, as it were, and I think we will be able to arrive at a suitable accommodation in this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want also to emphasise that there will, of course, be a need to have a permanent secretariat set up, apart from the specialists and I <Col N="831" /> would consider such a secretariat necessary.  The Government have already pledged themselves to achieve, and consider it necessary that there should be, one public service in Ireland and, therefore, people on the permanent secretariat would be part of the overall public service.  One of the drawbacks we have in the public service is lack of mobility and the tendency to create cells of interest which soon become little empires of their own.  As a result many of the best skills in the civil service are not being used in areas where they could be most efficiently used.  A certain amount of frustration is also likely to develop in that situation.  I would consider that the back-up service for the committee would be at two levels, a permanent secretariat which would be part of the secretariat of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and the specialists who would be brought in from time to time to give special aid.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware we are suffering from a lack of accommodation in the House for Members and the existing staff.  The creation of yet another committee with the need to provide accommodation for the secretariat will add to these problems and some time will, unfortunately, emerge before additional accommodation can be provided in the precincts of Leinster House but it is something I am anxious to improve.  It may be necessary to have a little discomfort while the committee is getting under way until alternative additional accommodation becomes available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not anticipate at this stage what the Estimates may or may not contain but, naturally, some provision will have to be provided for it because it would be my desire, as I am sure it is the desire of both Houses, that the committee now that it is being brought into being will go into operation immediately.  We would certainly like to get a year's experience of this committee in the lifetime of this Parliament. After the dissolution of these Houses in the spring of 1978 it will be necessary to table similar motions to give life to similar committees in the new Houses.  Ultimately, I would hope that this committee would obtain its life from the Standing Orders of both Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  For the time being it has to get its authority from motions moved in each House of the Oireachtas after a general election.  In other words, it would be on a par with the European Secondary Legislation Committee which has its source in that manner at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the confidentiality provision, I gave a considerable amount of thought to this.  It is my feeling, and I think it is shared by several Members, that the committee will work better if confidentiality is maintained and if it is an obligation.  If we did not provide for confidentiality either in the motion or in the rules of the Committee subsequently&mdash;it is better to do it at this stage if it is regarded as a desirable thing&mdash;there is a danger that witnesses before the committee would be hesitant about furnishing the committee with all relevant information.  Quite an amount of information which witnesses would have could be of value to their competitors in the private sector at home and abroad.  It would be most undesirable and harmful to the public interest if such information were to be furnished to their competitors.  In order that the committee may get a proper understanding of the workings of several of these operations it would be necessary for them to possess some of the important information which should <Col N="833" /> be treated in a confidential manner. There will be a tremendous responsibility on members of the committee to maintain confidentiality because they will have access to information which could do material damage to some State concerns and could, if made available to their rivals, give them considerable profit to the disadvantage of the public sector.  I am sure there are no Members of Parliament who would deliberately breach confidentiality in such cases but it is highly desirable that we should put it on record that confidentiality should be maintained.  As Senator Horgan properly said, if the committee feels that the confidentiality is being irresponsibly or unnecessarily pleaded it is a matter which can be referred to in the reports to either House.  We can once again take a look at the rules to see whether or not they should be amended.  That communication can be given to the House without in any way committing a breach of the obligation which is at present being imposed.</P>
    <P>On the issue of industrial relations mentioned by Senator West, I would think that falls in most cases into the current administration of a company. Perhaps it is one of our shortcomings that yesterday's strike is of little interest. Once a strike is over people tend to heave a sigh of relief and hope it will not happen next week.  Clearly, if an industrial relations situation in a concern has a material impact upon its operational results the committee will be seized of it and would, no doubt, form a view and, possibly, issue a recommendation.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Horgan relating to the relations between the companies and the consumer is bound to be considered by the committee. That is part of the overall operational results, to consider whether or not the consumer is satisfied with the operations of the companies.  It may be that we will find in the workings of the committee that many public expectations cannot be satisfied but at least the sense of annoyance and frustration might not be as great if we knew the reasons why.  That would be one of the achievements of which the committee will be able to boast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Senator West asked if the Minister for the Public Services would consider the Independent Senators when compiling the members of the committee.  I can assure the Senator that while I have every sympathy for his idea I will have no responsibility in this regard.  Membership of the committee will be established by the Committee of Selection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out, as I did before, that as the acting-Whip&mdash;maybe there is no such thing&mdash;I was asked by Senator Sanfey to nominate a name.  The whole thing becomes ludicrous if the Independents were asked to nominate somebody, we nominated somebody and he does not appear on the list.  All the parties complained that they did not have enough members to put on these committees, that they were all tied up with the committee dealing with European legislation and so on.</P>

Senator Sanfey has a great capacity to read my mind and fulfil my wishes even before I have expressed them.  I am sure both sides of the House will be anxious that the committee will be as representative and impartial as possible.  That was our objective and I hope that when the committee is established people will see that it is so.  No political person has anything to gain from the operations of this committee in a partisan sense, whether he is a supporter of the Government of the day or of the Opposition.</P>

If I have not dealt with them all I hope that those who have been good enough to participate in this debate will have their anxiety to see the committee work rewarded by their being appointed as members of the committee.  What I <Col N="835" /> have heard and what was reported to me is an indication that Seanad Éireann sees that this committee has great possibilities.  I am sorry that as the motion is drafted there will be only four Members of the Seanad on a committee which is to have 11 Members but some balance has to be maintained between this and the other House on a numerical basis as well as on a responsibility basis.  It was argued that the Seanad should not be represented on this committee at all because it should be like the Public Accounts Committee and, therefore, should be confined to the Dáil as it will be dealing with public moneys.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the other House, my view of this committee is that its responsibilities extend beyond the mere expenditure and, when the Minister for Finance uses the word, &ldquo;mere&rdquo;, in relation to expenditure, one will realise that he is dealing with it in a confining sense and not in a sense of disregard for moneys.  Matters of policy and the provision of goods and services arise here and that goes beyond the constitutional requirement which confines financial responsibility to the House which it directly elected.  That was one reason why I was happy to include the Seanad.  The other one was the very simple one which has been referred to here by so many, that Members of both Houses are overloaded with work at the moment.  I hope the Seanad will not take umbrage if I say that possibly some Members in the other House might have to work a little harder than some Senators.  We would, therefore hope that it may be possible for the Senators to serve this committee at times when Deputies might not find it so easy to serve it. That has been our experience in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear the tributes paid to the growth of the committee system in the Oireachtas in the past few years. It has certainly thrown a considerable amount of additional work on Members of both Houses who have had to meet in general session more frequently than in earlier years.  I would expect that this <Col N="836" /> development is going to continue but, certainly, if we are to use public time to best advantage, and we are here being paid by the public for serving them, we should try to find the best way of serving the people.  I feel certain we are making a very significant step forward by adopting this committee.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, a suitable way to commemorate&mdash;as we will be commemorating in a couple of months' time&mdash;the establishment of the first semi-State body here half a century ago.  I am sure historians will comment on the fact that it took us a half a century to establish a parliamentary committee to supervise the operations of children who were brought into the world by Parliament itself.  Now that we have it, let us hope it works.  I should like to thank the House.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say, apart from checking on the financial working of these companies, what will happen as far as the economic and policy ends are concerned?  Does the Minister envisage that this committee will have as a function some direction regarding the policy of these companies as well as checking the accounts?</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; might be too strong a word to use.  I was explaining earlier that in the democratic system it is important that the Government of the day should have responsibility for policy matters and be answerable to the House and, ultimately, to the electorate for their activities.  But if this committee examines the overall operational results of semi-State bodies they will undoubtedly form and express a view as to whether the policies pursued in the past are successful or whether they consider they should be changed. Direction must clearly lie with Government but influencing power will certainly lie with this committee because of their right to examine and pass comment.</P>

      <P>Earlier I indicated I was giving permission to Senator Horgan to raise a matter on the <Col N="837" /> Adjournment.  The matter is on the alteration on the status of music as a subject in the leaving certificate examination. It is the custom for the mover to be allowed 20 minutes, leaving ten minutes for the Parliamentary Secretary to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Parliamentary Secretary in the House although I had hoped to have been able to wish his immediate superior <i>bon voyage</i>.  Firstly, I should like to talk briefly about the background to the problem I have raised.  It is one which goes back to 1925 when the leaving certificate was established in its present form.  Since then, music was available up to very recently in most ordinary and honours courses and was examined at the appropriate level.  The number doing music has grown steadily over the years but what is perhaps even more important is the fact that a very high proportion of the students doing music at leaving certificate level have, traditionally, done it at honours.  This shows to anybody who knows anything about education that people who do music are informed by a very high sense of specialisation and dedication to what is a very difficult as well as a very rewarding subject.  Recent figures, for example, indicate that before the honours paper was terminated the percentage of students doing honours in music was as high as 67 or 68 per cent.  When we compare that with the 11 per cent or so who did honours in maths and the 51 per cent who did honours in art, we will see this is evidence of a very high degree of dedication.</P>
      <P>Since 1925 we have seen the very slow emergence of music, as it were.  The Minister has a very lively interest in the subject and to the best of my recollection has spoken very warmly of it as an element in the transitional year experiment which he has piloted in a number of schools.  One would have hoped that this upward trend would have continued and, indeed, until recently there were signs that this was, in fact, the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we turn to the question of the more recent history of music as a subject in the leaving certificate, however, <Col N="838" /> the position changes.  In 1975, the last year in which music was available at both pass and honours level in the leaving certificate, approximately 950 students took music in the leaving certificate.  This was a substantial achievement for the educational system as well as for the students and their teachers.  Simultaneously with this a number of developments were taking place, some of them benign and some not so benign.  The most obvious of these, initially at any rate, was the revamping of the syllabus for music which was referred to by the Minister for Education in answer to a Dáil Question on 20th October.  He said at column 53 of Volume 293:</P>
    <P>The position in regard to Music, as to all subjects of the curriculum for the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations, is that, with due notice changes are made following recommendations from syllabus committees representative of teachers' organisations, managerial associations and the relevant university faculties as well as representatives of the Department of Education.  There was complete agreement when the new syllabus in music and musicianship was introduced in 1974, for examination for the first time at leaving certificate level in 1976 and dissatisfaction has not since been expressed with the syllabus as such.</P>
    <P>This statement is, of course, very true. There has been no dissatisfaction with the syllabus.  There has, however, been considerable dissatisfaction at things which have happened alongside the revamping of the syllabus and which have necessitated in turn other changes which have not been made.  In line with the re-vamping of the syllabus my understanding is that the syllabus committee of the Department of Education decided to introduce a single paper for music in the leaving certificate.  I used the phrase &ldquo;single paper&rdquo; advisedly because there is no evidence that the syllabus committee had in mind what is generally known within the Department of Education as a common paper.  A common paper is the paper which is held with certain other subjects such as technical drawing and has, in fact, a relatively well-known existence in the <Col N="839" /> Department of Education.  I do not believe it was necessarily the case that the syllabus committee intended that their single music paper should become a common paper in strict terms. Unfortunately, perhaps through some administrative hiccup inside the Department, this is the box into which this particular paper was put.</P>
    <P>The syllabus committee was then confronted with the situation in which the universities decided that they would regard this common paper of a lower level than the honours paper for particular purposes.  This was severely affecting both the popularity of music as a subject and, indeed, its immediate prospects.  The committee unanimously decided in April, 1976, to propose that the paper be divided again into its two former component parts.  In other words, that there would continue to be an honours paper and that there would continue to be a pass paper.  This has not yet been acted on by the Minister for Education.  The results of it are already plain to see.  In the 1976 leaving certificate music examination the numbers taking music had already fallen from 950 in the previous year to approximately 650.  I suspect they would have fallen even further had there not been a widespread assumption on the part of music teachers that in fact the common paper would be abolished and the original set of honours and pass papers would be re-introduced.</P>
    <P>Because of failure to take this decision to re-introduce the honours and pass papers in music, the present situation can only be described as parlous.  I do not know what the present rate of enrolment for music in the leaving certificate is but I would be very surprised if it were anything as high as the 650 that sat for music last year.  I would not be surprised if it were as low as 200.  In reply to another parliamentary question later on, the Minister for Education gave details of the number of children studying music as part of their leaving certificate course. He was able to show to his satisfaction that the numbers of people actually doing music as part of their leaving certificate course was very substantial; it ran into 3,268 in 1973-74 and in 1975-76 <Col N="840" /> it was up to 3,473, a very substantial figure.  The acid test of whether or not music is acceptable and whether or not the examination and marking system is acceptable is not the number of people who are taking it as a course in school but the number who are going to sit for it in the leaving certificate examination. When we see those statistics I suspect we will see a very different picture indeed.</P>
    <P>There are two problems here, one of them relatively minor.  The minor one is whether or not the Minister has decided to extend, as I gather he may have been asked to extend, the date for signifying that one proposes to do music in the leaving certificate so as to allow this problem to be clarified before people actually commit themselves. If he did this it would be an indication of goodwill on his part&mdash; while it would not necessarily solve the whole problem.  All that is involved at this stage is indicating that one wants to do music in the leaving certificate.  It does not actually force one to do music when one gets there.  I suspect that the number of people who actually sign on now to say they will do music and who actually do music will be substantially reduced if the two papers are not re-introduced.</P>
    <P>There are two areas here.  One is an area which the Minister has said is one of his concern and the other is more properly an area of his responsibility. The area in which he has concern is in relation to the attitude of the universities towards this common paper.  The attitude of the universities towards this common paper has created the situation in which music is the only subject which is available at degree level which is not now available at honours level.  Music has been downgraded for points in entry to University College, Dublin, and Trinity College, Dublin, and even in the other colleges of the National University of Ireland where it is treated more favourably from a points point of view there is the situation that it has been downgraded by the Senate of the National University of Ireland in terms of their matriculation requirements.  I may have something to say in that area at another time and the Minister can be assured that in his attempts to get the <Col N="841" /> universities to change on this issue he will have my full support.  This does not necessarily solve the problem.  The reclassification might solve the problem for music but not for other subjects. Still, there has to be some progress.</P>
    <P>Specifically in the area of the Minister's own responsibility there is the question of his decision with regard to the unanimous recommendation of the syllabus committee.  This committee has urged a re-introduction of the pass and honours system in music.  Educationalists, parents and teachers alike are all clamouring for this.  It would be not only unnecessary to deny them but it would contribute very substantially to a very serious decline in standard and practice of music here.  I should like to know whether the Minister has made a final decision on this.  If he has decided finally to over-rule the recommendation of this syllabus committee, why has he decided to do so, and even in such a case is he prepared, even at this relatively late stage, to review this decision in the interests not only of the students who are confused and uncertain about the future, but in the interests of a whole generation of players of music, of concert-goers and indeed of performers of music in this country for the foreseeable future?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">

      <P>I should like to say a few words on the very interesting subject that has been raised here by Senator Horgan and, indeed, that has been debated so ably by him and presented in such a very eloquent fashion.  Most of us would concede that music is a tremendously important factor in the education of the individual.  At the same time, many of us will concede that we are not all born with the same abilities as far as music is concerned.  To complete the education of the individual, if at all possible, we as an Oireachtas should aim at having in our educational system a scheme whereby people would get the opportunity of educating themselves. It is a tremendous accomplishment for any individual to be fairly well versed in music.  After all, the Irish people have a very high tradition and a very high musical standard.  They have not got any great symphonies or high-class music, probably, to their credit, but it is true to say that the resurgence <Col N="842" /> of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann over the last 20 years and the research that has been done into traditional Irish music is valued very highly by the average Irish person.  I feel that people such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann have rescued from oblivion many fine Irish tunes and many fine pieces of Irish music.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue raised I just want to make a point on the attitude of the universities so far as music as a subject for entry into the universities is concerned.  I feel, and I think the average person in this country feels, that the universities and the governing bodies seem to have far too much power in allotting points for various subjects particularly in regard to music. It is regrettable that music has been downgraded in this fashion.  I cannot place all the blame on the Department of Education; the universities certainly have a part to play in it.  It is typical of the attitude that many of our universities have adopted for quite a number of years to various subjects that are taught all over Ireland.  They have the sole privilege of deciding what points are to be awarded to various subjects and in that way they can rule the career of potential students because they will not be able to gain admission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of affording some clarification to the House in relation to the matter which has been raised by Senator Horgan.  Following discussions and deliberations which took place over a period of two years, the music syllabus committee in 1974 made certain recommendations to the Minister in regard to the examination of the subject of music at leaving certificate level.  As Senators will no doubt be aware, the music syllabus committee is representative of the teachers' organisations, the school managerial bodies and the relevant university faculties as well as the Department.  The recommendations which the committee made were <Col N="843" /> (a) to replace the then three existing subjects, music, general and practical musicianship and general musicianship by a single subject called music and musicianship; (b) to have this single subject examined at one level only instead of at ordinary and higher level as had been the case with the three subjects it was intended to replace. It was their opinion that the course of action recommended by them would consolidate the status of music at leaving certificate level and would provide a programme of study suited to the aptitudes and requirements of all our young people.</P>
      <P>The committee also considered that, with suitably framed questions, one written paper and one oral paper would be sufficient to give the more brilliant student abundant scope for showing himself to best advantage, while at the same time amply accommodating the student of average ability.  The Department accepted the recommendations of the syllabus committee and all concerned in the exercise had high hopes of their success.  The revised syllabus was examined at leaving certificate level for the first time in 1976.  I think it is clear from what I have said that neither the syllabus committee nor the Department entertained any intention of diminishing the status of this most important subject. In fact, the opposite was the case.</P>
      <P>Let me refer back very briefly to a point made by Senator Horgan, when he suggested that it was not the committee's intention that the subject would be examined at common level.  It is true to say that they did not say, in so many words, that they specifically requested a common paper but there are and were at the time the committee made the recommendation&mdash;and the committee were undoubtedly aware of this&mdash;only three ways of examining papers for the leaving certificate, namely, ordinary level, higher level and common level.  Therefore, by eliminating the first two as they proposed to do, <i>ipso facto</i> they were recommending a common paper and this would seem to be the case from re-reading the text of the recommendations which I have already put on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, due to practical problems <Col N="844" /> which appeared likely to arise in connection with the implementation of the new structure of the examination enshrined in the syllabus committee's recommendations, it was decided to reconvene the committee in April, 1976 at their own request.  After re-appraisal of the situation the committee recommended a reversion to the ordinary and higher level mode of examination for 1977 in the subject.  The Minister was unable to agree to this recommendation as it is incumbent on him to give two years' notice to the schools of any alteration or variation in the syllabus for leaving certificate examinations.  I think the House will appreciate why such notice is necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in relation to the 1976 leaving certificate examination relates to its examination at common level.  While this level is in the opinion of the syllabus committee and also of the Department of Education, the equivalent of higher level, it would appear that this particular circumstance posed problems for the university authorities.  Approaches have been made to the National University and the matter is now being considered by the individual colleges.  The Minister takes the view and is confident that the Seanad will agree with him that it is highly desirable that students presenting this subject at the 1977 examination should be in a position to enjoy the equivalent of higher level recognition for it.  The situation as it stands is unsatisfactory and a cause of deep disappointment to students who have embarked, in good faith and with high hopes, on their leaving certificate course in the subject and a cause of no little bewilderment to teachers who, after all their efforts, now fear that the practical effect of the universities' difficulties will be to discourage student participation in this most fundamental cultural subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister has deep sympathy for all those students and teachers alike who are caught up in this situation which, as is also in the case of the Minister, is not a situation of their own making. However, he is hopeful that the discussions which are now taking place will produce a result favourable to the best interests of the students and <Col N="845" /> teachers of music and musicianship generally.  He is doing all in his power to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Generally it would appear that the course in music and musicianship first examined in 1976 was of a standard best suited to the abler student, despite its authors' admirable intentions.  Perhaps, as has been remarked by an eminent authority in the field, we were trying to go too far, too fast.  Standards must, however, be maintained but at the same time we must seek to cater also for the broad spectrum of students at leaving certificate level.  Ironically, it may be that the common level paper, as it is so described, far from being too easy, may have worked out to be too difficult for some of the less able students rather than the reverse which seems to be the opinion being adopted now by some of the university authorities.  The Minister would hope, however, that as a result of the talks to which I have referred, the matter will be resolved in the reasonably near future.  He would also hope to be able to make a statement in due course, giving further information in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary by way of postscript whether he would agree that only three months' notice was given of the change from the joint paper to the common level paper?  In the light of this, even if he cannot do anything about the examination this year, will he give an undertaking, if the response from the universities is not satisfactory, to restore definitively the two papers in 1978?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite true to say that only three months' <Col N="846" /> notice was given.  After all, the recommendation was made by the syllabus committee in 1974 and the syllabus committee contains representatives of all the relevant bodies with the excepttion, of course, of the students who are not directly represented and they were aware of the recommendation and of its acceptance in 1974.  This was examined for the first time in 1976, which is a lapse in time of two years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there is no absolute guarantee of the attitude of the universities to any particular form of leaving certificate.  The Minister's view is that the common level paper which was recommended as appropriate by the syllabus committee, upon which, incidentally, university representatives sit, should be accepted at its proper value by the university authorities and it is towards that end that he is now working.  The contingent situation envisaged by the Senator is based on the failure of the efforts which the Minister has now in hands at this end and it would be premature at this stage to indicate what would happen if they fail. It is hoped that they will not fail.</P>
