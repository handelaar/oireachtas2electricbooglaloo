      <P>It is rather a surprise to us on this side of the House to know that we are taking No. 4 and even No. 3 although there is nothing much to that.  It is surprising to find that we are now taking the Family Home Protection Bill.  I was under the impression and I think our Whips were, too, that this was being taken next week.</P>

      <P>I would like to vary the Order of Business so as to include No. 9 on the Order Paper, that is the Family Planning Bill, 1974.  As long ago as 26th November, 1975 I asked the Leader of the House when the Family Planning Bill might be taken for a Second Reading, given that it had its first reading in December 1974, more than 18 months ago.  On that occasion the <Col N="848" /> Leader of the House said as reported at column 9 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It was quite unnecessary for Senator Robinson to inquire in public on the Order of Business regarding her Family Planning Bill.  I had already communicated to her the position, namely, that the Tanaiste is prepared to come here to deal with the Bill as soon as the Dáil Special Committee on the Misuse of Drugs Bill has concluded.</P>
      <P>It took the Special Commitee on the Misuse of Drugs Bill a very long time to conclude, but it finally concluded its work some weeks ago and we are now in the happy position of having the Tánaiste here in the House today.  I would ask, therefore, that the Order of Business be amended to include No. 9 and to take it after the first item on the order so that this Bill which has been pressed by its promoters for 18 months since it got its first reading be given time in this House, or if not, that the Leader of the House ensure that a date be given for the taking of the Second Stage of this Bill before the House rises for the Recess.</P>

      <P>The position, as far as the order of events is concerned, is as Senator Robinson has stated that when the Committee consideration of the Drugs Bill was concluded in the Dáil I spoke to the Tánaiste with regard to this Bill as I anticipated Senator Robinson raising it.  So far as he is concerned it would not be convenient for him to deal with the Bill this side of the Summer Recess. If Senator Robinson wishes to move her amendment it becomes a matter for the House.</P>

      <P>The position is impossible for a private Member tabling legislation.  This Bill was given its First Reading by the House in December, 1974.  I have waited patiently since then <Col N="849" /> but it appears now that it is not convenient for the Tánaiste to take it.  It depends on what is meant by convenience. It is not convenient either for the majority of women in Ireland, the majority of the population, who want to see a change in the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Health Services (Limited Eligibility Regulations, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Regulations in draft form was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 22nd day of April, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations deal with the income limits which apply for purposes of limited eligibility for health services.  The health services concerned are: free hospital in-patient and out-patient services; free maternity services; free infant welfare services; assistance towards the cost of drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The categories of persons who, together with their dependents, have limited eligibility are: persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  For non-manual workers there is a remuneration limit of £2,250 per annum.  This limit has been in operation since April 1974; non-insured persons with annual income less than £1,600.  This income limit has been in operation since September <Col N="850" /> 1971; farmers with a valuation of £60 or less.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these regulations is to increase the income limit for non-insured persons from the existing figure of £1,600 to a new figure of £3,000.  I intend to make separate regulations which will increase the existing limit of £2,250 for insured persons to a new figure of £3,000. Farmers are not involved in these changes and the existing limit of £60 valuation remains unaltered.</P>
    <P>The reason for this change is to bring these limits into line with changes in money values and in incomes since they were fixed in 1971 and 1974.  If allowance is made for movements in wages under the basic terms of the national wage agreements, an income of £1,600 in September 1971 would have a current equivalent of about £3,000. The change in limits does not therefore involve any extension of eligibility.  It is aimed at retaining eligibility for persons who traditionally have had it and it does not involve any increase in the number of such persons.  A further effect of the change will be to do away with the present anomaly whereby there are different limits for insured, non-manual employees and for non-insured persons.  In future, the limit of £3,000 per annum will apply to both groups.</P>
    <P>If, however, the existing limits are not changed, a large number of people will lose their eligibility, even though there has been no relative improvement in their financial situation.  It has been estimated that about 85,000 such people would lose their eligibility by the end of 1976.  The great majority of these are insured workers.  The first group to lose eligibility&mdash;about 5,000 female workers&mdash;will become ineligible by 5th July if the limit is not increased to £3,000.  An estimated 30,000 male, non-manual employees, together with some 40,000 dependants, will become ineligible by January next while 5,000 non-insured persons, with some 5,000 dependants, will become ineligible during the course of 1976, unless the new limits are introduced.</P>
    <P>The proposed change in the limits <Col N="851" /> has been discussed in detail at a number of meetings between officials of my Department and representatives of both medical organisations.  The basis for the change has been explained fully and, as a result of these discussions, the medical organisations are not objecting to the new limits.  Both organisations have requested that a new system for identifying eligible patients at the point of health-care delivery be introduced in order to ensure that eligible patients only are treated free of charge.  The chief executive officer of the health boards and myself have agreed to this request and a more efficient system of identification is being worked out at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations do no more than the minimum necessary to raise the present limits in accordance with the fall in the value of money since the limits were fixed, that was, in April, 1974, in the case of persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and in 1971 in the case of non-insured persons.</P>
      <P>The fact that it has taken such a length of time to deal with the inflationary erosion in regard to non-insured people is a cause for very serious complaint.  These are the people who are hardest hit.  We have a situation where, despite the admitted erosion in the value of money since September, 1971, it has taken practically five years to make up the deficit in regard to limits that have been steadily eroded, month in, month out. They have eroded to the extent that the Minister is now bringing in here at this late stage a proposal in these regulations to raise&mdash;and rightly raise&mdash;the limit of eligibility to £3,000, practically doubling the limits of eligibility in the case of non-insured people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is entitled to raise this very serious social matter&mdash; that during that period since September, 1971, the non-insured category have had their rights in regard to eligibility for health services steadily eroded.  Surely this category is not the category which should have to wait five years to have limits rectified in order to maintain their rights&mdash;not to enhance <Col N="852" /> their rights, but, as the Minister stated, merely bring them up to the correct level having regard to the erosion in the value of money.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a case for an automatic indexation in regard to the basic rights surely the case exists in respect of the non-insured.  The least well-off category in the community has to wait for a period of practically five years to have their basic rights established in regard to the health services that the rest of the community owe this category above any other category in the State.  If there is an aspect of administration that shouts loud and clear for indexation surely it is this area.  The Minister could with his officials, devise some system of automatic readjustment in regard to limits for health services generally.</P>
    <P>This also applies in the case of the insured category, although the complaint in that case is not as serious in that their limits are in operation since April, 1974, which is two years ago and not five years as in the case of the unfortunate non-insured people.  The Minister recognises their position by lifting the limit from £2,250 to £3,000&mdash;again, doing just the bare minimum to adjust the limits in the case of insured employees with the erosion in the value of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of the anomaly between insured manual and non-manual workers.  This was quite clearly an anomalous position and it is to be welcomed that they are now on the same level of £3,000 and I hope that that will continue to be the case.  I am sure it will.</P>
    <P>In the case of the insured workers I would ask the Minister to comment on an indexation system also, an automatic readjustment in the case of insured workers who find themselves moving out of the category of entitlement due to increased wages and the erosion of money and inflation but who, although their real wages remain the same, find themselves deprived of rights.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on these two aspects because I believe there is an aspect of fundamental natural justice here.  The <Col N="853" /> Minister has failed lamentably to achieve the ideal of complete socialisation of all health services, but that is a separate matter.  I realise that due to the basic fact of financial exigencies complete socialisation of medicines cannot be achieved.  But short of achieving that ideal the basic matter to which we should attend&mdash;no matter who is in Government, be it a socialist or conservative Government; Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-cum-socialist Government&mdash;is to ensure that our existing services give value and that they do what they set out to do, that is, to ensure that the lower-income group get the full range of medical services that are available, that the middle-income group get their entitlements and that overall the scheme of medicine and health services which is operating in Ireland today works.  That is the very least that a socialist Minister for Health should bend his energies towards achieving.  The Minister, as I have said, subscribes to the ideal of complete socialisation but that has failed under his aegis during the past three-and-a-half years.  The minimum that should be achieved is that the existing services give value and give the highest degree of social justice within the ambit of the existing legislation and administration. This means having hospitals properly staffed, having the existing services functioning properly and not cut in any way as they have been in many areas during the past few months.  It means above all else that what is enshrined here in these regulations, that the limits under which the present health services operate, are real limits.  In other words, that the people who are entitled are not pushed out of entitlement, month in, month out, by the erosion in the value of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister brings in these regulations at a late stage.  This is just not good enough.  It means that far from improving health services, over the past five years they have steadily diminished in that a category of people have steadily worked out of the area of health and medicine to which they are entitled.  On the Minister's own admission, that is the purpose of these regulations.  At this late stage, that, at least, is to be welcomed; that we see here recognition of the facts of life in <Col N="854" /> regard to the erosion in the value of money.  We see now a restoration of rights to people that existed five years ago.  We are merely restoring the position in the case of non-insured people that they had five years ago and in regard to insured persons that they had two years ago.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in his reply to comment on my suggestion of having some form of automatic regulator or indicator or adjustment system that would keep people within eligibility even though wage rises and the fall in the value of money may push them out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is no useful purpose in saying that under the previous regime the intervals after which reviews took place were in many cases much more than five years. That is no consolation and I do not want to go into the past.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right but the inflation rate then was nothing like what it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  No doubt that point will be made often during the debate next week on the Appropriation Bill.  However, I do not think Senator Lenihan really appreciates what the position has been.  It is not a question of people's rights being eroded either since April, 1974 or since September, 1971, because I should explain that those who were earning less than £2,250 in April, 1974, were eligible for limited services in hospitals' outpatients' infant-care service and so on. But although that amount was exceeded they did not suffer any loss whatever because the provision was that they had a period of approximately two-and-a-half years during which they would stay eligible even though the £2,250 was exceeded. They were entitled to the services for the balance of their insurance year when they had the last stamp and for two years after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, since the period April, 1974, none of these people has had any of the services withdrawn from <Col N="855" /> him.  That may not be spelled out. I do not think it is spelled out but I want to assure Senator Lenihan that the 85,000 persons we are talking about were the number who were included in that particular period and that there was nobody at all who suffered.  The intention now would be that the same system would carry on and, if the £3,000 is exceeded during a particular period, that those people who exceeded that amount would not suffer either.  The categories are different.</P>
    <P>It is legitimate criticism for the Senator to say there was no change in their income limit from £1,600 since September, 1971 but I think the Senator, as one who travels his constituency or his prospective constituency, would know that in all these cases the CEO's examine the means of the applicant and although the income exceeds £1,600 the hardship clause is applied. The CEO has the right to do this and I have yet to get many complaints to the effect that people were barred from these services by reason of the fact that their income exceeded £1,600.  It has been said that, in order to regularise the position, this might have been done in 1974.  But these people are somewhat different from the insured groups.  I would agree with the Senator that there is a case for consideration of this category and possibly to have their income reviewed on, say, a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>The speech is self-explanatory.  As I said, it is not a question of the erosion of entitlement of people since April, 1974, or indeed September, 1971.  The only purpose of the regulations is to ensure that those people who are now covered will be covered for the future for approximately three years in the case of men and two-and-a-half years in the case of women.  I take the point made by Deputy Lenihan that those who are in the non-insured group would need to have their case specially looked at to ensure that there is no hardship, even though, as I said, the hardship clause can be applied by the various CEO's.</P>

    <Title>Employment Premium Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic objective of the premium employment programme is to get as many disemployed workers restored to employment as quickly as possible.  The State pays a subsidy of £15 per week to an employer for additional unemployed workers taken on over and above the number employed as at 20th June, 1975.  It is a condition of the scheme that the unemployed worker must have received unemployment benefit at least once since June, 1974, and was signing-on at an employment exchange or attending an AnCO training centre for at least the four weeks prior to being re-employed.</P>
      <P>With the co-operation of employers, thousands of people can be returned to gainful employment by means of the extended premium employment programme. I would ask all personnel managers and production planners to consider seriously the advantages which lie in PEP.</P>
      <P>I have directed all manpower offices throughout the country to contact local employers to examine afresh the steps by which the premium employment programme may at the new rates, with co-operation from employers, succeed in reducing local unemployment.</P>
      <P>Trades councils and chambers of commerce may assist by informing their affiliated members and organisations of the advantages of the programme.  While I am especially anxious that the premium should be availed of by those industries most seriously affected by the recession&mdash; textiles, footwear and engineering&mdash; PEP can also assist such relatively new industries as pharmaceuticals, electronics and petrochemical activities which are still in their growth stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By providing an incentive to employers to increase their work force now, ahead of requirements, we can be better placed to expand production quickly.  There is some evidence that the level of stocks in <Col N="857" /> some of our industries has now been reduced to a level consistent with the slowdown in overall demand.  We should not allow this situation to persist for so long that we are unable to meet the initial surge of demand which will surely come.</P>
    <P>The programme will make it easier for the employee to get a job again and for the employer to offer the employment.  For the employer who is delaying taking on workers until he sees further positive signs of an upturn in the economy, PEP, by reducing the cost of taking on new workers, gives him a substantial inducement to do so now.  In previous recessions here unemployment has tended to last longer than necessary because employers traditionally have met improvements in demand after a recession by increasing the overtime available to existing staff instead of taking on new workers.  In present circumstances this could be a short-sighted and expensive practice.  The programme enables employers to take on workers now in anticipation of the improvement already evident in certain of the major economies.</P>
    <P>The prospects for international recovery are brighter now than at any time for the last two years.  The major economies such as the United States, Germany and Japan are growing at increasingly faster rates. There are signs also of a new level of international co-operation in the management of the world economy. Agreements reached on planned growth in the OECD and EEC areas suggest that the recovery can be sustained without a recurrence of extreme inflationary pressures though of course it must be noted in this connection that the 5 per cent rate agreed at the meeting would not settle our unemployment problems in the years ahead even if those targets were achieved fully.  In the EEC it has been agreed that a growth rate of 5 per cent per annum should be targeted for with the objective of reaching a satisfactory level of employment by 1980.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, unemployment seasonally adjusted has stabilised during the <Col N="858" /> second quarter of this year.  In absolute terms the numbers on the live register have dropped by about 9,000.  This pattern is in contrast to that prevailing in Northern Ireland and Great Britain where unemployment continues to rise.  This would seem to confirm that the pattern of unemployment here is more closely related to that in the EEC rather than Britain which was traditionally the case.  Of course it is essential if we are to maintain this more hopeful tendency of our economy that our industrial costs must be held at levels which will facilitate a significant and early reduction of present unemployment.</P>
    <P>The total number of workers who have been re-employed to date under the programme is over 5,000.  The vast majority of these workers were re-employed in manufacturing industry including 2,000 in textiles.  I am encouraged by the fact that these workers might otherwise be still without a job but for the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I must say, however, that I am far from satisfied about the extent to which the scheme has been used up to now.  However, with growing evidence that there is now a prospect of a recovery in the economy, there should be a greater incentive for employers to take on additional workers in the expectation that the level of demand both in the domestic and export markets will increase.  A survey which was taken in May showed that the recovery in economic activity had in the main continued.  The level of exports had continued to improve and over the next few months the forecast was that production would continue to increase as would exports.  Home sales were expected to remain stable.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we should capitalise to the greatest extent possible on any opportunities to take up the slack in our productive capacity and thereby reduce unemployment.  The Government, as an earnest of their determination to take postive action to help those who are without jobs, have decided to seek the approval of the <Col N="859" /> Oireachtas to extend the duration of the premium employment programme schemes until the end of the year. Under the programme, two separate schemes were launched&mdash;one for certain manufacturing industries and the other for agriculture.  The currency of both schemes expired on 26th June, 1976.</P>
    <P>As announced in my speech on 26th May, 1976, on the Estimate for my Department, I propose to extend the duration of both schemes for a further six months.  The purpose of the amending legislation, as indicated in section 1 of the Bill before the House, is to obtain statutory authority for the proposed extension.  The proposed new termination date referred to in the Bill &mdash;8th January, 1977&mdash;was adopted so as to coincide with the four-week payment cycle up to the end of December, 1976.  The reason for prescribing the commencement date&mdash;26th June, 1976 &mdash;in section 2 of the Bill is to preserve the continuity of the schemes from the previous termination date, as prescribed in the 1975 Act, up to the new termination date on 8th January next.</P>
    <P>During the past year certain modifications have been made in the original programme.  For instance, the scope of the programme for manufacturing industries was extended to include food processing, which had been excluded initially, with effect from 5th December, 1975, after the seasonal peak in that industry had passed because, again, the programme was not designed to simply supplement a seasonal upturn in extra jobs.  It was intended to bring fresh, permanent jobs into the industries designed to be helped.</P>
    <P>In addition, the premium rates were improved.  Initially, the premium rate per worker was fixed at £12 per week up to 3rd April, 1976, after which it was to be reduced to £6 per week for the period 4th April, 1976, to 26th June, 1976.  As I have already announced, the amount of the premium has been raised to £15 per week with effect from 4th April, 1976, instead of being reduced to £6 as originally envisaged.  The second-phase rate, which has been increased from £6 per week to £7.50, will now apply from 19th September, 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> While the increase in the amount of the weekly premium to £15 should help to make the programme more attractive, I have also arranged, in addition to a publicity campaign in the newspapers, for the National Manpower Service of my Department and for the training authority, through its advisers, to undertake an intensive canvass of employers to again bring to their notice details of the programme and to encourage them to take advantage of it over the next six months.  I also arranged to have employers in manufacturing industry circularised by post about the improvements and extension of the programme.  These promotion drives should produce a renewed interest in the programme, which, I believe will lead to a further increase in the numbers returned to work.</P>
    <P>Expenditure approved to date under the programme is approaching £750,000.  Because of the higher rate of premium now applicable and in anticipation of an increase in the volume of payments, the provision of £1.25 million in my Department's Vote for the current year may be inadequate. If it is, I shall be happy to introduce a Supplementary Estimate before the end of the present year to meet the extra financial commitments involved, because it will be sure evidence of the effectiveness of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy for 1976 was to give priority to expenditure that would promote growth and sustain or increase employment.  The premium employment programme is one consequence of that strategy. One of the programme's attractions is that its effects are immediate inasmuch as people are immediately restored to gainful employment as a result of the programme.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the Bill provides for retrospection of the programme to 26th June, 1976, on which date the original programme expired.  I am anxious to avoid any interruption of payments to employers which might be occasioned by possible delay in enacting the new legislation.  For that reason, I would urge the House to give this measure a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Of course, there will be no opposition to this Bill. I should like the Minister not to have clothed it in such grandiloquent terminology as a strategy to end unemployment or anything of that kind.  Let us be realistic.  This is a very necessary stop-gap measure in a very serious state of economic recession to prevent further disemployment. That is what it is about. In so far as it is about that, we welcome it as a limited attempt to deal with a problem, particularly in the areas of the manufacturing industry such as textiles, which the Minister has mentioned, where 2,000 people have been prevented from being disemployed.</P>
      <P>In so far as it prevents further disemployment&mdash;and it has to the extent of the Minister's figures of 5,000 people over the past 12 months &mdash;this Bill is, of course, welcome. It in no way grapples with the massive problem of continuing unemployment which now appears to be stabilised between 110,000 and 120,000, averaging out over the year. It does nothing to deal in particular with the main sector of male unemployment which is in the building and construction industry with which neither this Bill nor the existing Act deals at all.  It completely ignores the major employment industry in the country, an industry giving male employment, in particular and which is an absorber of about 70-75 per cent of home materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building and construction industry is completely untouched by this legislation.  In my view, that represents a massive gap in the Government's strategy to deal with unemployment, and I am using the Minister's own phraseology.  Had the Minister confined himself to the purpose of the Bill, I would not go into this broader area; but the Minister in his introductory remarks did go into the broader area of planning to deal with unemployment.  This is not planning to deal with unemployment. This is a limited measure to deal with disemployment in certain areas that have been affected by our economic recession, certain manufacturing <Col N="862" /> areas and, in particular, in the textile field.  Some other manufacturing areas have benefited from it.</P>
    <P>The whole broad area of services is excluded.  The hotel industry is excluded and, in particular, the industry that will really give a fillip to our economy&mdash;the building and construction industry&mdash;is not included in this Bill and has so far not been referred to by any Government Minister in regard to whatever strategy they may have to deal with unemployment.  In our sort of economic situation this is the industry that needs the injection to get the economy going.  It is an industry that can be injected, whether by way of grant, loan, finance, tax incentive or remission and yet not do harm to our balance of payments position because of the high home-produced and manufactured content involved in all the various materials and ingredients that go into the building and construction industry, directly, and indirectly in the various ancillary industries involved in the production of modern homes.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to again emphasise that we will give this Bill a speedy passage.  It is necessary until the end of the year.  I should like to fully support the Minister in the sort of public relations drive that he proposes to put into it, to bring home to employers the fact that this £15 a week grant in respect of extra employees is something practical that they can avail of, that it obtains until January next.  It is no harm to have that time limit even though I would hope that, if the serious unemployment problem is still with us in December&mdash;and, unfortunately, it looks likely&mdash;the Minister would come in with legislation of this kind again.  That would be my hope.  I still think that the time limit incorporated in this legislation is a good idea because it does bring home to people the urgency of the matter; it brings home to employers the importance of getting on with it now, because it may not be there after January 6th.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister in every effort that he and his Department may make to bring home to employers <Col N="863" /> the importance of making use of this scheme, the importance from their own point of view by way of a practical benefit, the importance from the point of view of their employees, and the limited help it will give the economy.  But let us keep this in context and in perspective.  It is a very small stop-gap measure to deal with areas of disemployment within the limited field of manufacturing industry and does not get down to the real root of the economic problems that beset us.</P>

      <P>I also support this employment premium measure as I did when it was introduced some time ago.  It is a useful scheme which has been operated with success in other parts of the world.  I find it hard to judge from what the Minister has said how successful, relatively speaking, it has been in Ireland.  The Minister has given us a figure indicating that over 5,000 people have been re-employed under this programme to date.  I do not know what his target figure was when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>So it is about half of what was the target.  I have no doubt that it is a worth while scheme. We have got to push it on, give it the maximum amount of publicity and do everything we can to get employers and the organisations involved, the trade unions, trade councils and so on, to realise the benefits and to utilise the scheme and the money available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to take issue with the Minister in another part of his speech where he paints a glowing picture of the prospects of international recovery. But I notice that he does not depart from the international scene to talk about the prospects of Irish economic recovery.  An international economic recovery would help our economy but in this morning's papers there is the gloomiest forecast yet of our economic prospects.  One of the things that both Government and Opposition should start to do is to cut out some of the political play-acting that goes on&mdash;one can say this as an <Col N="864" /> Independent&mdash;and talk in more realistic terms about our situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and try to stick to the figures.  One cannot place entire reliance on the forecasts, even forecasts from bodies with such repute as the ESRI.  Their forecast this morning for the remainder of the economic year is so gloomy as to almost put one in a permanent state of depression with rates of inflation now anticipated to exceed 18 per cent and perhaps 135,000 people jobless and so on.  If I may quote one phrase of an article by the economics correspondent in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today:</P>
      <P>... &ldquo;faced with difficulties which seem to be insurmountable&rdquo; and that the goals of economic policy&mdash; lower inflation and higher employment&mdash;&ldquo;seem further from realisation now than seemed possible six months ago&rdquo;....  The ESRI's message therefore is that the economic recovery is over almost before anyone knew it had begun.</P>
      <P>Those phrases would depress anybody. I do not want to be a prophet of gloom but I would ask for a bit more realism when Ministers come into the House, spelling out the prospects of an international recovery.  Then one of the major institutes in the State on the very same morning predicts the prospects of something totally different taking place here in the next six months.  However, forecasts are only forecasts and one hopes that we will do better than this.  As an Independent it does hurt me to hear this constant emphasis that the boom is just around the corner and then read something like this in the daily papers that it is further off than it ever was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> I should like to ask the Minister one other substantive question.  During the Second Stage debate on the Principal Act I referred to the scheme operated in Canada.  The Minister's Department showed some interest in this.  The employment premium scheme in Canada is operated by a civil servant who is an Irishman whom I happen to know very well.  He is a fellow countyman of the Minister's and myself.  I went to some trouble and got a great deal of literature and information for the Minister's Department which I sent to the Department of Labour for comparative purposes.  I should like to know if the Minister's Department consigned this collection of literature to the waste bin; if the Minister himself has ever seen it; if he has ever made any comparative study of the situation in Canada; if any of our people have looked at the employment premium programme as operated in Canada.</P>
    <P>It is a rather different scheme but certainly one that is worth while.  It is a scheme directed specifically towards smaller industries in outlying areas. Its area of operation was restricted.  It was specifically designed to increase employment in the less well off regions in Canada.  Therefore, it was a scheme rather different in its scope from the one we are trying to operate here.  It is full of ideas which are readily applicable in Ireland's case.  I went to a lot of trouble to get this information and passed it on.  I wonder if the Department, in their wisdom, have ever bothered to consider any of this information, to assimilate it, make comparisons with the Irish scheme, or to investigate how some of the Canadian ideas could be fitted into the Irish context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Lenihan has already said, we welcome this Bill.  We welcome it without any undue enthusiasm because&mdash;as we pointed out when the Principal Act was going through last year&mdash;this is a limited measure which would, in any event, be limited but which is still more limited by the narrow way in which the Principal Act was framed. <Col N="866" /> I suppose one should make what seems to be a perennial complaint about the legislative programme of this Government; one gets tired of saying it and perhaps people get tired of listening.  Yet again we have the situation that this Bill is introduced five days after the previous Bill had expired.  The Minister says he will make it valid retrospectively so that nobody will lose out.  One wonders why, when it has been clear for the past 12 months that the Bill was due to expire on 26th June, 1976, it is necessary to wait until five days after that before coming into the Seanad with this Bill.  It seems to be quite impossible for Ministers of this Government&mdash;and, mark you, the Minister for Labour is one of the worst offenders&mdash;to introduce Bills in time and have them processed in any kind of reasonable manner.  Indeed, there are a couple of important Bills of this Minister hanging around&mdash;one in the Dáil and one in the Seanad&mdash;which have made no progress for the past ten months or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can only marvel&mdash;as indeed Senator West has already marvelled&mdash; at the manner in which the Minister introduced this Bill today.  Anyone coming to this country from Mars who, on his first day of arrival was forced to listen to the Minister introducing this Bill in the Seanad, would have come to the conclusion that whatever problems any other countries might have we, in Ireland, were sailing ahead in an optimistic way with things improving, unemployment falling and, generally speaking, an attitude that all is well in the world. But Senator West pointed out, it is unfortunate for the Minister that, on the morning that he comes in with this wildly unrealistic and over-optimistic speech, he is shot down&mdash; even if he needed any shooting down though I think everyone realises the position without it&mdash;by the report of the Economic and Social Research Institute which deals with the state of the country in a more gloomy fashion that I personally can ever remember a State body of this kind doing.  Even the Central Bank in its most gloomy days never used some of the <Col N="867" /> phraseology that this institute now uses.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;almost insurmountable&rdquo; is one I have never seen in an official document, and one marvels and is appalled to see it.  Indeed, reading the details of their submission, one feels that whatever about the phraseology, the actual facts they produce are in no way exaggerated.  When they say, for example, that inflation this year is going to be 18 per cent, in view of the fact that for the first six months of the year it has been running at 14 per cent, that figure is certainly the least one would expect.  I think we will be lucky to get out of it as easily as that.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, in spite of the gloomy facts that present themselves, the Minister has succeeded in preserving an invincible optimism, even to the extent of suggesting in his speech that the pattern of unemployment here is now more closely related to that of the EEC rather than Britain which was traditionally the case, at a time when our percentage unemployment is between two, three or even four times that of the continental members of the EEC.  What is the point of producing this kind of completely inaccurate information?</P>
    <P>One of the great problems from the start with the Principal Act we are amending today was that the target date for the industries concerned was fixed like a kind of lottery.  In other words, the position was and remains that an industry could only benefit from these premiums if it took on workers in addition to the number that were employed on the 20th June, 1975.  In other words an industry that was doing well on the 20th June, 1975 and has since then fallen on evil days and has had to let off workers and would now like to take on additional workers can in no way benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  It is a purely notional date, a kind of lottery and one wonders why the Minister did not at least update it to, say, instead of 20th June, 1975, let us take 20th June, 1976 which would have more relevance to present-day conditions. <Col N="868" /> Under this Bill an industry that since then has suffered economically and has let people off cannot benefit from these premiums.  Of course, the number of unemployed is now greater than this time last year.  Therefore industries have had to let off workers since then but this is not provided against in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the increase in the premium to £15 a week and talks about the increase in the amount of the weekly premium to £15, helping to make the scheme more attractive. As I understand the position, he raised the figure last April, by order, under the Principal Act, from £12 to £15 which, of course, did little more than cover the fall in the value of money since then.  The position now is&mdash;as he told us in the previous sentence, having said that the scheme had been made more attractive by the raising of the amount to £15 which apparently he had forgotten by the time he got to the following paragraph &mdash;that the second phase rate, which is being increased from £6 to £7.50 per week, will apply from the 19th September, 1976.  In other words, at the same time as we are told that the scheme will be more attractive because the premium is going to be £15 instead of £12, we are told that from 19th September next, immediately after the summer holidays, the figure will be cut again to £7.50.</P>
    <P>In view of the need to persuade industry to take on workers, one wonders, indeed one marvels, as to why it is necessary to cut the figure to £7.50 in September.  Surely it would be more sensible to keep the increased amount of £15 because, whatever attraction the scheme may have now, obviously that attraction will be halved as from 19th September next. One must bear in mind that, according to the Economic and Research Institute, there is going to be a very heavy increase this autumn and winter in unemployment, up to perhaps 135,000.  These unemployed are going to be helped by only half the rate of premium available up to September. One wonders at the reason for this.  One can guess at the reason but certainly, other than a purely financial <Col N="869" /> budgetary one, there does not seem to be any point to it at all.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one wonders why this scheme has been only extended briefly until 8th January next.  In the circumstances it would appear that at least 12 months' extension ought to be brought in.  We have now had over 100,000 people out of work for a year-and-a-half, week after week consecutively. There is absolutely no reason to believe that between now and well into late spring next year, perhaps even later, the figure will fall below 100,000.  In these circumstances one wonders why such a brief extension of the Bill is being brought in.  I know the Minister may say that he can come back in January with another Bill but it would appear, in all the economic circumstances, that a 12-month extension is the least that ought to have been implemented.</P>
    <P>I am very puzzled by the figures the Minister has produced for the cost of these schemes and the number of people involved.  As I understand them, he says that approximately 5,000 people have benefited from these premium payments.  With regard to that 5,000 it will be interesting to know from the Minister if he has any information as to the number actually taken on on foot of the Principal Act, on the operation of the premium scheme and the number that would have been taken on anyway. Obviously some industries would take on workers irrespective of the premium and they can benefit from it.  One wonders what has been the actual net increase in employment as a result of this Bill, whether the Minister has any information about this.</P>
    <P>There is another point that puzzles me considerably.  The Minister says that about 5,000 people have benefited and that getting near £750,000 has been spent.  I have done a rapid calculation and, as near as I can make it, that means that the average payment per worker has been approximately £144-£150.  In other words, the average number of weeks, if one takes an average of £12, in which these premiums have been paid is about £12. This scheme has been in force just over a year now.  Therefore, how can it <Col N="870" /> be that the 5,000 employers benefited, on average, from these premiums only 12 weeks per worker?  Does it mean that employers are taking on workers, getting the permium, letting them go and then in due course taking on further workers?  I would be interested to hear from the Minister with regard to that.</P>
    <P>Although it is unnecessarily limited, this Bill is potentially a useful one and we are certainly not going to hold it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that all possible efforts must be made to assist the employment situation in these very difficult times.  That does not mean to say that we believe that this is the panacea for all ills.  In fact, one could describe it as something similar to the Fóir Teoranta Bill we discussed yesterday, a sort of rescue operation.  It is clear that the only reason that makes necessary any piecemeal legislation of this nature or of the type we discussed yesterday, is the fact that there is a recession.  That is what justifies it to a large extent.  Fianna Fáil, the initiators of Fóir Teoranta, saw that this type of operation was very necessary.  They engaged in employing similar measures over the years to deal with unemployment problems.  They did so at one stage when we had 76,000 unemployed and we were considered to have never had it so good.  The idea of incentives, inducements and rescue operations is nothing new; it was, in fact, inherited and has to be pursued because we work within a system that is mainly supported by both sides of the House, the private enterprise system.  This seems to influence the policies and approaches that we make.  One wonders if this type of piecemeal approach even in Fianna Fáil's time could not be considered by a lot of deep thinking people, particularly in the field of economics, as schoolboy adventures into the realm of economics and is not really tackling the problem of unemployment in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not referring just to the present situation.  I am mentioning this in the context of the system we work in and the system we inherited <Col N="871" /> and the means by which we deal with problems within that system.  This is the means by which it has been dealt with over the years.  We can talk around it but that has been the practice; there was always the need, because of the system, to have this kind of rescue operation and the lifebuoy being thrown out every now and again.  It would be interesting to know how far those who have what I consider an unwarranted confidence in the private enterprise system to solve all our problems would be prepared to go to support a detailed economic plan, supported by socialistic legislation&mdash;socialistic in its content.  We would have a different kind of an argument if that was the case.  That is not a condemnation of the private enterprise system, it is an indication that this is the way it functions, works and is approached.  I do not want this to be taken as sarcasm, but the nature of the private enterprise system is that jobs go out of existence.  For example, a boy who wants to be a tram driver might find that the trams have gone out of existence when he grows up. That is the nature of the system.</P>
    <P>In close on 60 years of our own activities under the private enterprise flag we never have been in a position where any detailed economic plan was put forward outlining full employment. We had programming and a lot of attempts similar to this.  We had rescue operations because the system does not lend itself to considering in detail any long term plan of a detailed economic nature.  We go for this other kind of system and, therefore, a person like me has to accept the inevitability of working within that system and support it as best I can when it is in difficulty.  That is the basis on which I would support the Bill.  It is necessary and I do not think anybody can say it is not welcome in the present circumstances.  We should bear in mind that if somebody makes an attempt to solve the problem in another way, by having legislation that is socialistic in this content, we might have a different reaction.  I take it the Bill is welcome for the good reason that the only way the advocates of the private enterprise system have <Col N="872" /> been dealing with the unemployment situation over the years is by the same method, by public expenditure, grants, rescue operations and piecemeal things to get over the current problem.  That is the system we are working, and until such time as we get around to stronger socialist legislation we are going to have this problem and we will all support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Harte that the basis of our problem here is a collision of interest within the Coalition.  If we had an all out socialistic attack on our problems there is a chance that we might have a consistency. I am not pleading for it, I am not a socialist and I do not particularly believe in it, but if there was a consistency of approach towards the unemployment problem which this measure seeks to alleviate, it is possible that this benighted economy of ours might begin to recover.  Or, if we had the application of a consistently free enterprise philosophy towards it there might be the chance that it would recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble seems to be that the Government are going in two directions at the same time and also trying to convince themselves that they are moving forward in a unified way.  The pronouncements by Professor John Kelly, on the one hand, and former Senator Halligan, on the other, are in total collision.  It is amazing that this is not acknowledged.  This Coalition Government is in serious trouble ideologically. This measure is good.  Everything about it is good, but it dramatises for any of us who read the papers the state of despair and doom that grips the commercial, industrial and economic life of the country at the moment.  It is not going to change that.  Several Senators have said that it is merely a piecemeal job, a stop-gap job.  It is a kind of a plaintive cry for sanity and a compassionate gesture of help in a situation where the Government are becoming increasingly impotent in a situation where we have a small country which should be manageable enough, where we have daily this clenched confrontation between management and trade unions while Government Ministers plead, look on and hope for the <Col N="873" /> best, and then, in despair, introduce measures like this.</P>
    <P>What does it do?  The State will pay a subsidy of £15 per week to an employer for additional employed workers taken on over and above the number employed as on 20th June, 1975&mdash;that against the background of Gouldings, for instance, going into liquidation.  In other words, 300 or 400 workers are going to be unemployed so the taxpayer has to take them up.  They have to be paid unemployment benefit and if they are re-employed the taxpayer pays £15 towards their being re-employed.  Of course that is an advantage; it is better than having them unemployed. It means that at least they will be earning money and that money will be taxable.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Government because what seems to be happening to the Government is what happened to Governments elsewhere: they have become increasingly impotent, they can do nothing; they are not governing any more.  The Government of the country has fallen into the hands of the trade unions, on the one hand, and of management, on the other.  I would not put all the blame on the trade unions, but, certainly, it was an exemplary sight to see in England, when Chancellor Healy brought in his last budget and made his appeal to the trade unions, how they came to heel and helped.  The situation in the country began to improve.  Is it possible that the Labour element in the Coalition have any influence on the trade unions as such?</P>

The Coalition should take a look at itself and the manner in which it is divided between two philosophies with regard to employment and see this Bill as a symptom of goodwill.  Are the Government trying to do the best they can?  They are divided internally, at war with themselves and involved in a community where social and industrial confrontation and a damnable determination not to co-operate on any level is really wrecking us.

      <P>I did not intend speaking on this Bill but having listened to Senator Martin, one would think we are living in a perfect world.  One would think that every person was equal to another and that when decisions are made those decisions can be carried out fully.  We are not in a perfect world and this country is a small portion of that imperfect world. Therefore we cannot have a perfect system, and anyone who advocates a perfect system must be more foolish than those he has condemned.  I welcome the Bill because it gives an opportunity to industry to increase its workforce.  That is the whole reason for this Bill: to encourage industry to take on those who are on the unemployment list, something that is needed at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a substantial unemployment problem, like the rest of the world.  When we look across the water we see the unemployment problem there and the encouragement Conservatives and Socialists and all other grades are giving.  Yet that has no great influence on the reduction of the unemployment figures in that country. We know the problems in America. Theirs is not just a national problem <Col N="875" /> it is a world problem.  We can condemn the Americans for putting themselves in that position, but we must speak of our own country.  This excellent Bill has been introduced by the Minister to encourage industry to employ people who are on the unemployment list.  When the Bill is passed we should encourage industry to reduce the unemployment list.</P>
    <P>Industry is not just a group of one section of people, but a group of all sections, conservatives, socialists and trade unionists working together.  If they work together we will have better industry.  We should not knock one section without taking into consideration what affect that condemnation has.  The trade unionists recognise the problems and I hope they will make the right decision next week.  I am a member of a trade union and still a member of a conservative party. That can happen, and in our party we have members of a trade union who would be socialistic in certain ideas and conservative in others.  I see no conflict there.  I was brought up in that field; my family belonged to trade unions and, at the same time, we were conservatives in our ideas.  I could not understand the case Senator Martin was making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their reception of this measure here.  In one sense any piece of legislation can be regarded as piecemeal.  I do not make the claim that this legislation constitutes an effective answer to the present large-scale unemployment we suffer from in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator West asked if this had fallen from target, I explained to him that the original target figure for re-employment under this programme was 10,000.  We have achieved only 5,000.  Had we achieved 10,000 it would not in itself have constituted an effective answer to the problem of unemployment facing our economy. Indeed, it is a debate that belongs to a wider scale of reference than we have in this Bill.  We have not throughout the 1960s or in any part of the 1970s achieved anything near the target.  We have not succeeded in <Col N="876" /> reaching that figure of 25,000 new jobs per year.  As Senator Harte said, perhaps a socialist answer might improve matters.  Perhaps it would.  I believe from my own politics it would, but it is a fact of life that the society we live in gives only a certain amount of support to socialist answers.  That means for socialists that we must co-operate with others as we do now in this Government.  It means also that we must address ourselves to the realities of the society that exists around us.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the ESRI report this morning and Senator Yeats contrasted the gloom of that report with the optimism of my speech. Perhaps, Senator Yeats sees optimism where I do not, but it was legitimate to point to certain hopeful signs in our economy&mdash;with of course certain cautionary remarks about the future.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I would place a great deal of emphasis on the fact that, if our industrial costs are not kept down, unemployment will go up.  That follows as dawn follows night.  There is no doubt about it.  If our industrial costs continue to rise more and more investment in this country will be based on capital replacing labour.  There is a very close connection between the kind of incomes we award ourselves and the number of jobs that can be provided in our economy.  This is a problem that will not be settled this year or, perhaps, not even next year.  Certainly it was not settled throughout the 1960s.  When the ESRI report today comes to the conclusion that only statutory incomes control can settle the matter, they know, just as all other Administrations know, that that answer is neither effective nor desirable.</P>
    <P>This is a question to which our community will have to address itself to again and again before there is any satisfactory answer to the question of providing adequate employment levels in our community.  The position is that the Irish community, in its behaviour on the profit and incomes side, does not appear to be conscious of the connection between the kind of incomes we award ourselves and the effects that may follow for good or ill on employment. That belongs to a larger debate <Col N="877" /> and we do not have the basis in the debate on this limited measure, to go into that.</P>
    <P>We have improved the terms and this should lead to employers utilising the scheme more.  To revert to the economic situation and the grounds for some encouragement in our economic situation, there has been an improvement in our export position in the first quarter of this year.  The gloomy parts of the ESRI analysis are based on their prediction of a falling consumption pattern.  If they are right in that prediction, then other parts of their analysis would appear to be correct.  They admitted in previous publications that they have been wrong in their predictions. I cannot be accused of selectivity if I suggest that I treat that report with some caution in its gloomier passages.  I agree that, unless industrial costs can be kept down, undoubtedly the improvement in employment will not take place.  Without a recovery in the economy no scheme of this nature can close the gap.  I do not claim that this scheme or any other scheme on its own can do so.  This is a limited response for those industries that have been most grievously affected by the recession.</P>
    <P>Senator West referred to the Canadian scheme.  I must tell him that I do not recall his own communication with me and I will certainly investigate it.  Perhaps it has been lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should tell the Senator that, whatever about the fate of his communication, which I will certainly investigate, we have closely investigated the Canadian scheme and other schemes.  There are differences. Their scheme was based more on young disadvantaged people and I would see more similarity between the Canadian scheme and our own community youth project scheme. The scheme before us is designed not <Col N="878" /> for any social group but crudely as a response to certain industries which have been badly affected during the recession.</P>
      <P>I said we did not achieve the first target of 10,000.  I hope that, if the consumption pattern we have seen so far this year is maintained throughout the rest of this year, we should see employers here availing more freely of the scheme than they have in the less expansive position that obtained when the scheme was first introduced.  Because of that I am moderately hopeful that the targets can be improved upon up to the period of January.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Yeats' query about whether the rates coming down in September adversely affect it, we can always look at this and vary the rates.  We have the flexibility within the scheme to keep the rates at their top level and to extend the top level rate, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  We can and will do this.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan raised the point about the exclusion of the construction industry.  That has been excluded, as has the service industry. The construction industry is already in receipt of very heavy grants from the Exchequer and the appropriate assistance for the construction industry is, of course, through these capital measures announced in the budget.  That is the way to assist that industry and that has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They have.  At any rate, that is the appropriate measure of assistance for the construction industry.  This scheme is administratively impossible in the construction industry.  I looked at it very frequently to see if it could be applied there, but it is quite impossible because of the subcontracting features of that industry, the diversification of a firm's interest between different sites, the high degree of inter-firm mobility and the seasonal nature of the industry. All those factors make it impossible to apply it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the exclusion of the <Col N="879" /> service industries, service has not been the area most grievously affected during this recession.  It has been the industries like textiles and footwear which have been most affected and it is towards them that this scheme has been directed.</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats referred to the arbitrary way we had selected a base level date and said that was unfortunate.  I can tell him that, in the circumstances of firms who were able to give us a case for extra workers coming on just before the base date, we have been extremely flexible and we will continue to be flexible.</P>
    <P>I commend this measure to the House.</P>

    <Title>Employment Premium Bill, 1976: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to the base date, which arises under this section.  The Minister said the identical thing when we were discussing the Principal Act; that he would be flexible within a few days if an industry could show that they had let people off a few days before the 20th and that they would be brought in.  I accept that, but I do not think that is much help now.  In the light of what the Minister told us before on the Principal Act, I take it that the flexibility was perhaps three, four or five days.  It does not help in the least in the case of an industry which since then&mdash;last autumn, last winter, this spring or this summer&mdash;finds itself in difficulties, lets off workers, but later on would like to reopen or to expand production and wishes to take on extra workers.  In no way can it benefit from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem.  One has to take the number of workers the industry employed on 20th June last, or, if the Minister likes, perhaps on <Col N="880" /> 15th, 16th or 17th June, 1975, and if they take on extra workers beyond that figure they can benefit from the premium, otherwise they cannot.  For the whole of this year and the whole of the second half of last year, any industry that got into difficulties at that time and then wished to expand cannot benefit from premiums.  That is still the position.  When I heard that this amending Bill was being brought in I assumed, as a matter of course, that a new and more relevant, reasonable and up-to-date base date would be taken so that industries which in the past 12 months or so had problems would be in a position to benefit.  It greatly limits the operation of the scheme by being worked in this arbitrary way.</P>
    <P>I find the problem of the apparent average of 12 weeks during which premiums are being paid in respect of workers puzzling and I would be interested to know what the Minister has to say on it.  I am not particularly happy about his point that he has the power to increase the premium from £7.50 next September.  I am aware of that.  One might wonder whether he will be able to get the money from the Minister for Finance, but that is another day's work.</P>
    <P>A great part of the attraction of this scheme is that an employer can feel that, if he takes on extra workers beyond today's date, he will be paid the premium over a period. It is no great help in midstream, as it were, to alter the rate.  It is the incentive that is important.  The present position of an employer is that he knows that from the 17th September next the premium will be halved.  Therefore, if there is to be any change made it should be made now.  The Minister should not wait until September because by then the damage will have been done and employers will have assumed that there is only a relatively small time left for the £15 premium. The Minister, when he brought in the principal Act, at the very last minute brought in an amendment to include agriculture.  This amendment, as we pointed out at the time, was framed in such a way that it was very unlikely that much use was made of it. <Col N="881" /> As far as I remember, a farmer had to keep a man for the nine complete months before he was paid anything. We doubt if it will have much effect. I would be interested to know how many people in agriculture have received the premium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In agriculture, about 32.  As you know, the requirement in agriculture is that the person must be nine months in employment before he can qualify for it.  Because we are anxious to provide permanent employment, we are anxious to avoid the scheme being simply a supplement to the seasonal nature of an employment. We insist on this requirement of a nine-months' period before a person can qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister now appreciates that we were right when we said that this nine-months' gestation period would mean that nobody would qualify.  All right, nobody but 32 people in the entire agricultural industry have benefited by the premium.  He might just as well have saved himself the trouble of this dramatic last-minute rush to the Dáil and Seanad last year to include agriculture. It had no effect at all.  In any event, he has not answered my query, which I think is an important one, as to why the average period per worker has been as short as 12 weeks.  I find it very puzzling.  It would seem to subvert to a large extent the value of this scheme which is to provide, as the Minister said, permanent employment. It would appear that it is not providing permanent employment. According to his own figures, the average period in which the premium is being paid to workers is only 12 weeks per worker, and that is not permanent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the scheme as a whole.  All right, 32 people got the premium in agriculture, <Col N="882" /> but we do not know for how long.  I am not worried about it.  Once it is 32 we can forget about it.  It might as well not be in the Bill. Taking the general provisions of the Bill relating to industry, the 5,000 people the Minister says have gained these premiums at a cost of under £750,000.  That is an average of 12 weeks per man.  That is something that has me worried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's own figures about 5,000 people have been taken on and a premium paid in respect of them.  He says that the State has paid out to date a little under £750,000.  Now rapid calculation suggests that, if one takes an average premium of £12, the average period during which the premium is paid in respect of workers is only 12 weeks.  The calculation is a relatively simple one, if the Minister's figures are right.  The average period in which a premium is paid is 12 weeks, so that when workers come and go they benefit from the premium for a while and then cease to benefit.</P>

The Minister's figure of 5,000 people permanently re-employed does not exist because not enough money is being spent.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The two objects of this Bill are (1) to postpone elections to Boards of Fishery Conservators, due to take place this year, until 1977 or such later time as the Minister may by order decide, and (2) to abolish the present limit of 100 per cent in the increases which may be made by order in the scale of fishing licence duties under sections 68 and 279 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The postponement of the elections to 1976 was effected under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1974.  I had hoped that it would be possible to introduce legislation providing for a new administrative regime for our inland fisheries by October next, the latest time for holding elections to <Col N="884" /> Boards of Conservators under the existing system.  The report of the Inland Fisheries Commission, which had taken five years to complete, was received in July 1975.  However, examination of the various recommendations contained in this report and in the many submissions received from fisheries interests has taken longer than expected and as I consider it undesirable to hold further elections to boards under the existing electoral system, I am seeking power in the present Bill to postpone elections due in October next, thus prolonging the life of the present boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains a provision enabling the Minister to postpone the elections beyond 1977, subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but I am confident that such a postponement will not be necessary as I expect that it will be possible to have the necessary legislation for a new system of inland fisheries administration ready for enactment by the end of this year or very early next year.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to again express appreciation of the fishery conservancy work done by the Boards of Conservators.  This tribute is all the more deserved when it is considered that the members of the boards have worked on a voluntary basis and they have been so generous and helpful in their work for the good of the fisheries for so many years.  I look forward to the boards' members being prepared to continue their help by remaining in office for a further year.</P>
    <P>The second proposal in the Bill is to abolish the present limit of 100 per cent in the increases which may be made by order in the scale of fishing licence duties.  I have in mind raising the existing rates of licence duties beyond that limit with effect from the 1st January, 1977, but at this stage I cannot say what the level of the increases will be as these have yet to be determined.  As the House is aware, the licence duty payable in respect of drift-and draft-nets has remained unchanged since 1848 and 1925 respectively and salmon rod licence duties were last increased in 1959.  Higher <Col N="885" /> licence duties would provide much needed additional funds for the further protection and development of our inland fisheries.  Increases in the licence duties would have to be made by Order, the draft of which would be submitted to each House of the Oireachtas for approval.</P>
    <P>I recommend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is acceptable. There are two aspects in it: (a) to postpone the elections for another year&mdash;the Minister may, by order, postpone further if the proposed legislation is not law, and (b) the 100 per cent maximum increase in regard to existing rates of licence duties is being removed.  We can have an argument about whatever increases the Minister brings when the Order is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which it must be.  At this stage there is not much point in speculating about what the increases will be in regard to the various fishing licence duties.  Drift nets and draft nets and salmon rod licences were mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary.  We have to await whatever the proposed increases are.  We can only speculate that if the 100 per cent ceiling is being removed the increases are going to be substantial.  We can argue that when the matter comes before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the postponement in the absence of the proposed legislation. It is sensible to postpone the elections for a further year.  I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and this was raised in the other House&mdash;the importance of getting this legislation together.  The Inland Fisheries Commission Report is an excellent report to have.  It is a report commissioned six years ago.  It is now a year with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is a report which contains many excellent recommendations and provides the basis for a new system of election, supervision and control by boards of conservators in particular, amongst many other aspects for the conservation, preservation and enhancement of our inland fisheries.  It is a long overdue measure and I am certain that the Parliamentary <Col N="886" /> Secretary will get down to it. We cannot afford another delay.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this Bill that he may, by order, postpone the elections next year.  We do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to produce an order this time next year on the basis that the Bill is not yet ready.  He has all the material to hand and it is only a matter for the draftsman now.  I know that the draftsman is a difficult person to deal with, but basically it is only a drafting problem as of now.  I take it that in the past 12 months policy decisions have been taken in regard to what aspects of the report are acceptable to the Government.  I hope that policy decisions have been taken and that the past 12 months have at least achieved that.  If that has been done, it is merely a drafting matter and there should certainly be no excuse for not having legislation to hand within the next three to six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not perturbed about the postponement of the election of boards of conservators.  It is a minor issue.  The present boards of conservators, as they are constituted, are doing an excellent job.  While this proposed legislation will be an improvement, they can well do with it next year or the year after.</P>
      <P>Not alone should the method of election to the boards of conservators be improved but the employees of the boards of conservators should get a better deal.  At present, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, most of them are employed on a temporary basis. They have a dangerous and trying job and are working under very difficult conditions.  Their remuneration is low and their conditions of employment are quite awful and would not be accepted by any other group in the country. Although I look forward to the revision of the method of election to the boards of conservators, I look forward more to a better deal for the employees of fishery boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the protection of our salmon and trout stocks which are governed by this Bill.  I should like to impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that not alone is there a grave danger that our stocks of white <Col N="887" /> fish will be annihilated or seriously threatened by foreigners but that our salmon stocks are also threatened. Along our coast particularly in my own county, Waterford, on days like today there are dozens of salmon boats fishing.  They are earning a very good living at present.  The tales of gloom and doom that we have heard for the last six years have fortunately not come true.  The salmon fishing industry is in a very healthy state.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are to be congratulated for the way in which they sustained the employment that this industry gives, when, three years ago, they amended a Bill which had been passed by the previous Government.  In my county alone this industry has given good employment to a large number of people.  There has been no depletion of salmon stocks off our coasts or in our estuaries.  The last couple of years seem to have been better for fishing than many years previously.  This contradicts the allegation that drift-netting at sea would ruin our salmon industry.</P>
    <P>There are several things which have to be guarded against.  One is the probability that the fleets of foreign trawlers which are operating on our limits at present and sometimes inside our limits&mdash;but generally, the continentals and the Russians do stay on or outside the limits&mdash;will start netting salmon if they discover runs into our territorial waters in huge quantities, thereby doing irreparable harm to our salmon industry.  The Government should press for a 200-mile limit within the EEC and for a 50-mile limit for Ireland.  This would be a step towards conserving our stocks.  As things stand I can see a likelihood of our salmon stocks being mopped up at the existing 12-mile limit, as have our mackerel shoals.  Our mackerel and herring shoals have been decimated on the limit and outside the limit.  There is a grave danger that the same thing will happen to our salmon stocks if their passage into Irish waters is discovered by the foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should try to influence his colleagues in Government to seek a 200-mile limit for the EEC and a 50-mile limit <Col N="888" /> for Irish fishermen.  A 12-mile limit is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>A Water Pollution Bill was introduced in the Seanad a few weeks ago. Pollution is a much greater threat to our salmon stocks than anything else.  The River Barrow in North Cork was poisoned by some sort of pollution a short time ago.  Fifteen thousand fish were killed and a five-mile stretch of river was denuded of any form of fish life.  This type of pollution occurs every year in several rivers.  The Parliamentary Secretary should back the boards of conservators in their efforts to combat this type of pollution.</P>
    <P>The boards of conservators do their best, but the legislation which was passed in the Seanad last week and which will go before the Dáil will not solve the problem.  If anything, it will reduce the powers of the boards of conservators, who do an excellent job within their financial resources. It is imperative that boards of conservators be given power to prosecute people who pollute lakes, rivers, streams and canals.  It would be in the best interests of the salmon industry if the boards of conservators were given the powers which are being given to local authorities.  Pollution is widespread.  These are the people best suited to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the job of the conservators in certain parts of the country.  Last week we read in the papers of armed bands of poachers operating in West Cork.  This has also occurred on the River Moy in Mayo. These unscrupulous poachers can make as much as £1,000 in one night. The boards of conservators need strong support.  Are they getting the necessary financial backing?  They can do a great job if they are given the support of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about the postponement of the election of the boards of conservators.  I am concerned about the two aspects mentioned&mdash;that foreign trawlers will start netting within our 12-mile limit and that pollution will not be combatted as it should be, especially under the new Water Pollution Bill.</P>

      <P>I have an interest in this legislation.  I do not always agree with the views of my colleague, Senator Deasy, but I admit he is in a position to speak with feeling on this Bill because he comes from a constituency in which a lot of people earn their livelihood from the fishing industry.</P>

      <P>We would certainly make more money if we were drift-netting for salmon than we would as academics.  Perhaps we should take it up seriously.  I support two measures in this Bill.  Firstly, the postponement of elections of the boards of conservators and, secondly, the increase in licence fees.</P>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said in his speech, the licence duty payable in respect of drift-nets and the regulations under which drift-netters operate have remained unchanged since 1848.  The 1848 Act was constructed in an era when the boat had to be rowed or sailed around the coast.  Now they have large power trawlers with drift-nets which can be drifted several miles long.  There is a restriction on the length but that restriction is not being obeyed.  The board of conservators and their employees have a lot of difficulty in enforcing even our minimal regulations.</P>
      <P>I totally disagree with Senator Deasy's assertion that the increase in the amount of drift-netting around the coast is not likely to affect our salmon stocks.  I have given figures on a previous occasion, which are on the record of the House, of a system of rigorous monitoring of salmon coming up rivers and spawning in this country. That is the Foyle River system, and the monitoring is done by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  They produce figures every year.  There has been a drastic decrease in our salmon stocks. A recent television programme showed what the Foyle Fisheries Commission are doing about this problem.  They are curtailing the length of the netting season.  Mr. Haddock, who took part in this television programme, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> It is the belief of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, and it is borne out by a report of two Canadian experts which was commissioned and which has just been completed, that the drastic decrease in the number of salmon travelling up the Foyle River system is directly connected with the increase in the netting in the River Foyle area.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries Commission do not take the happy and optimistic view of Senator Deasy that drift-netting is not affecting salmon stocks. I must impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that, while I agree that water pollution is a serious hazard&mdash; and I agree with Senator Deasy's comments that the Water Pollution Bill will not solve the problem&mdash;the number of drift-netters, both legal and illegal, is a very serious threat to the survival of our salmon and sea trout stocks.  If the large foreign trawlers find the salmon runs they would certainly be a factor which would seriously affect our salmon and sea trout stocks, but salmon runs have been notoriously hard to determine, except in a close in-shore area where they must run up the river.  Even 12 miles out it has been difficult to detect their runs, although modern sounding devices may overcome this and create problems.  To my mind, the main threat at present is the number of legal and illegal drift-netters.</P>
    <P>I have belaboured this point at great length on other occasions.  I shall quote from two articles in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 26th June, 1976.  Both quotations are remarks by Chief Inspector Dan Good of the Cork Fishery area.  The first article is headed &ldquo;Would need Army, Navy, Gardaí, to beat poachers&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
    <P>Army, navy or special Garda assistance in a combined operation would be necessary to prevent a certain type of illegal fishing in the Castletownbere area stated Chief Inspector Dan Good in the course of his monthly report presented to yesterday's meeting of Cork No. 5 Fishery District, presided over by the Administrator, Mr. G.E. Byrne.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> Chief Inspector Good said their 17-foot boat was too small for patrol work and most of the fishermen were only laughing at them.</P>
    <P>He said he had taken the Administrator on their last patrol to let him see for himself the size of the nets that were being used.</P>
    <P>These, said another fishery protection officer present, were a mile long in contrast to the legal limit of 800 yards and some of the boats had two.</P>
    <P>He said some of the nets were on rollers, which meant one man could operate them.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We also visited the Dursey and Garnish area,&rdquo; continued his report, &ldquo;and it was obvious that the place was a minefield of fixed nets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency.  The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The piers were full of nets, especially monofilament, and there were boats in that area where drift-net is prohibited.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No water-keepers will ever have a chance of preventing this type of fishing without the help either of the Army, or the Navy or special Garda assistance, and it will have to be a combined operation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You would be attacked immediately by about 30 fishermen using oars, sticks and knives.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yesterday, accompanied by Mr. Byrne, we visited the Ballycotton area, and again the fixed nets were quite obvious and seemed to be an accepted fact.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless something drastic is done little or no protection of the drift-net fishing can be undertaken with our present equipment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Administrator said he would report on the matter to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries with a recommendation that the size of the boats be limited as recommended in the Inland Fisheries Report.</P>
    <P>All I can say is that this underlines more clearly than anything that has <Col N="892" /> been said in this report the need for the legislation which the Parliamentary Secretary has talked about to implement the vital sections in the Inland Fisheries Commission's Report. It is essential that this be done as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another problem and I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary did not deal with it.  It, too, is mentioned in the same edition of the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  It is an article headed &ldquo;&lsquo;Impossible situation&rsquo; on fishery summons&rdquo; and I quote:</P>
    <P>The impossible situation in bringing fishery summonses before the courts was referred to by the chief inspector of the Cork No. 5 District at a meeting held in Cork yesterday at which the Administrator, Mr. G. E. Byrne, presided.</P>
    <P>Chief Inspector Dan Good, in the course of his report said the court would not now apparently accept summonses served under Section 324 of the 1959 Act.  This was through the medium of registered post, ordinary post, through the medium of the Gardaí or through personal delivery by himself.</P>
    <P>The summonses were not accepted by the people for whom they were intended and they could not send them under District Court rules as there is no summons server in Cork.</P>
    <P>Mr. Good's report went on to state that there is no doubt in his mind that courts at the present time were being treated as a joke.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have on the one side,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Board's solicitor being paid by the taxpayer and the poachers with a solicitor and a barrister with free legal aid on the other.  How can you win?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He added that the position at present was the most hopeless one could experience.  &ldquo;Last week&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;I approached four men who were strokehauling and when I went to seize the gear, they wanted to know whether I really meant it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When I requested their names and addresses they only laughed. <Col N="893" /> This situation is happening with the other water-keepers and inspectors as well.  Only for the Gardaí and the help they give us at times we would have no business whatsoever operating in the city area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The problem is the problem of summonses served under section 324 of the 1959 Act which are not being accepted.  I submit that this problem should have been dealt with in this legislation.  It is a minor matter.  It concerns the boards of conservators and their servants and the summonses that they are issuing under the 1959 Act are not being accepted by the courts, so even the Act itself is now being considered as a joke by the fishermen and the legislation that we have is not being put into force because the courts will not accept the summonses.</P>
    <P>This situation should be dealt with in this legislation as well as the two minor matters which I support and which are dealt with here.  I want to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about these two specific points, but I would urge very strongly since he has referred to the 1848 Act and raising the licence fees that he should overhaul all the regulations in connection with drift-net fishing and draft-net fishing as recommended by the Inland Fisheries Commission.  They took five years to produce a report. Let us hope that it will take the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department considerably less to produce the legislation that is necessary to give our fish and legal fishermen some chance of surviving into the last quarter of this century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with much interest to the speeches of both Senators Deasy and West on this very important subject, and I think nobody could fail to be impressed by the degree to which they had informed themselves on the issue.  May I say from the start that I support the Bill as it stands but have the same kind of reservations about its limitations that have been expressed specifically by the two Senators I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parameters within which the Bill <Col N="894" /> are operating are endless and the Bill itself is perhaps not substantial enough within the parameteres that are available to it.  The job of the boards of conservators, for instance, with regard to the inland fisheries situation is enormous. I would see three particular problems involved or at least three headings under which the Bill itself can be scrutinised.</P>
    <P>The first, the most dangerous and persistent and damnable abuse of our inland fisheries is that of poachers. Senator West's quotations from one issue of the <i>Cork Examiner</i> were scarifying and were true, that you have in the first place a total flouting of the law, that you have wholesale and unauthorised drift-nettings, you have the inability to bring the culprits to book and you have a total impotence on the part of the law even to catch up with them or to serve summonses on them. This is a deplorable situation, particularly in reference to one of our most cherished resources, that is, the magnificent fishing facilities which the country has to offer.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I agree with Senator West as distinct from Senator Deasy on the matter of drift-netting.  I do not think drift-netting is the worst enemy of our salmon runs.  After all, it happens out at sea.  By comparison with draft-netting it seems to me to be comparatively harmless, but it is an activity that has to be limited severely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>But what is required is the legal limitation and the imposition of that limitation and the necessary teeth in order to enforce it.  Indeed legislation of this kind is hardly worth the paper it is written on unless it can be backed up with proper law enforcement facilities.  This is one of our biggest problems.  I wonder if again, like the previous Bill, we are not really just doing kind of piecemeal and patchwork activity on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing is the question of pollution.  In other words, the first problem of poachers seems to me the primary one, that everything having to do with these precious salmon runs has to be tightened, the law enforcement <Col N="895" /> facilities have to be increased. The Government will have to get very serious about it.  That is the poaching aspect of the problem, perhaps the primary one.  The pollution one is even more puzzling and difficult in the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The water pollution legislation that has been passed recently has given to local authorities powers which, as Senator Deasy very properly says, should be given to the boards of conservators because some of the worst offenders in terms of water pollution are local authorities.  They have been successfully prosecuted frequently for water pollution.  Almost every week I am sent a report by some local conservationist society.  The most recent I got was in respect of Lough Sheelin. This related to angling facilities at the lake being despoliated by pollution in recent times.  Who are the best conservators of that?  I would say the board of conservators, the inland fisheries people themselves, rather than the local authorities because it is happening over and over again that some of our best inland fishing grounds are being polluted as a result of the casual savagery on the part of local industrialists, farmers, pig raisers and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point.  The Bill is of course a limited one but it points out, by its limitations, the enormous problems that are not being solved by its terms.  In particular I should like to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take into account these matters which have been raised with much more eloquence and information by Senator Deasy and Senator West than by me.  The whole situation of our fisheries is one of extreme crisis and only very vigorous action in the framing and imposition of legislation and making it work on the ground as on the water <Col N="896" /> will save the situation which is at the moment drifting rather disastrously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred last week and on other occasions to the entire corpus of our conservation legislation.  In that I included the Wildlife Bill, the Water Pollution Bill and other Bills and I said that these when taken together would be reregarded as the corpus of our conservation legislation.  As someone who has not had the time to fish I spend more time in this House speaking about conservation and such matters than a number of people who speak as professional anglers and one wonders about the opportunities for reflection provided by angling.  Let us be clear what the crunch is in this Bill.  There is nothing controversial in it but there is this which is important: the Murphy Report and the commission's report was late in being submitted to the Minister.  I will be very blunt about what I have to say.  The Inland Fisheries Commission when they reported so late placed the Parliamentary Secretary in a number of difficulties.  The boards of conservators were also in difficulty because how could they conserve when they had no policy stated?  Let us be clear about the terms of reference of the commission&mdash;what it had to deal with: Who was to put the fish into the rivers of Ireland; who could fish under what conditions; what conditions were to prevail at the estuaries in Ireland; what effect would that have on rivers?  I will give a striking example, and I know Senator Martin <Col N="897" /> will be sensitive to this, in regard to the statements I made last year on a related measure.  At that time I condemned the indiscriminate dragging of salmon from the Corrib but of course people will know and I hope the Press, if they decide to report anything I have to say on this matter, know that I also condemned the commercial dragging of salmon in a most indiscriminate fashion by the authorised authorities who are allowed to operate the river Corrib and places like it. After I had spoken on that occasion numerous defences were made of private fisheries but an interesting point occurred to me about that.  It was suggested to me in many private conversations because of my attack on poachers that I was somehow attacking people who were working-class people at a precarious level of existence. I had pointed out that I was speaking about the preservation of rivers and the fish life that exists within them for future generations and I had been quite unrelenting in my attack on the private operators of fisheries who butcher fish carefully and systematically under the gaze of the public in Galway.  Tourists can watch an English-based company butcher salmon which are exported giving no employment content except to two people.  This raises the kind of questions which affect legislation like this.  What do we want to happen in the waters of Ireland?  Whether people like it or not there have been in the last years some good measures.</P>
      <P>The Wildlife Bill has been introduced. The Water Pollution Bill has been introduced.  We have been interested in cleaning up our waters but this is not accidental.  People have felt that the kind of pressure which has come from such enlightened Senators as Senator Deasy is often a crank activity but it is not a crank activity. It is an activity which must be commended because we were always told in the Seanad that this is the place where you could take the long view on legislation or you could have the shorter view on legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill which was debated with eloquence in this House and with a considerable contribution was mutilated <Col N="898" /> by political partisanship in the other House.  I refer to the Wildlife Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the guidance of the Leas-Chathaoirleach in this matter.  What questions should arise when you take a simple Bill like this?  Should the boards of conservators be abolished or sustained? Should their election be postponed? What power should boards of conservators have?  Should those powers be expanded in the Bill?  In what atmosphere are we considering the postponement of the election given that we have information about pollution and information about the danger to salmon and trout stocks which have been mentioned earlier? Finally is there an alternative structure?  I should like now to deal with these four points.</P>
      <P>The Bill, must be seen in the terms of the other Bills which come before us, that is, as legislation which affects generations other than ourselves. The word &ldquo;conserve&rdquo; raises the hackles of a number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sometimes seen as anti-progressive. People who conserve are conservative and are retaining an existing status against what might be an imaginative alternative development. Fishery conservators are referred to in previous legislation but we have never put our money where our legislation is.  Neither have we displayed public spirit.  Senator Deasey spoke about the difficulty of being a fishery conservator.  The cute person speaks about giving more drift-net licences or of easing the penalties on poaching. It is very difficult to argue politically in the pragmatic sense against the advantages which accrue to such a <Col N="899" /> person, in favour of saying the salmon stocks are not ours that the salmon stocks are the property of the people who came before us and the people who will come after us.  Our contribution, sadly, has been for the most part that we polluted rivers sufficiently so as to make it impossible for future generations to fish properly.  Regarding my deliberate points about the boards of conservators, I know the Parliamentary Secretary is receptive to this idea of having one body in charge of rivers rather than to have, for instance, a harbour authority in charge of the mouth of a river and a board in charge of the channel in the river.  We might have another body in charge of conservation.  Is it not time that we had a single authority in charge of fisheries in general and, in relation to water management, that we should bring it under the control of some single accountable authority? This is what people want.  I am a member of two local authorities, Galway Borough Council and Galway County Council and we hear reports from the board of conservators on occasion.  Do they have enough money to educate the young people that to take a fish by the most inhuman means possible is an ugly thing to do? Is there enough money for education towards the genuine value of conservation, towards the idea, even though it has not existed up to now, that the River Corrib and what flows in it, is ours and will be ours?</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary has within him the spirit that wants to say that the control of fisheries is at its most precarious and at its worst when it is in the control of private interests&mdash;the people who have the most investment in taking everything out and the least investment in putting anything in.  It is wrong to suggest that one could suddenly do a transition to communal or public ownership and that a conservation attitude would develop overnight. A public which would maul and take the fish out would be no adequate substitute for what takes place under private management or control of fisheries.  What would be adequate <Col N="900" /> would be an educated attitude towards river life.  Boards of conservators should have far more contracts with the Department of Education and should have far more money to enable them to publicise the value of conservation to the public.  Otherwise, you have on the one hand the licensed fishery people who are referred to as coming from the privileged class and the poachers who are referred to as coming from the working class.  Is it not an appalling indictment that in the location of the river one man would be a criminal and another would be recreating himself?  Is it too much to look forward to a time when we could educate all of our people to the value of our rivers and lakes and when we could have conservators elected popularly?  Near my office in Galway where I work every day people were afraid to report blatant acts of poaching which took place last year in Galway city.  Why is this so?  There is this division between what is a leisure activity and what is regarded as an economic activity to sustain the lower classes?  I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has shown so much courage during his period of office against the people who say that a totally open-ended drift-net policy is possible.  Such an opinion is the opinion of the mindless.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment I had been speaking about the general corpus of fisheries legislation.  I know that this Bill is non-contentious and I want to enable people to draw discussion on it to a close.  There are just one or two points I did not make before lunch I would like to make now.  Boards of conservators are tremendously important in so far as what they try to achieve.  I referred before lunch to the difficulty of obtaining democratic acceptance of such boards.  Perhaps the Minister would reassure me but I believe that boards of conservators should be entitled to carry out research, that there should be a research function involved. I put these questions on conservation in this almost empty chamber.  I agree with much of what the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to do but why is it not possible to do it now in view of the tremendous decay in what is available to the community from our rivers and lakes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to address the House about this other subject.  I hope the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Parliamentary Secretary, who has been so patient with us today, will enable us to introduce legislation quickly on the subject of fisheries. May I make an appeal to my fellow legislators in both Houses that on this occasion they would not be narrowly political about something that is a social matter?  Can I give content to my remark?  One can make demands about the number of drift-net licences from one part of the shore to another and be partial and say: &ldquo;We want this.&rdquo;  There is a national responsibility involved in conservation of stocks.  These appeals are often partially political rather than nationally responsible.  Our duty as a Seanad is to be nationally responsible in regard <Col N="902" /> to the conditions which prevail in our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>In another place on the notion of licencsing it was feared that the introduction of licences would represent policing.  I wonder about its necessity? People who have gone on the rivers of Ireland are sensitive to what is happening.  As a person who would like to preserve the resources of this country for my child or children I ask myself a straight question, to which there is a straight answer, about this awful, uncritical society, in which we live. Development and progress must take place; people must establish their houses but what about our rivers and lakes, our fish and the boards of conservators who look after them?  I would say: think again about the boards of conservators and make them communally responsible.  I referred before lunch to the class division, that the man who is referred to as the poacher is generally regarded as lower class and the man who fishes is generally referred to as the man of leisure.  In this Chamber was there ever a greater indictment of the society in which we live, in which the working class might have embraced waterways and the fish life within them as their own, that they might not become the preserve of the few?</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to restrain my emotion about the necessity for nationalising the inland fisheries system in general. The Parliamentary Secretary will know this.  How will boards of conservators conserve if there is private ownership and the greed that I have expressed?  Now I introduce a new complication.  How will you ever conserve and have boards of conservators if there is not adequate research into the state of stocks?  There is this mindless attitude in Ireland, unfortunately which can become popular, that the people who attack the indiscriminate use of drift nets&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary will know what I speak about &mdash;that the people, for example, who attack poachers are attacking people who have a necessity to live.  Yes, Sir, we have a necessity to live but our successors will have that necessity.  We have a responsibility to this environment and to everything it offers which <Col N="903" /> transcends our personal need.  I would say about this Bill in general and it is appropriate to say it&mdash;it is just not good enough to say that we are once again deferring elections of boards of conservators without saying it&mdash;I can see that there are reasonable objections which might be raised, for example, that we needed to see the effects of the Water Pollution Bill and the Wildlife Bill.  I referred to the disgraceful way in which the Wildlife Bill has been held up in the other House.  I hope the Water Pollution Bill is not held up in such a disgraceful and partisan way.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for reminding me of these things.  What are we to do then on the Fisheries Bill?  We can accept this Bill but we must stop the tokenism creeping into the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bills are not introduced merely by accident.  They are not introduced for any flimsy reason.  Bills ought to change situations.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state that he is in favour of the community management of fisheries in the community interest.  I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary will do that. He has had no serious objections to this Bill.  How can one conserve without having established ownership, without having established limits?  To whom do the rivers and lakes belong, to whom do our shores belong?  We are living in this lacuna of legislation or decision.  We have come to a time of demand but that time of demand was last year.  Last year I said that the putting in of young fish stocks was a national responsibility and their taking out was a matter of private profitability.  This society must make up its mind: does it want the distinction, does it want continually to make the distinction that the fisheries are for the usage of private people, not only that, for an élite amongst society? My view offered again and again in this House is that we have a responsibility. We have a responsibility about stocks.  That responsibility about stocks can be best met nationally. <Col N="904" /> It is trivial for people to stand up here and say that certain private fisheries are responsible.  My hat on that.  This House has to make up its mind.  Give fishing back as a fine recreational activity to every child in this country.  No less than that is what I have in mind.  I will repeat it: give fishing and the right to encounter our rivers back as a right to every citizen and every child.  That is our responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the boards of conservators are appointed are people not going to ask themselves the questions: are these the anonymous boards we knew before who made decisions; do we know them, who are they and so on? I think they are.  Once a decision has been made about fisheries policy then one can have a board of conservators.</P>
    <P>In this House the position of salmon stocks has been referred to.  That is a matter of scientific study.  It is not true to say that salmon are an endless resource to be exploited.  There is research to suggest the opposite.  Are we to take cognisance of that research?  I use this opportunity of saying what I would like from the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a Fisheries Consolidation Bill.  We would welcome a Fisheries Consolidation Bill which would establish the rights and responsibilities adverted to in previous legislation. What should a Fisheries Consolidation Bill such as I have suggested do?  It should establish responsibility for the waterways presently administered by the fishery conservators.  This should be done with imaginative power.  There should be a consolidation of legislation to enable life to continue in our rivers.  I do not like to be adding words upon words on this subject but may I make the point that more and more of our young people are turning against the recreational pastimes of their parents and rejecting carefully patented and patterned entertainment and asking to encounter their environment?  We can only allow them to encounter their environment when we have taken responsibility for the life that exists in our rivers.  We have seen the Minister for Lands being congratulated, and rightly so, for the expansion of the forestry and <Col N="905" /> wildlife service.  Why the delay in implementing the Murphy Report?  I do not consider the Murphy Report adequate.  The Murphy Report was referred to in the other House.  The Murphy Report was not adequate in that its data-base and research-base are too narrow.  For example the commission collected information on Lough Corrib at a most unsuitable time.</P>
    <P>Should a confrontation take place in this House on the issue of whether somebody should be charged £2 or not?  There is a bigger issue involved. Senator Deasy made a reasonable point about indiscriminate netting at esturial points destroying breeding possibilities within rivers.  Is that to be ignored?  The local authorities have been proven to be indiscriminately polluting our rivers.  Is that to remain the position?  The whole question of whether the life in our waters belongs to the tourist or to the native has gone undebated.  Is that to remain so? My view about the fishing industry&mdash; and this has been reflected in previous debates&mdash;is that I am not in favour of the narrow concept of keeping our rivers clean for tourists.  I want our children to visit our rivers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very interesting one. Why are we not giving boards of conservators real and broad powers?  Why are we not asserting community powers?  I am not attacking the Parliamentary Secretary, whose attitudes have been most progressive in this matter.  I am disappointed with the reaction to this Bill in the other House.  They have said that we have so many drift-nets in that part of the country and so many in some other part of the country.  They seem to have missed the point of the Bill, which is to re-establish conservators who were established under a statute which spoke about conservation.</P>
    <P>I would repeat what I said last week, that I wish more Senators were present to hear this debate.  We have listened to the notion that industrialisation and conservation are in conflict. We have not heard representative voices.  Why have we not heard these voices?  Perhaps, after all, the Seanad is a progressive body and we have <Col N="906" /> achieved a breakthrough about our relationship with the environment.</P>
    <P>On the question of the establishment of the boards I would like to see water management becoming a community endeavour under the control of community councils who would elect people to manage the waters in their area.  This is closely aligned with my philosophy of community ownership of the fisheries in general.  In so far as the conservators exist I have not said I have any criticism of them.  I offer an image to this House, one offered by one of the distinguished independent Senators, why should fishing become the province of an élite? Why should it not become one of the more regular recreations of our people as they encounter the water and life within it?  It would inculcate a degree of humility.  We are regularly visited by speeches suggesting that anything of a preservation nature is an enemy against progress.  The proponents of progress have dishonoured democracy by not coming out in this House and saying they are in favour of industrialisation at any cost, of polluting rivers at any cost, of telling the fishermen to go to hell, of telling me to go to hell.  They have not done that, so how democratic are they?</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can assure me that he will introduce legislation which will sort out this nonsense once and for all.  Let us be clear about what is involved and what is required of the legislation.  There was a lot of fuss in the other House about a £2 increase in licence duty but there was less fuss about the private signs going up all over the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary should say that he wants to conserve the maximum and the most variable sub-aquatic life and that he believes it is possible only by State legislation and State ownership.  There are enlightened people&mdash;I am told&mdash;the owners of private fisheries who have been continually writing to me&mdash;and I should like to say to them that if the State establishes a scheme, what is wrong with it that they would not participate in it?  What is wrong with it because the State runs it?  The idea that on a Bill such as this we would <Col N="907" /> not discuss the larger issues of conservation and allow to lie, without being announced, the fact that these fisheries are being advertised as attractive to tourists and not attractive to our own people is wrong.  Travesty is involved in that.</P>
    <P>Every year, as a sociologist, I read about the tremendous number of people who are forced to adopt occupations which are criminal and we keep everything away from them.  In the Wildlife Bill we give much to the people.  We celebrated the establishment of the forestry and wildlife service.  We created a new concept of marine park.  Why can we not conserve our rivers for all of our children, not as a tourist gimmick?  When boards of conservators are established on a communal basis and some one perpetrates an act it will be seen as an anti-communal crime.  It will, therefore, have much more force than a normal crime.  For all of these reasons I appeal to the Minister to come quickly into this House with a proposal to communalise the fisheries of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cáit Uí Eachthéirn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is beag atá le rá agam.  This Bill is of very limited content and its object is to postpone elections of the boards of conservators. I do not know why the need is there to postpone the elections.  I agree with Senator M.D. Higgins that we need a longer debate on the fishery industry.  We need to discuss the stocking of our rivers, the control of pollution in them and the extension of the fishing limits.  It is a very broad field.  The fishing industry is one of our greatest natural resources but it is the least developed.  I hope we shall get a longer period to discuss the interests we all have in fishing, especially those of us who live around the coastline and where there are good salmon fishing rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of drift- or draft-net licences I have known cases where many long-established traditional fishermen did not succeed in getting a licence whereas persons in professional fields succeeded in obtaining them.  There is no <Col N="908" /> point in saying a person must have been at least three years earning his living by fishing because it is well known that many sons of fishermen, unfortunately, have had to leave the country because fishing is a very precarious industry.  For some reason or another they have returned to this home base and are prepared to take the risk of becoming share fishermen or to get boats of their own.  This has happened along the Kerry coast, especially along the Cashin area. Because of that I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give first claim on any licences to those who have a tradition of fishing in their families. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá súil agam go mbeidh lá eile againn chun cúrsaí iascaireachta na hÉireann a chur faoi díospóireacht anseo agus ní dhéanfaidh uair a cloig nó dhá uair a cloig an gnó chuige sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their very constructive contributions to this debate. As I indicated, the Bill is of limited scope requesting the Houses of the Oireachtas to approve the extension of the lifetime of the existing boards of conservators for a further year and also to give the Minister authority to increase licences from 1977.  Senators availed of the opportunity to discuss the duties of boards of conservators, with particular reference to our salmon industry.</P>
      <P>Salmon is a very important species of fish in every sense of the word. This can be guaged from the fact that last year our income from the export of salmon exceeded £3 million and, as I mentioned in the Dáil, that is a sizable sum of money and is helping towards the development of our economy.  It is also helping in supplementing in a reasonable way the livelihood of a large number of salmon fishermen and others engaged in the processing of such fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question has arisen, particularly since 1972, of dangers to our stocks.  As Senator Higgins pointed out it is not an endless resource and <Col N="909" /> then the question arises, how do we exploit that resource for economical reasons or, to a lesser degree, for recreational reasons while at the same time conserving it for future generations, something that was emphasised so forcibly by Senator Higgins?  That is the problem the Department have. It is the problem of everybody, the boards of conservators and other bodies or groups of individuals interested in the development of our fishery industry, inland and sea fisheries.  It is for this reason that five or six years ago the then Government asked a group of people to submit a report on our inland fisheries.  At the time that request was made it was not thought that our salmon stocks were in any danger.  Fishing for salmon did not have the same image nor was it as extensive as it has been since 1972.</P>
    <P>The last Fisheries Act, with the exception of minor amending Acts, was in 1959 and, naturally, it was mandatory to update our fishery laws and in so doing to get as much information as possible from every source. The major source of information was the Inland Fisheries' Commission Report which took five years to compile. I also asked for views from many other groups interested in our inland fisheries and from individuals who may have had useful or valuable suggestions for embodiment in any future legislation that may be formulated. The final reports and recommendations from such bodies and individuals were not received before December, 1975.</P>
    <P>I gave the House an assurance 12 months ago that I expected to have this legislation ready for introduction in the Dáil or Seanad this summer. Unfortunately, I was unable to keep to that for reasons I am sure everyone will agree are justifiable and soundly based.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, the last major Bill in so far as fisheries are concerned was introduced in 1959.  The reports came to us late in 1975 and I did not like to rush the formulation of this legislation.  I thought it was too important and that we should try to get further views and analyse the views we had.  It was important that we <Col N="910" /> should devote time to the preparation of such comprehensive legislation. That we have done and I hope the legislation will be ready for the end of the year, or very early in 1977.  I am hopeful that we may still have it if the time of the Houses will permit us to discuss it late this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that it was better to continue the existing system and to extend the lifetime of the boards of conservators for a further year than, as I mentioned, rushing the proposed legislation through.  Our inland and sea fisheries are very important and by their contributions Senators have indicated their interest in the development of fisheries and, particularly, their interest in the conservation of the king of fish, the salmon, so far as rivers and the sea are concerned.</P>
    <P>Our volume of catches is increasing as is the income from such catches. In 1974 the figure from exports of salmon was £1,880,000 and it has moved to £3,129,994 in 1975.  That is a sizable increase and it was due mainly to an improvement in price but there was an increase in the volume of catches.  That is something we could not ignore but the system by which salmon are caught here, by drift-net, has aroused a great deal of opposition.  As I indicated in the Dáil and other places, when I spoke on this question, there is a great deal of resentment about the extent of salmon catches and the decision of the Government to increase the number of people allowed to use drift-nets for salmon fishing.  I can say to those people that we are mindful that salmon needs to be conserved.  The orders I have made continue from year to year and should the 1976 reports indicate that we are too liberal in so far as the catching of salmon is concerned, we would act with a view to conserving our stocks to a greater measure than we are doing at present, by further restrictions in the regulations attached to drift-netting licences. A number of regulations were brought in in the last few years but the Seanad, without labouring the point too much, will agree that any industry worth as much as salmon <Col N="911" /> fishing is&mdash;it represents more than 30 per cent of our total income from fishing&mdash;cannot be passed by lightly and will say fishing must stop because if it continues as at present stocks will disappear.</P>
    <P>I have great respect, as has every Member of this House, for scientific advice.  Those of us who do not have technical qualification to assess the habits of salmon, where they come from and go to must be guided to a large extent by scientific advice.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are fortunate in having first-class scientific information available but, at the same time, there is a divergence of opinion.  Some think that if people did not catch the salmon around the sea and particularly in the estuaries, they would all flow up the river and be available for the rod fishermen in the inland centres.  However, my information is that that is not so.  Salmon are just as likely to move off to Greenland or some other country as they are to move up our rivers to be caught by the rod fishermen.</P>
    <P>That is something about which we are gaining information all the time. At the same time, as Senator Deasy pointed out, the Government made a change in 1973 when they took office. Some said it was a gamble, and a very dangerous one, that we were gambling with our salmon stocks and if we persisted they would disappear but, fortunately, that is not the position.  The volume of catches is increasing and we are reasonably satisfied that they will continue to increase.  Should the opposite prove to be the case we will take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan, speaking for the Opposition, and other Senators who contributed welcomed the Bill.  Senators are reasonably satisfied to give powers to the Minister to increase licences as from 1977.  I am sure everybody appreciates that licence duties and fees which were not changed since 1848, 1925 and 1959 need adjustment.</P>
    <P>Senator West and Senator Martin were rather forceful about illegal fishing and poaching.  The Department are totally against illegal fishing and will <Col N="912" /> do everything possible to put it down. Parliament makes laws for the country and whether those laws refer to our fisheries or to any other aspect of our life they must be adhered to and honoured until they are changed constitutionally. I agree with Senator Higgins that people are annoyed about the position of private fisheries but until such time as it is decided to change regulations and make new ones the laws as they are at present must be enforced.  I agree it is exceptionally difficult to enforce the fishery regulations in many areas.  We do not expect to eliminate illegal fishing but we are trying to reduce it to the lowest level possible.</P>
    <P>We know that with salmon at present fetching £2 per lb. there is an incentive for people who feel they should have a licence, as well as those who have one, to catch those fish illegally.  It is possible that they do not see themselves committing a serious breach of our laws.  It is a serious breach of our laws.  The number of licences is limited and any person who has not a licence and is not legally qualified and is apprehended, brought before our courts and is punished will not get any sympathy from the Department.  I made that statement in the Dáil last week and I repeat it now, that I firmly believe in upholding our fishery laws and punishing those in breach of them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Deasy that waterkeepers have an exceptionally difficult job to do.  Many of them are doing it effectively and efficiently.  I do not think the scope of this Bill would warrant me taking up the time of the Seanad by saying what may be included in future legislation but I have never made a secret of the fact that our present system of protection needs a great deal of scrutiny.  It is obsolete. The protection of our inland and sea fisheries is made all the more difficult by the system that obtains at present whereby waterkeepers are appointed to cater for developments in their own immediate locality.  They move out and may catch some neighbour, friend or relative illegally fishing.  It is very difficult in such instances to bring such a person before the court.  When a man takes on such a job and gets paid for it <Col N="913" /> it is mandatory on him to do his job faithfully even though he may create enemies for himself in his own locality.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to ask ourselves before our legislation is finally formulated, if this position should obtain at all so far as the protection of our fisheries is concerned.  We do not appoint members of the Garda Síochána to look after the maintenance of law and order in their own locality; we do not appoint a guard to catch his next door neighbour who may be a publican in breach of licensing laws.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are sent to districts removed from their homes so that they are not near their neighbours and relatives.  The same system should apply to fishery inspectors and waterkeepers.  This would ensure that they did not operate in their own immediate localities.  Senator Deasy mentioned the inadequacy of pay and the employment conditions of waterkeepers.  Since I took over this office the remuneration of waterkeepers has been improved.  At that time the flat rate was £17 or £18 per week and now it is £44 per week.  It has stayed above the level of our inflationary trend during that period.  I realised that the rates of pay for waterkeepers were entirely inadequate and that their conditions were not up to standard.  I am hopeful that Parliament will devise a system to improve their standard further and to uplift their status.  I do not see why there should be any reflection on waterkeepers. Their work is similar to the work of the Garda Síochána.  They are trying to uphold the fishery laws which are made by Parliament.  It is an essential job and they should be given every encouragement.</P>
    <P>We are doing everything in our power to ensure that our fish stocks are not depleted.  Restocking is attended to by scientists and other officers of the Department.  Senator Higgins said that it would be an advantage to everybody if our fisheries were nationally owned.  That statement has been made by Members of the Oireachtas in the past, including myself, because there is a general feeling that our lakes and rivers <Col N="914" /> should be freely fished by all who are qualified to fish them&mdash;those who get a licence in accordance with the laws of the State.  The main difficulty in this respect is that our fisheries are in private ownership and are therefore private property.  The fisheries that are deemed to be private are owned by people who, in many cases, bought them from previous holders. It would be a great advantage to have our fisheries under national control. Perhaps they would be acquired by the State on a compensatory basis over a certain period.</P>
    <P>Our inland fisheries are of exceptional importance and their acquisition would be an advantage.  I have always been a firm believer in private enterprise but our lakes and rivers should be owned by the State.  That would be a desirable objective.  That is for an authority superior to me to determine. We should be throwing out these ideas and getting reactions to them.  I know there would be complications but difficulties can be overcome if there is the will to overcome them.  That does not mean we want to take property without giving compensation.  There is no need to go into the question of how the fisheries became private property originally. I am sure everybody in the House knows how that happened.</P>
    <P>Senators Deasy, West and Martin referred to pollution.  I agree that we must do everything possible to eliminate pollution.  Legislation drafted by the Department of Local Government was discussed in this House recently. We were closely associated with it because of the advice we gave in relation to our fisheries.  We have appointed six pollution officers.  We must be very watchful for pollution in so far as it affects our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Senator Ahearne expressed disappointement with the number of licences allocated to Kerry.  As I indicated in the Dáil yesterday, in 1972 when drift-net licences were freely available at £3 each only five persons in Kerry had licences.  There are now nine licence holders and they did not meet the strict criteria laid down for qualification for licences.  The allocation of licences is carried out impartially. The boards realise that licences are <Col N="915" /> very important.  They scrutinise all the applicants and determine allocations in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Department.  If any complaints are made about the allocation of licences they will be examined by the Department.  I am satisfied that in carrying out this exceptionally difficult task of determining applications for drift-net licences the boards are doing it to the best of their ability.  That is the information at my disposal.</P>
    <P>The licence fees seem to have the approval of the Seanad and I am glad that that is so.  They need to be changed to provide additional funds for the further development of our inland fisheries.  I do not think there were any other points raised.  I should be only too pleased to meet any Member of the Seanad at any time to discuss any aspect of our inland fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have advocated allowing more drift-net licences around the coast but my case is weakened considerably by the type of activities mentioned this morning by Senator West.  He quoted extracts from last Saturday's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  Through the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned it in his reply to the Second Stage debate, he has not given us any assurances that something is going to be done about the situation that exists.  I wonder if the Fisheries Act of 1959 is deficient or are the powers of the boards of conservators too limited to deal with the problem that exists.  It is a type of activity which is going on in the west Cork area at present in the No. 5 area.  If that type of activity is not stopped or curtailed drastically, the whole future <Col N="916" /> of our salmon industry will be in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>For years I have been reading reports of gangs of armed poachers around the River Moy in County Mayo, which seems to be an excellent salmon river.  More recently I have heard of gangs of armed poachers in various rivers in Donegal who have intimidated and ignored the waterkeepers. This activity has spread to the No. 5 District in Cork and it could well spread throughout the country.  If it does, there must be grave doubts about the future of our salmon industry which is, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, worth more than £3 million to the economy and is increasing every year.</P>
      <P>Inspector Good of the No. 5 District of the Cork Board has stated that they need help from the Navy, the Garda and the Army to combat what is going on at present.  He says if a bailiff or waterkeeper tackles these poachers he is likely to be attacked by 30 poachers brandishing knives and oars and anything they can lay their hands on.  Obviously there is no law in this area at present.  Is there a deficiency in the Act of 1959? What can be done to give the boards of conservators power to deal with the situation?  Is there impending legislation which will improve the position? It is obvious that poaching in these areas has gone beyond all reason. Unfortunately, poachers do not confine themselves to the legal season. They poach at all times.  If they continue like this through the autumn, spawning fish will be wiped out in large numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us what is being done and what can be done.  If the laws are not sufficient, what is the Minister going to do about it?  The laws probably are sufficient but the boards of conservators are probably not sufficiently financed and have not the manpower to deal with the situation. Do they need to be armed?  It would seem so from the report in last Saturday's <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  The courts appear to be treating the matter far too leniently.  Poaching seems to be just another national pastime in the eyes of many district justices in this country. <Col N="917" /> That is not good enough.  I appeal to the Minister to wipe out this blatant poaching.  Poachers are using monofilm nets which are invisible to fish and which are bound to deplete our stocks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have had reports from the administrator of the Cork Board.  The reports were, undoubtedly, most disturbing.  He indicated that there were people engaged in illegal fishing and that it was exceptionally difficult to apprehend them because of their aggressiveness. I can assure you, as I did earlier, that such people will get no sympathy from the Department.  I have asked the administrator to ensure that such people will be brought before the courts.  The report mentioned the difficulties of summonsing such people because of the absence of a summons server in the district.  Apparently, there is a legal conflict as to whether summonses can be issued by other means, such as registered post.  The legal position is being considered by the Department's legal adviser.  That people are let off the hook on such a technicality creates a doubt about the manner in which a summons should be served.  I am sure that our laws are not so ridiculous as to allow anyone off the hook, so to speak, since we are talking about fish, on that kind of technicality. I do not know whether we have that power.  I think we have.  However, we are getting legal advice and I am hopeful that it will deter those engaged in illegal fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more punitive system than our present one would be helpful.  If a man is brought before the court for a serious <Col N="918" /> breach of the road traffic regulations, such as dangerous or drunken driving. he will lose his licence.  If a fisherman is brought before the court and is found guilty, I see no reason why he should not lose his licence.  I can assure Senators that all reports, whether from Cork, Waterford, or any other county, regarding illegal fishing are getting the closest attention possible from the Department.  There is a great deal of illegal fishing throughout this country and we want it stopped as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will no doubt be aware, on the Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil I spoke at some considerable length.  I did so in order to explain the policy basis of the Bill and to mention the reasons for adopting the machinery contained in the Bill rather than some other type of protection.  I am sure that Senators will agree with me that it would be undesirable to travel down the same paths again in my present speech. Accordingly, I propose to refer to just a few points which have given rise to some discussion.</P>
      <P>Very briefly, the Bill has two main purposes.  It is directed at affording protection to a family against the vindictive disposition of the family home by a spouse and it seeks to encourage the voluntary transfer of homes into joint tenancy, by the removal in section 14 of stamp duty and registration fees.</P>

    <P>With regard to the first purpose&mdash; that of protecting the home against a vindictive sale&mdash;the Bill, in sections 3 and 4, proposes a straightforward system of protection.  A spouse will not be able to sell the home without the consent of the other spouse.  If he attempts to do so without the necessary <Col N="919" /> consent, the sale will, as a general principle, be void.  Where the other spouse&mdash;and for convenience, from now on I will refer to her as &ldquo;the wife&rdquo; since this will be likely to be the most usual situation&mdash;refuses to give her consent, the husband may apply to the court under section 4 for the court to dispense with her consent.  The court will not do so unless, and I quote, &ldquo;The court considers that it is unreasonable for the spouse to withhold consent taking into account all the circumstances...&rdquo;, including specific circumstances set out in the section.</P>
    <P>Supplementary protection against a vindictive sale is afforded by section 15 of the Bill, which makes it a serious offence for a husband to hide the existence of his wife from a prospective purchaser, and by section 5, which gives the wife a right to take proceedings for an injunction or financial compensation as the case may be, where her husband intends to dispose of the home, or actually succeeds in doing so, without her consent.  Moreover, sections 6 to 8 give the wife increased legal rights where her husband defaults on mortgage or rental payments. Section 9 of the Bill introduces a wide-ranging scheme of protection of the household chattels against oppressive sale or removal from the home. Section 14 of the Bill, as I mentioned, is designed as an encouragement to spouses where the home is in the name of one of them to place it in joint ownership.  The stamp duty and registration fees are removed by section 13 in regard to this type of transaction.</P>
    <P>This is, as Senators will appreciate, a very short summary of the main provisions of the Bill.  Although not a very long Bill, its provisions are of very great importance.  I believe that the Bill succeeds in its primary purposes. There is no doubt that the subject of vindictive sales over the heads of wives and children was a matter of very considerable concern.  The Bill solves the problem in a simple and straightforward fashion.  It has the great advantage of not requiring a wife to take positive steps to protect her position&mdash; a sale by a husband without her consent will be void.  Other possible <Col N="920" /> systems of protection, such as a registration system or a procedure whereby a wife could take court proceedings in regard to a threatened sale, have the disadvantage of tending not to protect a wife in situations where she most needs protection.  This has been the experience in other countries.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion as to whether the Bill ought to go further. First of all, may I refer to the wellworn assertion&mdash;made in regard to nearly all reforming legislation on family law&mdash;that it is piecemeal.  I have become somewhat weary of pointing out that an orderly phased programme of family law reform is not &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo; in any derogatory sense.  The alternative to introducing phased legislation would be to wait a very considerable time indeed until a comprehensive family law reform Bill was introduced.  To have delayed the recent reforms of the maintenance code, for example, or to have deferred introducing the provisions in the present Bill, relating to protection against vindictive sales, simply in order to achieve some form of legislative comprehensiveness would, in my view, have been grossly insensitive to the human problems with which the legislation is dealing.  No one should seriously suggest deferring the present Bill on this ground.  Equally, any person who knows anything about law reform will appreciate that in no country in the world can comprehensive legislation be produced &ldquo;out of a hat&rdquo;, as it were. There is no way of avoiding the long and hard road of research and analysis on which good law reform proposals are based.  I do not, therefore, accept that there is any basis in the charge that the Bill is in some way to be criticised for being &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been aired is that the Bill should deal with the question of compulsory joint ownership of the family home.  At the outset I would observe that it is interesting to note that there are virtually as many different schemes of joint ownership recommended as there are recommendations on this matter.  This complete lack of a consensus serves to highlight one reason for the non-inclusion in the <Col N="921" /> Bill of such a provision.  The question of compulsory joint ownership is a highly complex matter, requiring very detailed research and analysis before an informed and sound position on the question may be reached.  I mentioned in the Dáil that I would welcome more public debate on the question&mdash;preferably with reasoned arguments rather than emotionalism.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that call today. I would not wish to be understood as necessarily opposing compulsory joint ownership as something that may be introduced at some future date.  I am open to be convinced but it will require very cogent reasons to convince me.</P>
    <P>I will mention briefly the more important amendments to the Bill that were passed in the Dáil.  The others were of a drafting and technical nature.</P>
    <P>Section 3 has been replaced by a new section on substantially the same lines as the original.  However, the new section makes it clear that, in a case where an original conveyance by a spouse to a purchaser was void for some reason by virtue of the provisions of the Bill, a subsequent conveyance by that purchaser to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value will be valid.  It would not be desirable that an original vice in a title should continue to affect the home indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) of the Bill has been broadened so as to enable the court, in making an order compensating a family where a spouse has effectively deprived them of their residence in the home, to make an order, in appropriate cases, which will affect third parties as well as the husband.  A simple example would be where a friend of the husband colluded with him to create a fraudlently-based judgment mortgage on the property.  In such a case the friend could be required to contribute to the compensation of the wife, as well as the husband.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil, the potential scope of section 5 is very wide, and a large amount of discretion <Col N="922" /> is given to the court.  However, as I also mentioned, I am confident that the courts will operate the section in a common-sense fashion.</P>
    <P>Another amendment that was passed by the Dáil was the inclusion of subsection (2) of section 7 of the Bill.  This will enable the court to have regard to whether the wife received notice of her husband's defaults on the mortgage or rental payments and, if so, when she did, in determining whether to grant an adjournment under section 7 of proceedings by a mortgagee or landlord for possession or sale of the home, and, if it does grant an adjournment, in determining its duration.  Clearly, as a general rule, it would be desirable for the wife to receive notice of the arrears at an early stage, when the damage could be undone more readily. The flexible approach of the subsection has been preferred to the creation of a binding obligation on the part of a mortgagee or landlord to inform the wife within a specified time.  The latter solution would raise considerable problems regarding sanctions for breach of the provision as well as running the risk of hardening attitudes in cases where there is no question of any disagreement between the spouses.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill and I hope that the House will agree with me that it is a worthwhile measure.  Certainly I can say from my own experience of people writing to me that there are quite a few&mdash;not, indeed, a great number in absolute terms but enough to constitute a social problem&mdash;who are anxiously awaiting the enactment of the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is a very important Bill.  It is tackling a problem which is comparatively widespread and one which needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.  Certainly there will be no delay so far as this side of the House is concerned.  We are in general agreement with the Bill.  On this Stage of the Bill there is not very much that I want to say about it.  The principle is correct. The need is obvious and the Bill certainly meets, as far as one could <Col N="923" /> reasonably expect, the situation which exists.  When I say that the Bill meets the situation I think it would probably be impossible to draft a Bill which would meet all the circumstances which are likely to arise in the future.  Consequently, it is almost inevitable as time goes on that people will think of ways in which they can evade the terms of this Bill, in which they will go about getting rid of their house in a way which will twart the purpose of this Bill.  However, that is not a criticism of the Bill.  Every possible eventuality cannot be anticipated so all that can be done in due course is to amend the Bill when these loopholes show themselves.</P>
      <P>It is a Bill which is necessary, urgent, and acceptable in principle. Discussion of it would be most appropriate on Committee Stage than on Second Stage.  By then we will have a few amendments down. On this Stage I welcome the Bill. I am very glad it is coming in and I hope it will go through without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome as an interim measure on the road to a proper and just system of co-ownership of the matrimonial home.  I use the word &ldquo;interim&rdquo; advisedly because of the Minister's sensitivity about &ldquo;piecemeal&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, it is a very useful and important Bill indeed in Irish terms. Probably the source of greatest hardship in our family law has been the helplessness and the dependence of the wife who could not prevent the matrimonial home from being sold over her head.  She could not protect herself and her children from this hardship and she was solely at the mercy of whatever goodwill her husband would show her when the marriage relationship had broken down.  If he wished to desert her and sell the home and realise his asset there, she could not prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree therefore with the Minister, that it is a very important measure.  Indeed, I find it interesting to see what an empty House we have on this July afternoon to examine <Col N="924" /> the terms of the Bill.  I would prefer to think that this is evidence of support for the principle, as Senator Ryan said, rather than a lack of interest in its provisions.  When we were dealing in this House with the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Bill the point was raised that that Bill would provide for possible exclusion of a violent spouse from the home, but that it did not cater for the problem of the sale of the home to a certain party. The Minister, in introducing this Bill, has emphasised this aspect of it: the vindictive sale by a spouse against the wishes of the other spouse&mdash;normally, as the Minister said, the wife.  I think that is a misdescription of the scope of this Bill, with respect.  This is not just a Bill to prevent vindictive sale.  It is much more far-reaching, a much more important interim measure than the Minister indicated in his speech here today.  It is a general provision in that when any matrimonial home is being sold the wife's written consent will be required.  That is extremely significant.  I think it will have a deep psychological and cultural impact in the country.  The wife in Ireland has been in a very disadvantaged position; she has frequently not been consulted by her husband in relation to financial matters she is very often unaware either of the extent of the husband's property, of the value of the house they live in or of the husband's income.  She is often in a position of total financial dependence and ignorance.  She may not even be consulted in relation to financial decisions to be taken.  All too often it is the husband who has taken them and perhaps has been kind enough to inform her afterwards.  That is the position for a very significant number of wives in Ireland.  To try to pretend that is not the case, to try to pretend that it is not a matter of concern to those interested in law reform, is to ignore reality.</P>
    <P>Any measure which will have a general impact on all marriages in the country&mdash;good, rocky and bad marriages&mdash;and which will improve the position of the wife, her psychological <Col N="925" /> commitment to the partnership of marriage, is a very important one.  It will have a very significant impact on the wife's psychological identification of herself, of her role in the partnership of marriage when she realises the fact that her consent in writing will be needed for any mortgage, for any sale of the house, for any leasing or disposition of the family home.  I am fairly sure that the majority of women in the country are unaware of the proposed impact of this Bill.  Indeed I am equally sure that the majority of solicitors in the country are unaware that they will need a new type of requisition on the sale of property; a requisition to ascertain whether the vendor is a married man and, if so, whether the written consent of his spouse has been obtained.</P>
    <P>That aspect reinforces the point that this Bill is an interim measure on the road to co-ownership of the matrimonial home.  I regret that it is only an interim measure.  I think that it would be more desirable if the homework had been done&mdash;and I do not underestimate the homework and research that needs to be done&mdash;if the Minister had had the courage to pursue the principle, just that important step further and to create a concept of co-ownership of matrimonial property.  To do so would be to reinforce the concept of partnership in marriage, to have our laws reflecting the importance which we place as a State on the concept of a genuine partnership in marriage.  In this regard I would refer to the report of the Commission on the Status of Women, where at paragraph 450 reference is made to this question of the matrimonial home, and I quote:</P>
    <P>There are, we consider, two acceptable alternative courses by which the protection referred to in paragraph 449 may be achieved. The first is to provide that neither spouse of the marriage may dispose of the matrimonial home without prior consultation with the other spouse and that where it is not possible to reach agreement a period of time should be allowed to expire before any further action is taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister did refer to this first <Col N="926" /> alternative in introducing the Bill in the Dáil.  I would agree with him that the solution in this Bill is better than that first solution proposed by the Commission on the Status of Women. The report continued in paragraph 451:</P>
    <P>The second way in which the protection sought could be achieved would be to introduce a system of co-ownership of the matrimonial home under which the home would legally be regarded as being jointly owned by the husband and wife, by virtue of the marriage bond, except when an agreement to the contrary has been entered into by the spouses.</P>
    <P>The report states that this involves complex property problems, complex relationships and so on.  It will involve very careful study and the Commission on the Status of Women, not having the benefit of such study could not express a view on it.  The Minister in replying to the debate in the Dáil said much the same as he said here today&mdash;that it would require great research and study. As reported at column 426 of the Official Report for 27th May, 1976, he said:</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan and Deputy Mrs. Desmond both advocated joint ownership as being a preferential mechanism for securing what the Bill wants to secure.  In another jurisdiction where they had means of investigating these law reform measures in some detail, it took many years to investigate this question of compulsory joint ownership and the question still is to some extent an open one and the problems that were found in that jurisdiction are equally present here.  There could also be a constitutional difficulty in relation to compulsory joint ownership.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister, when referring to another jurisdiction, was referring to the British Law Commission Working Paper No. 42 on this subject of matrimonial property.</P>
    <P>However, we have a Law Reform Commission in operation here.  There was considerable enthusiasm for the Bill which established it.  It has come <Col N="927" /> into existence and is manned by expert people.  Has the Law Reform Commission been asked to study the problem of joint ownership of matrimonial property?  Has it undertaken this as an important aspect of family law which I understand was to be a priority for the Law Reform Commission?  I ask this because a number of people who wish that body well, who regard it as a very important step, now wonder what stage it is at. To some extent it has gone underground. This is understandable in that it takes time to get established.  It would be extremely useful for the Law Reform Commission to examine this and other aspects of family law reform so that the whole approach could be more co-ordinated and comprehensive and less piecemeal.</P>
    <P>If there is a constitutional difficulty, then that difficulty would seem to be a difficulty in reconciling the provisions of the Constitution which reinforce the concept of private property and the provisions which reinforce the family in Ireland.  It appears that the Government are contemplating a constitutional amendment in the autumn in relation to protection of the interests of the child. As yet I have not seen or heard a clear statement of the Government's intention but if it is intended to have a constitutional amendment on that aspect of family law, then I submit that it would also be appropriate to have a constitutional amendment to remove any shadow of possibility that the concept of private property referred to in our Constitution might weigh more heavily than the concept of partnership in marriage which would provide stability and strength to the family relationship.  The reason for having a constitutional amendment as in the other context, is that part of the Constitution is in conflict with aspirations in our society, in conflict with a desire to have legislation which reflects our social aspirations: the awakening and deepening aspirations of women to play an equal and full part in Irish society.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the introduction of a scheme of co-ownership <Col N="928" /> of the matrimonial home would be a significantly better measure in reinforcing the dignity of the marriage relationship.  It is a partnership which includes a partnership in responsibilities, in financial arrangements and so on.  It would be more significant than this measure, which&mdash;although it will have psychological importance in regard to the role of the spouse when there is a question of either sale or leasing or mortgage of the family home&mdash;will not give her any legal interest in the proceeds of the sale of the home.  She has no legal property right during her lifetime.  Admittedly she would have a substantial property right under the Succession Act.  If there is a will she could defeat the will by claiming her legal share; or if not she would get a substantial property right on intestacy and indeed a particular right to the family home. Why not give her a protection during her life which we have been happy to give her after her death?  Why were the same constitutional problems not posed by the Succession Act in limiting the disposition of property which is a private property right?  Why must we invoke some vague shadow of a constitutional difficulty to prevent the equal sharing in a lifetime which we have to a large measure achieved through the Succession Act after a person is dead?</P>
    <P>If I could return to the psychological significance of this Bill, any women's organisation in the country which has done any research into the problem, or listened to its members, knows of the cruel dependence of the wife in Ireland.  They know of her lack of possibility of protecting herself against the abuses that can occur.  But even more lacking is the recognition from society that she is an adult independent member of that society.  A wife in all her relationships outside the home is a less important person even to herself than is her husband. She has to get a signature accompanying her own signature on a number of legal forms.  She is not treated as an adult independent person by many of the agencies she deals with. She thinks of herself, ultimately, as being in an inferior position to <Col N="929" /> that of her husband because of the cultural conditioning factors which are so strong.  She is very largely in ignorance of the earning power of her husband.  Now, of course, it is to be hoped that a spouse who is not being maintained by her husband will enforce the procedures under the Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act for attachment of earnings. That will probably be the first time for a number of wives that the wife will know how much her husband is earning.  A considerable number of wives do not know their husband's income and do not share with him in the financial budgeting of the family.</P>
    <P>When one comes to the question of income tax it is the husband's income tax form which is the income tax form for that family.  It is the husband who signs it.  His wife's income tax, if she is earning a separate income, is included on the husband's form unless she applies to be assessed separately.  So again, in dealings with the Revenue Commissioners, it is the husband who is the sole actor in relation to the financial arrangements involved.  It is clear from the homework done by the AIM group in relation to maintenance of deserted wives and in relation to their recent report on legal separation in Ireland, that even in separation agreements the wife's position has been a very inferior one.  Quite often there has been no specific provision in relation to matrimonial property. Quite often the agreement has been entered into at the last minute, just before going into court, and consequently in a hurried manner.</P>
    <P>The report, which is a relatively small sample of 30 cases, nonetheless shows very decided trends.  It shows that the separation agreements do not protect the best interests of the wife. She is not adequately advised as to her possibilities of protecting herself. Obviously this report referred to the fact that the wife could not prevent the matrimonial home from being sold over her head.  That is one of the matters that will be remedied by this Bill.  There are other significant defects in the present <Col N="930" /> arrangements particularly stemming from the economic dependence of the wife who does not operate on equal terms with the husband in cases of matrimonial breakdown where it is necessary to enter into separation agreements or other arrangements.</P>
    <P>Consequently this is not a minor Bill dealing only with a narrow matter, the matter of vindictive sale of a family home.  It is a mainstream Bill, which will deal with the sale of every family home by a husband in this country from now on.  The Government should use their best endeavours to get that message across on the highways and byways so that it is appreciated and realised.  The Bill will provide for the need for consent in writing by a wife to the sale by the husband of the family home.  What does this mean?  It means firstly that the wife must be made aware in advance of the intention to sell or mortgage or lease the family home. That would be an improvement on the situation in a significant number of cases at present.  Secondly, it means the wife must be consulted about the intention to sell or lease or mortgage, including creating an equitable mortgage by bringing the title deeds down to the local bank.  She must be consulted in advance, and, thirdly, must give her written consent for that, which will be a considerable improvement on the present situation for the majority of wives.  She must be made aware in advance.  She must be consulted as an adult person with a view to express on what happens to the home she is living in, which is again an improvement in a large number of cases at present in Ireland, and she must give her consent in writing to such sale or lease or mortgage.  I would say it would be difficult to calculate the cultural impacts of that in Irish society, and hard to estimate the difference it will make to the psychology of the woman herself, to the psychological relationship between the husband and wife.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read the Minister's reply to the debate in the Lower House, where he expressed doubt about the support for a system of co-ownership. <Col N="931" /> He said that he felt it might not be something that would be wanted by the general Irish public. I have not got the precise quotation, but the sense one got is that he was talking about the usual political grassroots, the male grassroots.  I think if he were to go out and listen to the women speaking from a woman's point of view there would be a very strong support for the concept of co-ownership of the matrimonial home. There would be a very different perspective indeed.  In the case of the average Irish male who has had the entire disposition of property in his own hands&mdash;who has not had to consult his wife, who has not had to inform her of his plans&mdash;why should he be particularly anxious to change and to enter into new responsibilities and new commitments?  I would suggest that in looking for reactions to the proposal for co-ownership of the matrimonial home it is neither relevant nor adequate to look to the usual grassroots, the usual male grassroots in a constituency; but rather the approach should be first of all to create an awareness of the considerable impact of this measure and then to see what support there is for going further, for having a full system of co-ownership which would give the wife a genuine sense that the partnership in marriage was a partnership in relation to the property and the fruits of that marriage.  This would help to redress the very considerable imbalance she feels; that the work she does is cleaning the house, looking after the children, painting the house, exerting herself to make it a home, does not have an economic value in the community and is therefore of less value than the wages which her husband brings home.</P>
    <P>Somebody has said&mdash;there is an ironic side to it&mdash;it is only when a criminal conservation suit is brought that true value is put on the work that the wife does and her services within the house which normally do not get an economic value.  If one sees the damages awarded by our courts occasionally for criminal conversation one has some idea of a <Col N="932" /> judicial determination of what is the value of the work done by a wife.  I say that as somebody who would prefer not to see suits for criminal conversation in our legal system.  However, they are useful to point to as an example of one way of assessing the input of a wife to the matrimonial home and the reason and justification for having a system of co-ownership of the matrimonial property.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is regrettable that this Bill, which I described as an important interim measure, attacks only the symptoms of the imbalance in the marriage relationship.  The Minister said it attacks only the particular symptom of the vindictive sale.  I would say that it goes further than that and attacks the symptoms of any sale by any husband or any disposition of the property by lease or mortgage or whatever without the written consent of the spouse.  Nevertheless, that is only a symptom of the reality that the wife has been in a very inferior and unequal position.  It would be better to go further and create a genuine system of joint ownership so that the wife would have legal title.  She would have a legal share in the proceeds and she would have a genuine sense that the relationship was one of partnership.</P>
    <P>Another important matter was raised by me and other Senators when considering the Maintenance of Spouses and Children Bill and it becomes more and more obvious as we pass measures of this sort.  It is that we are creating some sense of a better balance in family law on paper, but little improvement in reality because we are not introducing side by side with these measures a comprehensive system of free legal aid and advice. Without that parallel mechanism which makes a reality of these Bills then I am afraid they will not have anything like the impact which they appear to have on their face.  The Minister must face that reality.  I do not know how to say strongly enough that unless we have a system of free legal aid and advice a great many people whom this measure and the Maintenance of Spouses and Children Act are supposed to benefit will not <Col N="933" /> benefit and cannot benefit under our present system.  Therefore, I was disappointed when this question of legal aid was raised in the Dáil that the Minister seemed to find it largely irrelevant to this Bill.  He referred at column 431 of the Official Report on 27th May, 1976, to the fact that it would be the husband who would be making an application to the court to have the court dispense with consent of his wife and said:</P>
    <P>Therefore I do not think the lack of legal aid will be an inhibiting factor in the operation of this Bill. The onus is being placed on husbands not on wives to move.</P>
    <P>With respect to the Minister, that is a complete misreading of the Bill.  If one goes through the various provisions of the Bill: it may be the husband who will be making an application under section 4 to have the court to dispense with the consent, but in very many other important sections it will be the wife who will make the application.  It is the wife who will make the application under section 5 in relation to conduct leading to loss of the family home.  It will be the wife who will make application under sections 7 and 8 in relation to adjournment and paying off of mortgage proceedings&mdash;or by and large it will be the wife.  It will be the wife who will make an application under section 9 for restriction of disposal of household chattels, and it will be the wife who will probably make the application under section 12 to voluntarily register the fact of the marriage in the Registry of Deeds.  So, far more of the sections of this Bill relate to applications by a wife, applications to protect herself, applications to record the fact that she is married, applications to prevent sale of household property while there are matrimonial proceedings ensuing.</P>
    <P>Some of these applications are highly technical matters.  She will certainly require the services of a solicitor, if not of counsel, and she will not get that service in the way that she should until we have a system of civil legal aid and advice.  The Minister is a solicitor.  He knows that some solicitors <Col N="934" /> are extremely helpful in these sorts of cases but they are the few: the vast majority of solicitors do not want to know if there is a family law problem walking in their door.  It takes time; there is no guarantee of any fee at the end and they do not want to proceed with it.  Voluntary organisations who have women coming to them with legal problems, and who direct them to solicitors, all come back with the same story&mdash;that solicitors on the whole&mdash;for understandable reasons if one is running a busy practice and has got to make one's overheads meet&mdash;do not want to take on this sort of family law application. Costs depend, in the end of the day, on whether you succeed in the application and the husband has enough money to meet the costs of both sides which may be a heavy bill for costs.  Therefore, the women are deterred, letters are not written on their behalf; they sit in the corridor waiting for the solicitor; he is not in when they telephone and they have the whole heartache.  As the Minister knows, that is why so many of these people go to the FLAC centres.  It appears that FLAC are carrying the Government and State responsibility in the matter.  I do not think they can cope with that much longer.  Perhaps, in some senses, they coped with it too long because it has been a safety value in the demand for civil legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that the provisions in this Bill are of little real significance to the people who are supposed to benefit from them; the wife in a position where the house is to be sold without her consent, where the household property is to be sold without her consent, where her husband has defaulted on mortgage payments and the mortgagee wants to close, or where she wants to register the fact of her marriage to prevent a sale of the property without her written consent.  In all of these circumstances she needs legal advice.  It is unreal and unfair that our system does not provide for a comprehensive scheme of legal aid and advice.  When mentioning this matter in the debate on the Maintenance of Spouses and <Col N="935" /> Children Act I made reference to the committee on civil legal aid and advice.  I referred to the fact that that committee still has not reported.  That was some months ago, and certainly the report has not been made public, if it has reported with proposals in this area.  I made specific reference to the chairman of that commission, Mr. Justice Pringle.  I said that, in view of his heavy commitment and engagement in the Special Criminal Court, he was perhaps not the best chairman of that commission because he could not spend enough time on it.  The Minister reprimanded me very sharply for that; implied that I was in some way criticising Mr. Justice Pringle, which was not the case.  I would say this of any person who is supposed to be bringing in a report as important as that on civil legal aid and advice.  If he has to do a very heavy, responsible and wearing job somewhere else, then get somebody else to do the job.  The important thing is that we do not wait more than two years for an important report such as that on civil legal aid and advice.  Also, when the report does come in, we must move very sharply on it so that the measures for reform of family law that we have been passing can become a reality, can be implemented actively and can redress that very substantial imbalance which has existed where the wife has been helpless and dependent in so many areas and lacking in proper legal protection.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn briefly to the specific provisions of the Bill.  I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan, it is largely a Committee Stage Bill and is one with which we will deal in more detail on Committee.  However, there are a number of matters on which I would like clarification.  Section 2 in defining the family home provides that it means: &ldquo;primarily a dwelling in which a married couple ordinarily reside&rdquo;.  Then it continues:</P>
    <P>The expression comprises, in addition, a dwelling in which a spouse whose protection is in issue ordinarily resides or, if that spouse has left the other spouse ordinarily resided before so leaving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> I should like clarification as to whether, in relation to one family, there can be two family homes?  I am not quite clear what is the precise significance of that.  If the wife has been deserted by the husband and he has established a home elsewhere, are there two family homes then, one in which the wife continues to reside and the other, the home the husband has which he wishes to sell?</P>
    <P>The second point is in the very important section 3 on the alienation of interest in the family home.  This is one of the key provisions.  Subsection (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Where a spouse, without the prior consent in writing of the other spouse, purports to convey any interest in the family home to any person except the other spouse, then, subject to subsections (2) and (3) and section 4, the purported conveyance shall be void.</P>
    <P>The exception on which I wanted some clarification is that no conveyance shall be void by reason only of &ldquo;(a) if it is made to a purchaser for full value, ...&rdquo;  Then, in subsection (6) &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; is defined as a person who &ldquo;in good faith&rdquo; acquires an estate or interest in property. I am wondering whether that is strong enough for the purchaser who, in good faith, does not ask any questions?  Is the Minister satisfied? Obviously it is a key provision.  Suppose a person is just buying a property and asks no questions about it?  If, on the other hand, it is considered adequate, then is it proposed to ensure that the requisitions sought by solicitors incorporate a provision to this effect, that it is implemented into conveyancing practice so that no purchaser could say: well, in all good faith I had no idea there was this provision? It is very important that it be copperfastened.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with where the husband applies to have the court dispense with the consent of the wife.  I am using the words &ldquo;husband&rdquo; and &ldquo;wife&rdquo; in the sense that the Minister was, that this would normally be the relationship; it is, of course, either spouse.  I am not clear about the precise <Col N="937" /> significance of section 4, subsection (3), which says:</P>
    <P>Where the spouse whose consent is required under section 3 (1) has deserted and continues to desert the other spouse, the court shall dispense with the consent.  For this purpose, desertion includes conduct on the part of the former spouse that results in the other spouse, with just cause, leaving and living separately and apart from him.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be slightly unfair. If the reason for the desertion is that the spouse has been driven out by the conduct of the husband then in those circumstances why should the court dispense with the consent of that wife to the sale of the family home?  I would say that, for this purpose, desertion should not include conduct on the part of the former spouse that resulted in the other spouse, for just cause, leaving and living separately, that that should not constitute desertion.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 5&mdash;conduct leading to loss of the family home&mdash; there are two cases where application can be made to the court&mdash;again it would be normally by the wife&mdash; where the other spouse is engaging in such conduct as may lead to the loss of any interest in the family home or may render it unsuitable for habitation as a family home, or where he has deprived the applicant spouse or a dependent child of the family of his residence.  It is in relation to subsection (2) I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Is this subsection retrospective?  If so, is there any time limit on how far back it goes because it provides:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the court, on the application of a spouse, that the other spouse has deprived the applicant spouse or a dependent child of the family of his residence in the family home by conduct that resulted in the loss of any interest therein or rendered it unsuitable for habitation as a family home, the court may order the other spouse or any other person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that cater for the third party's interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>to pay to the applicant spouse such <Col N="938" /> amount as the court considers proper to compensate the applicant spouse and any such child for their loss or make such other order directed to the other spouse or to any other person as may appear to the court to be just and equitable.</P>
    <P>The reason for my question is a fairly obvious one, that this would leave a cause of action to all of those spouses who were deprived of their residence in the past and who did not have the right we are giving under this Bill&mdash;a right of veto, if you like, a right to refuse consent and force the husband to go into court, if necessary, to establish whether that consent had been unreasonably withheld.  If that is a retrospective provision, then this should be made very clear because I am sure there will be a queue applying to enforce its provisions.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 6 the same question is relevant, whether it applies to existing mortgages.  Section 6 provides for payment of outgoings on the family home.  Subsection (1) says:</P>
    <P>Any payment or tender made or any other thing done by one spouse in or towards satisfaction of any liability of the other spouse in respect of rent, rates, mortgage payments or other outgoings affecting the family home shall be as good as if made or done by the other spouse.</P>
    <P>If a wife comes in on the default and makes a payment, then that would constitute a valid payment.  I know this is done in practice by wives who are in a position to do it, but I would like clarification as to whether that section also is retrospective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 9 in that they afford a necessary and parallel protection to a spouse, again usually the wife, where matrimonial proceedings have been initiated which would prevent the disposal of household goods or chattels without the consent.  It really is a case of disposal. Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>Where matrimonial proceedings have been instituted by either spouse, neither spouse shall sell, lease, pledge, charge or otherwise <Col N="939" /> dispose of or remove any of the household chattels in the family home until the proceedings have been finally determined.</P>
    <P>Then there is provision in subsection (4) for penalty where a person contravenes that:</P>
    <P>A spouse who contravenes the provisions of subsection (2) shall, without prejudice to any other liability, civil or criminal, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me, reading the wording that that could be rather harsh. For example, one can foresee a circumstance in which a certain item of household property would be pledged, put in pawn, that matrimonial proceedings might have issued and a person could find himself liable to criminal penalties.  Perhaps it would be better to insert the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; or a word which does figure in subsequent provisions for penalties.  In section 15, for example, there is the phrase &ldquo;knowingly gives information which is false or misleading...&rdquo;.  It is possible that this could create a certain hardship in that a person might have disposed of, sold, or pawned some household property without any intention of undermining the family provenance.</P>
    <P>I agree with the parallel procedure for voluntary registration of notice of existence of a marriage provided for in section 12.  This is the best combination of protection to the wife in this instance, the fact that there cannot be a sale, mortgage or disposition for value of the family home without her consent and, at the same time, a facility for voluntary registration of the fact of the marriage in the Registry of Deeds.  It is proper to waive any stamp duty or fee on the registration of such notice.  Again, it would be important to get over the idea that this is in some way evidence of a breakdown of the marriage relationship, that it is&mdash;if you like&mdash;a score, in a bad sense, by the wife <Col N="940" /> against her husband.  It would be much preferable if it could become standard practice that notice of a fact of marriage be entered in the Registry of Deeds.  There was no pejorative content to it.  It was not a last minute emergency measure where the wife feared that the family home might be sold.  In fact it would be desirable that it would become standard practice on marriage&mdash;put the notice in the paper and put the notice in the Registry of Deeds.  This would reinforce stability and be further evidence of the joint role of the husband and wife in relation to the matrimonial home which is a good way along the road towards creating a proper system of co-ownership.</P>
    <P>I welcome this measure and I think it is more far-reaching than the Minister indicated in his opening speech. At the same time I would ask that the Law Reform Commission be called upon as a matter of urgency to examine the whole concept of joint ownership of matrimonial property, and that a Bill to this effect be introduced; and if necessary a constitutional amendment together with the other proposals for amendment of the Constitution be made so that we can have the full realisation of some of the thinking behind this measure &mdash;of the concept of partnership in marriage, the concept of sharing in the responsibilities and the property dealings in the marriage.  This would ensure the consequent reinforcement of the position of the wife, the strengthening of her property interest, but even more so the reinforcement of her own psychological status as a coequal partner in marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest way in which we could describe this piece of legislation is to say that it is a Bill which simultaneously shows us how far we have come and how far we still have to travel.  I welcome the Bill whole-heartedly for what it does.  In common with many people both in my party and outside it, I am impatient for further change, a more radical change than this Bill actually contains.  But that does not stop us <Col N="941" /> from welcoming it for what it is.  It has all the things that Senator Robinson has said.  She is right in saying that the Minister is slightly underplaying some of the total psychological effects this can have in Irish society.  It is a Bill which will help to put an end to one of the most sordid forms of blackmail in Irish society, the blackmail of one spouse by the other based on a leverage which is given to that spouse by property rights.  Most forms of blackmail are reprehended by the law.  This is a particular form of blackmail which is actually based on the law.  It is based on property rights, based on the rights which do so much to sow dissention between people in our society.  This is why I am glad to see this Bill coming before the House.  I would like to think the degree of acceptability which it will find in the community at large and the response to its provisions will be such as to encourage the Minister to come back at the earliest possible opportunity with further legislation in this area. We cannot have enough of it; there are always gaps to be plugged and one of the greatest advantages of this kind of legislation is that by and large it does not cost taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>This sort of social legislation can be almost as profound in its effect as many more obvious budgetary and financial provisions in helping to create a kind of society of which we can be proud.  I have long argued for provisions of this kind.  I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will be back before long with more.  When I said that the Bill indicated how far we have come as well as pointing out to us how far we have to go, I would like to add a few words on where we should be going.  First of all regarding the question of compulsory joint ownership, the Minister noted that the question of compulsory joint ownership is a highly complex matter requiring very detailed research and analysis before an informed and sound position on the question may be reached.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned in the Dáil that I would welcome more public debate on the question, preferably with <Col N="942" /> reasoned arguments rather than emotionalism.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, there are few subjects which give rise to more emotional discussion&mdash;not just in this society but in any&mdash;as property, on the one hand, and marriage on the other.  When the two are combined the results can be positively inflammatory.  While I accept that and accept that there is a danger in what the Minister describes as emotionalism, I would also argue that there is a case for passion, a case for the sort of passion that is often needed to fuel changes that society needs to enact.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that call today. I would not wish to be understood as necessarily opposing compulsory joint ownership as something that may be introduced at some future date.  I am open to be convinced but it will need very cogent reasons to convince me.</P>
    <P>While that is a bit lukewarm, at least it is there.  The Minister is on the record as not necessarily, in principle, opposing compulsory joint ownership.  If that is all we can have at this stage at least it is something. It is on the record and the Minister will be faced with it again.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I am in favour of a close examination of the concept of compulsory joint ownership leading inevitably to some kind of legislation to give it effect.  I accept the difficulties are fairly substantial but rather than concentrate on the difficulties, we should concentrate on the advantages that would be gained from enacting a further provision of this kind in due course.  At the same time I should like to put in one slight proviso here on the question of joint ownership of the property of married couples, that is, that while I am in favour of it, I would hate to see this kind of provision introduced if it were to be introduced in such a way as would further widen the gap between the rights of people whose relationship is a contractual as well as a social one, and people whose relationship is merely a social one.</P>
    <P>It is a factor of this system certainly, <Col N="943" /> and of that of the neighbouring island, that families, households, whose arrangements do not include the normal marriage contract, are usually, in many respects, discriminated against by the operation of the laws of the land. More specifically within those families and households, the position of the dependent spouse, usually the wife, is also very seriously at risk in many cases.  This is, perhaps, not such a problem in societies and jurisdictions in which couples are free to decide, on the basis of civilised divorce legislation, whether or not their family arrangement will also be a marital one. In this society, as the Minister is well aware, there is no divorce legislation. It does not seem to me that there is the prospect of any such legislation for quite some time to come.  For as long as this situation continues to exist we will have a great many families and households in which the partners will not have, and cannot have, the protection of this Bill.  There are many situations, I dare to say, in which&mdash;because of the absence of divorce legislation&mdash; there may be families and households in which one of the spouses, very often the woman, may have contributed very substantially in cash, work, kind, to the creation, the acquisition and the maintenance of what is, in fact, the family home.  That spouse, unfortunately, would have no rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is proper to draw the attention of the House to the fact that family and marriage are not coterminous.  The fact that they are not coterminous is becoming recognised to a greater or lesser extent in some of our laws, some of our ways of treating people, ways of behaving towards responsible members of society.  In fact, I have been, to some extent, heartened to see the distinction between family, on the one hand, and marriage on the other is also one which finds a place in our Constitution.  Our Constitution has been criticised on many occasions by many people, not least forcefully by me on some occasions.  There are important aspects of Article 41 of the Constitution which I think we should consider here.  Article 41 is headed&mdash;not marriage&mdash;but <Col N="944" /> The Family.  Article 1.  1º states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>and Article 1. 2º states:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>There are a further two sub-paragraphs which have provoked some criticism in recent days about a woman's life within the home and the duties of women within the home.  It is only when we come to sub-paragraph 1º of paragraph 3 that we find the Constitution talking of marriage:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>The final two subparagraphs of this paragraph are the ones which totally prohibit the enactment of any divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>While it is true to say that the institution of marriage is one on which the family is founded, it is equally true to say&mdash;and I argue this very strenuously&mdash;that the family and marriage are not in any way coterminous. So, in broad terms, while I strongly support the right of joint ownership for married couples as a necessary, eventual and, perhaps, not too long prolonged extension of this Bill, we must not forget the situation in this country at present caused by the absence of divorce legislation which further widens the gap between, I might call, legitimate families who are married and legitimate families who, by reason of this Constitution, cannot be.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I should like to mention in brief to the Minister. One relates to the question raised by Senator Robinson on <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value from one spouse <Col N="945" /> who may not have received the necessary consent from the other.  Senator Robinson was worried about whether the section concerned was strong enough to protect a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser. My worry is slightly different. I wonder whether the section is strong enough to prevent the possibility of collusion between a husband and another party, or a succession of other parties.  Very often, in this sort of situation, husbands have access to more resources, more lawyers and, if there are loopholes in this legislation, erring spouses will be sure to find them and will be sure to pay the lawyers to find them.  We must really finne-tooth comb this legislation on Committee Stage to make sure that no such loopholes continue to exist.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make on the Bill is that I am very sorry not to see its provisions extended &mdash;as I believe they ought to be&mdash;to local authority dwellings.  Within the last week, I have had knowledge of a case in which a woman with seven children has been, to all intents and purposes, evicted from a local authority house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does extend to local authority dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the sense of local authority dwellings which are vested in purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is merely a tenancy also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted this has happened because it was my original understanding that it was not so.  The force of my example is, if anything, strengthened by the Minister's intervention.  We have had situations in the past, and the one I am talking about is very real and actual to the people concerned, in which a spouse has been effectively evicted from a large substantial house by the other spouse and the local authority concerned has so far, unfortunately, stood on the sideline and preferred not to take sides in what it regards as a marital dispute.  This unfortunate woman and her children are subsisting on what the State can provide them within the way of finance but <Col N="946" /> the State cannot provide them with anything in the way of housing because they have been allocated a house which is currently in the effective ownership or control of the husband. I would be very grateful if the Minister, when he comes to reply, would talk about perhaps enforcement in this area.  The sort of problem I am talking about does not necessarily refer to the sale of the house.  The husband in the case I have been talking about does not intend to sell the house and does not want to sell it.  He is quite happy to live there and to bar the door to his wife and his seven children.  There is a real problem here which does not necessarily arise on sale and can really only be solved by requiring that all local authority tenancies certainly should be jointly vested as of right so as to give the wife in this kind of situation some real rights that she can enforce against a husband who may be determined to deprive her of them.  Finally, as I said when I opened, I welcome this Bill.  It should be a prod and a spur to all our consciences.  I hope a whole-hearted and generous response in the community will be among the things which will convince the Minister not only that he is doing the right thing but that there is plenty of room for improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cáit Uí Eachthéirn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  As has been said, it is another step along the long road towards a comprehensive code of family law.  It is long overdue and it will be welcomed especially by the women of Ireland because by and large it is the husbands who own the family homes here.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to ensure that neither husband nor wife can sell the family home over the head of the other.  It is a protection against vindictive sales.  It is very sad that we have to admit there is more breakdown in marriage today than there has been over the years but that is all the more reason why this legislation is opportune. It will be welcomed by the wives and the children as some security should any breakdown happen in a marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate we have been <Col N="947" /> speaking about wives as if all wives were angels but there are cases where that is not so.</P>
    <P>A Senator made a point that when these cases are being heard they should be heard in private and I agree with that.  There should be free legal aid because unless a wife is in a very solid financial situation it would be very difficult for her to have enough money to take any proceedings.  A point made by Senator Robinson was that it would be a great benefit psychologically to women and that is a point that should not be overlooked. By and large they have been, in many cases, regarded as second class citizens and inferior in many cases not having rights.  Some of them do not know what the husband's income has been.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad reflection that we have to bring in this Bill.  Almost 90 per cent of those who have gone through the marriage ceremony here have said, &ldquo;with all my wordly goods I thee endow&rdquo;.  It is a sad reflection that in 1976 we have to bring in this legislation but human nature being what it is we have to protect the person who is about to suffer the injury.  More will be said when we take the Committee Stage of this Bill next week.  All we can do now is thank the Minister for the Bill. Everybody in this House, without exception, welcomes it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for the welcome they have given the Bill. It is encouraging, indeed, to find it welcomed and commented upon in such a constructive and analytic fashion.  The debate we have had today will be of considerable assistance in setting the background for the debate on the Committee Stage.  I look forward to a continuation of the debate at that Stage.  Senator Eoin Ryan gave the Bill a general welcome. He was worried about the possibility that over a period of time loopholes might be found in the protection which the Bill affords.  The Bill proposes a straightforward system of protection whereby the sale of the family <Col N="948" /> home cannot take place without the consent in writing of the wife.  We gave a lot of thought to the protective mechanism to be put in the Bill and we decided that this was the most effective that could be devised.  Quite frankly I do not anticipate that the husband will be able to find loopholes. But, as Senator Ryan says, there are many ingenious minds that would probably direct themselves towards trying to find loopholes in the Bill.  If this happens, it will of course be possible to block these loopholes as soon as they might appear; but I have not, quite frankly, any apprehensions that loopholes will appear.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson also welcomed the Bill.  She made the point that the Bill is a wide-ranging one, which does more than simply require the wife's consent for the disposition of the family home.  This is, of course, true. However, the main purpose of the Bill and the reason we are here with this legislation is to end the scandal of vindictive sales over the heads of wives and children.  The consequence of requiring the wife's consent will be that the wife will necessarily have to be consulted.  Senator Robinson felt that this was going to be of psychological importance for the esteem and dignity of married women of Ireland. Up to now the position has been that many wives have gone through life without being consulted by their husbands on business matters or in relation to the disposition of the family income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know but it does seem to me that this is an exaggerated view of the married state in Ireland.  The happiness and the success of a marriage do not depend on the legal trappings surrounding the ownership of the property.  The efficacy and happiness of the marriage depend on the relationship between the couple in question.  To provide in a Bill that a wife must give her consent in relation to the sale of the family home is not normally going to be of very great importance, because if it is a proper marriage she will already have been consulted fully and her view taken fully into account and if her views are against the sale of the family home <Col N="949" /> and it is a happy marriage they will be accepted.  This will be the reality of most marriages and, as I say, changing the legal trappings is not going to change the situation for the vast majority of Irish marriages.  It will change it in the case of those marriages which are not happy.  That <Col N="950" /> is the whole purpose of what we are doing in the Bill.</P>
