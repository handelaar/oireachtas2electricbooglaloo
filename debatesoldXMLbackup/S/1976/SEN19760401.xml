      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2 and to break for lunch from 1 o'clock until 2.30. It is proposed, if No.1 has not concluded by then, to interrupt business at 2.30 p.m. for the purpose of taking No. 2, and then to resume on No. 1. This is to convenience the Minister.</P>
      <P>Some Senators were inquiring about sittings next week.  It may be taken that we will be sitting on Wednesday of next week and it is proposed tentatively at the moment that if the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973, is not finished today that we will resume the Second Stage on Wednesday.  If it is finished today or if it overlaps we will continue then with the Building Societies Bill, 1975, next Wednesday.  That is tentative, but I think that is what will happen.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is the setting up of a planning appeals board to deal with appeals, references and other matters arising under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  All parties are agreed that it is desirable that the political head of the Department of Local Government should be relieved of responsibility in relation to <Col N="1632" /> appeal decisions in an area as controversial as land development.  The National Coalition's 14-point programme contained a pledge to set up independent machinery to deal with planning appeals.  Accordingly, the present Bill was one of the first to be introduced in Dáil Éireann after the Government came into office.  Over the last two years, the Bill has been discussed in great detail in the Dáil and now includes a substantial number of amendments made in that House.</P>
      <P>Apart from the provisions setting up the appeals board, the Bill contains a number of other provisions in relation to the operation of planning control at central and local level, including provisions strengthening enforcement procedure and provisions designed to improve some of the more positive powers in the 1963 Act. Account has been taken of the views of local authorities and of the many other bodies who made submissions to me.  I feel, therefore, that the Bill goes a long way to remedy defects which have come to light since the 1963 Act came into operation and provides, for planning authorities and the general public, a sound basis for future progress in the area of physical planning.</P>
      <P>This is a complex piece of legislation and I do not propose to comment on the individual sections, at this stage; these are adequately covered in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill and can best be discussed on Committee Stage.  I would, however, like to bring to the notice of Senators some of the main provisions of the Bill and what they aim to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main provision is the setting up of An Bord Pleanála, an independent body to be chaired on a full-time basis by a judge of the High Court or a former holder of judicial office.  The board will take over the appellate functions of the Minister for Local Government in relation to appeals, references and other matters under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Detailed provisions relating to the board are set out in the Schedule.  Articles 4 and 7 respectively deal with the appointment <Col N="1633" /> and terms of office of the chairman and ordinary members of the board while articles 6 and 10 provide that in the event of the chairman or an ordinary member being removed from office, a statement of the reasons for removal must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Physical planning does not, of course, operate in a vacuum and while I would stress the independence of the board in relation to the manner in which they carry out their function of deciding appeals and references, they must keep themselves informed on matters of public policy which could be relevant to planning and development. Experience in dealing with appeals shows that they frequently raise issues relating to national policy or development objectives, for example, achievement of the housing, industrial development, roads and sanitary services programmes, and conservation, environmental protection, airport and harbour development. A major purpose of planning control is to secure the implementation of such policies and objectives. Provisions in sections 5, 6 and 31 of the Bill cover this area.  Section 5 requires the board to keep themselves informed of the policies and objectives of public authorities, planning authorities and the Minister for Local Government, while section 6 empowers the Minister to issue general policy directives to the board.  Any such directives must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the provision does not, of course, enable the Minister to issue a directive to the board in relation to any particular appeal or other case coming before them for decision.  In order that there can be a two-way flow of communication, section 31 enables the board to make submissions to the Minister, either on their own initiative or at the Minister's request, in relation to planning matters.</P>
    <P>It is my aim that the board shall come into operation as soon as possible after the passing of the legislation. I should stress, however, that before an actual transfer of functions can be made, a great deal of administrative work will have to be done <Col N="1634" /> and various new regulations will have to be made.  Moreover, if there is to be a smooth transfer of functions, with minimal disruption of the work of deciding planning appeals, it will be necessary for the board to have some time to prepare for the task. Section 14, which transfers appeal functions to the board, will not therefore come into operation until &ldquo;the appropriate day&rdquo;&mdash; a day fixed by order under section 45.  To facilitate the smooth transfer of functions, provision is being made in section 21 (3) to enable the board to make interim arrangements for the use of services which my Department can supply, for example, staff and accounting services.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a number of changes in the existing appeals procedure. To discourage frivolous appeals, provision is being made for a deposit of £10 to be lodged with an appeal; on determination of the appeal, the deposit will be refunded unless the board consider the appeal is vexatious and direct the deposit to be forfeited.  A further provision in section 18 will enable the board to deal expeditiously with any appeal or reference which, in their opinion, is vexatious or is being unnecessarily delayed by any party.  And the regulations proposed under section 20 will allow the board greater flexibility in dealing with the details of appeal cases.</P>
    <P>With the increased rate of development in recent years and the growing interest of the public in environmental and planning matters, appeals have been running at nearly 4,000 per annum or about 10 per cent of all applications for planning permission. It is no longer practicable to ensure that every appellant who demands an oral hearing will get one, unless we are prepared to accept very extensive delays.  The board are, therefore, being empowered to refuse an oral hearing except where a direction to hold one is given by the Minister.  A person whose request for an oral hearing has been refused by the board will, however, be able to apply to the Minister for such a direction to the board.  It often happens that the <Col N="1635" /> issues in an appeal are clear but the decision is held up by a request for an oral hearing, sometimes to the detriment of the appellant himself. Where an application for an oral hearing is refused and the applicant considers an oral hearing is essential, a remedy is being provided.  Accordingly, I have no doubt that in considering applications for oral hearings, the board will use their discretion reasonably and weigh the advantages which may result in any particular case from the holding of a hearing.</P>
    <P>In an effort to improve the position at local level in regard to planning applications, I have introduced a number of new provisions and also provided for amendments of certain sections of the 1963 Act.  Provision is being made, in section 29, for the &ldquo;withering&rdquo; of all existing planning permissions five years from the date of the coming into operation of the section and, in the case of permissions granted after that date, five years from the granting of the permission. The section does not have a retrospective effect and extensions of time may be given in particular cases. There are safeguards to ensure that developments which are substantially completed are not left unfinished and that conditions attached to a permission must be complied with unless the planning authority issue a waiver notice in that regard.</P>
    <P>To encourage the resolving of difficulties by discussion at local level, I am making provision in section 39 for an amendment to section 26 of the 1963 Act, whereby the time for considering an application can be extended where the applicant gives his consent in writing.  And in that section also, I am including a provision under which local planning authorities will be enabled to seek revised plans, and so on, relating to a particular development and to deal with the case on the basis of such plans.</P>
    <P>An area where many problems have arisen in the operation of the 1963 Act is in the enforcement of planning control.  In response to representations and suggestions made to me by <Col N="1636" /> planning authorities, residents' associations and other interested parties, I have introduced new provisions which should strengthen substantially the powers of planning authorities in this area.  Section 25 will enable planning authorities to overcome problems which have arisen in securing the provision and maintenance of open space in housing estates in accordance with the terms of the relevant permission.  To discourage unauthorised development or use of land and to protect trees and other features which are required to be preserved in accordance with the terms of a planning permission, section 26 enables a &ldquo;warning notice&rdquo; to be served. Failure to comply with a &ldquo;warning notice&rdquo; will involve substantial penalties.</P>
    <P>A further strengthening of the position in relation to unauthorised development is contained in section 27.  This provides that the High Court, on the application of the planning authority or any other person, whether or not the person has an interest in the land, may prohibit the continuance of any unauthorised development or use, or where development is not being carried out in accordance with the terms of the planning permission, direct that it should be so carried out.  In addition, maximum penalties for non-compliance with enforcement notices under the 1963 Act are being increased by section 38: the maximum fine will now be £250 with a maximum of £50 per day in the case of a continuing offence.  The legal advice available to me is that £250 is the maximum penalty which can be prescribed while retaining the offences within the category of &ldquo;minor offences&rdquo; which can be dealt with by the courts in summary manner.</P>
    <P>The protection of the environment is a wide field in which many agencies are necessarily involved.  As Senators will recall, the Wildlife Bill was recently passed by this House and a Water Pollution Bill has recently been introduced here.  These two measures will expand considerably the powers available to preserve and improve environmental standards.  Environmental <Col N="1637" /> policy is and must continue to be an overall policy and I consider that it would be neither practical nor realistic to attempt to make one Minister solely responsible for this wide area.  What we need is effective co-ordination and I have set up machinery to achieve this.  The physical planning system itself can, of course, make a significant contribution to environmental protection and, therefore, the planning authorities have a crucial role.</P>
    <P>A number of specific provisions in relation to environmental planning were included in the 1963 Act and I am expanding these in the Bill.  Section 39 contains a number of these amendments. It enables regulations to be made which will require, in the case of certain major developments, submission of an environmental impact study with the relevant application for permission.  It also provides that conditions to reduce or prevent the emission or the intrusion of noise or vibration may be attached to planning permissions. And it includes such conditions, and conditions relating to air pollution, among those in respect of which a planning authority will not be liable for compensation.  A new section is being provided to cover the making of special amenity area orders in order to encourage planning authorities to consider the making of such orders, to simplify the orders themselves and to enable the Minister to direct that an order be made.  The law in regard to the making of conservation orders is also being modified having regard to the provisions of the Wildlife Bill.</P>
    <P>Before completing this general review of the Bill, I should like to refer to the provisions in sections 32, 33 and 34 relating to pecuniary or other beneficial interests in certain matters.  The provisions as originally introduced related only to local authority members because it was hoped to deal on a more general basis with the position of officials and others.  The sections were debated at length in the Dáil and, to meet suggestions made by Deputies, I introduced amendments on Report Stage extending the provisions to board members and other persons in so far as the matter could appropriately <Col N="1638" /> be dealt with in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the requirements of section 32 cover the making of a declaration of any interest in land, any business of dealing in or developing land and any business, profession or occupation which relates to dealing in or developing land.  Planning authorities and the board will keep registers of such interests and these will be available for examination by the public.  Failure to comply with the requirements of the section will be an offence with a penalty of up to £250, or six months' imprisonment, or both.  The requirements to be met where a person has a pecuniary or other beneficial interest in a planning or land acquisition matter coming before the board or a planning authority are set out in section 33, while section 34 contains supplemental provisions in regard to the taking of proceedings and disqualifications arising from conviction.  Since planning is an area where decisions can involve considerable amounts of money and where people engaged in the implementation of planning control can be subject to considerable pressures, I see the provisions in the Bill as more in the nature of a safeguard for public representatives and officials than an imposition, they should help to preserve those concerned from any taint of personal suspicion in regard to decisions involving the development of land.</P>
    <P>In the course of this Bill's passage through the Dáil I endeavoured to meet as many as possible of the suggestions put forward there.  I feel we now have a comprehensive and worth-while piece of planning legislation, and I have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House and asking for its early enactment.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by repeating what I said in the Dáil when introducing the Bill?  If any worthwhile amendments are put forward by any side of the House I will be only too glad to consider them.  I believe the function of Parliament is to ensure that the best possible legislation will emerge at the end of discussions.  Finally, with reference to the question of the declaration of interest, that is there as much to protect the characters of people in <Col N="1639" /> public life as it is to ensure that somebody who wants to be smart in public life does not get away with it.  We have had, unfortunately, in the past wild allegations made, both in the media and otherwise, against people when no proof whatever was subsequently produced.  In order to ensure that this sort of thing will not continue it is necessary for us to have in a Bill such as this the type of sections which have been included.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. We on this side of the House do not wish any delay in the passing of this Bill because it is overdue.  The last Local Government (Planning and Development) Act was passed in 1963 which is 13 years ago.  While that was a good Bill we feel that it is only right that after such a period of time there is need for change, so that progress may continue.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why there has been such a delay with this Bill.  Immediately after the Minister took office he told us it was his intention to introduce a Bill because he felt that there was a need for it.  He introduced this Bill in the Dáil on the 13th November, 1974, more than two years ago.  I can think of no other Bill in recent times which has taken that length of time to work from one House to the other.  It is not even law yet and will not be for quite a while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many mistakes have been made, by the Minister in particular.  The proper authority to make decisions as far as planning is concerned is the local authority, the local county council, corporation or urban body.  I know that from time to time they make mistakes and it is only proper that people should have the opportunity of appealing to a higher authority, which is at present the Minister.  The previous Minister for Local Government as in most cases upheld the decision of the local authority. Most, not all, appeals which came before him were turned down. I did not altogether agree with him in that.  I felt that there were some appeals which came before him which should have been upheld.  When the present Minister took office there was a complete about-turn and most <Col N="1640" /> appeals against the local authorities have been upheld.</P>
    <P>I know of a few cases in my own county where the decisions were not proper.  A garage was erected in Tipperary town at a very dangerous bend in the road and I questioned my local planning officer about it.  He said that he did not give permission, he turned it down, but the man got it on appeal to the Minister.  When that garage is opened I can foresee accidents happening there every other day.  I have heard that quite recently some people bought a piece of land on the Dublin road outside Cashel, a road on which we feel houses should not be built.  A group of houses will be built there where there is no water or sewerage. That was turned down by our local authority also.  When it came on appeal to the Minister he granted the appeal. I feel sure that the reason the Minister was so anxious to grant those appeals was that he was trying to ensure that his traget of houses would be built each year.  I honestly believe that, no matter where one asks the present Minister to build a house, one will be allowed to build it.</P>
    <P>It is a pity this Bill was not made law 12 months ago or possibly two years ago and a lot of the mistakes made throughout the country would not have occurred.  It is a good thing to see in this Bill that there will be an independent board to make decisions in future apart from the Minister.  Any Minister of any party will naturally be pressurised. A board will be independent of politicians and everyone else and will be able to make a fair decision.</P>
    <P>In this Bill it has been suggested that in future anyone lodging an appeal must also lodge £10 with the appeal, which could easily be lost.  I believe that £10 is not enough.  In the old days there were people lodging planning objection without any real grounds whatsoever.  I know of a case concerning a garage where a man applied for planning permission to erect petrol pumps, and across the road there was another garage.  The man across the road objected and he had no grounds for his objection.  He held up the planning appeal for 12 months, and eventually the other man got his planning <Col N="1641" /> permission.  I remember telling the person who was objecting that he could not hold the other person up for ever. He said he knew that but if he held him up for 12 months he, the objector, would do a good business for that 12 months.</P>
    <P>This is a frequent practice.  There are farmers who, not too friendly with their next door neighbours, when the neighbours applied for planning permission later put in some frivolous objection and held up planning permission for maybe 12 months.  That is why I think £10 is far too low.  Today £10 is not much money.  It should be at least £100.</P>
    <P>Another thing which worried me about the old Act related to farm buildings.  If these were built without a roof&mdash;such as silage pits and so on &mdash;no planning permission had to be applied for.  The result was that they were built alongside our main roads. A silage pit is something which is not too nice to have alongside main roads. I hope that in the new Bill steps will be taken to prevent buildings of that kind being built close to a public road.</P>
    <P>Something else in the old Bill with which I disagreed with was that people could build anywhere they liked on old accommodation.  In other words, if there was some wreck of a house on the side of a main road a farmer could decide to knock that down and build a new house there on the old foundations.  We have all seen a number of these buildings on the side of the road.  I hope that the new Bill will take steps to see that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>We in Tipperary at the moment are having some trouble as regards the old Local Government (Planning and Development) Act and I am wonderin whether in the new Bill anything can be done about cases of this kind. I refer to the American industry which was to be set up two miles south of Clonmel, a clean industry which would give employment to at least 600 people and a major industry for this country.  A group of people in that area decided to object to the planning permission.  Their objection <Col N="1642" /> was over-ruled by the local planning authority.  They appealed to the Minister and lost the appeal.  I think that the Minister did put in some new conditions that the firm would have to accept.  We felt very happy about that.  We felt that at last, after almost 12 months, the industry would go ahead.  Then, to our dismay we learned that those objectors were going to the High Court.  Immediately the High Court was mentioned, the firm decided to go elsewhere and to build their first factory in Puerto Rico instead of Clonmel.  We know that the industry is not yet completely lost to Tipperary.  We hope that something will be done in the near future to see that we get the industry.  What really worries me&mdash;and I suppose the same could apply to the new Bill&mdash; is that a person after being over-ruled by the local authority and the Minister &mdash; or by the proposed board &mdash; could say: &ldquo;I will take it to the High Court&rdquo;.  The people who propose to put their money into the industry will not take a chance then.  I hope that something will be done in the new Bill to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on this Stage.  When it comes to Committee Stage we will have a good deal more to say on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give a very warm welcome to this Bill both as a Member of this House and as a member of a local authority for more than 30 years.  Nobody in this House can complain about the length of time this Bill has taken to pass through the other House.  Indeed, anybody who takes even a cursory glance at the Dáil Debates will understand the main reasons for the delay.  The Bill was circulated in 1974, just two years ago. The Dáil Debates confirm that some 140 amendments were put down with which the Minister had to deal.  There was generous praise from three of the Deputies who pursued the Minister for most of the time when the Bill was in the Dáil &mdash; Deputies Haughey, Faulkner and Molloy &mdash; at the conclusion of the debate on the final Stages of the Bill.  I think we can say that it is legislation that was considered at very great length <Col N="1643" /> in the Dáil which was proper for legislation of this type which includes very many important amendments and additions to the 1963 Act.  The Minister, true to his word, did give responsible and constructive amendments the fullest consideration and did include, both on Committee Stage and particularly on Report Stage, certain significant amendments to which I propose to make a short reference to in my contribution here.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this morning that the main provision, the one which undoubtedly would receive most publicity and would probably get the warmest welcome from members of local authorities and I think generally from the public is the establishment of an independent board to deal with planning appeals.  I think most members of public authorities&mdash;they have confirmed this from time to time&mdash;have felt critical of the decision of successive Ministers for Local Government.  They felt aggrieved.  Indeed, individuals and corporate bodies from time to time have been often incensed at what they thought was a decision wrongly made by the Minister.  All sorts of accusations, amounting almost to bribery and corruption&mdash;certainly what I would describe as the least of them was political influence&mdash;have been hurled around the place.  I would like to say that my experience over a long number of years has been that generally the successive Ministers have upheld the decisions of the planning authorities throughout the country.  There have been what appeared to be inexplicable decisions from time to time by successive Ministers. Then the Minister's side of the case has hardly ever been, as far as I am aware, put to the local authorities or put generally to the public.  A mystery has inevitably surrounded these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This independent board will do two things which I think are essential, perhaps because we tend to be a suspicious people by nature and we do not tend always to give credit where credit is due and bad words often seem to travel more swiftly than good words.  This independent board will give an independent judgment on <Col N="1644" /> appeals referred to it and it will appear to be giving justice, which is equally important.</P>
    <P>The second provision in this Bill which I like and which I welcome again as a public representative is that it does give some extra powers to the local elected representatives in particular under section 26 (3) whereby the elected representatives of local authorities may decide to amend their development plan because logically they are responsible for a development plan in their own local authority.  I hope that members of local authorities will be responsible in their use of this new power.  I would not like to see them taking advantage of this to make drastic or undesirable alterations to their own development plan.  I can recall being chairman or Mayor of the Limerick City Council when the 1967 development plan went through after months of discussion.  I would be very sorry to see drastic amendments to that plan which included many desirable sections, particularly those for the preservation of historical buildings and the provision of open spaces and amenities for residents in new housing areas.  I would like to see all these things maintained as a matter of principle. I hate to think that the dictates of commerce&mdash;and I speak as a business man&mdash;would induce a local authority to make any unworthy changes in their development plan.</P>
    <P>As a corollary to that new section 26 (3) the Minister has provided that the appropriate period for deciding the planning application to which the new procedure applies should be calculated from the day the notice required under the new section is first published, the relative period being two months.  That is a welcome addition to the new powers being given to members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>A further matter of contention for many years, and one on which I have expressed strong views from time to time, is adjusted or rectified in section 29, which provides for the withering of existing planning permissions five years after the Act comes into force or in regard to future planning permissions. That is a very worth-while <Col N="1645" /> amendment.  Those of us who are members of local authorities have experience of land being purchased for alleged development of one kind or another and left there and in some cases subsequently resold at substantial profits.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of reselling and making a substantial profit, due in no way to what the potential developer has done &mdash; because he has done nothing &mdash; there is the question in the older cities, such as Dublin, Cork or Limerick, of open spaces acquired for certain developments and left there and constituting an eye-sore in the heart-centre of these cities.  This provision will put a stop to that.  The only comment I would make is that five years is too long.  I regret that there is no retrospective element in the legislation. The Minister and very few people would agree but, from personal knowledge, it is one case in which retrospective legislation might be justified&mdash;possibly the only one because normally I am opposed to retrospective legislation.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the lack of powers of members of local authorities, I wish to make a few comments.  Perhaps some of these points are seeking clarification rather than making any striking comment.  I am not quite clear&mdash;though I should be&mdash;exactly who or what is a planning authority.  When the 1963 Act came into effect in 1964, with a great fanfare of trumpets, one of the things we were told in the Limerick City Council was that the effect of this measure was to put the planning powers firmly in the hands of the people's representatives.  We were not long in finding out how untrue that suggestion was.  It was not long after when the city manager was asked who was the planning authority and he replied cryptically and truthfully &ldquo;I am&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go through the Bill section by section, as this is obviously a matter for Committee Stage, but I would like to ask who are members of the planning authority.  I know the Bill provides as to who the officers of the planning <Col N="1646" /> authority are but I am not clear from the terms of the Bill, or even before it was introduced at all, who are the members of the planning authority apart from the city or county manager.  Are the elected local authority members members of the planning authority or is the planning authority confined to the manager and/or assistant manager and his officials?  Following on from that, what rights have elected members of local authorities <i>vis-á-vis</i> the planning authority?  The planning authority is the manager and/or his officials.  I say this from past experience when the members of a local authority disagreed with a decision of the planning authority&mdash;the manager in this case. What is the position of elected members of local authorities if they disagree with the decisions of a planning authority?  When I say &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; again I am assuming the planning authority to be the manager and his officials.</P>
    <P>Getting back to this new independent board, I would like to ask the Minister&mdash;again this question has relevance to experiences I had on one local authority over the years&mdash;if elected members of local authorities can appeal to the planning board against decisions of the planning authority, the planning authority again being the city or county manager and his officials?  Unless the elected authority members are members of the planning authority, they should have equal rights with anyone else to appeal to the planning board against a decision of the city or county manager as the case may be. I know they can invoke section 4 and so on.  That is not always a satisfactory procedure.</P>
    <P>In regard to the proposed new board which will have a chairman, a former holder of judicial office or a holder of such office and not less than four and not more than ten ordinary members, what qualifications will these ordinary members have?  I hope when the appointments are being made that people with the requisite qualifications to make decisions in regard to planning appeals will be appointed.  I am sure the Minister will <Col N="1647" /> have in mind people retired from the architectural profession or even from local authorities, perhaps former members of local authorities with long experience.  I have great regard, and I know the Minister has also, for the ordinary public representative who has freely given his time, energy and intelligence over the years to serve the public.  I do not think enough appreciation is given to the lesser public lights in our public life.  People who serve on even the smallest local authority, urban district council, town commissioners and so on, year after year give of their time at the expense of the time they should be devoting to their wives and families and to their work and recreation.  They are unpaid and unsung heroes and, to my mind, they are the basis of our democratic local authority system.  I am sure the Minister would agree with me in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am using the memorandum as I find it more convenient than the Bill. It says that the term of ordinary members shall not exceed three years. I take that to mean that members will be appointed from time to time for different periods not exceeding three years.  That may not be the sense of the Bill.  The Minister might clarify that point.</P>
    <P>Not only I but other Members from time to time have raised this old query &mdash;and in this regard the memorandum reads rather differently from the Bill but I will quote the Memorandum.  It says in relation to appointment to the new board:</P>
    <P>Any employee nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas or who becomes a member of a local authority shall stand seconded from his employment without pay.</P>
    <P>I can understand the reason for the nomination because this would probably apply to the Taoiseach's 11. But when a person is nominated&mdash;this is repetition on my part but I will go on repeating it until something is done about it by some Minister, I hope, sooner than later&mdash;to either <Col N="1648" /> House of the Oireachtas he should not suffer any disability unless and until he is elected.  He could fall between two stools.  By standing for election he might sacrifice an appointment, promotion or even a job.  If he fails to be elected, he has lost in both ways. Something should be done about this and, sooner or later, I hope it will be done.</P>
    <P>As I understand the situation at the moment anybody can apply for planning permission over any land and need not necessarily be the owner of that land.  In fact more than one person or one company or corporate body can apply for permission.  Indeed, that has been done.  I am aware of certain cases where owners of land were unaware of the fact that somebody else had applied for planning permission over their land.  I wonder if that matter could be rectified if I am correct in the statement I have made, and I am sure that I am.  I think that unless a person has some recognisable title to land or property he should not be allowed to apply for planning permission.</P>
    <P>Any permission, as we all know, adds considerably to the value of land and it has not been unknown for people to apply for planning permission and, having got it, to sell the land for a substantial profit.  I am all in favour of private enterprise, but I think there should be some reasonable time limit &mdash; the Minister has partly covered this &mdash; when a planning permission is given and something is not done.  Five years, in some instances, could be too long.  Incidentally, a point I would like to make to the Minister is that we see all along our main roads today, and outside cities and towns in Ireland, signs saying: &ldquo;Land for Sale with Planning Permission&rdquo;. In many cases they have received only outline planning permission; they have not received full planning permission.  Some steps should be taken to safeguard a potential purchaser from this sort of misleading notice which does not fully explain the type of planning permission.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased about the trouble the Minister has taken to ensure <Col N="1649" /> that planning authorities and local authorities will be encouraged to make proper provision for amenities and open spaces.  I cannot over-emphasise &mdash; again from long experience&mdash;how important it is that every time a housing estate is developed adequate open spaces are provided. Even the present minimum requirement, in my view, is not enough and compares, as far as I am aware, very badly with the legislation in other countries.</P>
    <P>I can remember a time when the whole emphasis was on building houses.  It did not matter where you built them so long as you built houses. In fact, I can recall in one instance a long discussion as to whether or not houses should not be built on a playground because houses were more important than playgrounds.  That thinking has changed for the better and now people are more interested in homes and by homes they mean houses with adequate open spaces available where children and young people can play and exercise themselves. These spaces are absolutely essential; it cannot be too often emphasised that a house is not a home unless you have these essential amenities around it: adequate open spaces, places where little children, or mothers with prams can go and take their children and see them play around in comfort.  Then as the children grow up into teenagers they have room for football, hurling, soccer, rugby and tennis, to let off their surplus energy, because if they do not let it off that way they will let it off in some other and less desirable way.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this is covered in the Bill or not; I cannot pick it out specifically&mdash;when a housing estate is built it often seems a very long time before the roads are brought up to a proper standard.  Most members of local authorities from time to time in their own areas have seen nice housing estates completed with the roads almost impassable.  If you take the matter up with the local authority or city or county manager or town clerk as the case may be, you will be told unless and until the developer brings the roads up to the required <Col N="1650" /> standard they will not be taken over by the local authority.  If the developer is delaying in that regard there should be some form of penalty.  On the other hand, if he had brought the development up to the minimum requirements, the local authority should be required without delay to put the roadways and footpaths into proper repair. I mention this because nowadays when so many people have cars young couples rush in and buy houses and are no sooner landed in than they find the roads and footpaths almost impassable.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive measure.  It is a great improvement on the 1963 Act, and in case the House should think that I am being too critical of the 1963 Act, I do not in any way wish to impute that.  It was a very fine piece of legislation in many ways; it was the first significant step forward in planning legislation.  It was a major step and all concerned with it, deserve the highest praise, particularly the former Minister, Deputy Neil Blaney.  This is a further step forward in our planning legislation and it takes in areas wider and more comprehensive than the former legislation.  The Minister is to be heartily congratulated on that.  I only hope that the local authorities, particularly the public representatives on local authorities, will avail to the full of the powers in this measure.</P>
    <P>I should just like to end on one note which I emphasised while I have been speaking.  I want to re-emphasise it.  It is the fact that I am concerned to ensure that local public representatives, the people who go before the public to be elected, will have the ultimate power, if such power is necessary, to appeal to this new board.  Generally, local representatives work very well with their city or county managers.  I think the whole viability of the local authority system depends on a close co-operation between the two, but occasionally a conflict can arise.</P>
    <P>For instance, take my own native city of Limerick with which the Minister is familiar.  Last year he came down there in connection with certain works which we had done on the occasion of the European Architectural Heritage Year.  The centre of <Col N="1651" /> Limerick has been destroyed by the erection of unworthy commercial buildings and that has been going on for at least two decades and the local representatives seem to have no powers to prevent this.  They can object to the type of building that is going up.  They are told that this is necessary commercial development.  I am all in favour of commercial development. I am a businessman myself.  I see the necessity for replacing old buildings with new buildings.  But in our cities and towns one of the great things we have, one of the things we can offer to outside visitors, the people who come here, is a tradition in our cities, of mainly Georgian-type buildings and a certain unique quaintness where there was never any town planning.  Buildings grew up in a sort of natural affinity, one cottage, two houses and so on.  They had a particular quality of their own which should be preserved.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later some steps will have to be taken to answer the question: what type of cities and towns do we want?  Do we want little Leeds or little Manchesters or little Coventrys?  Or, do we want Ye Olde English Village copied here in Ireland or do we just want to turn the country into a poor replica of what has been done outside the country?  I do not want that and I believe the Minister does not want it.  I believe that the people who live in the towns and cities of Ireland do not want it either.  We want to preserve what is worth preserving.  We want to preserve the unique qualities of our cities and towns, their traditions.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be obstructive or reactionary.  We want to see progress, but I believe the two go hand in hand.  We all have seen magnificent examples of new, modern buildings blending in with older buildings in cities and towns in Ireland.  It is that type of sympathetic blending that I am appealing for.  I should like to see some units set up in the Department where you would have qualified town planners&mdash;people who have &ldquo;a feel&rdquo; for cities.  I am saying nothing against the competence or qualifications <Col N="1652" /> of the staffs of local authorities. I had reason on many occasions over the years to praise them for the work they have done.  Most of them are not natives of the local authority administrative area in which they are employed. They go on from a small urban council to a county council or city council, as the case may be, and eventually they get to Cork, Dublin or elsewhere.  That is as it should be, but they have not got the same feel for the local city or town as the people brought up in it.  The local public representatives have a feel for it and they understandably may resent developments which in their estimation destroy the tradition and the appearance, quality and uniqueness of their native town or village. That is something we will have to measure up to because we have seen all over the place efforts to bring in beautiful model buildings, new modern glass and concrete structures, and shove them in among lovely Georgian buildings.</P>
    <P>I am not against modern buildings. Some of them are magnificant and very fine structures and I hope people will go on building them, but they should be made compatible with the existing environment in which they are erected. They should not be taken out of some plan in Leeds or Manchester and stuffed into Merrion Square in Dublin or O'Connell Street in Limerick or Patrick Street in Cork, or more important still, on the outskirts of these cities. I hope some steps will be taken to restrict this type of development.  Even if the local authorities want to do it, somebody in the Department of Local Government with an overall responsibility for the development of cities and towns in urban centres in Ireland should say: &ldquo;No, we are not having that.  This is unique.  People come to see this place and it is good business to preserve it.  If you are going to build new buildings make sure that they conform with the existing buildings&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have been a bit long winded, but it is a bit of a hobby-horse of mine because I have grown up in an old city and seen many changes over the years, some good and some not so good and some appalling.  I cannot <Col N="1653" /> resist the temptation to make my views heard by, I hope, a sympathetic Minister. This is a good Bill.  It is to be generally welcomed.  Apart from the comments I have made, which I hope the Minister will accept as being constructive and concerned, I have nothing else to do except to repeat my welcome for the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority to which I belong happen to be one of the first to accept town and regional planning when it was first introduced. At the time not so many of the local authorities were anxious to accept this. I happened to be one of the people who was enthusiastic about this because I realised the great damage that could and might be done and had been done to quite a lot of the structures that had already been erected &mdash; road alignment and so on.  Had I known at that time that afterwards I would weave for myself a web of trouble I would have been long sorry to be so enthusiastic as I was then.</P>
      <P>Far be it from me that my comments regarding the town planners or local authorities and Departments should do away with ordinary common sense.  The fact is that the physical structure of the county to which I belong needs something of a special treatment rather than Meath, Dublin or Kildare, because they are flat country. Mine is a hilly country.</P>
      <P>We were assured by our county manager and his officials and advisers, the people in charge of town planning, that we would not be given a world of trouble afterwards.  It was given by the manager on the advice of the people in the planning office.  I am glad to say, or maybe I should say sorry to say, that there has been a vast improvement in the attitude towards town or regional planning in recent times.  People with more experience or vision have taken a different view.  It would take a couple more hands than I have to count all the appeals that are made to us.  It looked to me as if the people in the county council office took the line of least resistance.  For fear they would make a mistake, they turned the appeals down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1654" /> to the Minister is here.  His office was one of the offices that dealt with this.  Those appeals reached such enormity that it would take a twoton or even a 10-ton truck to carry them.  Those appeals lay there for years, not months.  The result was that houses that should have cost a person a modest £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 cost them £12,000 to £15,000.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the Bill because it is a step in the right direction. There may be parts of it that I do not completely agree with.  I was very interested in Senator Russell's statement about maintaining the architecture that the people of Limerick were used to down the years.  The city was famous for its architecture.  I think that the cities, especially, fell flat on their faces for chrome.  Public buildings like post offices and railway places had nothing only chrome staring you in the face&mdash;a chrome front here and a chrome rail there.</P>
    <P>We in our town were assured by the county engineer and his advisers at the time that they would give us a link road around our town.  They came along with a prepared plan which was very acceptable &mdash; at least I thought it was and my colleagues on the urban council thought so too.  To our amazement, when this plan came to be revised we found that it had been completely scrapped and that they had allowed buildings to be erected which put paid to any worthwhile plan to relieve traffic in the main thoroughfare in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>This has happened in many towns, and the people protested at the density of traffic in the main streets. This traffic brought no extra business to the towns and villages and, in fact, it proved to be a hazard which discouraged the local people from coming in to do their shopping.  They could not get parking space for their cars.  Link routes should be provided for every city and town to divert traffic from the main thoroughfares. At present is it almost impossible to drive through Clones, Monaghan, Castleblayney or Carrickmacross. There have been many accidents but, <Col N="1655" /> of course, they were not all caused by the density of traffic.</P>
    <P>When I approached the Department of Local Government about some of the planning appeals I received a very sympathetic hearing. The officials were extremely helpful and eventually about nine-tenths of the appeals were granted.  I was quite satisfied with the decisions and justice seemed to be done all around.  When notices are inserted in newspapers about planning permission being sought for extensions to existing buildings and so on, it often causes owners to increase considerably their prices for land.  I have a reasonable degree of confidence in the Department. They have gained much experience over the past years.</P>
    <P>When this Bill comes before us on Committee Stage any shortcomings in it can be put right by amendment. Common sense will prevail.  Planners, particularly those in the younger age group, often seem to take particular delight in turning down suggestions or altering them in some way, but all law is based on common sense.  If common sense does not prevail no amount of legislation will improve our situation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the matter I wish to raise now is proper to the Department of Local Government. Some objectionable industries have been allowed to develop in the proximity of local authority housing schemes.  Perhaps this comes within the scope of the Department of Health, but the Department of Local Government should be concerned with it also.  Senator Willie Ryan spoke about silage pits alongside county roads.  I am not perturbed about the odour from these pits.  I remember a story about a cruelty to children inspector who called to a house following a complaint about neglected children.  He found the children in an extremely dirty condition and in due course a case was brought against the parents in the District Court where the father was fined.  He appealed, and when the inspector was giving evidence about the condition of the children the Circuit <Col N="1656" /> Court judge asked him: &ldquo;Was this dirty dirt?&rdquo; and when the inspector replied that it was not, the judge remarked &ldquo;Oh, I see, it was clean dirt&rdquo;.  I say the same about the silage pits.  That is clean dirt, and I have no objection to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like most Senators, welcome the new planning board which, as the Minister said this morning, is to be chaired by a judge of the High Court for the hearing of planning appeals.  I agree with my colleague, Senator Willie Ryan, when he said that all planning should, in the initial stages, be at local level.  It is only when unreasonable objectors are not satisfied with either their local legislators or with the decision of their local planning authority that matters should be taken further.  This Bill will help to overcome problems which arose over a number of years. The Minister found himself in difficulties at times in the examination of planning appeals where objections had been made to planning appeals which had been granted by the local authority.  Over the past 12 months County Tipperary has experienced the most extraordinary set of circumstances that anybody could ever tolerate in a democracy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tremendous courage in presenting a Bill such as this to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It gives away the sole right he had in the powers vested in him as Minister for Local Government to planning developers, the right to have decisions made by an independent board.  We advocated this for many years while in Opposition.  I am glad the Minister complied with our commitment to the public, that we would, as it were, grasp this nettle and put the area of planning outside the area of petty politics, be they party politics or otherwise, at any level, and into an independent board, chaired by a person of the calibre and standing of a judge of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future this appeal board will listen to the rights of people who they consider have a genuine right of appeal against a planning permission given by a local authority.  I should <Col N="1657" /> like to outline further what Senator Ryan referred to in Tipperary.  A major application from an American pharmaceutical company was intimated at a public relations exercise within the county, to which we as the planning authority brought the best brains available in the country to the offices, with the extra assistance of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, and in the process of that public relations exercise&mdash;we invited all the people we felt would be interested, not alone in the environment but in the industrial development, including the trade union movement and all the various prescribed bodies such as An Taisce, the fishing industry, all the people who had various and relevant interests in a planning application of this magnitude &mdash; we proceeded to have a public hearing before there was any objection. We bent over backwards to ensure that all their worries and any cause for concern they might have had would have been aired on that day.  Many of them refused to turn up at that exercise.</P>
    <P>We, as a planning authority, in the interests of the public allowed the planning application and an objection was lodged to the Minister.  Following long and serious consideration of their objection, the Minister laid down the most stringent planning regulations ever laid down in this country for a pharmaceutical company, to such an extent that even the developers were concerned whether it was physically possible for them to achieve some of the Minister's requirements. Despite all that, they lodged with us a threat of a High Court action.  That is where the matter lies today.  They do not have to make any further move if they intimate that they intend to take the Minister to the High Court.  They do not have to show cause for their threat.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ryan said, the moment the Americans heard of a possible High Court case they sat on the fence. It is difficult to blame them when people are so blinded by their personal hobby-horses that they are not prepared to accept the best advice <Col N="1658" /> available, legal and otherwise, to the Minister and the planning authority: they just leave it in abeyance as a threat.  This is a most extraordinary situation.  Any Bill that allows this kind of situation is not a good Bill. The Minister is personally aware of this matter and I am sure he will agree it is imperative that we tidy up this situation to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>I hope this new board will make use of their powers to refuse an oral hearing unless a direction to do so is given by the Minister.  This would eliminate these petty objections. References have been made to the fines it is intended to apply to objectors which would be refunded if their objections were legitimate.  It has been said that this fine is too small.  This is an area where we have to be extra careful.  We cannot make the fine so large that it would do away with a person's legitimate right to object, if there was a legitimate objection.  Provided that the fine is applicable to each individual signature to an objection, I think that £10 is probably a sufficient amount.  To overcome some of these problems, planning authorities should make more use of the type of public relations exercise we had in Tipperary to help to dispel doubts in the minds of local residents.</P>
    <P>Under the existing Act people have a constitutional right to object.  We must also remember that under the Constitution people have a right to earn their living.  This should not be denied to them by any small section of the community who, for vested interests or otherwise, continue with threats.</P>
    <P>I have no time whatsoever for professional objectors who live in areas completely removed from the area of development.  The objection in County Tipperary to which I referred brought forth objections from people living in Cork, Waterford and Louth who are just professional objectors to every planning application in this country. They have no interest whatsover in the area or the people who require work in the area or to people who are genuinely concerned with the environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1659" /> An Taisce are an exception to this rule.  They are a prescribed body under the Planning Act.  They usually play a significant and responsible function in all planning applications, especially those affecting the environment. I compliment An Taisce on the attitude they adopted in Tipperary. They made no comment until they examined the area and then came out in favour of the planning application. They have members in most areas who possibly have a mandate to interest themselves in the development of all areas.  They have proved a useful conscience for members of local authorities who are members of planning boards as well.  They have reminded them of their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I should like this Bill to clarify in the minds of developers that in future once a decision is reached, whether by the Minister or by this new board, unless this decision can be looked upon as being repugnant to the Constitution objectors would not have the right to intimate their intention to appeal to the High Court. Would the Minister agree that, once a threat is initiated against us when planning permission is granted, whether on appeal to the board or by the local authority, there would be some limit on the time by which the threat would have to continue its course into the High Court, where at least a decision would be given, or whether a period of time to be stipulated and agreed by the House would be set down when they would have either to put up or shut up?  This is not an unreasonable proposal, particularly when you find that the chairman of the council who issued an appeal to the final handful of objectors has been threatened by the objectors to be taken to the High Court for intimidating them for objecting.  This is the situation we find ourselves in.  I do not think any member of a local authority should be held up to ridicule by people like this.</P>
    <P>Section 27 is a most important section.  It provides for the right to go to the High Court in the event of <Col N="1660" /> planning conditions not being adhered to.  It is a section which local authorities will welcome because it gives them the right and the power to implement the restrictions they have on unauthorised development, whether it is agricultural or otherwise.  All development should be subject to planning rules.  It is not just the smell, as Senator Brennan said, that concerns people, but the unsightly appearance of some of these buildings.  We must ensure that the effluent from silage pits and so on does not get into rivers and streams and cause tremendous damage, as we know it does.  So it is a vital section for planning authorities. It ensures that the regulations laid down by the local authorities or by the Minister will be adhered to by the developers and that indiscriminate development does not continue.  If the board, on appeal, laid down regulations under this Bill I would be concerned that the authority would have to answer in the High Court for the implementation of a decision in which they were not involved in making. We like to defend people's rights, to ensure conditions are adhered to.  If people had a reasonable regard for other people's rights we would not have some of the problems we now have in various counties with regard to industrial development.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also made reference to certain developments within our county.  I am personally aware of each house, garage and roadway which he talked about.  Many of these roads would not have been restricted by anybody with any sort of a reasonable approach to people's efforts to either build a house for themselves or to better themselves.  Certainly there were restricted roads under the previous Government. None of us agreed with them, not even the Minister himself.  But because they are different, I know it is an embarrassment to Deputy Molloy and his followers in my county that we have now opened up the specific roads and have allowed reasonable development there.  They are not national primary routes; there are no problems.  In other areas in which planning permission was given under which the authority refused it, I am sure the Minister's <Col N="1661" /> officers looked at these with all due concern, and if permission was given, the people were justified in lodging their objections.  To overcome that problem the local authority planning engineer and the county manager should take the local representatives' views more into consideration before he signs a refusal order, because once the manager signs an order refusing planning permission it can only then go to the Minister.  Consultations between local representatives and the planning officer&mdash;indeed, with the developer on the site&mdash;can solve many problems.  Initial problems can be overcome by discussion, and reasonable planning permission can be given without involving the Minister, or appeals or any other board.  This should be looked for more so by members of authorities.  Instructions should be given to planning engineers and managers not to refuse planning permission without consulting local representatives, because they know their own areas, know the developers involved, and know what the feeling of the people would be to a particular development.  It goes on in some counties and is beginning to go on in our own county.  I know it happens in Cork where they have relatively no section on planning.  If this is how you get planning permission, the public will not view us with any great love as democrats. They see it directing a manager, by section 4, against his will, to give permission to a particular person.  This creates attitudes in the mind of the public that local representatives must have a vested interest in planning applications. Therefore, I agree to remove the anomaly and I agree that there should be this declaration of interest. If they have any interest whatsoever in land or the development of land, they should certainly not sit on any planning committee or county council. Their consciences will be clear and the public will have been served notice by representatives that their decisions are usually given for the benefit and interest of the community as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will forgive me if I do not concentrate on the positive elements of the Bill to start with, but voice a few criticisms <Col N="1662" /> of sections in which the Bill seems to be vulnerable.  The Minister has heard nothing but praise for the Bill since we sat this morning.  He is a modest man but perhaps too much praise, even for him, would be excessive.</P>
      <P>My main point is that the Bill, while it is a good Bill and takes out of, as Senators said, the area of petty local politics the whole question of appeals about planning, because it removes the Minister from that area, is defective in not going far enough.  Senator West and I have a motion on the Order Paper of considerably long standing which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann, in view of the present rapid increase in urbanisation, mining, industrial development and other sources of pollution, is of opinion that a separate Department of the Environment should be set up with responsibility for the preservation of the country's scenery, wild life, fisheries, architectural and archaeological riches and other cultural and tourist amenities.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I still hold the view that a Department for the Environment is required.  The Minister has already referred to the Wildlife Bill which is under the supervision of the Ministry of Lands.  It is certainly true that the environment, which, as Senators admit, is constantly and increasingly under threat, concerns at least the following Departments: Agriculture and Fisheries, Lands, Industry and Commerce, Local Government and Transport and Power. All of these have a bearing on the environment.  It is inevitable that there will be, and have been, clashes of interest between these different Departments. The only way in which these clashes can be harmonised, or obviated, in the future is to have an over-arching Department or Ministry which will, more or less, take in in a much larger way the role of this Bord Pleanála.  In other words, it would be a Ministry to which all other Departments, and particularly industrial development projects, would have to submit their plans before they went ahead.  I know that this will certainly fall on hostile ears in so far as a great number of Senators are members of local authorities, <Col N="1663" /> but they will forgive me for pointing out that local authorities throughout the country have been successfully prosecuted for pollution of the environment and for water pollution.  In a recent report of An Foras Forbartha, they have been named as the second worst offenders in the country in terms of water pollution.  That makes one pause a little.  How can planning and local authorities be the proper and final custodians of our environment if they are among the worst offenders?</P>
    <P>It seems to me anomalous that the Water Pollution Bill, which has recently been passed in the Dáil and which will soon be coming to us for consideration, is under the purview of the Department of Local Government. In other words, the Department themselves, which have been named as one of the worst offenders in the matter of pollution, are vested with responsibility for the very offences which they have been found guilty of. That seems to be an unavoidable anomaly.  It seems that a far more long-term, wide-ranging approach towards the environment involving a Ministry for the Environment would solve our problems far more successfully than this Bill sets out to do.</P>
    <P>When one thinks about the whole range that might fall within such a Department, one thinks immediately of the very things that have been mentioned by Senators already: historical buildings, the landscaping of the countryside, unsightly buildings, the mutilation of our cities, particularly Georgian Squares, of which we have had some ferocious examples of late.  There is one very distressing example at this moment in Fitzwilliam Square.  You have the whole question of archaeological sites.  You have the vacillation of the Minister over the Wood Quay site which has caused much trouble.  An examination of all these matters can properly be carried out only under one authority concerned with the environment and the environment only.</P>
    <P>That having been said, the positive aspects of the Bill have to be stressed. It is certainly an improvement on the <Col N="1664" /> situation where the Minister himself was the sole authority and the sole source of appeal.  That has been very unsatisfactory, and I agree with the Senators who say that the removal of that aspect of the Minister's ministry, so to speak, is a good thing.  I am as surprised as other Senators are that it has taken so long for the Bill to reach us in this form.</P>
    <P>Before finishing I should like to deal with one question.  The Minister has gone to great pains in this Bill to define who the chairman and employees of the board will be.  He has very little to say about the ordinary membership of the board except that they can be planning officers.  I would be interested to learn from the Minister what kind of person he has in mind for ordinary membership of the board, by what criteria will they be chosen?  It is in the Bill that they will be appointed by him, but one would like to know what criteria would apply in terms of their qualification, otherwise the Minister might be open to the charge that he was appointing his own men anyway and that the board's independence was ensured only by its chairman.  I am not suggesting that the Minister would do anything of the kind, but I should like to hear from him what criteria would be used in appointing members of the board.</P>
    <P>The matter of declaration of interest, in regard to which Senator Horgan and Senator Higgins have a motion on the Order Paper, is dealt with in sections 33 and 34 of the Bill. That is particularly praiseworthy.  It will obviously remove not only abuses but also suspicion of abuses.  That is extremely valuable.  I like very much the clause with regard to planning permission.  There has been a good deal of unscrupulous profiteering in fraudulent outline planning permission of late.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to compliment the Minister on the fact that he has shed power.  That is always a sacrifice on the part of a politician.  I suppose they are in the game largely for power and want to exercise it, as they think, benignly.  In this case the Minister has been very scrupulous indeed and in <Col N="1665" /> section 6 has limited himself to giving the board a general direction.  That is an admirable decision.  However, the relationship between the Minister and the board and his issuing of general directives seems extremely vague.  I look forward to the Minister's explanation of this on Committee Stage.  Over and over again we see in the Bill &ldquo;The Minister shall give directives&rdquo;, &ldquo;The boards shall take account of&rdquo;, but do they have to obey the directives and what does &ldquo;taking account of&rdquo; mean in hard facts?  It is very hard to say.  There is a grammatical difficulty.  Perhaps I am being too pedantic here, or maybe not legal enough.  Section 5 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Board shall, so far as may in the opinion of the Board be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed ...</P>
    <P>The board &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, that is prescriptive; that means the board must.  It shall, but it need not.  That formulation seems to cancel itself.  However, it is a small point and it belongs to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>By and large, the Bill is to be welcomed and I compliment the Minister on it.  I should like to reiterate my belief that it is not the answer to the problem.  The answer to the problem resides in a far more radical approach towards the environment and indeed in the creation of a ministry for the environment, as has happened in so many other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill, which is long overdue.  The Minister has done much to take a lot of suspicion from decisions made at local or ministerial level in regard to planning appeals.  When the boards are established they should be representative of the various interests in the nation as a whole.  It would be wrong if the people of purely urban or city background were to have the opportunity of making decisions in regard to matters of rural location.  It would also be wrong to allow a situation to continue where somebody in a Department could tell a Minister that he had examined an appeal and that was his recommendation. The Minister, being human, <Col N="1666" /> would have to delegate very many of the decisions based on recommendations made by people like this.  He would not be able to deal with every appeal, even if he were to devote all his time to it.</P>
      <P>For that reason I feel that this board should be broadly based.  It should be comprised of people with rural and urban backgrounds.  All the personnel should have qualifications in regard to rural difficulties, pollution, and landscaping of the natural beauty of certain areas.  The interests of the people should at all times be protected.</P>
      <P>It is very important that local authorities be given the power to revise industrial planning from time to time and I welcome the provision where the local authorities may, in the light of experience, vary a planning scheme already adopted.  That is a very good thing.  A situation can arise where industry of a particular kind may be objectionable in a particular area, or on the other hand, a suitable location for a certain industry might have been designated as an intended residential area.  Local authorities should have the right to alter residential and industrial planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most objectionable aspects of previous legislation was that in many cases in countries and towns we had vested interests.  As Senator William Ryan indicated, one person could object to another person pursuing his reasonable purpose in life&mdash;his reasonable industrial purpose &mdash;for the sake of certain opportunities. This meant that more wealth would accrue to a particular person in the immediate vicinity who felt that he was likely to come into competition with the proposed planner, industrialist or builder.  The greatest abuse was exercised by way of objection.  It is certainly necessary to have provision for objections.  At the same time, it is very wrong to prevent people from doing the reasonable things they have a right to do.  If reason and charity had obtained these objections would never have been made.  Very often the reverse situation arises.  For instance if somebody wants to curry favour with a certain section of the community, he can object to an industry.  That industry <Col N="1667" /> is then shyed away from a locality because the people who have the application for planning permission are offered easy access to other areas and are welcomed into them.  These practices make the objection provision very objectionable in itself.</P>
    <P>The right of the individual should always be preserved.  The people of a particular area should always be helped to better their positions.  There is a considerable danger in that a person who does not own property might have the right to make application for planning permission.  A person might feel that refusal of an application on the basis of an objectionable structure would have the effect of lessening the value of a property he wished to buy.  That person could then buy the land, perhaps at a lesser price, and then submit different plans which would be accepted by the planning authority.  The Minister should look into the danger of how that section could be abused.</P>
    <P>We should have a more elevated method of finalising appeals than the see-saw methods we have, where the local authority can reverse an appeal, but the applicant can continue appealing.  Section 27 refers to the rights of access to the High Court. There should be a judicial finality in regard to planning, not necessarily the High Court, but the right of the individual to go to the High Court should always be open.  It is a constitutional right.  If somebody went to the High Court as often as they served notices on individuals, not to speak of Ministers acting in the judicial or ministerial office, if anyone were to shy off from doing his legitimate functional work because such a notice had been served, a lot of work would be held up and a lot of people would be shying away from what they have done successfully.  The Minister should not, in any sense, feel threatened by reason of High Court proceedings being taken by a planning authority or any other person.</P>
    <P>Planning is vital at this time.  The well-being of our children will depend on good planning.  The landscape, the structures we have in our cities and towns, the health of the community <Col N="1668" /> and the well-being of the people generally depends very much upon it. The Minister has gained experience during the last few years from witnessing the initial working of the Planning Act.  I am glad to see that he is removing planning appeals from the political arena.  He is creating a situation where confidence and trust will obtain in planning decisions. When a decision is given nobody will be saying it was done through influence with a particular Minister. Planning will have as much weight as the Land Courts, or other courts where decisions are made.  When that day comes we will have more respect for planning.  The sooner the Minister gets to this stage, the higher the level of authority dealing directly with planning, the better for the people.  I wish the Minister every success with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KitAhern" hpid="Cáit Uí Eachthéirn Cáit Uí Eachthéirn">
      <NameTxt>Cáit Uí Eachthéirn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister very kindly said that he is quite prepared to take any suggestions or any amendments that we in this House can give him.  But seeing that the Bill took so long in the other House, that it was so fine-combed and that he accepted over 100 amendments, the Bill will have a fairly fast passage through this House.</P>
      <P>Like all other Senators I welcome the setting up of Bord Pleanála and I hope that this will expedite appeals, because my experience is that appeals took very, very long when they came to the Minister.  This is only to be expected because he says that he had to deal with about 4,000 a year.  I hope this new section will expedite the hearing of those appeals.  Somebody made a point about the standards and qualifications of the people who will be on this board but I am confident that any Minister, including the present Minister will put on this board only people who have the good of the countryside at heart and a knowledge of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning and development is an area where we should have great vigilance.  I am just thinking of even my own village and I regret that our Government, whatever Government were in power 20 or 30 years ago, did not have the vision and the foresight <Col N="1669" /> to set up a planning authority because many of our villages have been spoiled by indiscriminate buildings and additions to the fronts and so on.  We can do nothing about it now.  All we can do in our time is to see that whatever is left, whatever is good, will not be further spoiled by indiscriminate buildings and structures and monstrosities and so on.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's memorandum he said that it will take quite a while to transfer the functions from the present set-up to the board, but I hope he will do this as speedily as possible. I am glad also, like other Senators, that steps are being taken to deal with frivolous objections and frivolous and vexatious appeals.  It is very good also that the board have the power to refuse oral hearings when they see the nature of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 29 which deals with the withering of planning permission after five years, is a sensible section to have because the whole area for which a planning permission would be got, say, this year may have completely changed in five years' time.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin believes that we should have a more comprehensive Bill.  At the same time, this is a start. We are dealing with the physical side mainly in this Bill but the Minister has incorporated in it a section which deals with imposing conditions to protect us against noise, against pollution and cable and pipelines here, there and everywhere, the protection of trees and the protection of amenity areas.  Even though he has not gone into those in detail Senator Martin does not have to be too worried.  These things are looked after in the Bill, if not in detail.</P>
    <P>One matter that I am very interested in is rights of way.  I see that there is to be an amendment requiring that planning permission be obtained for the fencing or the enclosure of land which has long been open or used by the public.  The Minister might specify there what length of time would be reasonable before the fencing in of these areas can take place.  Only last week at our county council meeting I said that we should have a list or maps in our areas showing old, existing rights of way.  Quite a few of these <Col N="1670" /> rights of way that people enjoyed for generations have been closed off.  We should protect those rights of way.</P>
    <P>It is only in places like Kerry and other tourist counties that we have very great difficulty because we have to ensure that the building blends in with the scenery in the area and that it does not upset the skyline or interfere with scenic views.  That is to be welcomed, but we all know that there are hardship cases where somebody has perhaps just two acres of land in a very scenic spot and cannot make a living off them.  He gets the chance of selling a couple of sites and the man cannot just part with them although it is probably the one and only time in his life that he could get a few bob. It does contain hardship cases like that.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin referred to An Foras Forbartha, saying that the local authorities were the second worse offenders as regards water pollution.  We can all be very critical but we cannot be blamed for something that happened 30 years ago and everybody thought that once sewerage was discharged into the sea or into a river it disappeared, unfortunately that is not the case.  These sewerage schemes were laid 30 years ago without any consideration of pollution or the damage to beaches and marine life.  It will cost thousands of pounds to treat the problem.  Quite a few beaches and lakes are affected.</P>
    <P>We are going to be in a very difficult situation within the next four or five years when the EEC regulations regarding beaches come into existence here.  Whilst we have 3,500 miles of coastline we have only about 350 miles of beach and many of those beaches are going to be polluted.  The water will have to be monitored and if there is a certain level of pollution those beaches and seaside resorts will not get a licence.  They cannot.  They will not be sanctioned as seaside resorts.  I hope that the question of giving substantial grants to the local authorities concerned to enable them to combat this menace will be seriously considered.  I have two places in north Kerry in mind.  Their only industry is the tourist industry.  We are spending millions of pounds bringing in foreigners to build factories <Col N="1671" /> and so on.  We have a ready-made industry in those areas in Kerry.  If they cannot get a licence to run a seaside resort they will be in a bad way.  It will be their one and only industry wiped out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Naturally, after 13 years the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1973 needed many revisions.  It is only in the working of many of our Acts that we can see the loopholes.  All the loopholes have been closed now.  I hope that local authorities and county councillors will give every co-operation and that the suspicion and favouritism bandied around here are gone.  Whatever decisions are given by our local planning officers will be sensible decisions and I hope the councillors in every area will stand behind their planning authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for two main reasons.  First, while in planning terms it is a relatively minor Bill, the administrative procedures it sets up are very, very good and deserve to be welcomed by us and by anybody concerned with development whether public or private.</P>
      <P>Secondly, for the first time in this country it writes into legislation the idea that there should be a public disclosure of any interests of elected representatives or, indeed, of public officials which might be held to reflect their judgment in planning matters.</P>
      <P>I have had a motion on the Order Paper for over a year now urging the establishment of just such a register for Members of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am delighted to see in this Bill the beginnings of a move towards that.  I am delighted to see the beginnings of a move towards full disclosure. I believe that in a democracy we should have nothing to hide.  I will come back to that later.  I wanted to bring it in at this point as part of the general reason why I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of good things in the Bill to which I should like to draw attention in some detail.  The first is the Bill's explicit recognition of the fact that planning is a political process. We have had a lot of talk today&mdash;and <Col N="1672" /> I agree with much of it&mdash;about the importance of taking planning appeal decisions out of the hands of the politicians, specifically out of the hands of the Minister for Local Government. It is quite logical for us to agree with this and at the same time maintain that the Minister's overall powers with regard to planning must not only be retained but must be respected and built into whatever machinery is being set up by this Bill to consider appeals against the decisions of planning authorities.</P>
    <P>There are few things which are more political, in the best sense of the word, than the quality of our physical environment.  This is what planning is about.  This is why I am so glad to see in the Bill the Minister's power and responsibilities with regard to setting down the broad outlines of a planning policy from time to time and making the new planning board aware of these policies and of requiring the planning board to operate within the general guidelines set out by him.  It is a very good thing.  I do not think we need to apologise for stressing the value of having planning in the political arena in this context.</P>
    <P>Ultimately it is the Minister for Local Government, the Government themselves and, at another remove all our public representatives who are responsible for the kind of planning policy we have.  They and we are the people who can be removed by an electorate who disagrees not only with planning but with other policies.  It is important that the people who make overall planning policies should be answerable to the electorate.  Ultimately, as I said, this person is the Minister for Local Government.  He is answerable to the electorate.  Because he is answerable to the electorate he has the power and the responsibility to determine overall planning guidelines.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is important that a lot of the detailed work of planning should be removed from his shoulders.  This is what this Bill does by setting up a planning board.  In general, the idea of the board and the composition of the board is a reasonably good one.  I went to the length <Col N="1673" /> of circularising a great many Irish architects when this Bill was first published and asked them for their views on the Bill in general and on the board in particular.  I was rather surprised initially to find out that many architects were rather doubtful about the wisdom of having a board instead of the Minister as the final arbiter on appeal.  They tended to worry, for example, about the possible remoteness of a board and about its lack of involvement in day-to-day political, administrative and social affairs and that this lack of involvement might make decisions on planning matter to a greater or lesser degree irrelevant to the real need of the people making the applications or the areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>There was also a certain amount of criticism of the Bill based on the originally suggested composition of the board.  I think that many of these objections have been met by the amendments made to the Bill in the other House.  I imagine that if I were to circularise the architects again I would have a more positive response to the general idea of a planning board.  The board will be judged ultimately on their record.  We look to the Minister to make it the best possible board so that their record will be something which will very rapidly win the confidence not just of architects but of people involved in planning and development at any level.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill which I think is important &mdash; not necessarily in order of importance &mdash; is the withering clause for planning permissions. There have been occasions, and there still are, where the granting of very large-scale planning permissions, for example, for large housing estates, has put many local authorities in a very difficult position.  If planning permission exists for a very large housing estate in a certain area, the local authority have to bear in mind the necessity and, perhaps, the obligation to service this site.  They have to either earmark funds on a contingency basis or prevent other schemes from going ahead until a decision has been made on the one for which <Col N="1674" /> initial planning permission was received. This has tied local authorities in knots in one or two instances.  The idea that planning permission should wither after a period of 5 years is a useful one.</P>
    <P>The third point which is useful in the Bill is the Minister's power to make regulations for planning authorities. There are many things in the Bill which at first sight seem to give the Minister unnecessarily wide powers but in so far as planning is, and should be, a national exercise it is very important for the Minister to have the power to make these regulations for planning authorities so that we can have some kind of uniformity, some kind of conformity as between one area and another.</P>
    <P>The fourth point which is good in the Bill &mdash; I really cannot overrate the importance of this &mdash; is its explicit statement to the effect that an inspector who prepares a report for the board or for the Minister can make recommendations. In the past, under the system of administration, the inspectors have been rather shadowy figures. They are supposed to write reports on which decisions are made but it has been doubtful whether or not they could make recommendations.  The way in which the evidence was presented in many of these reports effectively amounted to a recommendation, but their inability explicitly to make recommendations must have hampered many professional inspectors in the proper exercise of their functions.  They will be helped considerably in their work under the provisions in the Bill and I would hope that their reports will be a significant addition to our general approach to planning.  We must accept that the inspector, as the professional on the spot, is likely to make a good assessment of a situation.  The assessment of the situation may not necessarily carry the day but if he is allowed to make recommendations any decision which goes against the recommendations will have to be explained in its own terms, for very good reasons.</P>
    <P>The fifth point which I find valuable is that the board can examine matters which have not been raised on the <Col N="1675" /> appeal.  This is an interesting development, in so far as judicial or quasi-judicial bodies usually proceed only on the basis of evidence presented to them.  The Bill widens the scope for a particular planning board and enables them to study anything which, in the opinion of the members of the board, is relevant, as long as they give notice of this to the people making the appeal or to those who are resisting it and afford them an opportunity to comment on it.  Good planning depends on the maximum amount of information, of discussion and disclosure available.  This is well catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A sixth point&mdash;although it is a relatively minor one&mdash;relates to the power of planning authorities to make orders for the preservation of materials.  This was sought for very keenly by various interests, An Taisce and other people involved in the general preservation area, and the way in which it has been met by the Bill is generous and whole-hearted.  It is no small thing to say that, whatever about our exterior townscapes and our countryside, some of the physical interiors of buildings are among the most precious part of our heritage and I am glad to see that the Bill encourages their preservation.</P>
    <P>A final point I should like to make in this part of my contribution about the basically good things in the Bill is that it will make the whole business of drafting development plans much more meaningful than it has been up to now.  We are all familiar with the experience of the Dublin draft development plan to which there were no fewer than 15,000 objectors.  In this type of situation the danger is that none of the objections is taken seriously because the mechanism for considering the problems is inadequate and unequal to the task. Under the new procedure being set up under the Bill the formulation, publication and debate about development plans on an area or even a regional basis will be a more positive and useful exercise.</P>
    <P>I now refer to some matters which are, perhaps, debatable and to which the Bill should have given more attention. <Col N="1676" /> Is it entirely appropriate that the chairman of the planning board should be an acting or a former judge?  I have not got any strong views on this but there is a substantial body of opinion which would urge that the nature of planning is really indicative rather than legal or administrative; that, fundamentally, it is a policy matter, something which not only requires but demands flexible interpretation.  There is hesitation in some quarters about the idea that the chairman of the planning board as a judge or a former judge might be encouraged to view planning simply as a matter of determining law.  There have been some decisions in the not too distant past when judicial decisions in planning areas have raised this problem because the judges as, perhaps, strict constructionists have tended to look only at the letter of the law and have allowed no latitude for its spirit.  One case, the <i>Bray Urban District Council versus Finn,</i> was a judicial decision on a planning appeal which has now been reversed by one of the sections of this Bill.  I understand why it was decided to choose a judge, especially in view of criticisms made in the other House and indeed, outside both of these Houses.  It was seen that it was essential that the chairman should be of maximum impartiality.  I put it to the Minister&mdash; and I should be glad to hear his comments on this&mdash;that if the chairman is to be a judge, perhaps, the Minister's directions to the planning board should include a direction or directions which would enable such a judicial person to act, not in a strictly judicial way, but in a way that will take account of more of the circumstances and of more of the context of planning decisions than a judge, strictly as a laweyer, could or would do.</P>
    <P>The other point I make is about membership of the planning board.  It is a pity that it is not stated in the Bill that at least one member of the planning board should have planning qualifications.  I accept it is unlikely that the board would not include somebody with planning qualifications but it would be no harm to give statutory force to such a requirement. <Col N="1677" /> People with planning qualifications are thin on the ground so it is all the more important that a planning board should have the services of the best planning minds available.  I urge the Minister to give statutory recognition to the importance of planning qualifications among members of the board by writing in that at least one member should possess such qualifications.</P>
    <P>With regard to inspectors' reports, it is not clear whether or not the board will have power to publish or release reports drafted by inspectors at its request.  If it is necessary to give the board statutory authority to do this I would urge that it be included in the Bill.  If the Minister is of the opinion that it is not necessary and that the inspector's report may be published by the board at its discretion, then I would be happy with such an assurance.</P>
    <P>One of the great weaknesses of the planning system in the past has been that the inspectors' reports have not been published.  Because they have not been published applicants and planning authorities have been left very much in the dark about the reasons on which planning decisions are based. This has produced a climate in which allegations of political favouritism have flourished, even when, as in the huge majority of cases&mdash;I am convinced &mdash; the decisions were made on genuine planning grounds, very often in line with the report of the inspector.</P>
    <P>I would like to see emerging from this Bill and from the establishment of the board the publication from time to time of inspectors' reports which would add up to a substantial <i>corpus</i> of planning guidelines, if not planning law.  These would be an enormously helpful guide to applicants and to planning authorities.  Some of the more well-known planners in Great Britain have, in fact, initially created their own reputation as public inspectors whose reports on major development schemes were published over their names.  This would also do something to underwrite the importance of the inspectorate in the general area of planning.</P>

      <P>Redundancy Contributions Variation of Rates) Order, 1976.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 10th March, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>As and from the 5th April, 1976, it is proposed to effect an increase of 20p redundancy contributions and the draft order is for the purpose of affecting this increase.  The increase will be apportioned as follows&mdash;12p on the employer and 8p on the employee.  The new rates of redundancy contributions will therefore be, on aggregate, 38p for a male worker and 37p for a female worker. The employer will carry 25p or two-thirds of this rate and the worker's share will be 13p and 12p respectively for a man and a woman.  The social welfare stamp includes elements in respect of social insurance, health, occupational injuries and redundancy contributions and the ordinary stamp for a male worker will be £6.49 from 5th April next.  The redundancy element comprises less than 6 per cent of the total value of the stamp.</P>
      <P>During 1975 an income of approximately £4.5 million was derived for the redundancy fund from redundancy contributions.  This income was not sufficient to meet the demands on the fund and it became necessary to rely on Exchequer borrowing to help in financing the fund's statutory operations. Up to the present time repayable advances totalling £4.18 million have been made by the Minister for Finance to the fund.  The new contribution rates are designed to repay these advances while dealing with ongoing redundancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasons for the large-scale borrowing from the Exchequer have to do with the scale of redundancies in 1975 <Col N="1679" /> and the increased demands made by unemployed workers for redundancy weekly payments.  It should be noted that the rate of notification of redundancy so far in 1976 shows a marked decrease over a similar period last year.  This is in line with the improving figures of unemployment.  However, it is necessary to restore balance to the fund after the very heavy demands that have been made on it during the last two years of recession.  I therefore ask the Seanad to approve the increase as outlined in order to restore solvency to the fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister concluded by saying that it is necessary to raise these payments from employers and employees in order to restore solvency to the fund.  In fact of course the fund is solvent.  What he means is that it is necessary to increase these payments in order to pay £4.18 million to the Minister for Finance.  The fund is solvent with the aid of the advances from the Exchequer.  So, in effect, this is a further continuation of the budget.  This is the third time in the past week that we have had a proposal of this kind. Last week we were dealing with extremely heavy impositions under the Social Welfare Acts which included, among other things, an element of profit&mdash;if I may use that word&mdash;of £8 million to the Exchequer in ease of the budget of last January.  Yesterday, we were dealing with increased payments under the health laws and today we have this additional amount on foot of redundancy.  As I understand it, the total of the income last year at the old rates was £4.5 million.  The total being raised by this motion must be in the neighbourhood of £5 million. Would that be correct?  I assume that it would.  This is another £5 million taken from the workers of this country &mdash; taken also from the employers but essentially taken from the workers because the employers will of course hand this on in increased prices to the consumers and the workers and it may have some further marginal effect in yet further increasing the ranks of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases are very large.  Their size is particularly startling in view of <Col N="1680" /> the Minister's point which he made that so far this year the number of redundancies is running well below that of last year.  He did not tell us here, but I think I am right in saying that he told the Dáil, that whereas last year there were 19,000 redundancies this year the figure is running at a rate of about 13,000 per annum.  Whether that will continue or rise or fall, one does not know but that is apparently the present position.  In the light of this, the startling increases in this motion have no relation at all to any worsening of the redundancy position as compared with last year.  The Minister has pointed out that there has been an improvement so far; it is purely a budgetary transaction in order to pay back these funds to the Exchequer which were advanced last year.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that in the present recession, the present extremely dangerous economic, financial and social position with a very heavy unemployment total, that this was the time when the repayment of this amount could have been deferred until times were better.  Instead, we are loading on an extra £4 million or so beyond what is needed to deal with redundancy&mdash; perhaps even more than £4 million&mdash; simply in order to ease the problems of the Exchequer or the Minister for Finance.  The increases are some 100 per cent in the case of the employer's liability, around 166 per cent in the case of male workers and 200 per cent in the case of female workers.  One wonders why this further element of discrimination should enter into it, in regard to women workers, why we are still in breach of the law both of this country and of the EEC in that they are still paid less than the male workers and they have to pay a higher rate of increase on these redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken of the fall in redundancies this year being in line, as he puts it, with the fall in the general unemployment rate.  I would have thought that the fall in unemployment, if it has taken place at all, is marginal. I think it has fallen from 118,000 at peak to just over 116,000.  As was pointed out only yesterday by Mr. Connellan, allowing for the situation <Col N="1681" /> that one would expect at this time of year, of a seasonal fall in unemployment, the underlying trend is, if anything, upwards, perhaps stable, but certainly not downwards.  Indeed, with the problems we are facing, the continuing, ever increasing rate of inflation, the problem being presented by the pay position, the free-for-all that seems to be coming, it seems only too probable that unemployment in the later months of this year may well go up again. So far as the present position is concerned the Minister has pointed out that there are fewer redundancies and yet these very large increases are being loaded on the workers and employers who have already been mulcted almost weekly with increased payments.  These type of payments do not appear in the cost of living index.  They will not have any effect on it but they are nonetheless increases in everybody's living costs.  They make it still less likely that anyone will be willing to accept a pay pause of any kind; they represent the wrong type of decision to take under the present circumstances and, as I have mentioned, the sensible thing would have been to defer the repayments to the Minister for Finance of these payments until such time as the community could better afford them.</P>
    <P>The whole position about unemployment appears to be one where Ministers, such as the Minister for Labour, still go around saying that improvements are taking place, still appear to be conveying the impression that there is really no need to do anything constructive about it.  We have a very, very high rate of unemployment and the Government appear to have no policy at all to deal with it.  The fact that unemployment at the moment is well above the figure for this time last year, and that at the same time the Minister has pointed out that redundancies have fallen, appears to have sinister undertones. In other words, it would appear to me that there are not so many new people coming on the unemployment register as a result of redundancy but that there is a very large number who have been unemployed for a very long time, who were made redundant last year.  There are not so many new redundancies but the 116,000 unemployed <Col N="1682" /> are increasingly long-term jobless people.</P>
    <P>The precise figures seem to bear this out.  Recent weeks have shown that there has been only a marginal increase as compared with this time last year in the number on unemployment benefits&mdash;I think it is about 500 &mdash;whereas there are 12,000 or 13,000 more people on unemployment assistance. This is a state of affairs which can only mean that there are thousands of people who have been unemployed for so long that they have ceased to be entitled to unemployment benefit and are going into the ranks of those who have to exist on the much smaller payments made under unemployment assistance regulations. The position, therefore, is extremely serious.  The Government appear to have no policy for dealing with it.  The indications are that the position will become worse rather than better.  Added to this, there is the imposition of a further £5 million or so in a form of taxation&mdash;it is not taxation but it comes to the same thing from the point of view of people who suffer from it&mdash;and this £5 million will be taken from the workers.  Yet another £5 million is being added to living costs: it will be added to the other payments we dealt with yesterday and the very big increases in social welfare payments that we agreed to last week.</P>
    <P>There is apparently no end to the effects of last January's budget.  Week by week we find further extensions of the budgetary policy being inflicted upon the people.  One could say that a further £5 million compared with what has already been imposed on the people in relatively small but nonetheless it is unwelcome; it is unnecessary; it is not calculated to improve the economy in any way; it is calculated to increase still further the problems of attaining recovery and, in particular, of creating further employment. It will do nothing to create further employment: it will make it more difficult.  It may increase in a marginal way the extent of unemployment. Certainly, for the Minister to come in here and say that the fall in redundancies is in line with the falling rate of unemployment is far too casual an <Col N="1683" /> approach.  It is very doubtful, indeed, if there is any real fall in unemployment. It is even more doubtful whether if there is, it will continue.  We cannot agree to these payments because they are not required either by the state of the fund or by the state of the country.</P>

      <P>The motion before us enables the Minister to ensure that those who are fortunate enough to have work should contribute towards a fund which will provide the greatest possible support for those who, through no fault of their own are out of work.  I am rather surprised at what Senator Yeats said because in the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill last week he expressed surprise that redundancy fund contributions had not been increased.  Yesterday, the Minister obliged him by increasing the contributions for the redundancy fund.</P>

      <P>The Senator also made reference to the number of people on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;reputed to be the booming years of our economy when we were led to accept and accepted, that 70,000 was an acceptable figure. <Col N="1684" /> If we break down the balance between the present number of unemployable and unemployed we find that half of the unemployable are farmers in the smallholder category.  The most recent changes in the budget will ensure that this anomaly will be removed.  The net figure of people who would have lost their jobs over the past couple of years, in spite of the recession, would be comparatively low.  Despite the gloom in this respect, there is a certain amount of confidence among us that on the upswing we can recover what we lost through circumstances beyond our control &mdash; circumstances which Fianna Fáil when in control accepted&mdash;very high figures of unemployment in this country.</P>
      <P>Nobody likes to see additional taxation as Fianna Fáil describe it, but no worker who is fortunate enough to have a job will begrudge his less fortunate neighbour the few additional pence that is asked for here to ensure that those who do not have a job have some standard of living protected for them.  I think this is the purpose of the Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House very strenuously oppose the motion and we align it, as Senator Yeats pointed out, with the Social Welfare motion and yesterday's Health Contributions Bill as further indirect taxation.  The Minister requires very significant increases from both the employers and the employees &mdash; in the case of the employer almost 100 per cent and in the case of the male employee almost 200 per cent and in the case of the female employee a full 200 per cent.  The fact that those contributions will do nothing to alleviate the state of the economy, on account of the redundancy payments made in the past, is a reflection on the Minister and the Government.  The employers and employees are being asked to pay that money on the basis that it should have been reflected in the budget of the Minister for Finance last January.  This seems to be a recurring phenomenon, as Senator Yeats pointed out, in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the Government taking <Col N="1685" /> any straightforward action to improve the desperate state in which we find ourselves in regard to unemployment. Those increases will place an extra weight on the employer.  We are well aware that many employers are finding the burden of all these extra payments a severe test.  Here, again, we have drastic increases placed on the employer and the employees.  I cannot see what those increases will do to take us out of the desperate economic mess in which we find ourselves.  Again, as Senator Yeats pointed out, I cannot see the proposal before the House improving the unemployment situation in any way.  The future of industrial development cannot but be hindered by the proposals put before the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKerrigan" hpid="Mr. Kerrigan Mr. Kerrigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion before the House is to increase the contribution rates for redundancy.  Nobody welcomes increases.  We could all share Senator Yeats and Senator Cowen's sentiments about this increase but we must look at the whole situation. When redundancy payments were introduced in 1967 it was during a period of relative boom, as it was called.  The rates were fixed at that stage for employee and employer.  It was at that time intended that this fund should be self-sufficient and self-supporting. There is a more pressing need today that it should continue on that basis.  I do not think, as Senator Ferris said, that anyone in gainful employment would object to ensuring that people who, unfortunately, lose their jobs would be protected with redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction in 1967 of redundancy payments, redundancy in the first three years was fairly steady with a pattern of roughly 3,500 people redundant each year.  The scheme was brought in because it was realised that our traditional industries were going to go through a period of recession and probably change from the traditional industries we knew to other industries which, at that time, were coming to the fore.  This was the idea of the redundancy payments.  Since then we have had quite a change. In 1971, if my memory serves me correctly, in the first five months we <Col N="1686" /> had as many people redundant as we had in the previous 12 months.  We could see that it was escalating.  Then we had our entry into Europe and, on top of that, a worldwide recession. This brought about a total change in the whole position of redundancy.  We can all glibly say the £4½ million is coming from the Exchequer but money has to come from somewhere. It has to be provided by somebody and, unfortunately, the only method adopted at the outset, in the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; as I call them when we hear so much about them, was that the fund should be able to carry itself. This is to repay the Exchequer.  I would agree with that.  It is during a time of recession and during a time when we hope recovery may be made this year.  Perhaps it is necessary now to ensure that this money is there and it cannot be provided by general taxation. So, the alternative is that the scheme must be self-sufficient and I support the Minister's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position here is that it is necessary.  When I use the term &ldquo;solvent&rdquo; I mean to end the dependence of the fund on Exchequer resources.  We have arrangements whereby the Exchequer supports us in times of excess demands on the fund. Of course, it is an expensive dependence because loans of this fashion must be repaid and, of course, the interest on such loans at this time of scarce resources is high.  Therefore it is necessary to see that the fund is returned to a situation once more where its finances are contributed solely by the employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the rate of contribution by male and female workers.  It must be understood that, whatever mileage there may be in it or whatever reasons Senators may have in making this point about discrepancy in the rate of increase, the amount sought for a woman worker is, of course, less at 12p than it is for a man at 13p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been asked whether the sums required are necessary.  I believe they are because there is, first of all, this <Col N="1687" /> requirement to bring the fund back into a state of stability as between the contributions made by employers and employees.  That we do by looking for the extra amount here.  We have had these advances from Exchequer sources up to now.  We want to end that dependence and therefore the new rates are required to bring in this increased amount of money into the fund.</P>
    <P>Very large demands have been made on the fund's resources over the last two years.  Senator Ferris was correct to refer to the entire question of unemployment, which is of course a larger question than the question of redundancies, and to put that in the perspective of the sixties and of the present.  It is true that we have for too long tolerated unemployment figures that would be regarded as intolerable in any of the other Community countries of Europe.  This is not to suggest that the present position of unemployment is one about which any of us can feel complacent. We do not.  We can only say that there is evidence of the Government's commitment to end this situation, to hasten the period of recovery.  The very same budget that is criticised for its imposition on this category or that category of citizens has made the largest capital advance ever in terms of promotional employment. That we regard as a very genuine commitment on the part of this Government to hasten recovery in this economy and to bring back our unemployed into gainful work.</P>
    <P>Indeed this is having an effect. Even allowing for seasonal factors, you can see the steady improvement in unemployment over the past five weeks.  I think that is a very significant tendency observable in our figures.  In all the economies with whom we trade people look anxiously for the signs of recovery.  The first signs of recovery here are evident in those figures.  I think it is a realistic expectation that the tendency of unemployment figures to rise will be arrested over the coming months and that we will see a gradual mend in the position over the months of this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> I know that Members of this House, like the Deputies in the other House, have a case to make the most of the present economic difficulties faced by this Government in common with other Governments.  But the £600 million we have put into the capital budget programme is evidence of the serious resolve of this Government to plan our way through the difficulties surrounding us at present and to make jobs available for those out of work.</P>
    <P>The evidence of that commitment of the Government is to be seen in the training programmes of AnCO, which come under the aegis of my Department &mdash; the number of young people we have coming in to be trained for jobs. While we cannot in all cases undertake that an immediate job is available, we certainly are taking the appropriate measures to ensure that when recovery comes we avail of the opportunities presented by that recovery.</P>
    <P>It is clear that over the period of this year, while we will not have, on the figures available to us, the large rate of redundancies we have had over the past two years, we must make arrangements to put the redundancy fund in order.  The increased contributions sanctioned by this order are necessary if that is to be done.  The demands are there.  There is a clear duty on the Government to ensure that those put out of work are maintained in at least minimum comfort. When we look at our present employment situation and when we see what was tolerated in other days, we must understand that in those other days emigration was still relatively high. That was the remedy for those who were out of work.  It was the easy option availed of by the authorities at that time, an option which is now no longer available to this Government, an option which we are happy not to have: there is no longer the safety valve of emigration to Britain.  Our welfare system means that a person has a free choice of remaining at home even without a job.  That choice was not there under our predecessors.</P>

      <P>During most of that period the option was there of emigration.  The option had to be there because there were no welfare payments given to people who were out of work.  We have ended that situation deliberately.  We have decided that as a community we must grapple with this question of providing opportunities for employment for our people in the years ahead.  It is going to be a very big challenge even when we come out of this period of recession. Never before in our history has such a huge demand been made by young people looking for work. This will call for a large-scale reallocation of resources.</P>
      <P>At any rate, the decision in regard to the redundancy fund is that it must be brought back into balance.  The moneys we sought here are required for the demands we think may be made on this fund in the future.  These demands will not be as large as they have been in the past two years, but the debts of the last two years must be paid.  That is the purpose of this order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned, I was urging on the Minister the importance of having inspector reports published.  This would make available a large volume of planning reports which would be of considerable interest, even important.  It would mean that with each planning appeal decision we would have the reasons for the decision.  Therefore, we would be <Col N="1690" /> able to compare the reasons given for the decision on the appeal with the inspector's report and make up our own minds about it.  We are hopefully moving into a whole new era in planning in which instead of the famine of information we have had up to now, we will have a vast amount of information about planning decisions. Such a vast amount of information cannot but be helpful to people who are interested and concerned about preserving and legitimately developing our physical environment.</P>
      <P>I would now like to move on to a third point of ambiguity in the Bill about which I am not altogether happy.  &ldquo;Ambiguity&rdquo; is perhaps not the right word.  What I would like to do is to pose a question to the Minister as to whether he has really worked out in detail the implications of one particular aspect of the Bill. That is the one which empowers local authorities to acquire and carry out work on open space which has been left unfinished by developers.  I am very conscious of the fact that this particular power is something which many residents' associations and local associations ask the Minister to give to local authorities.</P>
      <P>It seems to me to have implications which might not be altogether desirable. For example, it seems to imply that local authorities in this situation will virtually have to set up their own parks Departments.  They will have to expand employment in order to service these areas and of course will have to recoup the expenditure from the local ratepayers in respect of this. This could become a very costly exercise for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder why this particular change has been made at this time other than in terms of the requests from local resident associations and so on.  As I understand the situation, the usual mechanism adopted to ensure that development was carried out in an appropriate manner is the posting of a bond by the developer &mdash; an insurance bond which more or less guarantees that he will carry out the final work, the landscape of the open space and so on, in accordance with his planning permission.  The Minister <Col N="1691" /> should tell the House whether this system has been weighed in the balance and found wanting and if this new provision is now intended to take the place of the bond system.  To my mind the bond system, in that it was the financial and administrative responsibility of the developer, is a better system if it can be made to work.  We should be slow to pass legislation which would more or less encourage developers to skimp on their responsibilities in the knowledge that the anger of the local residents will be turned not on them, as it should be, but on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of matters I would like to refer to which I am sorry not to see included in the Bill. There are many aspects of this Bill which represent a tidying up of the 1963 Act and an addition of various matters which were not covered in the 1963 Act.  I think it a pity that there are not more of them.  There are a couple of specific ones I would like to bring directly to the Minister's attention.  The first and perhaps the most important one is that there is still no provision in the Bill or in our planning legislation generally for having special inquiries for major planning applications.  I am thinking especially of major planning applications which are made to relatively small understaffed local and planning authorities.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which is, if anything, going to increase in the very near future with the development of our offshore resources, whether oil or gas.  These are quite likely to take place off the territory of relatively small local authorities and may indeed in some cases affect more than one local authority.  At the moment there is no provision for a special inquiry at the point of initial application for a major scheme like this. I am thinking of a scheme such as the gas one in Cork or if oil is found in the Irish Sea or in the Atlantic on the Continental Shelf&mdash;a scheme which will be of national importance. It is absurd to expect a very small local authority with little or no planning expertise available to it to sit in judgment on what is fundamentally a <Col N="1692" /> planning application of national rather than local importance.</P>
    <P>As things stand at the moment most local authorities face this kind of situation.  They will almost always refuse development permission on the grounds that it will then go to appeal and the ball will be out of their court and into the court of somebody more qualified to deal with it.  This is to my mind putting an unnecessary step into the process.  It should be possible to handle national applications other than by way of continual appeal&mdash; applications for schemes of national importance.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister writing into the Bill a provision that the board themselves, perhaps on request by a local authority, may institute a special inquiry for major applications.  This sort of special inquiry would be held on terms and conditions decided by the board.  This would be a form of assistance to the local authorities concerned, especially smaller and poorer ones, and would produce a much better standard of discussion at the level of the initial application.</P>
    <P>The second problem&mdash;and this is one which has been referred to by other Members of this House&mdash;is the delay in deciding appeals.  The Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland in their initial submissions on this Bill, of which I have been given a copy, call very strongly for a time limit on decision.  There is a very strong case to be made for this.  Every architect who individually contacted me about the Bill also made the case for a time limit on appeals.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would let us know what the average delay on appeal is at the moment.  One figure I have been given by a practising architect suggests that there is an average of 32 months between submission of appeal to the Minister and the decision by the Minister on this appeal.  We are obviously moving into a different situation with the establishment of the planning board.  We must not ever allow this sort of situation to happen again.  I would urge very strongly on the Minister to consider either a directive to the board or <Col N="1693" /> to write into the Bill that planning appeals should be deemed to have succeeded unless a contrary decision is given within a stated time.  The board already have power in the Bill to take applications out of sequence if they considered this necessary for any reason.  This underlines the possible value of having a time limit on appeal. It can be done by ministerial directive. It might be better to do it that way than to write it into the Bill.  One way or the other, I believe it should be done.</P>
    <P>A third area which I am sorry the Bill has not touched in more detail is that, in spite of its initiative with regard to the preservation of house interiors, it still contains no provision for conservation areas as such.  It is possible for local authorities to identify individual buildings which they would like to see preserved; but it is not yet possible here, as it is in Northern Ireland, for a local authority to specify a whole area as being worthy of special consideration in terms of planning and development.  Such an area might be a townscape like Upper Leeson Street; it might be a Gaeltacht village; it could be in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have some kind of provision to allow local authorities to establish conservation areas like this.  I am not suggesting that these areas should be preserved in aspect for all times, because it is obvious that some development has to take place at some time in almost all of these areas.  But the areas should be regarded as of such importance from the point of view of environment generally that no development should take place without special scrutiny and, in particular, that demolition within these areas should not be exempt.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with what happens in towns and in the country with regard to demolition.  The demolishers move in and it is a matter of knock down the house and ask questions afterwards.  This is a form of blackmail because once the house is gone the planning authority is committed more or less to accepting something in its place, irrespective <Col N="1694" /> of how much out of character that new something may be.  This form of blackmail could be defeated by, first of all, giving local authorities the power to create conservation areas and, secondly, by insisting that demolition in these areas would not be exempt.  Thus a developer who wished to develop in a conservation area would have to approach the local planning authority and say: &ldquo;I want to knock down No. 16 or No. 25 to 28, and this is what I want to put in its place.&rdquo;  The planning decision on the application can then be taken in terms of the whole context of the situation and not in terms of a gaping hole which somehow has to be filled.</P>
    <P>It is important also that opportunity should be taken in the Bill to simplify the special amenities order procedure.  This was introduced in the 1963 Act.  It has not been widely availed of or indeed availed of at all, so far as I am aware, up to now.  If this power has not been availed of by local authorities something is wrong.  Perhaps it is the wrong power.  I suspect that the procedures suggested for it are too complex and perhaps require unnecessary ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>Related to the question of conservation areas is the unfortunate fact that there is no provision made whereby scheduled buildings and interiors can be supported financially by local authorities.  It is not good enough for local authorities just to schedule a building or an interior and say that they should be preserved. It is possible for the owner, if he happens to be an unprincipled developer, to let the building collapse.  Statutory powers should be given to local authorities to contribute, if necessary, in a modest way and perhaps, with the approval of the Minister, to the maintenance of scheduled buildings.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been brought to my attention by members of the architectural profession is the continuing dismay at the way in which section 4 decisions are still being made by some local authorities.  This causes alarm and despondency and in a sense <Col N="1695" /> undercuts the whole idea of planning and the purpose of the Planning Act. It certainly undercuts anything like a national or regional policy.  It appears that this loophole has not yet been stopped up in the Bill and I urge the Minister to give it serious attention.</P>
    <P>The lack of planning expertise, which I spoke of earlier, has two main effects in our planning situation generally.  The first is that there is a dearth of planners.  Few people working in local authorities have planning qualifications and these are concentrated on the eastern seaboard.  They are very often not to be found in areas in which the greatest damage is being done to the environment.  This is directly related to the fact that there is no proper career structure for those with planning qualifications.  Highly qualified people who enter employment with planning authorities as planners often find that their avenue to the top, their career structure, is blocked at a relatively low level.  If they want promotion they must move into another area, such as engineering. There are people with excellent planning qualifications who are occupied now solely in engineering or sanitary services.  These are estimable services but they are services that are not directly related to the qualifications and particular abilities of these people.  There is a real need to open up a career structure for planners, right up to the level of county planning officer.  The Minister, through his Department and his relationship with the local authorities, should encourage this.  If we do not do this, we will be left with the situation that planning is a low level activity within each planning authority and in which real responsibility never really attaches to the people with planning qualifications.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the original Act allows a local authority to pay for the education of planners.  It is a good section and one which has been availed of in the past.  Unfortunately it is possible for a young planning student, who has got support from his local authority&mdash;say in the west of Ireland &mdash;to follow a course in Dublin, to <Col N="1696" /> take a position when he qualifies with an eastern seaboard local authority. The section should be amended or directives should be issued in some fashion to ensure that people whose education in planning is supported by their own local authorities will return for a certain period to that area and give it the benefit of their planning expertise.  This is a modest proposal. It would not cost any money. It would be a simple administrative arrangement to carry out and I strongly recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest gaps in the Bill is the areas of exemptions, which are still very large.  Agricultural development is still exempt from planning permission.  In the old days agricultural development meant perhaps putting up an outhouse or a shed or a haybarn.  There was a good reason for exempting it from planning permission. There are about 40,000 planning applications every year and obviously if all farming developments were to be included it would make the burden of planning authorities even more impossible than it is at present.  But we have reached the situation where some identifiable farm developments are so large and have such an overwhelming effect on the environment that we are cutting our own throats if we allow them to continue without planning permission.</P>
    <P>There are controls on major agricultural development relating to pollution and so on, but I question if these controls are enough.  The best control is by the Planning Act and some of these major developments should be brought in under its scope. If a factory is set up to deal with 3,000 pigs it will produce roughly the same amount of effluent as a town with 12,000 people and it can be done without planning permission.  For the sake of the environment and the community generally, this must not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a fundamental point which the Minister, as one who comes from a largely agricultural constituency, would, I hope, appreciate. There is not enough connection made in the Bill or in planning policy generally between agriculture and planning.  Planning policies for the <Col N="1697" /> rural areas, and especially the areas reasonably close to towns, take little or no account of the special character of agriculture.  Planning decisions given on a completely piecemeal basis have the effect of creating urban fields, little pockets of bricks and mortar right in the middle of agricultural land for individual dwelling houses, which not only affect the general aspect of the environment but may have in the long term a very deleterious effect on our agricultural production.  It is very tempting for a farmer who is temporarily short of cash &mdash; if there are any such nowadays &mdash; to realise a bit of capital by selling off a field, or half a field, for a house and making a couple of thousand pounds on the transaction.  This is killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  There is no way in which the return to that farmer from selling the land will ultimately make up for the loss to him in cash terms of the agricultural produce which it could support over an extended period.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the relationship between planning and agriculture in rural areas is that planning policy in general seems to be careless and heedless of the need to establish sensible settlement patterns. There is a strong tendency nowadays for people to move five or six miles out of town to the peace and solitude of the country and build their little house in a corner of some kind farmer's field.  We ignore the fact&mdash;if we continue to allow this to happen &mdash; that by allowing and, in some cases, encouraging spot development like this we are encouraging a settlement pattern which will have an enormous effect on our energy consumption in the future.  For a family living in that kind of house having two cars is not a luxury.  It would be an absolute necessity.  At a time when we are trying to reduce our overall consumption of energy, it seems we are adopting, without too much thought, patterns of settlement which are almost designed to increase it.  I would ask the Minister in his exercise of his general political function with regard to planning to bear these matters in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the point raised by the Minister and incorporated in the Bill <Col N="1698" /> relating to the declaration of interest. I welcome this proposal and I should like to think I am partly responsible for it.  I wish to point out that requiring individuals involved in planning decisions to disclose their interest is really only tackling one-third of the problem.  The web and the nexus of influence and of vulnerability in connection with matters of this kind involve not just individuals.  The political associations of which they may or may not be members are involved. Also involved are the people who may seek to influence their decision.</P>
    <P>Something along the lines of what the Minister is suggesting for members of local authorities has already been incorporated in the law of the United Kingdom and has helped to spotlight a situation in which very many public representatives have outside interests and are required to declare these outside interests in order that their actions may be seen to be completely above board.  I should like to see us going even further in this direction than the Minister has gone. I should like to see us going in the direction that would require similar disclosures of interest by political parties.  Several countries, including Belgium and Italy, already have legislation which requires political parties to publish their annual balance sheets in order to qualify for the very substantial State subvention they at present get to help them carry out their business.  Political parties in this country do get a substantial subvention from the State and I see no reason why they should not be asked to disclose reasonably detailed balance sheets as a precondition for receiving a State subsidy.</P>
    <P>The third area in which I should like to see more progress is to require people who actually make contributions to individual politicians or to political parties to identify themselves, or at least to require the recipients of these gifts to identify themselves. Many countries have adopted legislation along these lines.  We are very much in arrear in legislation in this field.  In the United States, for example, every political party and political individual has to publish the identity of any person who gives him more <Col N="1699" /> than £30 by way of a political contribution in any one year.  While we have here the beginning of an attempt to require disclosure of interest related to individual public representatives, which is welcome, I should like to see it extended into the area of political parties and the sources from which the political contributions come.</P>
    <P>There are particular problems for local government because local government public representatives are unpaid. Therefore, they are especially vulnerable to the sort of pressure that can be brought to bear on them.  I am not suggesting that public representatives who are paid are completely invulnerable to the same sort of pressures. That is obviously not true. There is a special pressure on the unpaid public representative.</P>

      <P>I would go even further if I could to suggest that, now that a safeguard is to become part of our law, we should give even more power to local representatives.  We should recognise the fact that local government is an absolutely essential part of our democratic structure.  We should be devolving real power&mdash;more power than they have at the moment&mdash;to our local representatives.  Having said that and having apologised for what I believe is a misunderstanding, I would commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Like other members of the Seanad, I would like to welcome this Bill.  This Bill has had a long airing in the Dáil.  It was first introduced in March, 1974, because it has gone through many sitting days since and has been probed very well, and the Minister has accepted many amendments to this legislation, we can be assured that the Dáil has done a very good job on the Bill.  I do not intend to detain the Minister or the House too long in speaking on it.</P>
      <P>As we are all well aware, there are industrial development zones in most towns of which, naturally, the local authority have control.  I noticed while driving through Britain&mdash;the few times I was there&mdash;that they seem to have their industrial zones well separated from the actual towns and villages. The reason for this may be the fact that it is a long established industrial country.  Here it is quite the reverse. The towns are there and we try to develop the industries within the vicinity of those towns and villages.  When travelling through the country, I notice that it is a bit lop-sided in that respect. We seem to have industries pitched in the centres of villages and towns.  It may not be the case everywhere, but there are isolated cases of bad planning.</P>
      <P>Anyone involved with local authorities will realise that the judgment of the person in charge of planning can be over-ridden by the county manager. I had hoped that the final decision would be left with the planning personnel. It is quite probable that a county manager, for some unknown reason, might not be on the best of terms with a planning officer and might have very different views with regard to the decision of a planning officer.  This legislation does not alter decision making at local authority level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When appeals went before the Minister, irrespective of who was Minister for Local Government, they took a very long time.  I welcome the three main changes in this legislation.  The main one is the establishment of An Bord Pleanála which takes over the work of the Minister.  The second main change is the strengthening of provisions in the 1963 Act relating to unauthorised <Col N="1701" /> development.  The third change amends various provisions in the 1963 Act which need improvement to make them more flexible and effective. I welcome the fact that public representatives will have to make disclosures in regard to owning property in the area in which they serve.  From my own experience, I know that people involved in local authorities are very open-minded in this and I have never come across anyone who was reluctant to reveal his involvement in any land developments in the area which he served.  I suppose there was a general sense of suspicion that planning was a political decision.  For that reason I welcome this proposal.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan referred to planning permission not being essential for farm development.  I know of one particular case myself.  Three or four people had built modern bungalows where there was an actual housing site left between two or three of them, and a farmer came along and built an outhouse.  That farmer should not have been allowed to erect an outhouse on that site.  He had plenty of space at the rear of the site.  The fact that he did not have to get planning permission to erect that farm building is wrong.  Action should be taken to ensure that this does not continue. Another point to be raised is that of planning permission being granted in the business centres of small towns and villages.  A pre-cast bank was built in the centre of a business street in a village, which spoiled the environment in that village.  The Minister should do something to ensure that buildings are in alignment with their surroundings.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate these matters, particularly in regard to farm development.  In most cases, the farming community do not interfere with the existing housing structures in an area, but, on the other hand, farm buildings have been erected which do little to enhance existing building development.  Perhaps the Minister could do something to alleviate this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Any legislation with regard to planning development must be short-term, particularly in such a small developing country as <Col N="1702" /> this.  It is quite possible that further changes may be needed within another five or ten years.  Although the 1963 Act has functioned fairly well for the period of its existence, this legislation is needed at this time and I totally welcome it on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got a lot to say on this Bill.  Generally speaking, I think my views would run counter to those of Senator Horgan.  I approach this measure and planning control generally on the basis that, while I do not think it can be questioned that it is a necessity, it can be very much overdone.  I am afraid that we are becoming too planning conscious.  Having said that &mdash; and my views as expressed will, no doubt, be misunderstood by some and possibly misrepresented by others &mdash; I want to make it quite clear that, generally speaking, I do recognise the necessity for planning control.  I think we should be on our guard against overdoing it.</P>
      <P>I have a number of things in mind when I say that, which distinguish my point of view from Senator Horgan's. It is quite right that in our approach to planning generally we should go as easy as possible on agricultural property. The Minister has made it quite clear that, since he became Minister, he wanted planning authorities to approach the question of planning permission on a sensible and realistic basis.  That is the correct approach. I would feel that, particularly in times of economic difficulty and recession, in so far as planning authorities can do it, they should be encouraging development, certainly in times of economic difficulties, in times when there are large numbers of unemployed, where you have the entrepreneural type of developer who is prepared to take a chance in development. He should be encouraged because of the additional money that will be put into circulation by his efforts, the additional employment he is going to give.  In times of economic difficulties we should to some extent back-pedal as far as being too rigid on planning control is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do recognise the necessity for planning control.  I do recognise the <Col N="1703" /> undesirability of allowing harmful types of development, or allowing what I might describe as disfiguring types of development, particularly in scenic areas.  The more planning control we have the more it is necessary to increase vastly the planning staff of local authorities if the entire works are not going to get bogged down.  When I say that, I have a number of things in mind.  Most of us know, roughly speaking, the procedure to obtain planning permission for any development at the moment. It is necessary to give notice in the newspapers, to make the application where the planning authority have a couple of months to come to a decision, where possibly there are going to be negotiations or an exchange of views between the architects and the planning authority, and where plans submitted are considered and alterations of one sort or another suggested. All that in itself takes a great deal of time and eventually permission is either granted or not granted. I would have no idea of the percentages, but certainly in a very substantial number of cases where planning permission is either granted or refused the whole matter ends up in an appeal to the Minister for Local Government. Some time ago the Minister must have had between 2,000 and 3,000 appeals on his desk for decision. These are not all appeals by people who have been refused permission because it is nearly as common a practice for local residents' associations, in particular, to appeal when development permission is granted for housing development adjoining them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another of the points which I think will be resented by some people, but I think it should be said.  I do not think the pressures on members of local authorities by people who are interested in getting planning permission are nearly as numerous as the pressures exerted on members of local authorities, certainly in the Dublin and County Dublin area, by residents' associations.  Residents' associations can and, I think by and large do, play a very useful part in community life but I have the impression that residents' associations <Col N="1704" /> are frequently urged by their members to object to residential development taking place in estates or fields and so on in their area because they have become accustomed to living in an area with large open spaces near them which are right for development. Members of residents' associations who have become accustomed to living in that kind of comparatively free area so far as development goes do not like to see houses going up.  It does not seem to occur to them that they would never be in their own houses had objections been made to the development proposals when their houses were being erected.  Members of local authorities are continually being subjected to pressure.  There is nothing undemocratic in it.  Quite the contrary.  But being subjected to pressure with regard to planning decisions by residents' associations is very hard for a member of a local authority to withstand.  Certainly in new residential areas, where there is an active residents' associations with a big membership, the attitude of the residents' association at the time of an election may be of crucial importance to the candidates.  I merely mention this as one of the pressures that are there and it is more important in many ways than the pressures from people seeking permission for development.  It is something that has to be noted.  Perhaps it would be as well if at some stage we thought about it in the context of what is being done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The idea of setting up the planning board is an excellent one.  It removes what might perhaps be described as the dangers that exist in the pressures that I am talking about.  It is provided in the Bill &mdash; I questioned this in my own mind when I read it first &mdash; that the chairman of the board will effectively be either a judge or an ex-judge. I wondered if it might not have been better to have provided that the chairman of the board would be someone with practical experience as regards planning but, on balance, I think the Minister has done the right thing.  This whole area of planning appeals is one that requires a judicial approach.  It requires the kind of approach that will be able to set at one side and consider appeals for what they are on <Col N="1705" /> their merits &mdash; the local opposition on the one hand and the vested interest of the developer on the other hand.  A calm, judicial kind of mind brought to bear on the pros and cons of that situation is probably the right approach.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill which is good and very necessary is the provision which is being made to give a life-span to planning permissions.  The position heretofore has been that a planning permission had no particular life.  Unless a condition was attached to the planning permission providing that it would remain extant for a particular period only and that it would cease unless development took place within the period specified in the planning permission, a planning permission once granted remained there indefinitely, whether or not the development which had ben applied for was ever undertaken.  It is necessary and an improvement in the law to provide for the five-year life as is done in this Bill with provisions for extensions where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Also, mainly from the point of view of their own protection, it is a good thing to bring into this Act the provisions regarding the declaration of interests which is provided for in the Bill.  There were two points, one of detail and one of what I would regard as of general importance, that I would like to ask the Minister about. This Bill does not tackle the question of planning authorities or local authorities being required to take in charge new estates when they are completed. I know this is a difficult problem. I want to put to the Minister that it is not merely a difficult problem from the point of view of the local authority but also it is a very difficult and frustrating problem from the point of view of the developer.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware in general terms of the procedure which exists in endeavouring to have estates taken in charge.  When an estate is completed, an application is made to the local authority to have the estate taken in charge.  It is a general procedure then for local authorities to carry out an inspection and to submit to the developer a list of their requirements. <Col N="1706" /> They will inspect the roads, sewers, public lighting and the open spaces, footpaths and so on.  They will draw up a list setting out any defect which they see existing in the estate and they will ask the developer to attend to these matters before they consider making an order taking the estate, the roads, and services and so on in charge.</P>
    <P>The problem from the developer's point of view is that if the developer carries out the requirements of the local authority he has no assurance whatever that the estate will be adopted by the local authority within a reasonable time.  What can happen &mdash; and what has happened more than once in the Dublin area &mdash; is that the developer, having been furnished with the requirements of the local authority and having attended to their requirements, then finds that the services are not taken in charge, and meanwhile the estate roads, footpaths and so on come into general use.  I know of one case in which I was concerned in my professional capacity where a private estate road that was not taken in charge was used as a bus route for a period.  There were repairs on the normal bus route and buses were diverted along this road.  Look at this from the point of view of the developer.  This was never intended to be a bus route.  Admittedly, it did not last for very long, but if that kind of thing happens the extra weight which is carried when heavy traffic is diverted from its normal route along an estate route, because of repairs or something else, it is likely to damage the estate road even though that road is fully up to the standards of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The main point I am making is that once the local authority are notified that their requirements have been carried out they should then carry out another immediate inspection and if the inspection shows that the requirements have been carried out there should be an obligation on the local authority then to take the estate in charge and not to allow the matter to drag on to an extent where in the course of years and &mdash; sometimes it is a question of years and not of months &mdash; ordinary deterioration takes place. Then it is necessary for the local authority <Col N="1707" /> to send out another list of requirements. That is not tackled in the Bill.  Possibly it was never intended that it should be, but it seems to be a matter which is vital in connection with planning legislation, and I would be glad to hear the Minister's mind on it.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to raise is in connection with section 19.  This is a good provision which enables the planning appeals board to award costs against the unsuccessful party to the appeal.  But I am wondering how people stand in relation to section 29 of the Principal Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> section 19 of this Bill.  The Minister will be aware that section 29 of the 1963 Act is the section whereby a person, if an appeal is disallowed by the Minister, can serve a purchase notice on the local authority, and then the local authority can accept the purchase notice or they can serve a notice of unwillingness to comply with it.  If they are unwilling to comply the matter is back with the Minister and he has roughly six months to decide what action to take. The point I want to make is that that procedure can only be operated provided that the matter has been determined by the Minister on appeal and the purchase notice machinery in the 1963 Act becomes operative only provided an applicant has gone to the trouble of first of all putting in his planning application, getting it turned down by the local authority, then going on appeal to the Minister and getting it turned down by the Minister. It is necessary for him to do that before he can begin to operate the purchase notice machinery under section 29 of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>It would seem unfortunate if a person who merely wanted to comply with what is necessary in order to operate section 29 of the 1963 Act were to be penalised in costs for doing that.  The answer may be that it is entirely a matter for the board, and if it appears to the board that the applicant is doing what he is doing merely for the purpose of operating machinery which is open to him to operate under the Act, possibly the attitude of the board would be that <Col N="1708" /> it was not a proper case in which to award costs against him.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the Seanad has shown its appreciation of the Minister's work in relation to the Bill and has particularly expressed its appreciation of the idea of the planning appeals board.  I am sure it will be a relief to the Minister personally and to his Department once this legislation is through and the board are established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>If any country or any Government were to indulge in planning in the ideal way they would have had to start planning from the year of one.  Unfortunately we are a bit late in the day for that. While the 1963 Act was a commendable effort in its own way towards trying to bring some order and cohesion and co-ordination into what had been a rather haphazard development up to then, there were many defects and loopholes which have come to the surface in the intervening 13 years and the purpose of this Bill is largely to close those as far as possible.</P>
      <P>It has, of course, included a number of admirable provisions, a number of new ones as well, namely as regards the protection and preservation of interiors of buildings which is a new one and which is certainly to be welcomed.  But in the main the Bill revolves around the setting up of an appeals board.  This is an admirable decision on the part of this Government.  It was part of its 14-point plan in 1973 at the general election.  It is a Bill in fulfilment of that programme.  I think it is an effort on the part of the Minister to take, as it were, the politics out of planning or to take the planning out of politics, whichever way one likes to look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that it is commendable effort, there are a number of points we should look at and there are a number of reservations I have in regard to certain matters in the Bill.  With regard to the composition of the appeals board, I wonder whether a judge is the right person to have as chairman of such a bord. <Col N="1709" /> Certainly I do not think any judge would have practical experience at local authority level as to what are really the sensitive issues involved in planning.  Planning is a very sensitive matter.  It is only the party who is directly involved in a planning application who finds his emotions really involved in that matter.  An outsider looking in cannot gauge the full extent and depth of the involvement of that applicant's emotions.</P>
    <P>As regards the numbers on the appeals board, the provision is that there shall be not less than four and not more than ten.  Ten, to me, would seem somewhat large to arrive at a decision, but the Minister probably has in mind that they would divide themselves up into separate committees and so on, to deal with different aspects of planning. Perhaps he would make some confirmation on that point.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Board shall, so far as may in the opinion of the Board be necessary for the performance of its functions, keep itself informed of the policies and objectives for the time being of the Minister, planning authorities and any other body which is a public authority whose functions have, or may have, a bearing on the proper planning and development (including the preservation and development of amenities) of cities, towns or other areas, whether urban or rural.</P>
    <P>This seems to me somewhat optional on the part of the board.  There is no requirement on them; they may, only if they feel in need of some information, go to the Minister or the local authorities to seek guidance.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 the Minister is retaining his authority to give general policy directives to the board but he is precluded from exercising any control over the final resolution of the appeal. Weighing up both these sections, it appears that the Minister is perhaps giving away a little bit more than he is getting back in return from the appeals board.</P>
    <P>Section 16 and a number of other <Col N="1710" /> sections appear to form the basis of what I feel are deterrents to appeal by any person.  First of all, we have the question of a deposit being asked for. A person can say that a deposit is not going to be a deterrent.  In many instances it will not.  In the case of a large corporate body or a large business firm a £10 deposit is nothing.  But in the case of an individual, some person who may have a certain emotional involvement in regard to a planning application by another party and certain objections to make to that planning application, the question of a deposit can be a deterrent.  I wonder whether it is right to have a deposit in the case of an individual.</P>
    <P>The appeal board can refuse an oral hearing.  This again smacks somewhat of being slightly bureaucratic.  One of the great things about the 1963 Act was that a person could look for an oral hearing and while it might have involved a delay in the determination of the appeal it was a good right for any individual appellant to have.</P>
    <P>The situation now that the deposit is liable to forfeiture could also be a deterrent towards an appellant putting in an appeal.  The wording, &ldquo;when the board feels an appeal is vexatious&rdquo;, to me is typical of the situation where a person looking at a planning case from the outside may not be able to gauge the depth of the emotional involvement of a party to that planning application. The appeal board may well at times put aside the emotional involvement some appellants have.  The appellant if he is unsuccessful in his case would have to pay the expenses all round. This is somewhat burdensome and onerous.  Exception should be made in the case of individual applicants, or else they may not go ahead with what they would know in their hearts to be a very genuine case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the issue of warning notices in regard to unauthorised development.  Should we not consider that that warning notice should include the provision that the unauthorised development should be restored to its original condition? I have seen far too many instances where a person undertook unauthorised development and then <Col N="1711" /> aggrieved people made their case, the country council stepped into the scene, but much damage had already been done.  The unauthorised development continued for a very lengthy period. Ninety-nine times out of 100 it was allowed to continue in existence and was possibly completed at a later stage when some compromise was arrived at.  I should like to see some provision here as regards that development having to be removed&mdash;in other words, to restore the area to it former condition.</P>
    <P>The withering of permission after five years is also welcome, but I wonder if five years is not a little bit too long.  In my own county of Louth we have a provision in our county development plan that outline planning permission would lapse after two years if further progress had not taken place within that period.  Two years is perfectly adequate for anybody who has any intention of developing an area for him to make a move in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of the paragraphs regarding register of interests of both elected representatives and employees of the board and also certain officers of the planning authorities is good. It should not be misinterpreted.  There have been very few abuses, if any, in regard to people really playing upon their interest in land.  Their responsibilities as elected representatives will always outweigh such considerations. It is no harm to have it included, as long as we remember that it is there simply as a safeguard and as a cautionary note and not as a penalty now imposed on account of past malpractices in that regard.</P>
    <P>The figure of 4,000 appeals or roughly 10 per cent of all applications for planning permissions might seem hefty enough, but I have often felt that that figure of 10 per cent or 4,000 would have been much less if local authorities had done either of two things.  Certainly I can vouch from my experience as an elected representative on Louth County Council that on many occasions the planning officials did not act in accordance with the recommendations of <Col N="1712" /> the Minister for Local Government as regards easing up on restrictions with regard to planning applications. Planning officials should have, perhaps, brought local representatives and the elected representatives into the issue at a much earlier stage than at the time of refusal to a proposed development.  I do not think that 4,000 appeals, while it may involve an awful amount of work for officials in the Department, is all that hefty a figure.  The fact that a person could always make an appeal on a matter in which he felt there was going to be a certain infringement of privacy or of his rights was one of the corner stones of our system.</P>
    <P>My last point concerns planning officials.  They have certain aesthetic attitudes, even ideal attitudes towards planning and they have often come into friction with elected representatives on this score.  I appeal to those planning officials to remember that the elected representatives are people who have their ear to the ground as regards what people in their constituencies have to do as regards development and their needs in regard to development.  It is all very well having idealistic attitudes towards planning, but the pressures of the age in which we live, the pressures of living accommodation and the pressures of an increasing population mean that some sacrifices will have to be made in regard to having such attitudes.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Bill is commendable. It is an improvement on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act of 1963.  No doubt it will not fill all the loopholes.  We will discover through time that there are some defects in it.  The procedures in regard to the appeal board will be proved only through experience either to be correct as they are laid down in the Schedule to this Act, or they will need further improvement and further enlargement.</P>
    <P>In concluding, I welcome the Bill. It is a fulfilment of another point of the 14-point programme which this Government went into the general election of 1973 with.  I think it will be generally welcomed by all parties and by the citizens as well as by the planning officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill could well be described as legislation that has received adequate airing in the other House.  It has been on the Statute Books for almost two years now.  That so many amendments have been accepted during the course of debate is a clear indication that every effort is being made by the Minister and all the parties and all the participants to the debate to have the best possible legislation to deal with and control planning in this country.  Planning is one of the most important issues facing the country at present. We hear so much about the environment, about pollution and good and proper planning that it is necessary and important that every aspect of the Bill be dealt with adequately. The other House has dealt with this Bill in a most adequate manner.</P>
      <P>There is little left to be said with regard to the Bill.  This measure, like every other piece of legislation, will not be final in dealing with local government planning because changes take place from day to day.  It is 13 years since the last Bill was introduced. Many changes have taken place in that 13 years.  Thirteen years ago we heard very, very little about the environment and pollution.  In fact, we did not have any pollution problem in 1963 compared with those we have today.  Therefore, the success of this legislation will depend entirely on the wholehearted co-operation of everybody involved in the environment and in planning, from the local officers up along to the new planning board which the Minister proposes to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to hazard a guess as to whether the planning board will be the success that it is hoped to be, but at least it will relieve public representatives of a great deal of anxiety and pressure with regard to planning appeals, because the real bone of contention in the last few years has been in the matter of planning appeals.  Many of those appeals have been regarded as political decisions. As long as elected representatives have any say in planning it is natural to expect that lobbying will <Col N="1714" /> occur from time to time.  Public representatives will always be susceptible to the wishes of groups, especially in their own constituency.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I welcome the channelling of the work over to the new planning board.  However I am not satisfied with the composition of this board.  Their chairman should be a man or a woman who has been associated with somebody who has had long and detailed studies carried out of the environment, of pollution and long-term planning in general.  While I do not wish to cast aspersions on judges, we should not have somebody of that calibre: the responsibility is so great that something more is needed.  I would like to see someone on the board who had the interests of the environment at heart.  But we must await the setting up of the board before we can comment on it composition.</P>
    <P>Local authorities could play a greater role in the smooth running of planning within their jurisdiction.  In the past many local authorities did not take an active interest in planning. The work was left to the planning officer. He and the county manager always had the final say and members of the local authorities were seldom involved.  Planning decisions often had to be questioned.  In recent years, possibly because of the interest of community groups or residents' associations, members of county councils have become aware of the role they can play in planning.  They know that in the final analysis they are the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Sometime last year the Westmeath County Council, of which I am a member, set up a planning committee which will enable appeals to be dealt with.  Members of local authorities know of the problems associated with a particular planning application and they are able to assist and advise planning officers.  In this way the number of refusals in County Westmeath has been cut to a minimum.  In March there were only three refusals and I do not think the Minister or any planning board would have given permission in the three cases in which we refused it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> An inland county never has the same problems as a city or a large town or a coastal county.  Westmeath is a county of many scenic attractions. It has pollution problems which can be associated with planning.  Lough Ennel, one of our most beautiful lakes, has become polluted by sewerage from Mullingar and its hinterland.  This has happened because adequate steps were not taken to have a proper sewerage system before the town was allowed to grow and develop in recent years.  The Minister is aware of this and I ask him that, in future, before long-term planning is carried out he would ensure that the sewerage system in the areas concerned is examined and brought up to a standard that will cater adequately for such development, both private and industrial. There has been considerable industrial development in Mullingar in recent years and that also has added to the problem of sewerage disposal and the pollution of our lakes in general.</P>
    <P>When we speak of pollution and the environment we must also question the role of the developers.  In recent years it has become common practice for a developer to move into an area, acquire land and build a scheme of houses.  In the granting of planning permission provision has always been made for a proper road network, footpaths, public lighting and so on.  A great deal of controversy arises as to when the developer's responsibility ceases and when the local authority takes over.  This contentious problem has arisen many times because developers either did not know their duties and obligations or preferred not to know and the result in many cases has been that housing schemes were completed and when the residents moved in, after some time a road or a footpath fell into disrepair.  Then the residents lobby the local authority to have footpaths and roads provided or repaired, and it usually emerges that under the planning permission the developer should have carried out this work before leaving the scheme.  It should be clearly defined when the function of the developer ceases and when the local authority can take over. Our engineers tell us that they cannot <Col N="1716" /> move in until the developer has finished his work.  A specified time should be written into all planning agreements to ensure that the work is completed within that time.  This would enable the residents and the local authorities to know where they stand.</P>
    <P>The role of the local councillor has never been fully appreciated here.  They are the last group of unpaid servants we have.  When I see mention of a declaration of interest I feel that I must make the case for the county councillor who carries out an enormous amount of work and receives no remuneration whatever.  Take the case of the county councillor who is resident in the headquarters of the administrative area.  He gives his time free of charge.  If he has any pieces of property around that town he should not be under an obligation to declare his interest in them.  This may not be an opportune time to mention it, but if an effort was made to remunerate county councillors for their work, it would remove a great deal of the misunderstandings and misconceptions that exist regarding the members of local authorities.  They give a voluntary and worth-while service and they are among the few people who are prepared to give so much time and effort free of charge.  I doubt if the members of the proposed planning board will be expected to give their time without some remuneration.</P>
    <P>If the members of the planning board move on circuit through a given group of local authorities they would be able to reduce the time factor in processing appeals.  We know the amount of overlapping and communication that must take place in regard to planning appeals.  Those who have been refused send their appeals to the Department of Local Government.  It lies there.  The Department of Local Government will go back to the local authority on more occasions than one seeking further submissions and so on.  This vicious circle operates of one communicating with the other all the time before a final decision is reached.  Therefore, if this planning committee was set up in groups, and if they moved from one local authority to another, their work would be speeded up to a great extent. When they visit the headquarters of a <Col N="1717" /> local authority, they will have access to maps and files and to a great deal of background information which would be hitherto unavailable to them in this capital.  I do not know how valid this point is or whether it would be effectively implemented or not but I feel it is worthy of consideration.  It would help especially with oral hearings which still take place at local level.  It would help in the administrative aspect of planning appeals.</P>
    <P>I must mention those who object for the sake of objection only.  We have a case of two people in an area, one not on speaking terms with the other, one will object to the other.  The result will be that planning applications can be dragged out for a long time.  Then, perhaps, there is someone in an area who is prepared to object to anything and everything without any valid reason for doing so.  I know a case of a man in an area who did not want another businessman to secure planning permission for a small project.  He collected lists of names of people asking them to object.  Some of those people did not even know what they were signing or what they were objecting to.  They thought it had something to do with the environment, or a green belt in an area.  These are aspects of planning appeals that have to be fully dealt with and could be very adequately dealt with at local level.  I am just throwing out those suggestions to see if they are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I agree with the guidelines set out in the Bill to try to achieve the highest degree of flexibility in planning.  I feel that there must be flexibility if we are to have a fully acceptable planning system in any country.  It is important that all our planners make a special effort to exercise the fullest degree of flexibility.  It is only in that way we will make any plan work.</P>
    <P>I would like every effort to be made to ensure that maximum development takes place in our towns and villages. It is deplorable at present when we see increasing demands for development in urban areas and discover that many of our towns and villages are falling into decay.  The people are leaving them.  All local authorities should <Col N="1718" /> be encouraged to induce people to establish homes in towns and villages because it is only in that way we will protect the environment.</P>
    <P>People should always come first in any environment.  The needs of people should be foremost in everybody's mind whenever a planning application is being dealt with.  Every local authority should be instructed to give the fullest assistance and co-operation to people who want to establish their homes in rural areas.  Progress has been made in recent years in regard to the installation of regional water schemes.  Those schemes should make it a great deal easier for people to carry out group building in rural areas. But, unfortunately, the county development plan which is often in operation prevents this type of development. I am sure the Minister is fully convinced that we should encourage this type of development.  There is nothing nicer in our countryside than to see well-developed housing schemes in our towns and villages, and new towns and villages created by continued development in rural areas.  We can have planners who are only concerned with urbanisation and more density in urbanisation.  I believe that if we want to improve the quality of life we must try to distribute our population as evenly as possible back in the rural areas.  It is frightening to realise the number of people who have left the land in recent years.</P>
    <P>Now, with regional water schemes, with rural electrification and the reasonably good standard of our road network, it should be possible to get more people back into rural Ireland.  It is very important because the more urban developments we have the more costly it becomes on the local authority. I mentioned the case of the Mullingar sewerage system not being adequate to meet the continued development which had taken place around the town in recent years.  If we had more rural development, if we had properly constructed septic tanks we would relieve local authorities of a great deal of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Planning is necessary in the expansion of any area.  Housing schemes should be adequately planned to ensure <Col N="1719" /> that open space is available, that places of recreation are available and that, in general, the planning authorities by their efforts in planning would play a positive role in the improvement of the quality of life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the full co-operation of all sections of the community is necessary in order to see a programme of successful planning carried out.  I feel that the points I have made are worthy of consideration.  I may introduce amendments later on on Committee Stage if I feel they are necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this Bill will seal all loopholes.  It is never possible to seal all loopholes in any legislation: it would be wrong if that were the case.  We live in a changing world and changes will take place.  There must be room for manoeuvring. There must be room for flexibility at all times.  I feel that this Bill, which has been debated for so long, will go a long way to alleviate any misconceptions that have occurred in regard to planning.  Nobody will regret the transfer of planning appeals from the Minister to this planning board.  I hope that the planning board will ensure that wise decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>Recently, an appellant in County Westmeath got planning permission on appeal for housing development in an area.  When the local authority got back to re-examine that development they discovered that it would be necessary to instal a 24-hour pumping plant for the sewerage system if that area were to be properly sewered.  They went back to the developer and asked him if he was prepared to meet the further cost of development and, if so, they would accede to the Minister's decision.  Unfortunately, the developer was not prepared to accede to their request for payment of the cost of those services and that development has not taken place.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that local people become more and more involved in local planning because they know the problems of the area, they know the contours of the area and they know what piece of land is suitable for development and what is not. <Col N="1720" /> I would impress upon the Minister the importance of giving full recognition to the members of the local authority and assisting them in discharging their duties in so far as planning is concerned.  When we talk of planning we talk of one of the most important aspects of the environment. Good planning plays a major role in providing us with an environment that will be worthy of the representatives and the people in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join those who welcomed this important legislation.  In a legislation like this it is important to be generous in paying tribute where effort has been made in draftmanship particularly. It was with great interest that I watched the passage of this Bill through the other House.  I noticed something about the debate in that House: there was a tremendous spirit of co-operation, particularly on Committee Stage.  Senators on the other side have commented on the number of amendments which were accepted by the Minister.  The Minister, in his introductory speech today, said that he would consider further amendments if they were necessary.  I pay tribute to the Minister for having this attitude to legislation.</P>
      <P>Concerning this Bill, it cannot be considered in isolation from other legislation which has come before this House.  It is interesting that today we are discussing the third piece of legislation which affects the environment in a very important way.  In this House we had one of the finest debates since I became a Member of the House.  Contrary to what another Senator has suggested, the Water Pollution Bill has been introduced in this House and we are yet to debate it. These two Bills need to be taken together with this amending planning Bill.  We should probably look back also to one or two other measures.  It is useful in commenting on this Bill substantively to speak of the corpus of legislation which affects planning and the environment in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much I like about the Bill in a number of ways.  I should like to <Col N="1721" /> feel that its effect will be to remove pressure and suspicion from members of local authorities.  I should like to feel that the Bill will make a substantive and very real contribution to the erosion of bureaucracy within the State itself.  A Minister for Local Government of the day has a tremendous task.  The occupant of that ministry in the near future of this State will be one of the most important members of the Cabinet in so far as we are living at a time when the structure of the population of the State is undergoing massive change.</P>
    <P>A birth rate which ran at a relatively static rate in the 1940s increased dramatically in the 1950s, changing the structure of our population and thereby giving a huge increase in the proportion of people under the age of 30. This means that not only have we a huge increase in the number of young people but, naturally, we will have to make infra-structural provision for such people.  In a narrow sense this means that there will be a huge demand for housing.  Decisions will have to be made as to the quality of housing, housing estates, and their general design.  If the Bill, through the establishment of An Bord Pleanála removes from the Minister, the obligation of having to deal with huge numbers of appeals&mdash;I know he has tried to do it&mdash;it will have been worth while.</P>
    <P>For that reason the establishment of An Bord Pleanála is to be welcomed. It will speed up decisions on appeals and will set the Minister of the day free for urgent social tasks.  I am sorry Senator Russell is not here for he may be surprised to hear me say that I was very impressed by his contribution earlier in this debate who spoke as he said as a man of commerce. I pay tribute to the fact that he spoke as a man of commerce with extraordinary sensitivity.  In his comments on this Bill he said that he particularly welcomed section 29, the section which spoke of the withering of existing planning permission five years from the date of the coming into operation of the instrument of legislation and in the case of permissions granted after date, five years from the <Col N="1722" /> granting of permission.  He said that in the absence of the provision which is now being made in section 29, city centres had moved into decline.  He spoke of Limerick city and later said that the heart had fallen out of city centres.  I live in Galway city and I might say that it is a city which, when one looks at its aerial photograph, is amazing.  More than 40 per cent of its households are contained in relatively newly-built suburbs.  Yet an aerial view will show the city centre itself in massive decline.  Therefore, I am glad the Minister is bringing in this kind of provision.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, planning application was made to redevelop portion of that city centre.  Planning application&mdash;let me not mince my words&mdash; was made for window-dressing purposes. Once the application had been made, the local authorities&mdash;on both of which, the corporation and Galway County Council, I serve as an elected member&mdash;were precluded from taking any very significant action about the usage of this space.  The result was, therefore, that irresponsible commercial attitudes&mdash;as against sensitive attitudes&mdash;were reflected in an application to hold the line.  Holding the line meant that portion of the city went into serious decay.  Galway is a city which is striking in that respect. Viewed in any way it is a city that will benefit immensely from section 29 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other points of merit in the Bill itself.  I have referred to the impact the board will have at the central level of reducing bureaucracy and at the more general level of removing suspicion and dreariness from local representatives.  I thought that it might be usefully taken with those other measures&mdash;the Wildlife Bill, which we discussed earlier, and the Water Pollution Bill.  Then it will be seen as a serious and very reasonable contribution towards protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has defended the Houses of the Oireachtas in a significant way.  He has defended the principle of accountability&mdash;the board will be accountable for their actions to the House.  If <Col N="1723" /> the chairman or an ordinary member is removed from office a statement of the reasons for such a removal will be made in these Houses and will be justified in these Houses.  This means to the public that nobody can say that you have the Minister for the day interfering for his own petty reasons with the board he has established.  That is an important constitutional principle and it is one of the merits of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will excuse me if I might reflect a slight note <Col N="1724" /> of cynicism in regard to any difficulties of the Department of the Public Service in being able to promise us a smooth transfer of functions from parts of his own Department to the new boards. This was referred to in his speech earlier today.  He stated that staff and accounting services will be made available.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
