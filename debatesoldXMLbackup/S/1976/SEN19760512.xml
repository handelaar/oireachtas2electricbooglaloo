      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 5) Regulations, 1976, and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1976,</P>
    <P>copies of which Regulations were laid in draft before the Seanad on the 5th day of May, 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations propose to raise the fees payable in respect of cattle, sheep and pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The present rates of fees are at completely unrealistic levels and it is necessary that they should be brought more up-to-date.  It is proposed to raise the fee for cattle from 5p to 45p per head and that for sheep from 0.625p to 8p per head.  In the case of pigs the increase will be from 1.25p for a pork pig and 2.08p for a bacon pig to a flat rate of 12p for both types.</P>
      <P>The present rates of fees are in fact those fixed in 1930 and 1935 when the Acts first came into force and when livestock were worth far less than to-day's record values.  In the intervening years, because of such factors as increases in salaries, inflation and the need for more intensive supervision at the factories, the cost of veterinary control at the factories has been increasing steadily.  The cost has risen particularly steeply in the past few years so that receipts now bear no real relation to the cost of the inspection service.</P>
      <P>For example, receipts from fees in 1975 were only about £100,000, whereas the cost of veterinary supervision of meat and bacon factories was £1.6 million.  Obviously this kind of situation has to be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present levels of slaughterings the new rates of fees can be expected to yield about £500,000 in the current year and about £700,000 in a full year. This is far short of what is required to bring receipts and outgoings into balance and the recovery of the full cost of veterinary supervision must be the ultimate aim.  However, an immediate increase to levels which would meet the full cost of veterinary <Col N="4" /> supervision would not be warranted at this stage and in one step.</P>
    <P>Fees in respect of horses presented for veterinary examination at meat factories cannot be increased by order, and so I propose to introduce amending legislation shortly to enable the fee for horses to be increased to the same level as that for cattle.  The legislation will also enable the fees for all species to be collected monthly instead of half-yearly, as at present.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should explain that the proposed new fees will not apply to slaughtering premises catering for the home market only, which are under local authority supervision.</P>
    <P>When a similar motion was being debated in the Dáil this morning I was asked if the National Prices Commission had been consulted about the proposed increases, I made it clear to them, and I wish to do so again, that the Commission were consulted in advance. Some doubt was also cast on the estimated increased receipts of £700,000 in a full year.  It was suggested that if receipts in 1975 had been about £100,000 the proposed new rates should bring in appreciably more than £700,000 per annum.  The figures are quite correct.  Any apparent difficulty here arises largely from the fact that fees collected in any 12-month period do not necessarily relate to slaughterings in a 12-month period also.  There is always some carry-over.</P>
    <P>I now recommend the motion to the Seanad for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although we are not opposing the motion, I should like to make it clear that we are not at all happy about it.  The Minister has stated that the present charge of 5p is unrealistic.  That may be, but the increase is unrealistic also.  An increase from 5p to 45p per lb. is certainly a big jump.  I do not know how many pounds of meat are actually weighed when the Minister says 45p per lb.  If we take an animal whose dead weight is 600 lbs. and the 45p is put on on the full 600 lbs., it would mean about £27 on the animal, according to my recollection.  This is an 800 per cent increase, which is a very steep increase.  I feel it should be staggered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" /> The Minister said that at the commencement the new fees will yield £500,000 and then it will go to £700,000.  We believe that it will go to £1 million in a very short time. This 1 per cent increase will come from the producer's pocket.  Cattle prices are very high at the moment but they were not very high a year ago.  Cattle were being given away for nothing.  That could very easily occur again.  Instead of trying to stifle production we should increase it.</P>
    <P>All the meat factories are going through a very difficult period.  They are finding it difficult to purchase cattle.  They are not able to compete on the open market against cattle going for export.  The result is that some of our meat factories have closed. The factory in Clonmel, County Tipperary, has closed down and others are running on a 50 per cent production and have let quite a lot of their staff go.  This further increase will mean that more people will be let go from factories and more factories will close down.  It will cost the IMP people £125,000.  I know it is time there was an increase, but such a steep increase is not necessary at this time.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that the vets have to be paid.  I understand a lot of the vets are Department vets and are paid their salaries anyway.  I also understand that the Minister is asking the industry to pay monthly instead of quarterly premiums.  This will be a further hardship on the meat industry. I want to point out that, while we are not opposing it, we are not at all happy with the order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to say that any increases, no matter what type, will be opposed by the sections that will be bearing the cost.  This increase of 5p to 45p per animal is a realistic figure because the 5p has been unrealistic for the past number of years. There has been no increase, but the increase in the price of animals has been substantial.  Naturally everybody expected that there would be an increase in the inspection service.  That service were going to demand an increase so, therefore, somebody had to pay for the increase naturally it was through the animal the increase would <Col N="6" /> be paid.  An animal today realises £240 to £300 going into a factory and the 45p is a very small percentage of the cost&mdash;.01 or .02 per cent.  It is very little to ask anybody to pay for the inspection service.  I have no objection to this increase.  It should be recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much the increase, as Senator Ryan said, but the principle behind the increase we are opposed to&mdash;the principle behind the attitude of the Government towards farmers for the last 12 months.  It is now clear that the attitude of the Government and the Minister for Agriculture is to allow taxation of every kind so that they can get at farmers.  The Minister is today in this House, as he was this morning in the other House, gathering obviously much wanted loot to try and exist in office for another couple of months.</P>
      <P>The president of the IFA said this morning that there is no doubt now but that this Government are demonstrating their desire to tax production in agriculture.  It is not very often, as the Minister knows, that I stand at the shoulder of the IFA in any statements.  The Minister's performance in the co-operative movement taxation and again this morning in his application of further taxation has made public the attitude of the Government.  I can assure the Minister and the Government that the Prices Commission, about which there is so much talk, have become a joke among the people.  Humourous stories are told about that organisation.  The Minister knows well that all he has to do is scribble out the request on a piece of paper and send it to the Prices Commission: back it comes to the Minister, then in here and out to the meat factories.  It appears to be as simple as that.  The Prices Commission have become a laughing stock.</P>
      <P>I wonder who will pay the price.  It will not be the big rancher, the big producer or the fat stock keeper who will pay.  It will be the store cattle man at the mart who will carry the brunt.  The producers in Connacht who produce the stores will pay it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister or any Member <Col N="7" /> on the Government side to come to any of the marts in Tuam next Monday, or in Galway, where we produce a lot of store cattle.  The first thing they will hear is: &ldquo;It is shocking&mdash;45p a head off our cattle.&rdquo;  They are not the people who will be sending those cattle into the market at all. The buyers will come and transfer that price back down to the special producer. The same applies to sheep.  It is a lot easier to take more money out of sheep and do very little towards formulating a structure in which the sheep producers will know exactly where they are going at any particular time of the year.</P>
    <P>In the last two or three years there was a huge anomaly in the sheep sales.  There were different prices in different weeks&mdash;in some instances in particular days&mdash;in County Galway, where there was a huge sheep production. It is most unstable and I cannot see why the Minister would have to attack the lamb at all.  I can see a reason for putting the levy on the cattle producers because they know where they are going and they have intervention price, but in the sheep trade there is nothing.  The price of sheep can drop and can vary from week to week by as much as £5.  The Minister knows that himself.  Yet there is a set levy put on it.  When one sees the amount of money that can accumulate from the sheep trade, particularly from the export of lamb, one can clearly see that it is an easy catch.</P>
    <P>There is another question I should like to ask the Minister.  As there are veterinary inspections on live sheep at points of transportation, is there to be a levy where sheep are exported on the hoof in containers or other ways across the sea? If so, is it included in the amount of money which the Minister mentioned in his speech?</P>
    <P>While one must admit that something will have to be done, it is the attitude, the means and the timing of it that seems so irregular and, to me, so unnecessary.  It is no wonder that Mr. Lane, the president of the IFA, said that it now appears to him, <Col N="8" /> and indeed to the IFA, that this Government's main aim in life appears to be to tax agricultural production to the maximum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the previous speaker, who started off by saying that he was grudgingly in agreement with the National Farmers Association, I want to say that all my life I have been a member of that organisation, have supported them in their principles and the work they are trying to do and, generally speaking, the constructive way in which they have approached the problems of agriculture, regardless of who was in office.  However, on this subject I feel that I cannot disagree with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who says that it is reasonable for the agricultural industry to pay for the inspection of our agricultural produce passing through our factories.  It is a small price for farmers to be asked to pay to ensure that the standards and quality of our products are at all times acceptable in foreign markets and will give credit to Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>It is not indeed the small farmer who will complain about this sort of charge.  I am completely confident that the only people who will raise any serious complaints are the people who have very big numbers, because it is only when you operate with very large numbers of stock that this becomes of any significance.  While the levy remained static over the years the price of cattle has gone up tenfold since I became actively engaged in agriculture.  I have seen the price of pigs go up 500 to 600 per cent and the levy remain static.  While the IFA have a responsibility to watch everything, to speak on behalf of the farmer and to ensure that nothing is taken from him that the IFA cannot stop, nevertheless I feel that the IFA would admit that they have bigger problems to be concerned about than this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, to suggest that this increase of 45p per head will go back to the store cattle producer in the west of Ireland is absolutely ridiculous.  I only wish that we could say to the store cattle producer in the west: &ldquo;Prices <Col N="9" /> have been guaranteed for beef, the intervention level will be applicable to you at all times and any change in that will be reflected back in store cattle&rdquo;. In fact the opposite is true.  At the present time we have store cattle prices in the west which bear no relationship whatsoever to the price of the finished product&mdash;indeed they very seldom do. Two years ago we had a situation where there was no relationship.  I do not believe any small farmer will accept for one minute that this will have any effect on the price of store cattle.  As a farmer, and one with a lot more to lose because of this particular order introduced by the Minister than any Seanad salary, I still say it is a reasonable charge and the agricultural industry will not mind paying it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichealPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Minister in his motion to increase these levies on slaughtered animals.  I do not think it is out of proportion, in comparison with the big increase in the price of cattle, sheep and pigs since the 1930s.  In fact, I suggest that all have gone up perhaps 20 times in price.  In the 1930s I remember the purchase of cattle at £8 and £10 a piece.  They are now making £300 a piece.  I feel that the meat packer plants should bear some of the cost of this increase.  I am afraid that the meat packing proprietors will deduct the amount of the levy from the price of cattle, sheep or whatever it may be. I hope that the Minister will not allow such a procedure.  They have not done it previously because the levy was only 6p or 8p.  The meat factories made enough in 1974 to do them for the next ten years and they should not be allowed at this stage to deduct 45p per head off cattle going through the factories.  That is all I am concerned about, I would like the Minister to assure me that he will not allow that to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this matter.  I have listened to the statement of the Minister and the observations from the Opposition benches, particularly that of Senator Killilea.  One aspect of his contribution was rather disturbing <Col N="10" /> when he referred to the Minister's exercise here as procurement of loot. Loot refers to taking money unlawfully. It has been written that he who steals my purse steals thrash but he who steals my good name takes from me that which makes me very poor indeed and enriches him not.  This is an exercise on the part of Senator Killilea, to take away the good name of the Government, an exercise that has been indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Party over the years in relation to every vote that comes up in this House or in the other House, when they demanded that more and more be spent and less and less collected.</P>
      <P>Many of the increases we have had have been made inevitable either because of the increased cost of providing services or because of inflation. Members have a right to criticise the Minister and, indeed, constructive criticism is welcome.  I would be glad if the people opposite, who seek to show that this increased levy is not appropriate, would tell us whether they would base the increase on the value of stock sold or on the value of money &mdash;in other words, on the consequence of inflation.</P>
      <P>All these could be considered as a reasonable basis for assessment, but when we hear observations which obviously are misinformed, or, if they are not misinformed, tend to present an unthinking public with a picture which is a distortion of facts and a misrepresentation of what the Government are doing, or should do, in the circumstances which obtain today we must realise that the Minister is doing a good job, not in regard to the sort of circumstances that Fianna Fáil people would present as the reason behind this, but because of the expenses incurred in consequence of inflation, the high cost of stock and the circumstances that obtain generally if you look at this matter today, on a fair and reasonable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister who has this motion has succeeded in handling some of the most difficult problems with honour and dignity and with a personal approach that has added prestige to that high office.  His performance <Col N="11" /> is comparable with that of any Minister for Agriculture in the EEC countries.</P>

      <P>Somebody who would not be considered as fair even at a crossroads might be regarded as the sort of person who would argue with Senator Killilea.  I am not going to argue with him but say to the Minister that he deserves from this House approval of this motion and I give it 100 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill comes before us immediately after the withdrawal of the decision by the Minister for Finance to tax co-ops and I am convinced that this is a sort of an appeasement effort on the part of the Minister going some of the way towards satisfying those who have been advocating taxation of co-ops.  It would appear to me that this small measure does go some of the way towards meeting the desires of those who have been so loud in advocating taxation of farm co-ops, namely the Minister's colleagues of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure is coming before us at a time when agriculture is being threatened from many angles.  Most people seem to believe now that we must tax agriculture to the maximum. In another aspect of industry we see that industrialists enjoy tax concessions for exports.  Therefore, it is difficult to understand why we must continue to tax the farmers and the farm products because we know that agriculture <Col N="12" /> is producing products which are being exported to every market in the world and is therefore helping to earn for this country and for the economy of the country much needed revenue from abroad.  Every incentive should be given to further increase agricultural exports instead of introducing incentives in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>This, in my opinion, is a tax on production.  It may seem to be insignificant but it is in the long run a disincentive to farmers to continue increasing production.  We know that there has been a decline in the cattle population, in the pig population and in the sheep numbers in recent years and this measure will act as a deterrent to farmers to continue production because farmers will never forget the latter half of 1974 or the early part of 1975.  I notice that in this measure no provision is made for a decrease in the prices of farm produce. I feel that is necessary because the farming community have no guarantee that agricultural prices will be maintained at their present level; they have no real guarantee of markets in the future and therefore even though this measure is small it will be a disincentive towards the increase in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker seems to be of the opinion that nobody has the right to criticise.  I maintain that this is a democratic institution and must be preserved as a place where Members of the Oireachtas will have the right to criticise or to praise.  I believe that it is the essence of democracy to allow freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of debate.  We must have that situation if we are to preserve the democracy we all value so dearly at present. Therefore, I believe that criticism is necessary and I know that every Minister worth his salt will welcome criticism. Therefore I was surprised that the previous speaker seemed to deny other people the right to criticise because the day that that happens is a black day in any democratic society. I believe that this measure is a sop to those who have been so loud in their demands for increases in farm taxation over the past few months.</P>
    <Col N="13" />
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House oppose this measure mainly on the basis that the existing levies have been in operation since the Acts of 1930 and 1935.  It seems to me that it was never the policy of any Minister or any Government down through the years to bring about a situation where those levies would, perhaps, meet in full the payments that were made to the veterinary surgeons.  Now in 1976 the levies are being increased 800 per cent.  Cattle prices have varied over the years since the Acts of 1930 and 1935 and no Minister for Agriculture, irrespective of which Government he was attached to, at any stage came before the Houses of the Oireachtas and asked for such a staggering increase.</P>
      <P>I see this measure as a complete change of policy by the Department of Agriculture.  They are now getting at the farmer again in this taxation measure, as I would describe it, because up to now the moneys collected through these fees bore no relation whatsoever at any time, irrespective of cattle prices, to what the Minister is aiming to do in this particular order &mdash;meet the cost in regard to those fees brought about by the veterinary men in question.  It is on that basis that we totally oppose it.  To ask farmers to pay an 800 per cent increase now is a deplorable action on the basis that the fees in question have been unchanged for the past 40 years or 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to raise my voice in protest against this measure in which the Government set a very poor example.  There is no consistency whatever within the Cabinet when the Government can make an order at any time they wish and tax the farmer.  An 800 per cent increase of taxation on the farmer is something unbelievable when we find that the same Cabinet have to apply to the Labour Court in order to put up a plea that they are unable to pay the men who are working for them, as they have already done.  It shows a very bad economic situation in this country when the Government have to plead before the court that they are not able to pay the increases sought. <Col N="14" /> They do not mind about themselves if they get away with it in the Labour Court.  How then can the same Government put an 800 per cent tax on the pig producer, the cattle producer and even the horse producer?  It is a wonder that the Taoiseach allowed that to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not?  That is in keeping with his views about horses. It is unbelievable that this can happen on top of a 12 per cent increase already granted in pig feed by the adding of skim milk to pig feed and to cattle feed which the Minister said, in a reply in Dáil Éireann some time ago, would go across the board to the cattle producers or the pig producers.</P>
      <P>There is no consistency within that Government.  If the Minister would set out an agricultural plan and tell the farmers what they can expect in one year, one-and-a-half years or two years and not come out with these orders every two or three months in the form of hidden taxation, people would know what to do.  The taxation imposed in the last budget was unforgivable and I am sure that in the near future when the people get an opportunity of voicing their opinions they will show that it is unforgivable. These orders have been coming out every second month, or every second week with price increases imposing taxation like this.  Any man who does not do an eight-hour day, which the vets are not doing at the present time in the factories, and who get from £16 to £20 a day is very well paid.  The Minister should not put another increase on the farmers to give them more money and take himself off the hook in the row that is going on with the vets.  We have spent already £91 million on the eradication of brucellosis and TB and everything like that and it has gone down the drain in 18 months because the schemes are not being carried on due to this row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were the Minister I would resign before I would allow this to happen. I oppose it strenuously.  It is a dreadful burden of taxation to put on the farming community, especially after <Col N="15" /> the increase of 12 per cent on the feeding stuffs.  There is no mention at all about this.  The farmers objected to it but they got no place.  As Senator Keegan has already said, this is probably a sort of appeasement to the tail that is wagging the dog, to the Labour Party, that the Government are going to tax the farmers severely.  I want to state my opinion as strongly as I can against this order.</P>

      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which this motion has been discussed. I think it is obvious to all of us that the Members of the Seanad appreciate fully the need and the justification for the sort of increase being sought here, after 40 to 45 years.  There were two Acts, in 1930 and 1935.  I think there will be some Members old enough to recall that at the time the 1935 Act was introduced and the existing fees were insisted upon by the then Government, now the Opposition, good cows and good cattle were freely changing hands at £10 apiece.  They are now going at prices in excess of £300.</P>

      <P>Senator W. Ryan, who led for the Opposition in this debate, referred to the 800 per cent increase and he emphasised this very much particularly in the case of cattle that had gone from 5p&mdash;at the time, as I say, they were £10 each&mdash;to 45p now at a time when they are making in excess of £300.  I would like to tell the House that the fee for the same inspection in the North of Ireland is 50p not 45p.</P>

      <P>In the North of Ireland, just across the Border, they are paying 50p and apparently they do not consider it excessive.  There has been a considerable amount of confusion about this that I would like to clear up.  There has been confusion among certain reporters in the papers as well in that it is being said that this increase is being sought to pay more to the vets in the factories. It has no connection whatever with what the members of the veterinary profession are being paid and will have no effect on what they are being paid.  Their salaries&mdash;for the information of the Members of the Seanad who do not already know&mdash; move in line with national pay agreements and where the awards are decided in that way they get the benefit of those awards.  But there is no association with the fees charged for veterinary inspections.</P>
      <P>I said in the course of my opening statement that in a full year we will recoup £700,000 and that the total cost is £1,600,000.  There will still be £900,000 to be collected from the taxpayers of this country in order to ensure that an efficient veterinary service will be provided for the processing factories and for, in the last analysis, the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, some Members of this House asked me to ensure that this would not be passed back to the producer. I think every cost in processing is, and has always been, passed back to the producer in the last analysis.  Of course it is the producer who will have to pay.  I cannot see processors reducing the margins of profit simply because we are trying to find ways of relieving the taxpayer of some of the cost of his meat inspection.  This is a normal cost for producers to pay.  It is very much in the interests of producers that there should be an efficient inspection; if our exports are not of a high standard <Col N="17" /> the producers must bear the ill-effects. We are trying to safeguard them against this.</P>
    <P>The question was also asked if a similar fee would be charged on cattle being inspected at the ports.  In my opening speech I stated specifically that this fee will only be charged in processing factories which are licensed for export; not only does it not apply at the ports, but it does not apply to cattle butchered in the normal way for the home market.  Therefore home supplies should not be affected.</P>
    <P>This morning I was told that arising out of this levy there would be an enormous increase in the price of bacon to the consumer.  The charge is 12p per pig and this is supposed to result in an enormous increase to the consumer.  It only indicates how. unrealistic we can become and how we can magnify the effect of things when it appears to be good propaganda for those who oppose the introduction of something new and when they have very little factual material on which to base their opposition.</P>
    <P>I have been chided because the Government did not have consultations with different groups, the IFA and the processors.  Nobody wants to pay.  What would be the outcome of such consultations?  The outcome would be that they would want no part in the scheme.  Nobody knows that better than those who are complaining that they have not been consulted.</P>

      <P>This is not a levy on slaughterhouses; it is a fee for an inspection which the slaughterhouses will be asked to collect in the normal way. My attitude to farmers and farming has been criticised at some length as well as the timing of this operation.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan) Oliver J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make more effective arrangements for control of water pollution with a view to ensuring that the quality of our water resources is maintained to a satisfactory standard consistent with their various beneficial uses.</P>
      <P>There is at present a great deal of concern in this and other countries about the need to protect the natural environment from adverse effects of all forms of development.  Experience in industrialised countries has been that economic and technological progress, while bringing immense material benefits, was very often accompanied by deterioration of the environment. It is the general aim of environmental protection policy to ensure that progress with industrial, agricultural and residential development is not achieved at the cost of environmental damage.  In saying this I should stress that there need be no inherent conflict between the maintenance of a good environment and the promotion of such development, provided the necessary safeguards are taken.  The challenge is essentially one of ensuring that there is a proper regard for environmental considerations in the planning and carrying out of development works of all kinds.  This includes making adequate provision for the safe disposal of the wastes which are the by-product of development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of pollution control one of the more pressing needs is the improvement of arrangements for control of water pollution.  There is no need for me to stress the very favourable position which this country <Col N="20" /> enjoys as regards water availability. We have abundant water resources enjoys as regards water availability.  We have abundant water resources which are relatively free of pollution.  They constitute a valuable national asset which must be protected.  Water is required for almost every human activity. Very large quantities are used for industrial, commercial and domestic purposes.  Our rivers, lakes and seas support a valuable fishing industry. Water is used in many different ways for recreational purposes and is important from a tourism point of view.  It is therefore essential to preserve and where necessary improve the quality conditions of our lakes, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters so that the quality requirements of all users are adequately catered for.</P>
    <P>I have said that our water resources are relatively free of pollution.  While surveys have shown this to be the case, they have also indicated that localised pollution, serious in places, is occurring.  The most comprehensive quality survey of our waters has been the national survey of Irish rivers carried out by the water resources division of An Foras Forbartha.  In April, 1972, An Foras published a report on the water quality survey of rivers carried out in 1971.  This initial survey covered the main water systems in the country&mdash;121 rivers to a total length of nearly 3,000 kilometres. The results showed that 7 per cent of the total length of rivers surveyed was in bad condition; a further 10 per cent was classified as doubtful and the remainder was found to be satisfactory.  Some special attention was paid in the survey to river stretches in which pollution was known to be a problem, it is probable that water quality in the great lengths of main river channel which were not surveyed would generally be satisfactory. In 1972-73 An Foras Forbartha carried out further chemical investigations into the quality of stretches of rivers, total length 400 km, almost all of which were found to be unsatisfactory in the earlier survey.  The results of these investigations were published in April, 1974.  They show that 14 of the stretches examined were reasonably <Col N="21" /> satisfactory, 15 were satisfactory only part of the time and seven were in a polluted condition.</P>
    <P>These surveys indicate that most of the serious pollution occurs in stretches of rivers downstream of urban areas and industrial enterprises that most of the pollution encountered is organic in nature and that toxic conditions&mdash;caused, for example, by the presence of heavy metals&mdash;occur in only a few cases.</P>
    <P>In addition to the surveys of rivers, An Foras Forbartha also carried out a preliminary survey of 53 lakes, the results of which were published in May, 1975.  The purpose of the survey, which was the first overall examination of lakes on a systematic basis, was to make a tentative assessment of the extent of enrichment of the more important and representative lakes in the country.  While the survey did not attempt a definitive assessment of the position in particular lakes, it indicated that certain lakes are showing indications of, or tendencies towards, excessive enrichment.  An Foras Forbartha have commenced more detailed studies of selected lakes.</P>
    <P>The fact that despite increasing urban growth and industrialisation our waters are still relatively free from pollution is due in part to the expanded sanitary services programme undertaken in recent years and partly to the control of new development operated by planning authorities.  It was possible to achieve a measure of co-ordination of development with new sewerage schemes, to require development proposals to incorporate measures to prevent pollution, or even to refuse permission for development which would give rise to pollution. However, the 1963 Planning Act was not designed specifically to deal with all aspects of pollution control and it has been evident for some time that other existing statutory provisions, many of which date back to the last century, are inadequate.  If we are to provide essential safeguards against the ever-increasing threat of water pollution we need specific legislation.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I expect that the main principles of this Bill will find general acceptance by all parties. Many of the Bill's provisions will be <Col N="22" /> readily identified as emanating from recommendations of an inter-departmental working group established in 1970 and whose report, entitled <i>Report on Water Pollution</i>, was published in March, 1973.  Comments on the working group's recommendations were submitted by a number of interested bodies and all these views were carefully considered prior to the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that while there was general agreement on the type of measures required to control water pollution there was, and may still be, some difference of opinion on the issue of who should administer the new controls.  The working group came out strongly in favour of control at local level being operated by county and county borough councils. The alternatives which have been considered are control by a national board or by regional or river authorities, possibly as part of a general responsibility for management of water resources on a national or catchment basis.</P>
    <P>While it could be said that such boards would approach the problems of water pollution in a single-minded way, an arrangement of this kind could give rise to serious conflicts at both policy and practical levels, separated as it would be from the general system for planning and control of development, which has a fundamental relationship to the problem of water pollution.  Water pollution is a side-effect of development and I am satisfied that there are compelling arguments for integrating the arrangements for dealing with water pollution as closely as possible with the physical planning system.</P>
    <P>Such an approach requires a system of water pollution control which would be operated by local authorities under the aegis of the Minister for Local Government.  Furthermore, local authorities have responsibility for other important aspects of water resource management, that is provision of water supplies and sewage disposal. The vesting in local authorities of responsibility for water pollution control would therefore facilitate an integrated approach to overall water resource management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" /> As I have already suggested, I believe that the environment and the development process can co-exist in harmony provided the necessary constraints are understood and applied.  It seems to me that this will be best assured if there is a comprehensive and integrated evaluation of development proposals as is possible only within the local government system. If the evaluation is fragmented, with separate bodies responsible for particular pollution control or other aspects, and for these aspects only, it seems clear that the whole control system will become more complex and burdensome, that new problems of liaison and co-ordination will be introduced, and that the risks of unnecessary conflict and delay will be greatly increased, to the benefit neither of the environment nor of the economy.  I am not convinced that there would be advantages to compensate for these difficulties or to warrant the costs involved in setting up and operating new control structures at this stage.</P>
    <P>A study of arrangements operated in other countries for pollution control reveals no uniform approach to the question.  Different systems are used by different countries.  The important consideration for us is to adopt a system suited to our particular needs and which will function effectively, having regard to the organisational and planning framework within which it will have to operate.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the arguments in favour of vesting the main control functions, as the Bill proposes, in local authorities are entirely conclusive.  This approach is also in line with the Government's objectives in relation to development of local government.  It is recognised however that circumstances may change and may in the future strengthen the case for different or additional structures either in general or in particular cases.  As I shall explain, the Bill includes provisions to meet that eventuality as well.</P>
    <P>Some particular criticisms of local authorities as the future controllers of water pollution are predictable.  It may be alleged that they have not <Col N="24" /> been very successful in controlling pollution in the past, that they themselves are among the main polluters and that their functional areas are not suitable as they do not coincide with river basins.</P>
    <P>These arguments are not well-founded. In regard to their past performance it is only fair to point out that local authorities had no specific statutory responsibility to control water pollution and lacked the necessary powers to take effective action.  As to pollution caused by local authority sewerage schemes it must be borne in mind that local authorities had of necessity to concentrate in the past on provision of basic drainage facilities for housing and industrial development due to the limited capital which could be made available for the sanitary services programme.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are however more than anxious to put their own houses in order.  For many years now all new sewage disposal systems have incorporated treatment facilities to avoid pollution.  Remedial works have been carried out to many older systems which were giving rise to pollution problems and in appropriate cases the schemes have been designed to enable tertiary treatment to be added if this is shown to be necessary.  Further works are in progress and planning is well advanced for a very substantial programme in the next few years.  As an example of such works the local authorities in the Dublin area have works in progress or recently completed costing approximately £20 million which have or will achieve significant improvements in conditions in the Dublin rivers and in the bay.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about areas is not an insurmountable one.  Provision is made in the Bill for co-ordinated action on a river catchment basis to be secured by consultation and co-operation, assisted where necessary by the preparation of water quality management plans.  There is of course also need for involvement of the various interests concerned at local level, including fishery, agricultural, health and other interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> In this connection I should mention that towards the end of last year it was suggested to local authorities that they should examine possibilities for co-ordination of action with other interests within catchments or groups of catchments. This suggestion has resulted in the setting up of informal co-ordination committees for catchments in a number of areas.  The Bill takes account of the possibility that further development of the arrangements for water pollution control may become desirable at some future stage and includes a reserve power which could be used, if the need arises, to set up water quality control authorities in respect of catchments or suitable groups of catchments which, due to their size or configuration, might give rise to special problems.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this aspect of the matter I should say that the Government have set up an inter-departmental environment committee whose functions include the co-ordination of the activities of the various Departments concerned with environmental matters. In so far as water pollution is concerned the machinery is therefore already available to secure any necessary co-ordination at national level.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the Minister's role under the Bill will be mainly a supervisory one and that the implementation of national policy on water pollution control will be secured mainly through the issue of general advice and guidance to the local control authorities.  The Minister will however have important powers enabling him to take effective action if this should become necessary&mdash;for example, by requiring alternation of water quality management plans or by establishing special water quality control authorities.  He will also be empowered to prescribe quality standards and to require local authorities and boards of conservators to consult with each other and with other bodies as necessary in relation to the performance of functions under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the discharge of his functions and responsibilities the Minister will have the advice of a water pollution advisory council.  Such a council has already been set up on an informal <Col N="26" /> basis.  All relevant interests, including industrial, agricultural, fishery, professional, scientific, voluntary and local authority interests in addition to the Government Departments and semi-State bodies concerned, are represented on the present council.  The Minister has also set up a technical expert group to advise him on questions of water quality and effluent standards.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with any of the detailed provisions of the Bill I should explain that this particular piece of legislation has important international and EEC implications.  It will facilitate compliance with the Paris Conventon for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land Based Sources, to which this country is a contracting party, as well as obligations arising under the EEC Programme of Action on the Environment, which was adopted in November, 1973.  To date a number of important proposals relating to water quality have been processed by the Community under this programme. These include a directive on the quality of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water and a directive on the quality of bathing waters. Considerable progress has been made towards finalising a directive on the discharge of dangerous substances into the aquatic environment.</P>
    <P>There is also the Community's recommendation on the &ldquo;polluter pays principle&rdquo;, which outlines a common approach to the application of the principle in pollution control.  The essence of the principle is that the person responsible for pollution should bear the cost involved in eliminating it or in reducing it to an acceptable level.  The principle is reflected in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill goes into a fair amount of detail and I will confine myself at this stage to summarising the more important provisions.  These include the introduction of a system of licensing of discharges of trade and certain sewage effluents to waters, including inland waters, tidal waters and the <Col N="27" /> sea.  The licensing system will apply to effluent from any works, apparatus, plant or drainage pipe used for the disposal to waters of liquid waste discharged from premises used for any trade or industry.  It will not apply to discharges to tidal waters from vessels or marine structures.</P>
    <P>The licensing authority in the case of an administrative county, including any urban areas situated therein, will be the county council and in the case of a county borough, the corporation of the county borough.  A county council or county borough corporation will be empowered to grant a licence, subject to or without conditions, or to refuse to grant a licence. Licences will be subject to review at intervals of not less than three years or at any time in certain circumstances, such as where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the discharge is a significant threat to public health.</P>
    <P>Any person will have a right of appeal to the Minister against the grant or refusal of a licence, the terms of a licence or a decision on review of a licence.  It is intended to consider having an appropriate amendment introduced to this Bill at a suitable stage to provide that appeals will be determined by An Bord Pleanála, instead of by the Minister, if and when the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973, which provides for the establishment of An Bord Pleanála, is enacted.</P>
    <P>The licensing system will apply to both existing and new discharges.  In the case of existing discharges it is proposed that where application is made before a date to be fixed by order the discharge may continue to be made without a licence until such time as the local authority concerned decides to grant or refuse a licence.  This will enable a flexible approach to be adopted in the case of existing discharges.</P>
    <P>While discharges from public sewers will be exempted from the licensing provisions of the Bill, the Minister will be empowered to make regulations for the prescription of quality standards for, among other things, effluents from public sewers. <Col N="28" /> The effect of any regulations made in respect of sewage effluent from a public sewer or in respect of waters into which such effluent discharges would be to place a statutory duty on the sanitary authority concerned to take steps as soon as practicable to ensure that the effluent does not contravene the regulations.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes a general prohibition on the entry of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to waters. The prohibition will not apply to trade or sewerage effluents, which will be subject to the proposed licensing system, the entry of matter from vessels or marine structures to tidal waters or to discharges or deposits which are authorised under various enactments.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends to discharges from agricultural activities.  The position in this respect is that agricultural waste, unless it is discharged from any apparatus, plant or drainage pipe used for the disposal to waters of such waste, will not be subject to the proposed licensing procedure.  Most agricultural liquid waste&mdash;for example, slurry&mdash;is collected and stored in tanks, for subsequent spreading on the land. Any overflow from storage tanks, leaching from silage pits, runoff from farm yards and so on which is not actually piped to waters would not constitute a licensable effluent under the Bill. Instead, such discharges would be covered by the general prohibition on the discharge of poisonous, noxious or polluting matter to waters.  The relevant section however provides that it shall be a good defence to a prosecution for the person charged to show that he has taken all reasonable care to prevent the discharge.  I might mention that the main remedy for pollution arising from certain agricultural operations, such as slurry spreading, will probably lie in the further development of advisory and educational services in this field, including the agricultural advisory services.</P>
    <P>The Bill also introduces a system of licensing of discharges of trade effluent or matter, other than domestic sewage or storm water, to sewers <Col N="29" /> on the same general lines as the licensing system for discharges of trade and sewage effluent to waters. In this case the licensing authority will be the sanitary authority in which the sewer concerned is vested.</P>
    <P>As regards enforcement, the provisions of the Bill include power for local authorities to take steps to prevent an unauthorised or prohibited entry or discharge, to remedy the effects of such an entry or discharge and to recover the cost of such steps from the person responsible, together with realistic penalties.  Special provision is made for action in cases of urgency&mdash;for example, removal of oil following an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be obliged to carry out such monitoring and analysis of discharges and receiving waters as may be necessary for the performance of their functions or as may be directed by the Minister.  They will also of course have the necessary powers of entry and inspection.  It is envisaged that programmes for monitoring of receiving waters will be co-ordinated on a catchment area basis. The local authority monitoring will also be co-ordinated with any monitoring programmes carried out by other bodies, for example, An Foras Forbartha. In this connection I should mention that the main activities which will be generated by the Bill, including monitoring, laboratory work, and so on, are being examined in the Department with a view to holding discussions with local authorities on the subject.</P>
    <P>Another important provision of the Bill is that which enables county and county borough councils to make water quality management plans.  It is intended that initially such plans will be made for important catchments only.  They will contain objectives for prevention and abatement of pollution of the waters concerned and the necessary informational framework for the proper quality management of the waters.  They will therefore form the blueprint against which decisions on water quality issues in the catchment or catchments concerned will be taken.  Provision is included for the periodic variation or replacement of a plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I have already touched on the need for a co-ordinated approach on a catchment basis to overall quality management of water resources by the various interests involved.  Under section 23 the Minister will be empowered, following consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Industry and Commerce, to require local authorities and boards of conservators to consult one another or other interested parties in relation to the performance of any function under the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is an important provision. Apart from local authorities there are other bodies at local level with a special interest in water pollution. Chief among these are the boards of conservators.  Due account is taken in the Bill of the need to facilitate and assist the boards in the protection of fisheries.  Apart from the consultative provision, they will be empowered to take prosecutions and appropriate enforcement action.</P>
    <P>The Bill will repeal the Rivers Pollution Prevention Acts, 1876 and 1893, and also the licensing and related provisions of the Fisheries Acts, that is, sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which are being replaced by the control provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make any further comment at this stage other than to say that the provisions of the Bill are aimed at providing a reasonably flexible statutory basis for control of water pollution backed up by realistic penalties and effective enforcement procedures.  When we come to consider the detailed provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage, some of which are fairly technical and complex, I will be glad to give full consideration to any worth-while suggestions for improvements which may be put forward.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has said in his concluding paragraph this is a complex Bill.  Any measure which would propose to control or deal effectively with water pollution would have to be a complex piece of legislation.  A clear indication <Col N="31" /> of that is the size of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech and the amount of data it contains.  Over the past few years everybody has become aware that we have here a water pollution problem.  This situation is in keeping with every other European country, although not to the same extent.  Being an island on the periphery of Europe we can expect to have an increasing volume of pollution problems as years go by.  We can also expect to have more and more problems as we endeavour to introduce new industries to this country, whether it be in the plastics sector, man-made fibre products, or whether it be in the oil exploration efforts which are taking place at present.  All those new enterprises bring with them many new problems which were unheard of years ago in this country.  Being an island and a large exporter of domestic and industrial goods it is natural that we have a very high tonnage of shipping in and out of our ports.  As we strive to develop our fishing industry, we can expect to have a greater amount of water pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am resident in an inland county, County Westmeath.  It is a county which has many lakes of high scenic and tourist value.  In many recent reports of An Foras Forbartha and the other pollution committees our lakes have been listed as badly polluted lakes.  I should mention that this pollution has taken place because some of our towns were allowed to grow and develop faster than our sewerage treatment plants were developed.  The town of Mullingar disposes of its sewage into one of our most beautiful lakes, Lough Ennel.  We have all heard and read a great deal in recent times about the pollution problems affecting that lake.  It has been put down to the fact that the town of Mullingar had an old sewerage system which was inadequate to deal with the expansion of the area.  The result of that has been that life in that lake is now practically extinct and corrective measures taken by the Westmeath County Council have failed to deal effectively and fully with the problem.  It was hoped that the Minister for Local Government would <Col N="32" /> have been in a position to allocate further money to that council to instal an effective treatment plant which would eliminate the pollution in that area.  Killarney was successful in securing the money made available and the result is that Lough Ennel must still be regarded as a lake which is polluted.</P>
    <P>Pollution affects us in many, many ways.  It affects our fishing.  It affects the tourists who come here to enjoy our lakes and rivers, to bathe in our waters and to fish our waters.  They have been a valuable source of revenue.  When this country is badly in need of revenue from outside sources tourism was always one source that we could rely on to guarantee us revenue from abroad.  The tourist benefited our agricultural industry. The tourist benefited our hotel industry. The tourist came to see our country, enjoy the scenery, the food and the hospitality of the Irish people.  It is very, very easy for some foreign journalist to insert an article in some foreign paper exploiting the situation with regard to pollution here.  It is, therefore, important that everybody involved in anti-pollution should work together to ensure the best possible legislation to guarantee against future pollution.</P>
    <P>In recent times many local authorities have begun to use lakes as a source of domestic water supply and therefore it is very important that lakes should be fully protected. It was stated earlier on that local authorities themselves were guilty of pollution.  That is so because any local authority which allowed sewage to discharge into our lakes would be directly responsible for pollution. Sewage disposal into rivers is not so dangerous because river waters are continuously moving and there is therefore not the same degree of pollution.  River waters are continuously moving out to the sea and that helps to alleviate some of the pollution problem.</P>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of the health of our people that we have a ready and pure supply of water available.  Local authorities have become more and more dependent <Col N="33" /> on our lakes for a water supply. We have had four consecutive relatively mild winters and that has affected the situation.  The low level of water in lakes and rivers and the lack of storms in recent years have to a certain extent affected the distortion rate which normally occurs under these waters.  If we have storms we have waves rising and falling and churning up the bottom of our lakes and rivers helping thereby to combat pollution to some extent.  Consideration must be given to the changing circumstances brought about by the change in climate.</P>
    <P>Every local authority should be asked to install the best possible sewage treatment system to ensure that effluent discharged into our lakes and rivers is of low pollution density, containing no deleterious organic matter capable of polluting our rivers and lakes.  We have always prided ourselves on our waterways.  We have always prided ourselves on their cleanliness and their freedom from pollution. I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that, as far as we are concerned, we will give him and his Department every co-operation in any methods necessary to ensure that the best possible water anti-pollution Bill becomes law and that its implementation will take place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal recently about pollution in Dublin Bay.  I am not fully competent to deal with that because I do not reside in Dublin but others may be able to deal with that at greater length and in more detail.  I am concerned about the pollution of our lakes and rivers which have been such a wonderful tourist attraction.  I believe more money should be made available to all local authorities to help them in their efforts to control pollution and more money should be made available to local authorities to help them carry out surveys with the aid of a pollution detection team.  If ruthless industrialists or private individuals allow noxious effluent to be discharged into our lakes and rivers we must have some form of vigilant committee to ensure the discontinuance of indiscriminate dumping of noxious effluents into our rivers and lakes.  That <Col N="34" /> is the biggest problem we seem to have at the moment.  This is going on, I believe, here in Dublin in a big way. It is going on in the country.  It is going on everywhere.</P>
    <P>We have had a reputation of having pollution free waters.  It was stated that our waters were the most pollution free in all Europe.  I believe that is so, but the situation is slowly but surely changing.  I assure the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I am glad that it is he who is piloting this Bill&mdash;that we will co-operate to the fullest extent in ensuring that we have the best possible anti-pollution Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in issuing a welcome to this very important measure and I should like to commend the Parliamentary Secretary for his very wide-ranging speech on the contents of the Bill.  I think I am correct in saying that this is the Parliamentary Secretary's first appearance in the Seanad since he assumed office and I would like to bid him a warm welcome which, I am sure, will be shared by all Members of the House.  The measure which we are considering here today is the Local Government (Water Pollution) Bill, 1976.  It follows on, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, three very important reports issued during the past four or five years.  I refer to the report of the inter-departmental working group in 1971, a general report on water pollution which appeared in 1973 and the two reports by An Foras Forbartha in 1972 which covered 171 rivers and a further report in 1975 which covered 53 lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first sight it would appear that we have little to worry about judging by the fact that in the Foras Forbartha report of 1973 only 7 per cent of the total length of rivers surveyed was in a bad condition, a further 10 per cent was classified as doubtful and the remainder was found to be satisfactory. I suppose there are very few countries in the world, certainly very few industrialised countries that could boast of such a pollution free situation in their rivers and lakes.  We would, however, be very foolish were we to allow ourselves to be lulled into <Col N="35" /> a sense of satisfaction by these statistics because now is the time to prevent polution on our lakes and rivers in which we take such an enormous pride and which contribute so much to the wealth of this country, both in terms of environment and also in terms of tourism.  We must also ensure that our water supplies are of the highest possible standard particularly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Parliamentary Secretary during the course of his address said&mdash;it is important in a Bill such as this to keep a sense of balance &mdash;that environment and development processes can co-exist in harmony provided the necessary constraints are understood and applied.  That is a very important statement because there is always a danger that in our enthusiasm for worthy measures we may overreach and, in fact, do more harm than good.  In recent years anti-pollution, ecology and environmental controls have become very emotive terms and I cannot help thinking that occasionally there is a lack of balance, if no lack of enthusiasm, on the part of some of the proponents of anti-pollution control.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about this. We must have industrial development and more processing industries if we are to provide for our young people, particularly our talented young people coming out of universities and technical and technological colleges.  With the best will in the world we are not going to employ them looking at beautiful scenery or fishing in lovely lakes and, if there had to be a harsh decision, I would far rather see our youth looking at what might be described as a blot on our countryside rather than have them looking at a similar blot in Birmingham, Heuston or somewhere else in the world.  There is no reason why we should have to face a harsh choice and, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out, there is no reason why proper environmental control cannot go hand in hand with necessary industrial development. For this reason it was no help to read in one of our national papers this morning what I would describe as a scare bannerline, &ldquo;Hands off Shannon&rdquo;, <Col N="36" /> following on the decision&mdash;in my view, a very proper decision&mdash;the Minister for Local Government prohibiting the erection of an oil refinery in Dublin Bay.  We must be sensible about these things.  We must at least have an opportunity of looking at the proposed development whether it be on the Shannon, the Lee or anywhere else, and decide on the merits of the case.  All local authorities are very much alive to the necessity of imposing the strictest environmental controls on all types of industrial development. The same is true of harbour authorities, as I can testify from personal experience.</P>
    <P>We have got to take a balanced view in these things.  We must be realistic and not have blanket refusals or a blanket outlook on industrial development, particularly major industrial development, which of its very nature can constitute some degree of pollution.  We are going to have some degree of pollution.  Our efforts should be directed towards controlling pollution and reducing pollution, whether it be water or air pollution or pollution in our streets, to the absolute bearable minimum. The most desirable goal, of course, would be no pollution at all.  We are very far from realising that ideal but that should not stop us ensuring that industrial development, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, goes hand in hand with proper and rigid environmental control.  The two are not incompatible and I am very glad that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that.  It is something that should sink into all of us here in this House.</P>
    <P>I am glad too that the Minister decided that the proper authority to administer water anti-pollution schemes is the local authority.  There is an advantage in the smaller entity. The smaller statutory local body with its publicly elected representatives is the best body to deal with matters which are to a large extent local and concern local people.  I would, however, suggest that consideration might be given where consultation is taking place with contiguous local authorities, to utilising the regional development <Col N="37" /> organisations.  I am fully aware that regional development organisations have no statutory basis.  I am one of the Members of this House and the other House who have represented to the Minister that regional development organisations should be put on a statutory basis to deal with regional matters and that, rather than taking responsibility from a smaller local authority, responsibility should be developed on the regional development organisation from the central Government.  In this way we would have an effective regional system and, at the same time we would not be interfering with the established rights of smaller authorities and we would be doing something to put into practical effect something most of us over the years have talked about, namely, the devolution of authority and the advantage in smaller bodies doing certain tasks and having certain responsibilities.  This would be a practical step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I notice as I am sure most Senators have noticed, that this Bill contains, what the Parliamentary Secretary described as realistic penalties for transgressing the controls set out in the Bill.  They are certainly realistic.  In some cases they are very substantial penalties indeed, but I would like to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to what seems to be an anomaly in the Bill.  It seems to me something will have to be done to bring into line with the type of penalties set out in this Bill the penalties provided in the Harbours Act, 1946, and I refer specifically to section 88.</P>
    <P>I might mention that section 3 of the Bill specifically excludes dumping in harbours under the authority of harbour authorities or any works done by harbour authorities in their harbour. It is interesting to note&mdash;this of course is a pretty old Act, 1946, quite a few years ago now&mdash;that section 88 (2) has a provision with regard to ships dumping in harbours and at times ships can dump extremely noxious waste, causing damage and pollution. A person who contravenes subsection (1) by dumping ballast, ashes, stones or any other substance or thing <Col N="38" /> into waters within the limits of a harbour unless the harbour authority for the harbour have authorised him to do so will be liable to a fine of £10.  The penalty for what could be a serious offence, particularly with modern shipping, is a fine not exceeding £10.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary this is wholly out of line with the sort of stiff fines set out in this Bill. But it is obvious that the Minister for Local Government's colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power at some date&mdash;and I think the sooner the better since we are now considering the whole question of water pollution &mdash;must introduce an amendment to the 1946 Act to bring the penalties into line and to give the necessary controls to harbour authorities to ensure that pollution will not take place in harbours under their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Here again I want to refer for a moment to the question of industrial development.  It is notable, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech, that most of water pollution&mdash;in fact, I think I am correct in saying practically all the water pollution&mdash;has taken place and is still taking place in the vicinity of urban areas or where there is industrial development. This is, if you like, a repetition of experience in Britain from the Industrial Revolution onwards, 200 years ago, and it is obviously right and proper at this stage of our still comparatively meagre industrial development that we should be fully alive to what happened in Britain and other industrialised countries over the past 200 years and particularly during the 19th century.  But we should also be mindful of the fact that during the last 100 years and more tremendous technological and scientific development has taken place in industry itself.</P>
    <P>We have seen photographs and films of pollution in certain parts of industrial England and I do not blame the people for using these in an effort to stop the erection of an industry in some area or other.  We should, however, be alive to the fact that in modern industry what are called objectionable industries, if you like, are very far removed from what the situation was 100 years ago.  We should take these <Col N="39" /> facts into consideration.  It is no good frightening the public by producing highly coloured films of an industry established perhaps 60, 80 or more years ago.  Admittedly they caused untold damage to the environment in Britain and in other countries.  Modern industry, with its controls and its different systems of providing energy, is a far less lethal construction as compared with its predecessors in the past century.  I am not trying to find excuses for modern industry.  Modern industry has got to be controlled.  It is very desirable.  It gives employment.  It provides a future for the highly trained boys or girls coming out of technical or technological college.  At the same time we must keep a sense of balance. Possibly one of the most important steps in conjunction with the introduction of this measure would be a campaign to make the public more aware of the vital necessity to preserve the environment, of which they are the heirs, and to hand it on to succeeding generations as good as, if not better, than they found it.  I would like to think that this would begin, first of all, in the home and, secondly, in the schools and thereafter through various organisations like An Taisce which, although from time to time perhaps some of us have been critical of An Taisce, has done amazingly good work since it was established and I would like to take this opportunity of paying it that tribute.  At times it has been accused of blocking industrial development. Perhaps they have been over-zealous at times and possibly unrealistic but I think nobody will contradict the fact that they have a huge measure of enthusiasm and wish to conserve our environment as a worth-while environment and a lovely country.  They must be commended for that.</P>
    <P>I notice this measure, like preceding measures on which I have commented, contains that obnoxious power giving the Minister the right to remove the chairman or any other members of the proposed water pollution advisory council.  I want to record once again my opposition to that.  I know it will fall on deaf ears but I intend to go on opposing it. <Col N="40" /> Again, you have the provision where a man cannot offer himself to the electorate without giving up his position on some semi-State body. That is also completely wrong.  I lump the two in the same category.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the composition of the board and I am glad to see that it will contain a number of experts engaged in and with a knowledge of different facets of pollution, particularly water pollution.  I think this is vitally necessary and I hope when the Minister appoints the members of this proposed water pollution advisory council he will not be influenced by any considerations other than selecting the best, most expert and most competent people because these will be the people advising local authorities who will not have the necessary expertise themselves and will have to rely on advice from this proposed water pollution advisory council.  It is essential that this proposed measure should get off on the right track, with first-class and highly expert, even if we have to go outside this country, men on the council, whoever they may be or wherever they may come from.  There is one little point to which I must refer.  We are told:</P>
    <P>Licences will be issued by the local authority in whose functional area discharge takes place.</P>
    <P>I can see certain difficulties arising there.  Take a stretch of river like the Shannon estuary where you have four contiguous local authorities.  A local authority in whose area an industry was established might in good faith, or in ignorance, issue a licence to discharge into the estuary.  The resultant damage might not necessarily be done in the particular stretch of the estuary contiguous to that licensing authority. It could be done further down the estuary.  This could happen in the Shannon Estuary which has a high rise and fall.  This strengthens the case for the strictest co-ordination and co-operation between various local authorities who share a common natural amenity like the Shannon.  I suggest that the regional development organisations might be considered for tasks of this type.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> The Bill deals mainly with local authorities and spillages.  Section 14 imposes an obligation on the person responsible for an accidental spillage to notify as soon as possible the local authority in whose area the spillage occurs.  This again puts an obligation on the individual, perhaps a house-owner, where something goes wrong with the sewerage, to notify the authorities. Public representatives will have experienced on a number of occasions disagreement between a local authority and the individual or individuals concerned as to who was responsible for a particular leakage or offence.  It can be quite a long time before the responsible party is pinpointed.</P>
    <P>In implementing the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, great care, common sense and reasonableness must be used.  I can see situations arising where an enthusiastic local authority, desiring to clear up an unsatisfactory situation regarding water pollution, might cause damage to old established industries.  There is provision that until such time as a licence has been issued, a factory will be permitted to operate.  I suggest that a better system might be applied. When an inspection is carried out and pollution is found to occur through lack of responsible action by a factory or individual, some system of warning should be given and a reasonable period allowed to put the matter right.  If necessary, not only expertise or technical assistance but financial aid should be given.</P>
    <P>We all know of instances in our own areas of certain types of industries who are finding it difficult enough to survive at present without having to incur perhaps substantial outlay on the installation of controls to eliminate pollution.  This provision must be exercised very carefully otherwise it could do a great deal of damage and possibly make a very necessary measure unpopular and bring it into disrepute. I would favour a warning system, first of all, and after a reasonable period of time a follow-up.  Some provision might be made for a temporary licence.</P>
    <P>In connection with licences, I should like to see provision made for a review at a period shorter than three years. <Col N="42" /> A lot of damage can be caused in three years.  The Parliamentary Secretary might have another look at that question.  At the same time, industrialists and business people should not be annoyed by regular examinations which would drive them to despair. However, in the interests of environmental control, three years in certain cases might be too long a time, or, on the other hand, it might be too short a time.  Some provision might be made for shortening this period.</P>
    <P>Any other comments I have to make might be more appropriately made on Committee Stage.  I welcome the Bill and consider it a very worth-while and important measure.  It is something which will influence environmental control in this country for many years to come.  I hope the provisions will be carried out efficiently but with common sense and consideration, particularly in regard to old-established industries which may be finding it difficult to operate at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary on his first visit to Seanad Éireann in an official capacity, at least during this period of office.  He may have been here before when he held office previously. It is always a pleasure to see him. He is not a person with whom I consistently agree on every issue but as a professional politician he has few equals and I am delighted to welcome him here.</P>
      <P>This is the second piece of environmental legislation which has been introduced by the Government who committed themselves in the election programme to the major reform of legislation concerning the environment. I suppose one can say that two pieces of legislation are better than none.  With regard to the drafting of legislation dealing with the environment for which there has been no precedent, I should like to quote from a document, the title of which I will give later:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Report of the Inland Fisheries Commission (1975) referred to &ldquo;the growing menace of pollution&rdquo;. Even more recently, the 1975-76 Annual Report of the Inland Fisheries Trust has shown <Col N="43" /> disturbing increases in water pollution over the past several years. Pollution sources had risen from 42 in 1972 to 63 in 1975.  In the light of this worsening situation, it would be charitable to describe the Government's progress in environment legislation as slow.  More rapid, and more determined action is needed.</P>
    <P>This quotation comes from a document prepared by the Fine Gael Branch at Trinity College, a Report on Water Pollution presented to the Minister for Local Government in connection with this Bill.  It is one of a series of papers produced by the Fine Gael student branch dealing with the environment.  Most of the points they make are very constructive. I do not agree with them all but the students have done a great deal of work and I hope it will be recognised by their party. They have done the spadework, they have got the figures, put them in documentary form and have submitted them to the Ministers concerned. I hope that their consistent work&mdash;this is about the third or fourth of these documents&mdash;will be recognised by the Ministers and they will receive the credit from the party to which they belong.  That is the sort of political involvement we want to see.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary has had some connection with them.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this legislation in the broad sense of the term.  As Senator Russell has pointed out there are problems of compromise.  There are established industries discharging effluent and this legislation will certainly curb some of their operations. There are also problems connected with industries which have not yet been set up.  In that connection, the work done by the IDA in imposing necessary controls to be observed before grants are made available is a very praiseworthy way of dealing with the problem.  Of course, as everybody knows, prevention is better than cure in the sort of situation which we are considering.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> It would not be right to think that the situation in this country was the best in Europe, that we were free from pollution, that we had not got any problems.  My view on the Rivers Lee and Liffey is that they are a national disgrace.  They are polluted to an extent not seen in most cities of the same size and the same degree of industrialisation in other European countries.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that there is a big scheme under way in Dublin costing £20 million and another big scheme in progress in Cork, costing something less than that, it is sad to say, but it is true, that the problem of the treatment of domestic sewage in both Dublin and Cork has been gravely neglected over the years. The state of the two rivers and the smell which one gets in Dublin and Cork at low tide is evidence of the neglect the authorities involved have been guilty of for the past 100 years.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the situation in the small Irish towns and contrasts it with the situation in Northern Ireland one sees how far behind we are.  Virtually every village and town of any size in Northern Ireland has its own modern sewage treatment plant.  This can be said of very few towns of any size in the Republic. My own town of Midleton discharges its sewage into the Lee Estuary and at low tide it is apparent that there is no proper sewerage treatment. There has been no drive over the years to get this under way, to ensure that local authorities had the finance and the will to establish proper local sewage treatment plants.  This means that we have a much greater problem of domestic sewerage than would appear from the people who have spoken heretofore in this debate.</P>
    <P>One cannot constantly ask that the Exchequer provide the money for all these schemes.  I feel that the money has to be raised locally.  In the case of many towns it would be an important move.  It would be an investment in better living.  The sooner local authorities set about doing this and the sooner the Government direct them to do something about it, the better. Otherwise we are facing an increasing <Col N="45" /> number of intolerable situations even in towns of quite a moderate size.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important and positive features of this Bill which I should like to list.  First, the establishment of a water advisory council; secondly, mechanisms for prosecution for water pollution; thirdly, the licensing system and a register of discharging agencies; fourthly, powers to stop pollution urgently in serious cases; fifthly, notice of discharges and the obligation to give information; sixthly, the proposals for water policy management plans and seventh, water policy control authorities which can be set up by virtue of this legislation and the powers of entry and inspection of places or agencies where there is a danger of a pollution problem.</P>
    <P>I support all these measures and I hope to be able during the course of the Bill to help to amend the legislation in a positive way so that it becomes more efficient and tighter and so that it will do the job we want it to do.  This legislation will not involve political controversy.  It will be supported by all parties and, I am sure, also by the Independent Members.  It is our duty to strengthen it and I hope the Government will respond by getting it on the Statute Book at the earliest possible date because it is of tremendous importance.</P>
    <P>The effluent that flows into our lakes and rivers can be divided into three distinct categories: domestic effluent, to which I have referred, industrial effluent and agricultural effluent.  It is appropriate that the categories of industrial and agricultural effluent should be dealt with separately.  The Bill provides stricter control for pollution by industrial effluent.  In a sense it is easier to measure this because the number of points of discharge is small, and it is generally easy enough to observe in a river and to trace the source of discharge.  There will be fish and marine life above the source and below the source there will be dead fish, dead plant life and so on.  Therefore it is easy to pinpoint the industrial discharge problem.  However, we have to compromise.  We want industrial development. Hopefully, we face a period when industries such as mining, <Col N="46" /> offshore oil and gas will develop to a significant extent.  We want to ensure that they will not have disastrous effects on our environment.</P>
    <P>The licensing system is a step in the right direction, but I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a number of questions concerned with the discharge of industrial effluent.  As far as I can see this legislation specifically excludes offshore discharge.  I am not clear on the legislation on the Statute Book at present which deals with offshore discharge by industrial agencies, such as oil rigs, gas pumping stations underneath the sea and so on.  It is a problem we will have to face and we should have proper legislation to deal with it.  The Parliamentary Secretary should say something about that.  We should have at least in outline some legislation prepared to deal with problems which could arise from offshore effluent, particularly that which may arise from the oil and gas industry.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the mining industry the discharge is mainly underground discharge.  I cannot see that the discharge into underground strata is covered by the definitions in section 1.  It does not seem to me that discharge into water contained in underground strata is covered.  This is important because in the mining industry this discharge is likely to happen.  It is a difficult thing to detect but that does not mean we should not legislate for it.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to amend the definition in page 3 of the Bill, line 25, to include the words &ldquo;water contained in underground strata&rdquo;.  In fact, he may be able to argue that that water is covered.  It is specifically mentioned in equivalent legislation elsewhere.  It is specifically mentioned in the Northern Ireland Water Act, 1972.  It might strengthen the Bill to insert the words &ldquo;water contained in underground strata&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We passed legislation a number of years ago to establish a nuclear energy board with a view to establishing nuclear power stations.  There should be a section in the Bill dealing with nuclear waste, or it should be included in the types of effluent mentioned in the Bill.  If we have an industry <Col N="47" /> which uses nuclear fission products, something should be done to legislate for the effects of pollution by nuclear energy plant.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems connected with the discharge of domestic sewage, the main one being that the local authority who are responsible for the treatment of the sewage and for the erection of proper treatment plant will be the body which will be prosecuting those who are in breach of this legislation.  The authority may be, in the widest sense of the term, the body actually causing the offence by inaction.  I am basically in favour of the idea of developing statutory power to local authorities and giving them the power to prosecute.  What happens in a situation like the one Senator Keegan has referred to in Mullingar where, due to the outmoded method of treatment and discharge of sewage, the local authority are the body that are really to blame for the pollution problem?  On balance, the decision was right.  It is better to devolve the authority locally.  We have been urging this for some time.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>As far as industrial operations are concerned I am disappointed that the Bill does not contain a section which allows the making of regulations to control the abstraction of water from rivers.  This is more of a problem than the pouring of effluent back into the rivers.  Any industry of the type that would come under the aegis of this Bill would be an industry sited near water a source which would take in water and then discharge back into the river, lake or estuary.  This is one of the measures which is specifically set out in the Northern Ireland legislation. There is power given in that legislation to the Minister to make regulations controlling the extraction of water.  It is section 14 of the Northern Ireland Water Act, 1972. Perhaps the Minister might look at this carefully before Second Stage.  It is a tremendous problem.  Two problems face a new industry setting up in an area, one of discharge and one of abstraction.  Many industries use tremendous volumes of water.  It can be just as damaging to a stream to <Col N="48" /> abstract too large quantities of water as it can be to discharge effluent.  It can have just as disastrous an effect.</P>
    <P>The other type of discharge is the agricultural effluent.  This comes mainly from the run off from silage pits and slurry disposal.  We have been rather gentle with the farming community in this legislation.  I would have liked to have seen more teeth in the section which allows prosecution for flagrant breaches of what is an important part of this legislation. Quite an amount is known about the problem now.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the phrase that &ldquo;all reasonable care&rdquo; should be taken to prevent the discharge.  That is too nebulous a phrase.  For example, can a silage pit built 20 years ago, old, out of date and overused, be taken as satisfying the conditions of the Bill?  We have been too gentle on the farming community.  Those who would be liable for prosecution would be those with very large operations. Since fairly accurate chemical analyses have been done of the various animal waste discharges we could have been more forthright in setting out the part of the legislation which deals with agricultural discharge.</P>
    <P>In the latest report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, the 1974 annual report, there is an excellent article on this problem.  That article is written by Messrs Oliphant, Haddock and Johnson who are either Government officials in Northern Ireland or members of the Foyle Fisheries Commission. They carried out a survey in a region near Limavady of a mainly pastoral area.  There were problems in a large percentage of the farms visited.  The problems were either that the silage pits or the slurry pits were not appropriate to the volume of waste they were trying to handle or that there was no liquid manure spreader.  Many farmers may have had to borrow a liquid manure spreader from adjoining farms and because they could not get them in time there were overflow problems from the silage pits.</P>
    <P>They give a table here and I shall read out the figures from the table <Col N="49" /> given in this article comparing the poisonous content of the effluent from the various sources of waste.  The figures are given in biochemical oxygen demand in milligrams per litre, BOD, the standard way of measuring it.  The types of waste are: domestic sewage&mdash;350-600 milligrams per litre; silage effluent&mdash;12,000-65,000 milligrams per litre; pig manure&mdash;17,000-21,000 milligrams per litre; cattle manure&mdash;4,000-15,000 milligrams per litre; and poultry manure&mdash;42,000 milligrams per litre. These figures compared to domestic sewerage figures are pretty high.  The effluent run-off from farms can be very poisonous and harmful.  I am rather disappointed that the Minister has not been a bit tougher with the farmers where this is concerned.  I agree that more education, greater realisation of the dangers and more help with the farm advisory system in obtaining the right type of machinery, the right design of the silage and slurry pits are all factors that are important.  For flagrant breaches of the legislation there should be prosecution.  I am not sure that this legislation has enough teeth in that regard.</P>
    <P>Having referred to the Foyle Commission I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the Foyle Fisheries Commission are one of the bodies which can prosecute under this Act?  I am sure he will know that we had to pass a special Bill so that the Foyle Fisheries Commission could prosecute under another Act only a couple of months ago.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission are excluded in the terms of this Act.  It is not one of the bodies covered.  It should be written into the Act.  It would be worth while looking at this before the Committee Stage because possibly it would avoid having to bring in other legislation if the Foyle Fisheries Commission was one of the stated bodies along with local authorities and so on.</P>
    <P>There is provision for the establishment of a water pollution advisory council which I welcome.  This is an important step forward.  The choice <Col N="50" /> of representatives on this council is one question that arises.  I should be worried if the Minister were to choose many representatives from representatives of the industries actually causing the pollution.  They could block any positive recommendations. After all, it is a water advisory council and its main function is to deal with pollution problems.  It must have people who are generally in favour of controlling pollution. Naturally, if there were many representatives of those who create pollution problems, they could effectively block the recommendations of this council.</P>
    <P>Later on in the Bill there is a provision for setting up a water quality control authority.  Again, it is a good provision.  In Cork and Dublin, the major cities, we should have these bodies established right away.  They will help to focus attention on the problem.  As I have argued in regard to many pieces of legislation, it is an important public relations exercise that people should know about the problems that their region faces&mdash; problems that Cork Harbour faces because of pollution from Cork city in the outlying areas and problems that Dublin Bay faces because of Dublin domestic sewerage being poured untreated into the Liffey and because of the industrial area around Dublin Bay causing effluent.  If people know about it and if they get the facts and figures straight then they will raise less objection to having to pay more.</P>
    <P>There is a very important reason for setting up these bodies: they will be bodies with a standing and should be able to give a picture of the problem. In Cork and Dublin the problem is very bad indeed.  Some of the money will have to be raised locally. You must tell the public why before you take the money from them; if you try to do it the other way round you will end up in trouble.</P>
    <P>In general, I am in favour of this legislation.  I hope the Government will get it through with the maximum speed consistent with genuine discussion. There is much to be said on the Committee Stage.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will look into <Col N="51" /> some of the points I have raised.  I shall put down some amendments for the Committee Stage of the Bill to deal with some of them: perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would consider doing likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>In Ireland we have for far too long taken the supply of clean water for granted.  Part of the reason for this may well be that we have a plentiful supply of rivers and lakes in our country.  We have a smallish population <i>vis-a-vis</i> a relatively smallish degree of urbanisation and industrialisation.  These things allied to a more than generous rainfall level have led us to believe that a clean water supply is something which was infinite in its source.  Like many other things which we have discovered regarding even the land on which we walk, it has a very finite resource indeed.  It is a finite resource whose saving lies in our own hands and in our own will to maintain it.</P>
      <P>We tend to turn a blind eye to its value, not only to the needs that we have for it but to its uses in the agricultural, industrial and amenity fields.  More and more we will feel a greater need for ensuring a clean water supply in the future.  As living standards will increase we will have a greater call upon a clean water supply and the demand on clean water will increase more than any increase in living standards.</P>
      <P>It is essential for us to protect our water resources.  Otherwise, we might find ourselves in a situation like the United Kingdom where cities like Manchester have to draw their water supply from far distant fields.  I think Manchester draws it from the Lake District.  We certainly do not want to see that kind of situation arising in Dublin or in this country.  There is no scarcity in recent years of surveys which have given rise to a certain amount of concern over water pollution. Reference has already been made to the An Foras Forbartha report which says that 7 per cent of rivers and lakes were classified as seriously polluted and 10 per cent of doubtful quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> There are other reports which it is no harm to mention.  The Industrial Development Authority Report, 1972, had something to say about inadequate sewerage schemes in Ireland.  It listed in all 18 coastal towns where the sewerage outflow goes into the sea. Breaking these down we find that six are in the north-eastern region, two in the north-west, two in Donegal, four in the west and four along the east coast.  This amounts to 18 coastal towns.  It does not account for sewage which reaches the sea from inland towns going downstream into the sea.</P>
    <P>In 1970 there was also a survey carried out of a number of industrial firms.  This survey showed that nearly half of the firms surveyed stated that their actual sewerage disposal arrangements were not subject to local authority or any statutory arrangements. It is a very pleasant feature of this legislation that local authorities are given very strengthened powers and remedial measures in this regard.  A local authority will be responsible for licensing as regards sewage inflows, as regards monitoring of water pollution levels, as regards devising of water quality plans.  It can also enter into co-ordination with other authorities to deal with water pollution on a catchment basis.</P>
    <P>These are all welcome additional responsibilities for local authorities. Hitherto they have had no statutory responsibility, indeed they have had little or no powers whatsoever with which to deal with water pollution. While I feel that we are giving additional powers to local authorities we must ensure that they have, first of all, the staff and resources with which to tackle these responsibilities.  It has been my experience in regard to the operation of the 1963 Planning Act that in far too many cases they have been found somewhat dilatory in coming to deal with abuses.  Unless we ensure in advance that they have qualified, and experienced and adequate staff numbers and that they have financial resources, they will have the same difficulties in tackling water pollution problems. Senator West makes reference to the wide field of water pollution and he itemises industrial, domestic and agricultural <Col N="53" /> pollution.  This is a very extensive field indeed and I am a bit doubtful whether local authorities as at present constituted will be able to cope adequately with this additional responsibility. I am sure that they will call upon the services of the regional development authorities who have been doing a lot of good advisory service work.  I feel these development organisations should be brought more into the play in regard to the tackling of water pollution.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the level of fines has been raised to something in the region of £250, and £100 for each consecutive day that the abuse continues. It is good to see the nonsense of the £10 a day fine done away with once and for all.  That was absolutely no deterrent to any large scale enterprise which could more or less cock its nose at such a fine and carry on with the abuse.  It is good also to see that the onus is now being placed on polluters, first of all to advise the local authority in the area even where there has been an accidental discharge of sewage.  In far too many cases we find nothing is done whatsoever about such an abuse and the local authority is left more or less running around in circles trying to find out the source of the outflow.</P>
    <P>But when all is said and done I think that, no matter what legislation we have on the books, no matter what powers and responsibilities we give to local authorities or to any other bodies, we come down to the need for public awareness of the dangers and the consequences of water pollution.  The Parliamentary Secretary in his fine speech made reference to the need in the future for having in the case of agriculture, education and proper advisory services geared towards the correction of any abuses as regards leakages from slurry pits and so on.  I think something similar will have to be done in regard to the public in general because the more aware they are of the consequences of water pollution the more alert will they be to any possible abuses that are being perpetrated in their own immediate locality.  As local authorities will be the bodies which will deal with water pollution in future it will be all <Col N="54" /> the more important that the public should be aware that it is up to them just as much as it is to the local authority to bring to notice any abuses which they see happening in their own locality.  Perhaps we should provide resources in future towards the education of our children in realising that a clean water supply is a very precious asset and an unclean water supply is possibly a useless think for anybody.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I can only wish it success in its implementation. I feel that at local authority level we are going to have to find additional funds to meet the increased costs which will arise from the introduction of this legislation but I think that is an increased cost which we will face up to in a responsible way.</P>

      <P>Together with the other Senators I wish to welcome this Bill but for many areas I feel it has unfortunately come too late. However, as we say in Irish, &ldquo;Is fearr go déanach ná go bráthach.&rdquo;  Tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh gach comhairle chontae beart do réir an Bhille seo agus feachaint chuige nach ndéanfar an t-uisce nó an fharraige a thruailliú a thuilleadh.</P>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill have been outlined by every Senator who has spoken.  The chief object is to make effective arrangements for the control of water pollution and to ensure that we have top quality water in our rivers and surrounding or country. I am glad that special reference is made to drinking water because, as a few of the Senators have said, this is not an unlimited commodity and indeed in many of our local authorities it has been greatly abused.  I think Senator West expressed the idea that we should control extraction also from our sources of water as well as protecting the source of the water we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are being given the onerous task of ensuring that our water is kept up to a good standard, but unfortunately they are the greatest culprits themselves in this regard. I would say that in 80 per cent of our local authority areas we have untreated sewage going into our rivers <Col N="55" /> and lakes and, more seriously still, going into our beaches.</P>
    <P>Senator West said that we should not put the onus on the Government to make money available for treatment plants.  I think this is ridiculous because we have investigated the cost of a very small village treatment plant and we have found to our surprise that it would cost thousands and thousands of pounds.  So, I am afraid that Senator West's idea of asking the local community to bear the cost of the treatment in local sewerage schemes is not feasible.  What we are talking about, the protection of our environment and the protection of our water inside and outside the country, will call for a very substantial amount in our budget and I hope that when the next budget comes around that there will be a very substantial allocation for local authorities to take on this duty and responsibility that has been placed upon them.</P>
    <P>It is right that the local authorities should be asked to do this job but I think Senator Russell was wise when he said that there are areas where it should be done on a regional basis. The regional development organisations could play a very big role in the pollution sphere and also in environmental protection.  As Senator Russell said, if anything goes wrong in the Clare area we in Limerick and Kerry are bound to suffer as a result, so that that region on the Shannon should be under one control.  There are many other areas where the same consideration applies because rivers which have become polluted at the source carry the pollution to some beach or some other area.  This is a case where I think you will have to combine not only the local authorities responsible but you will also have to get co-operation and co-ordination between various areas when it comes to rivers and beaches that concern many counties. Money will be a big factor when we get down to correcting pollution of inland and offshore water.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that as members of the EEC we must now comply with international standards and here my main worry is <Col N="56" /> licensing.  It is well known now to many of us in seaside areas that in the very near future, if we are to survive as seaside and bathing resorts we must have a licence and we will have to prove that the waters of our beaches are unpolluted.  It is sad to find that dozens of our beaches have untreated sewage flowing into them.  This will have to be taken up at a national level because tourism is the second major industry in this country.  In places like Ballybunion, Ballyheigue, Salthill and so on it is the one major industry and there is not much hope of our getting further industries because we are on the periphery of our country, along the coast, and industries generally prefer to set up in a central area.  I hope that a special allocation will be given to areas solely depending on tourism to ensure that beaches are cleared up in time to be reckoned as suitable for a licence under the rules of EEC.  We have only about 3,500 miles of coastline and of that only 350 miles of beach.  The beach is a very rare commodity and it is being thoroughly blackguarded by our local authorities.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see to it that a special allocation is provided to clean up the beaches of our country, which are our greatest asset, in conjunction with our drinking water, the water in our rivers and the waters in our lakes.</P>
    <P>Our local authorities will have to set headlines.  They cannot expect and demand from industry a standard which they themselves are not keeping. It is up to us and to the local authorities to put our house in order, but it will be a very expensive task. Given the money, I am sure that all of us in each area will accept the duties being imposed upon us under the different sections of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, not because I think it will bring about any spectacular improvement in the present situation where we have pretty widespread water pollution but because a debate such as we are having here today may awaken the public to the problem.  I was particularly impressed by the line taken by Senators West and Aherne.  We should not be clapping ourselves on the backs <Col N="57" /> and saying that we have the lowest rate of water pollution in Europe, because you cannot make a comparison with Europe, where countries are heavily industrialised and densely populated while our country is comparatively thinly populated and lightly industrialised.</P>
      <P>The Foras Forbartha report of the survey which was carried out in 1971 gives rise for concern and it would seem from reports in the newspapers that the situation has deteriorated since then.  In that report we were told that 7 per cent of our waterways were badly polluted.  The condition of 10 per cent of the waterways was doubtful and the others were quite good.  Since 1971 the amount of raw sewage particularly going into our waterways has increased tremendously and this is due to the rising standard of living.  Nowadays, more and more people have bathrooms and flush toilets.  In the old days most dwellings merely had dry toilets and the resultant sewage was just buried in a hole in the garden.  But nowadays it is discharged into the rivers, streams and waterways of our country and we could say that these waterways are merely one part of the pipeline which carries our sewage from the factory and the home to the sea.  That is how they are used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no surprise to us to find that, according to the report, the water-polluted areas in our waterways are downstream from factories and from towns.  I do not agree with the proposal in the Bill that the local authorities should be the bodies to control water pollution.  I know it is a cliche that we hear quite often nowadays but, unfortunately, it is true: the local authorities in this country are, perhaps not the greatest polluters individually, but they are the most widespread polluters and it is not easy to see a solution to the problem.  It will cost a great deal of money to provide the alternative which was mentioned here already today, sewage disposal plants.  In other countries you have them in every town and village but we have very few, if any, in this country.  We take the cheap way out and dump our factory effluent and <Col N="58" /> the necessary sewage into the waterways. It costs a great deal of money to provide disposal plants and it will be a very slow process to have the country fully equipped with them.  It will take many years, no doubt.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Aherne about our bathing places and beaches is very relevant and it should be treated with urgency.  Many of our beaches and bathing places are contaminated seriously and it must have a damaging effect on our tourist industry which is our second largest industry.  It is not uncommon nowadays to go to a beach adjacent to a town or city and see large lumps of excrement and other repulsive matter floating about on the surface of the sea.  I know of several bathing places which were very popular with local inhabitants a number of years ago and which nowadays are disused because of pollution.  We must take steps to eliminate it.  It seems wrong to me that under this Bill local authorities should be exempt in regard to emitting domestic sewage into the waterway.  This is the very type of pollution we should be trying to combat. According to the Bill industries must get a licence to emit their effluent but local authorities are exempt. There are certain requirements placed upon them.  I have grave doubts that these requirements will be very strict and that they will be adhered to in many cases.</P>
    <P>As regards industries, we have had an unfortunate attitude towards them for many years.  I assume it was utilitarian in that we felt that the provision of jobs was far more desirable than the prevention of pollution.  That was all right centuries ago, but in this day and age our attitude should change.</P>
    <P>I am not completely happy that we are at present studying and identifying the extent to which pollution occurs, especially in our fresh water rivers and streams.  Too often industrial effluent is mixing with domestic effluent and being discharged into waterways.  In many cases this causes excessive pollution because industrial effluent contains acids, waste milk and other chemicals which, when mixed <Col N="59" /> with domestic effluent can cause a most unsavoury looking scum on the surrounding waters.  There does not seem to be anybody who can tell us what effects this type of effluent will have on fish life.</P>
    <P>Fishermen on some of the rivers tell me that they regard pollution as being a far greater killer than either poaching or overfishing and that they would like to see something being done about it.  Slurry is also killing large numbers of fish.  It is not just killing them, but it is stopping them from going up the rivers.  When fish sense pollution at the mouth of a river they turn back.  I read recently that a salmon was caught in the River Thames last year.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Relations Bill, 1975: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is primarily designed to establish, under the aegis of the Labour Court, a joint labour committee for agricultural workers.  The proposed committee will have responsibility for the future regulation of the rates of pay and conditions of employment of agricultural workers.  Approximately 34,000 such workers will come within the ambit of the new committee.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned when the Bill was before the Dáil, this is the first significant legislative measure to be introduced by a Government for the improvement of the general conditions of agricultural workers since the Agricultural Wages Act was passed back in 1936.  The implementation of the provisions of this Bill will result in the replacement of the Agricultural Wages Board, established under the 1936 Act, by a joint labour committee. The basis of representation on this committee will ensure the co-operation of agricultural employer and worker interests in determining the future pay and conditions of agricultural workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> In recent years there have been many complaints that the pay and conditions of employment of agricultural employees have been allowed to fall behind the standards obtaining in other employments.  The new Bill should help to remedy the causes of these complaints as it provides, in effect, that agricultural workers shall be brought within the scope of the machinery operating in industry for the regulation of pay and conditions of employment. The joint labour committee system of negotiating the pay and working conditions of an industry already operates in respect of 42,000 industrial workers through the medium of 21 joint labour committees.  The new joint labour committee will, no doubt work towards achieving a greater harmonisation between the pay and conditions of agricultural workers and those of other industrial employees.</P>
    <P>Senators will not need to be reminded of the continuing decline in the numbers working on the land which poses a threat to the future prosperity of the agricultural sector.  The higher wages and better conditions prevailing in industry have undoubtedly been significant factors in accelerating this &ldquo;flight from the land&rdquo;.  If therefore this drift is to be halted, or at least reduced, it is clear that the remuneration and conditions of agricultural workers must be brought into line with those obtaining in the industrial sector. I believe that the new joint labour committee will have an important role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>While agricultural workers have in the past had access to the Labour Court in the event of a trade dispute, they have been generally excluded from the scope of the Industrial Relations Acts which provide the legal framework for the establishment of joint labour committees.  The Bill rectifies this position and provides that in future agricultural workers will have full access to the machinery of the Labour Court for the negotiation of their pay and working conditions.  Agricultural workers will also be enabled in future to be parties to registered agreements relating to wages and conditions of employment and will be included among the classes of workers in respect of <Col N="61" /> which joint industrial councils may be registered with the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>A few remarks about the structure of joint labour committees may be helpful to Senators at this point.  A joint labour committee comprises a chairman and two independent members appointed by the Minister for Labour.  It also has an equal number of members nominated by the two sides of industry.  The chairman has a casting vote in the event of deadlock. Orders by the Labour Court settling the statutory minimum wages and conditions of employment in an industry are made on the basis of proposals emanating from the appropriate joint labour committee.  The rates of pay and other conditions agreed upon by both sides and set down in an employment regulation order are legally enforceable.</P>
    <P>I have just described the normal composition of a joint labour committee. Following detailed consultation with the various interested parties I have agreed to certain modifications of the normal manner of appointment of members to a joint labour committee in the case of the proposed committee for agricultural workers. The Bill provides that the chairman and independent members of the proposed joint labour committee for agricultural workers will be appointed by me only after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Two panels for the selection of employer and worker members of the committee shall be prepared following consultation with the relevant employer/ worker interests and these shall be subject to consultation with, and the agreement of, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court will continue to retain its statutory function of making the actual appointments.  This modification of the normal procedure was necessary to meet the reservations of the farming organisations without whose co-operation the joint labour committee could not be set up.  The workers' organisations have raised no objections to this proposed arrangement. As the new joint labour committee will cover so many workers, <Col N="62" /> 34,000, it is only prudent that both the Ministers for Labour and for Agriculture and Fisheries should have sight of the panels before they are submitted to the Labour Court for the making of the appointments.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the abolition of the agricultural wages board as on and from the making by the Labour Court of the first employment regulation order setting standards under the new system.  The general inspectorate of the Department of Labour will from that time have responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions of employment regulation orders emerging from the committee.  During the passage of the Bill through the Dáil I introduced amendments broadening the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; so as to clarify that workers employed in horticulture, poultry farming, racing stables and stud farms and in gardens and sports grounds will be covered by the terms of the new joint labour committee.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Wages Board have hitherto been responsible for enforcing the holiday entitlements of agricultural workers which are provided for under a number of Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts.  It is my intention to exercise the powers already vested in me under sections 2 and 14 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, to provide that agricultural workers will be brought within the scope of that Act by regulation.</P>
    <P>The recent widening range of worker protection legislation has imposed a heavy additional burden of work on the Labour Court.  For example, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, provides for adjudication by the court on cases arising from the submission of equal pay claims, and the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill will give an important role to the court in adjudicating on disputes about equal treatment of men and women in relation to employment. The Bill before the House will of course provide extra work for the court.  In addition to the work arising from the legislative measures referred to, the court has had to deal with an expanding volume of work in other areas.  I might mention in this regard <Col N="63" /> that I made more extensive use of section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, than any of my predecessors and the work load of the court has of course also increased substantially due to its role in relation to the national agreements.  The number of recommendations on disputes issued by the court has increased considerably in recent years from a total of 232 in 1972 to 395 in 1975.  It has become evident that the early appointment of at least one additional division of the court is desirable in order to equip the court to deal more effectively with its increasing workload. The court at present operates in three divisions and I introduced an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil to facilitate the appointment by order of additional divisions of the court.  An expanded court will ensure the continuance of an efficient service by the court.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes special provision for the establishment of the joint labour committee for agricultural workers immediately after enactment of the Bill, thus dispensing in the interests of urgency with the time-consuming consultations normally involved prior to the making of an establishment order.  I expect therefore to see the new joint labour committee in operation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is acceptable to Members on this side of the House.  It appears to be a common-sense development of the system of joint labour committees in the industrial sphere.  The joint labour committees in that sphere appear to have worked well over the years.  In the circumstances there was a good case for extending them to the agricultural sphere.  Of course, the fact that they worked well in industry does not necessarily mean the same arguments in their favour apply to agriculture, but certainly they seem to apply and the experiment is at least worth trying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in particular a good development that there will now be access to the Labour Court in a variety of circumstances which employees in the <Col N="64" /> agricultural sphere did not enjoy up to now.  Again, this is a common-sense development provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that this Bill will be brought into operation very quickly, as provided for under section 4, without some of the procedures which were necessary up to now.  Section 5 will to some extent take away from the advantages of section 4 because the consultations necessary, the consultations by the Minister with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and the fact that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must vet the proposed panel members suggested by both the unions and the agricultural organisations is bound to take a certain amount of time and will modify the advantages provided for in section 4.  However that is only a matter of detail, and I presume in due course that suggestions for the panel will be made and accepted by the Minister concerned and then the provisions of the Bill can be tried out in practice.  Generally speaking, we welcome the Bill and wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Bill. It replaces the previous Bill which was in operation for a long period, since 1936.  It is only proper that workers, whether they are in agriculture or industry, should have comparable conditions of employment.  There is at present a vast difference between the two categories in the matter of wages and hours of work.  As regards agricultural workers, there must be a type of partnership between the farm worker and the farmer.  The same sort of relationship does not exist in any other industry.  If a cow is calving, if cattle have broken loose or any other emergency occurs it is reasonable to expect the farm worker to assist the farmer, even though it might be finishing time.  As a rural Deputy, I can see a vast difference in the type of work done.  I do not know whether AnCO and other organisations have given much thought to the training necessary.  County committees of agriculture often find it difficult to get farmers and potential workers to undertake the type of training necessary. Unless he is born and reared on <Col N="65" /> a farm it is difficult to adapt to the life.  His knowledge cannot be gleaned from books; it must be gained by experience and tradition.  He must have knowledge of sudden illness that can attack his cattle or sheep and of when it is necessary to call in the vet or the AI man.</P>
      <P>There must be liaison between the farm worker and the farmer and, as far as I know, this liaison usually exists.  We have many different types of farmers.  In many cases, and particularly in my own constituency, if farmers are obliged to pay the statutory agricultural wage all the year around they might be forced to sell their farms.  At present the position in the agricultural industry is not all that could be desired.  The Common Market has caused tremendous improvements and diversified the markets.  People have come to realise that many workers are employed in industries ancillary to agriculture.  The farmers and their workmen are producing the raw materials for thousands of workers.</P>
      <P>Often the farmer and the farm worker is looked down on.  The élite recoil in holy horror if they see a man with mud on his boots.  They forget that we are all made of clay anyway. Those with a higher standard of education seem to despise the agricultural worker and the small farmer.  They regard them as people of an inferior class of society.  This attitude must change because agriculture is our principal industry.  A farmer employing a worker must be put in the position where he can pay him the standard agricultural wage and give him a decent standard of living.  There should also be some kind of rotation system whereby if the farmer wanted to take a day off there would be a pool of workers he could draw from.  Those engaged in manufacturing industries can arrange for substitutes to take over from them at times of illness or annual holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time many farmers were reluctant to pay their workmen.  The workers were usually engaged at a hiring fair and they had no conditions of service set down for them.  They had no rights at all.  &ldquo;Spalpeens&rdquo; was <Col N="66" /> the name given to them in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The modern farm worker is often very highly skilled.  I should like to see them being taken to the Spring Show where they could examine the latest farm machinery and receive information on the various exhibits.  Particular care should be devoted to the design of farm machinery because of the tremendous hazard to operators. I refer in particular to tractors, safety cabs, bailers and so on.  These are used extensively on modern farms, but they are often used indiscriminately and without sufficient care.  Unfortunately every year there are from 20 to 30 people killed by tractors because they are not fitted with safety cabs.  Many are also killed by being caught in tow bars and in several other ways.  Most of these accidents could be avoided if the men were more familiar with the handling of machines.  Manufacturers of farm machinery should be subjected to close scrutiny by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, or some other body, to ensure that machines are not sold to young people who may be more dare-devil than their elders.  Manufacturers should be obliged to ensure that safety attachments are provided on their machines and full instructions should be set out for their use.</P>
    <P>There is a serious decline in the number of people working on farms. Agricultural production has increased because of improved mechanism.  The numbers engaged in farming have decreased because there is too much competition.  Farmers have been badly treated over the years in regard to the payment of rates and now they are being charged income tax.  There seem to be two different standards being applied, one for farmers and the other for those engaged in industry.  Yet the farmer is a type of factory owner.  Even though he may be working in a small way he is supplying raw materials for other industries which keep thousands of workers in employment.</P>
    <P>City dwellers, in particular, think the farmers live in luxury.  They think they are wealthy men who attend the races a couple of days a week and <Col N="67" /> lie in bed for the rest of the time. That is a completely false image of the majority of our farmers.  By and large, they are hardworking people who toil right around the clock in many instances.  They have a hard and lonely life, a life for which they must have a certain liking.  Because land is fetching a good price at present people think that farming is a luxury. But usually the farmer cannot sell his land because it is his only asset. Anyway, with inflation at its present rate the money he would get for it would not provide him with even frugal comfort.</P>
    <P>Many direct and indirect factors influence the agricultural situation, including EEC Directives Nos. 159 and 161.  Farmers are being encouraged to retire at a certain age to enable others to buy their land, but we must think very seriously about these directives.  What might suit other EEC countries might not necessarily be suitable for Irish conditions. I have no time for the inefficient farmer, the man who is lazy and who lets his land go to rack and ruin, but there are not many of that type.  We will probably have a considerable redistribution of land because it is becoming more valuable every year.</P>
    <P>In many areas far too much land is given over to forestry.  The employment content on it is nothing like the employment content we could achieve if that land were used for farming, particularly if modern techniques and machinery were used. We have come a long way from the time when a wealthy farmer provided a labourer's cottage for his workman and gave him a few gallons of milk and a bag of spuds in lieu of wages.  We are glad that the worker is now independent and can consider himself equal to his employer.  At one time it was argued that the farm worker had to pay income tax when his employer was not taxed.  I do not want that situation to obtain.  If a farmer is making big profits it is right that he should be taxed, but he should not be subject to both a rating system and an income <Col N="68" /> tax code.  He should be treated with equality.  If he is liable to pay tax, make him pay.</P>
    <P>Although the numbers of people working and living on the land have declined, the produce being produced from the land has increased immensely. I would venture to say that millions of pounds worth of exports from my constituency go from Killeshandra through the ports.  That is because of the efficiency of the farmers in the area who work hard in the milk-producing and pig-producing areas.  There is great potential here for the expansion in agricultural production because of our climate and our facilities.  We are far too hasty in taxing the farmer.  We should provide sufficient capital to encourage more farmers to develop their farms and employ an extra man.  With the advent of more up-to-date machinery we could find that it would take much more money to put a man into industry than it would to put a man working on a farm.  That is of immense importance because when one man is given a job on a farm he is producing raw material that could put four or five men working in industry.  That is more important than spending £5,000 putting a man into an industry that may fold up after a few years.</P>
    <P>There will be another opportunity for examining the various sections in the Bill.  As a member of a union I have always believed it is better for workers to be in their respective unions and easier for employees and industrialists to have negotiations with organised trade unions provided the unions can be controlled.  It is an orderly way of getting things done. This Bill will ensure that the workers will get their rights and it will be seen that they are getting their rights.  I hope it will renew confidence in working on the land and, in doing so, those who are trained by AnCO or receive third level education will recognise and realise that the man who works on the land is just as important or more important than those working anywhere else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. <Col N="69" /> So far as it will improve the conditions of those working in agriculture it is to be welcomed.  Unfortunately there are very few agricultural workers on the land at the moment.  This is to be regretted.  It is, of course, essential that agricultural workers should get a reasonable return for their labours.  The standard of living of many agricultural workers is not as good as one would wish.  If we tackle this problem by imposing conditions that obtain in industry on people working on the land we will be approaching this problem from the wrong angle.  Very often what is important to those working in industry is not important to those working in agriculture.  It is a matter of job satisfaction really and a reasonable standard of living, freedom to work when they like and often how they like. They have to have many skills and be prepared to devote a great deal of time, maybe six, seven or eight hours, to a particular job.  They have to be on call the same as professional people.  If we try to impose industrial conditions on these people we may well be making a mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scope to employ more people on the land.  Possibly the input to provide jobs on the land would be much smaller than the input which must be found to employ people in industry.  If we were to devote greater attention to employment on the land it might pay off in the long run. There are many small farmers who could be engaging in some kind of farm modernisation scheme, such as building a pig unit or a fattening unit for calves.  If an extra man is employed on a job like that he would not be able to work a straight six or eight hours a day.  It could entail his working irregular hours maybe seven days a week.  If we try to improve the conditions of those employed in agriculture by imposing conditions that are satisfactory in industry we may be making a mistake.  We should devote greater attention to seeting what can be done to employ more people on the land and, if we can achieve that, we shall be doing a good job. In so far as the Bill seeks to improve the conditions of those employed on the land it is a good piece of legislation. <Col N="70" /> I hope it will result in the employment of agricultural workers and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill which gives some recognition at last to the part played by agricultural workers down through the years. For far too long agricultural workers have been the Cinderella of the work force in this country.  They never benefited under wage agreements and as a result, they have fallen far behind other workers in somewhat comparable employment in industry, such as council workers, forestry workers and Bord na Móna and Land Commission employees.  Their wages were negotiated by what was known as the Agricultural Wages Board and it can be truthfully said that for a long number of years the agricultural worker got a raw deal. I am sure the Minister will be remembered by the agricultural workers as the Minister who tried to do something positive to take them out of that position.</P>
      <P>A minimum rate was laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board.  It varied from area to area.  There were three different area rates.  Those in Dublin county, part of County Meath and parts of Kildare and Wicklow benefited by being in the highest rated area.  They also benefited because they were very close to the capital where there was alternative employment.  As a result many very skilled agricultural workers had to be paid a rate by their employers far above the rate laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board to enable them to hold on to their men.  In other areas the workers were not so fortunate.  The minimum rate laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board became the maximum rate and these agricultural workers had to work long hours for a very low rate of wages.  I do not contribute to the argument which seemed to be running through the speeches I heard today about ability to pay.  There can be no question that any farmer employing a worker will be able to pay him the new rate laid down in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I welcome the Bill and, like the agricultural workers, I welcome the demise of the Agricultural Wages Board which did not serve the agricultural workers too well.</P>

      <P>I too wish to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill.  It demonstrates clearly that from now on workers in agriculture will have exactly the same rights in industrial relations as workers in the manufacturing and service industries. On the other hand, it establishes and indicates, again quite clearly, that from now on agricultural employers will have to exercise the same responsibility as employers in other areas.</P>
      <P>The most satisfying feature of this Bill is something that is not in the Bill at all.  I refer to the fact that the Minister has been able to secure the agreement of both farmers and workers to the provisions of the Bill.  That is satisfactory.  It is good for the farming industry.  It is good for the workers and for the community generally.  It is certainly good for the country that all concerned in agriculture should set this example, an example in co-operation at a time when the economy certainly needs the highest possible degree of co-operation on the part of all sections of the community.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing a measure which has the full support of all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this measure.  I do not speak for farmers in an area where a great many agricultural labourers are employed.  In fact in the part of the country I represent most farmers do their own work. There is no question of farm labourers being any significant percentage of the electorate.  Nevertheless, I believe farm labourers have been the Cinderella of our labour force in the past.  I do not think this was so because of the attitude of the farmer as an employer or because we had harder conditions in agriculture.  There was, in fact, a very special relationship between the farmer and his employee, a relationship one did not get in industry generally. On most farms you had the farmer and perhaps one or two people <Col N="72" /> working with him.  In my experience, the farmer and his workers worked as equals.  There was a better relationship between them than there was generally between employee and employer.</P>
      <P>The farmer will recognise that this is progressive legislation and legislation that was overdue.  I hope it will change the attitude of some people to what is essentially a very serious problem in agriculture.  Somebody mentioned that there should be no question of inability to pay.  Food prices have gone up in recent years but I cannot understand people in urban areas who say &mdash;sometimes these things are said maliciously for political advantage&mdash; farmers never had it so good and that prices have rocketted for the farmer. This is not the case.  Only a very small percentage of the increased price that the housewife has to pay has gone back to the farmer.</P>
      <P>The situation of a farmer as an employer is not as happy as it is in industry.  We have the figures for the farm modernisation scheme to support this.  A target of £36 a week has been set by the farm modernisation scheme to be achieved over the next two years by a farmer who, with the best advice available to him, plans to progress.  Only a very small percentage so far have been able to plan to achieve that target.  This is sufficient indication that as an income earner agriculture is not a good business to be in.  Nevertheless, I would say the agricultural worker, like the farmer himself, has compensation by way of job satisfaction. I believe the farmer and the farm worker in the past worked longer hours, produced more and got a lower return than did those in any other sector because, in other sectors, the lines were laid down and, if you could not achieve the target, you went out of business.  The farmer often worked for one or two years for half the income the industrial workers got. Farmers and the farm employees did this in the past but I believe that their lot was not as unhappy as some people might think.  The measure of job satisfaction that was enjoyed by them compensated for many of the disadvantages they suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="73" /> I welcome the Bill.  I believe it is welcomed by all progressive farmers who hope that in the future there will not be any question of the farmer and the farm worker having to take less than their counterparts in industry. Should a situation arise in future where agriculture is not an industry that gives a proper return to the employer and the employee it is only natural too that the losses should be shared by both employer and employee.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senators who have spoken on this measure and to apologise that I could not be here myself for the whole debate.  I have however some notes on the points made.  The debate has followed the same pattern as it did in the other House.  There has been a general welcome on both sides for the provisions of this Bill.  There is a clear recognition on the part of the Senators that there is need to end the disparity that exists between those who work on the land and those who work in industry.  This is a matter the farmers and their employees in this new joint committee will tackle together.  Their separation from the rest of the workers must be ended and the ending of that division should be brought about quickly.  That is a matter for the two sides in the joint labour committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan was worried whether the consultations with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries might constitute an unnecessary delay in the setting up of the joint labour committee. The provisions in this legislation actually mark a change from the usual procedures in setting up a joint labour committee and that should result in a speeding up of the establishment of the joint labour committee. We are anxious to have the committee set up as rapidly as possible. Senator Ryan will appreciate &mdash;this was a point referred to by Senator Kennedy&mdash;that it was necessary to get the agreement of the farming interests.  Obviously legislation of this kind cannot have happy consequences if it is introduced against the opposition of either side in the joint <Col N="74" /> labour committee.  I am happy to say that we have had co-operation and, to achieve that co-operation, there has to be a place for the Ministry of Agriculture because of its close connection with farmers.  That is the reason why the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is referred to in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald referred to the divisions which still exist.  Farmers accept it is not possible to get employees of the right standard who will stay in agriculture unless conditions more and more approach those obtaining in industry.  It is not possible any longer to get people to work under disparate conditions and at a different wage rate from those obtaining generally in industry.  Remember, manufacturing industry is now more generally dispersed throughout the country.  The old divisions between town and country are, fortunately or unfortunately, fast disappearing.  No longer can we get operatives who over a long period will accept conditions that differ radically from those of their brothers, cousins or friends in urban factory employment.  That is the prevailing reason which brought about agreement between farmers and workers for the establishment of this joint labour committee.  We want the joint labour committee to meet as rapidly as possible, discuss their programme of work and see to it that this Bill plays a part in ensuring that this most important industry, agriculture, which has a very bright future in terms of the European Economic Community, is served by a contented workforce, a workforce with more and more skills.  This Bill should assist in ensuring that that workforce remains on the land, serving the community in general and the national interest.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the problem of getting the agreement of the agricultural organisations and this apparently is the reason the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is necessary. It seems to be rather unusual, to say the least of it, that a Minister cannot do what he wants to do in a Bill without the consent of another Minister.  An extraordinary situation could arise here.  It is understandable that the Minister for Labour should consult with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and normally that should be sufficient but, if the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries positively does not give his consent, what will be the position of the Minister for Labour?</P>

      <P>According to a report in a newspaper last year, for the first time in over 100 years, salmon had been caught in the River Thames.  In the major rivers of Europe there are no salmon.  That compares to some extent with our situation where in some of our best rivers the number <Col N="76" /> of salmon going upstream in recent years has been declining.  Fishermen believe this decline is due to water pollution.  It is said that we are going backwards in our efforts to combat pollution while, in Britain, they seem to be going forward.  They have eliminated the dreadful pollution in the rivers serving industrial centres to such an extent that fish life is returning to these rivers.  There are many people employed here in the salmon fishing industry and it would be a disaster if it were to be destroyed by our negligence in combating pollution.</P>
      <P>Senator Whyte referred to a type of pollution that was causing concern on the River Shannon about two years ago.  It was caused by the emission of peat moss into the River Shannon by Bord na Móna.  Senator Whyte felt this would have an adverse effect on fish life.  I heard in a news bulletin yesterday that Bord na Móna are now carrying out tests to ascertain whether this excessive emission of peat moss is, in fact, affecting fish life.  Two years ago Senator Whyte was concerned about this and raised the matter here. Only now are Bord na Móna investigating the incidence of pollution caused by this emission.  There is a general lack of concern throughout the country with regard to the pollution of our waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said at the outset that I am not in agreement with local authorities being in control.  They are themselves the greatest water polluters.  Control should be left to the bodies which look after it at the moment and do quite well within the limits of their small resources.  I refer to the boards of conservators.  They do a wonderful job.  They are concerned with the elimination of water pollution.  This is not the case with local authorities. This is why I contend that the boards of conservators should be the bodies to be in charge of eliminating this problem.  I agree that members of local authorities might sit in on meetings of the board of conservators and also representatives from the Department of Local Government. I would primarily give these duties to the boards of conservators because <Col N="77" /> they are given the task of protecting fish life in our waterways.  If they feel that pollution levels are so high as to endanger this life they will take action. It is their immediate concern.  Local authorities, by and large, are not concerned.</P>
    <P>The officials of local authorities are not immediately concerned.  The board of conservators consists of fishermen themselves and their representatives. The immediate concern of local authority officials is to save money, to cut down on expenditure.  They will give in to pressure from the elected members of local authorities, the officials of the Departments who are directing their affairs from above, and they will not necessarily try to combat pollution.  They would rather try to save money, I am afraid.  Because of that, I cannot agree with this proposal.  To prevent pollution means that you will have to spend money creating sewage disposal plants or otherwise.  The cheapest way to get rid of sewage effluent is dump it into a river.  That is what local authorities tend to do.  That is not the way the matter should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal that industry should have to pay for the monitoring of the effluent they are emitting.  At the moment industries are getting away on the cheap by being able to dump their effluent into our waterways.  Some of these industrialists will continue to take the easy way out, if they are allowed.  Some members of local authorities will have to be prepared to take action against industrialists who are polluting our waterways.  They will be threatened by the industrialists that the factories they control may have to close and put people out of work if they have to find other ways of getting rid of the effluent.  This is a type of blackmail for an elected representative.  The penalties envisaged in this Bill are a deterrent, but I see a danger that these will not be implemented because the members of local authorities will be put under pressure from some industrialists. You will always get the unscrupulous individual who will take the easy and cheap way out.</P>
    <P>I would liketo see the members of <Col N="78" /> local authorities kept informed of the sources of pollution in their areas because those of us interested enough to bring pressure to bear on the people responsible for this contamination to have it eliminated have no contact whatsoever with the boards of conservators.  We read periodically in the newspapers that the local authorities are the people causing the bulk of the pollution.  The whole matter is dealt with by the officials and it never really comes before the members who deal with the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I feel it is not sensible to have local authorities controlling water pollution is that too many local authorities are involved for some water systems.  I will mention just one.  The Rivers Suir, Nore and Barrow meet before going into the sea in Waterford Harbour.  These three rivers travel through seven or eight counties.  That involves seven or eight county councils plus at least a dozen local urban councils, corporations or town commissioners.  If each local authority is involved in the control of pollution it will be a most cumbersome task to detect the cause of pollution if it is eventually discovered in an area such as Waterford Harbour.  The board of conservators, whose jurisdiction is over a complete waterway from the very start of the river to the point where it goes into the sea are the logical people to see that that waterway is kept free of pollution.  These people control fish life.  The greatest indication of pollution is when fish life are in danger.  In recent years we have seen that fish life are being destroyed more and more.</P>
    <P>The reasons are simple enough.  The amount of effluent going into our waterways is increasing because of modern methods of disposal and, secondly, because rainfall in recent years has been abnormally low, so a much lesser amount of water is absorbing a much greater amount of effluent, therefore decreasing the amount of oxygen available to fish life.  It is imperative, with this decreasing amount of fresh water in our waterways, that the amount of <Col N="79" /> effluent likely to affect fish life should be drastically curtailed.</P>
    <P>I have three main faults to find with the Bill.  I disagree that local authorities should be the controlling body with regard to containment of pollution.  I feel that agricultural effluent is treated too lightly in the Bill, that people are given far too much powers to emit agricultural effluent, because this is the greatest killer of all.  I am told that slurry is absolutely deadly to fish life.  I know that it has to be used and it has to be got rid of in the course of agriculture, but I think the restrictions on its use and its disposal should be greater. Thirdly, the provision comes into the Bill quite too often that accidental discharge of effluent will be considered a defence under this Bill.  That is giving people too easy a way out.  It will be too difficult to point the finger at the actual offender and it will render the Bill ineffective in many ways.  As I stated at the outset, I welcome the Bill because it brings to the notice of the public a problem which has been with us for a long time and which we have done little to deal with up to now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad to see such a Bill before the House.  I feel it is tremendously important.  Over the last couple of years a great song and dance has been made all over the country regarding pollution.  It was thought that quite a number of people were jumping on the band wagon and that there was not perhaps real sincerity behind the many calls we heard.  At the same time I must say that the Clean Water <Col N="80" /> Association and various other groups who interested themselves in this were not a band of discontented people but people genuinely interested in the environment. We all know that we like to be considered a clean country and a clean people.  Indeed, in my own county we won the Tidy Towns Competition on three or four occasions and were delighted to set a headline in that sphere.</P>
    <P>We are all sensible enough to realise that a certain amount of pollution will occur, but until the industrial revolution took place in this country we did not hear very much about it.  In my own constituency we were and are anxious to get industrialists into County Cavan, or indeed into that whole Fermanagh, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan area.  Until very recently we were not too concerned about pollution, because we were very anxious to entice industrialists, and both the county council and the Government offered them rates exemptions.</P>
    <P>When many of these industrialists set up industries they may not have realised the need to ensure that some method of disposal of effluent and waste be devised which would not cause pollution in the rivers.  It was only when fish started dying and farmers started complaining that a lot of this talk regarding pollution arose and it dawned on people that many poisonous substances were being discharged into our rivers&mdash;and they were not all coming from factories.</P>
    <P>Scientists admit that quite a lot of pollution is caused by detergents and various types of cleansing and bleaching materials used in laundries and even used by the housewife in her own domestic appliances.  In the past we had pollution from flax in my area, but all that is gone.  However, this other has come in its place.  I know, as chairman of the regional development organisation in the north-eastern area, that our engineers devised a plan whereby they would maintain water levels in the summer at the winter level or as near to it as possible.  In that way on this particular river they were able to conserve the amount of water and, by means of sluice gates, <Col N="81" /> to diminish or increase the flow.  We all know that if pollution is diluted it becomes less dangerous to fish life. That is a method which it would be very useful for us to employ not alone on that river but on many other rivers.</P>
    <P>We must realise that in 1976 we must live with a certain amount of pollution because we want to get work for our people.  We like the environment and we like to have tourists coming.  But there has to be a happy medium whereby these people will sit down around a table and will agree to install&mdash;perhaps with some aid from the Government&mdash;the necessary machinery to ensure that our natural environment will not be destroyed. We all know that, given peaceful conditions, we could double or probably treble the summer population of our country with tourists.  Irrespective of what prices are and so on, we have a tremendously attractive climate; we are not prone to earthquakes and the things that occur in more sunnier places.  Certainly we have a lot to recommend to the tourist.  We have good ferry services; the standard of our housing has increased.  Down the years various regional organisations, local authorities and the Government have been providing fishing stands around our lakes and making many of these places generally more attractive and more pleasing to the tourist. We are glad to have them and try to do everything to make their short stay here reasonably comfortable.</P>
    <P>I come from a county where we had a great tradition for producing pigs.  A change has taken place in recent years.  As a matter of fact, under a new direction a man must have ten sows before he will get a grant at all.  But in days gone by if you had two or three you were all right.  In other words, the tendency now is to get into the big unit.  We have men in County Cavan who have 40,000 and up to 50,000 pigs.  We know that in a single unit of that size the amount of slurry being discharged is colossal.  You can erect a tank to contain that slurry.  It can be guaranteed by the manufacturer and so on but yet it can burst, although this has not happened.  We know that the fines <Col N="82" /> the Government are entitled to impose would be insufficient to prevent people, purposely or because they had nowhere to put this material, discharging it into lakes and rivers. There is a regulation that a man must own so much land before he can extend his piggery to such a size; but due regard must be had of the type of soil in the area, whether it is the type that will not absorb slurry with the result that the slurry will probably float on the top and eventually find its way into the river.  All these things would need to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>At the same time we cannot destroy people engaged in pig production, because to the nation it is very important.  It brings in a lot of wealth. We sell these pigs for export.  Apart from supplying the local factories, the bacon and other products are exported and employment is provided. Therefore it is an important industry. We had an idea in Bailieborough&mdash; the Industrial Research and Standards people were on to it&mdash;of trying to produce a type of factory to turn this slurry into granulated manure that could be spread on our grasslands instead of importing fertilisers.  It might be a very efficient way of producing grass.  It is something we have. We cannot get rid of it and the best thing for us to do is to try to get our scientists to ensure that before it reaches the rivers and lakes it will have served a purpose on the land and it will do no harm whatever to the fish.</P>
    <P>Rabbits have become immune to myxomatosis and there are hordes of them all over the country again.  Fish may after a while develop some type of a built-in resistance to this algae or whatever appears in the lakes to eat up the oxygen and cause a lot of fish to die.  I have often seen hundreds of fish dead in Lough Oughter.  It is a depressing sight and we do not like to see it happen.</P>
    <P>There are other types of pollution, such as oil, to threaten our rivers.  I do not know of any law for the disposing of waste oil from garages or so on.  They can throw it where they like and eventually it can find its way <Col N="83" /> in.  So also can sawdust.  Various other types of pollution can find its way into our streams and cause serious pollution.  The same applies regarding creameries, milk powder factories and so on.</P>
    <P>I know our own milk powder factory in Killeshandra has spent an enormous amount of money so as to ensure that none of the effluent from that milk powder factory went into the lake.  As a matter of fact, they piped it out to two or three local farms in the district and did a wonderful job.  We were very glad to get these people in. Over 300 people are employed there and they are a consideration.  It would not be very popular if somebody from the area came along and said this factory was preventing a few tourists from coming to our country, because our first concern of course must be the people who are working.</P>
    <P>From the other side somebody mentioned the boards of conservators.  I do not think they are the right people to handle this.  We have a vast lake area starting with the Erne.  I was present at a cross-Border meeting in Enniskillen.  Some of the people there, especially Mr. Wells from Brussels, who is over there in connection with the EEC Regional Fund was amazed at the amount of water in the area.  I do not think the board of conservators would be fit to handle it.  There is a lot of merit in taking each river as a catchment area.  These problems are dealt with on the Continent on an international basis.  We have them here, too, in relation to the River Erne.  There must be co-operation between various counties in such a situation and there must also be a catchment area.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the Bill is sound.  As a member of the regional tourism organisation I know that the Lakeland Regional Tourism Board are worried about the effect pollution would have on tourists coming to that area.  It is a region of many lakes and it does not have any seaboard.  It is the only region in Ireland that has no seaboard.  We are anxious to increase the number of tourists coming to the area.  The regional manager and his <Col N="84" /> staff would be very disappointed.  It would be a big blow to their efforts to attract tourists to the area.</P>
    <P>Pollution along the seacoast would probably disappear more quickly than inland pollution.  It is very important to find some way of lessening the incidence of pollution especially in regard to the number of lakes in the Lakeland region.  I know other areas suffer from pollution but they do not have as many lakes as are in our region.  As some other Senator stated, it is much easier to control pollution when there is not a large expanse of water and it does not have the same ill-effects.</P>
    <P>Very often people are inclined to blame the farmer for pollution.  However, he must feel very annoyed if he lets his cattle down to drink at the lakeshore and finds it covered over with a green scum caused by pollution from some factory.  People are inclined to think that because a farmer puts fertiliser on his land, 10-10-20 or something like that, it is the cause of pollution.  All these factors must be investigated.  There are plenty of people qualified to do this.  They could investigate the effects of deep-litter pig and chicken rearing and the rapid production of cattle for the export market&mdash;the effects of these methods on the human being apart from the effects of pollution on fish in our rivers.</P>
    <P>It is a useful exercise for the Seanad to have this discussion.  It is not something which can be swept under the carpet.  There is a great influx of visitors to the River Shannon and it is important to ensure that it is kept clean.  There are plans to have the Rivers Shannon and Erne connected by a canal.  There must be some legislation to protect small areas from a concentration of cabin cruisers and other boats which could cause pollution, which would not occur on the open sea.</P>
    <P>All these matters are important and most of them are covered in this Bill. I welcome the Bill and I know that people will be pleased that it is before us.  We shall do our best to improve and amend it as it proceeds.</P>
    <P>Many people regard the effluent <Col N="85" /> from silage pits to be deadly to fish. We must be sensible about this matter.  That area is controlled by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  There should be a regulation regarding the siting of those silos.  As a rule a farmer will not put a pit on the river bank or lake shore because it is not the best place for it anyway.  He would prefer to have a concrete base under it and have water laid on.  Therefore it would not be fair to blame him in this regard.</P>
    <P>The same applies to sheep dipping tanks.  In my own area the county council had to close a sheep dipping tank because it was alleged that the tank was built too close to the river and the effluent, which is deadly, seeped into the river and caused the death of fish.  We learn as we go along.  Now the county council would not dream of putting a sheep dipping tank adjacent to a river.  Farmers do not wish to pollute the water they need for their animals.  They would like to see the rivers clean.  The main theme of this legislation should be the co-operation of the farmers, apart from the Government giving the lead.</P>
    <P>I am not sure who should enforce this legislation.  The county council have a difficult role to play because often the source of the pollution may cross their border into an adjoining county or State.  If it was enforced by some Government committee it might be better, but I will not quibble about that now.  I am glad to see this legislation, that we recognise the existence of pollution and are trying to approach the problem in a sensible way so that people, industry, animals and fish will have a fair share of God's graces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably could speak at great length on this Bill but it will be a relief to Senators present that much of what I wish to say can be said at Committee Stage.  My welcome for the Bill will be muted.  I welcome it as a recognition of a serious deficiency in our legislation and as an admission of such a deficiency. I welcome it as a Bill which will focus attention on a problem which I do not think it will solve.  There are good things in this Bill, as there <Col N="86" /> are good bits in the parson's egg; but I would not welcome being asked to eat a parson's egg at breakfast unless I was assured at the bishopric of an award for my consumption.</P>
      <P>The first discordant note will be to agree with what Senator Deasy said when he disagreed with the control of the licensing in relation to water pollution being given to local authorities. I wholly agree with Senator Deasy; I wholly disagree with the proposals in this Bill with regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps worth emphasising that the only justification I can see for being a Senator is that we survey legislation offered to us by the Executive, irrespective of which part of the House we may find ourselves in from time to time.  This seems to give to local authorities, who may be the worst offenders in the matter of pollution, the licensing of other bodies in their enterprises.  It is not merely a question of the poacher turning gamekeeper; it is a question of giving power to the poacher to sue the gamekeeper.  More than that, it is evident to anybody who gives any consideration to the manpower availability, or the skills required to be mustered to decide what quality of water our society should determine to have, that there will not be resources available under the control of all local authorities to administer properly the powers given to them by the Bill.  They are by this Bill exempt from obligations themselves in relation to the effluents that necessarily result from development and expansion of the population.</P>
      <P>This is much too serious a matter for us not to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what precisely were the comments, to which he referred in his speech, on the report on water pollution. This report was published in 1973. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Comments on the working group's recommendations were submitted by a number of interested bodies and all these views were carefully considered prior to the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What were these views?  Why are we not informed as to what these views <Col N="87" /> were?  How can we conduct a debate unless we know what the experts think of the inter-departmental working party's recommendations?  The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
    <P>The Government consider that the arguments in favour of vesting the main control functions that the Bill proposes in local authorities are entirely conclusive.</P>
    <P>This is what the Parliamentary Secretary says, but what are the arguments? Where are they?  What are the arguments against the proposals? Where is the money to come from to establish laboratories at the behest of every local authority?  Where is the money to staff these laboratories with technicians and supervisory technicians and analysts?  If local authorities are to be free to prosecute under the Bill&mdash; as they are now; this is no disimprovement in that sense&mdash;what court will consider evidence except from those who are suitably qualified?</P>
    <P>Our national problem is being brought home to us forcibly every day. We have reversed the trend that began with the famine.  We are at the beginning of a growth in population.  Instead of celebrating that and seeing in it a new dynamism, which if properly handled, properly monitored, properly guided could transform our country, we are turning it into a miserable, dismaying problem that we think, on the basis of our past experience, we can never solve.</P>
    <P>The number of working people who have to support dependants here is the highest in Europe, but our population growth is also the highest in Europe.  We must foresee a figure of 30,000 nett extra people in manufacturing employment if we are to have full employment in ten years, which was our original objective.  I think this is an overestimate of the requirement but I agree with what Senator Dolan said with regard to the potential in growth of employment in services&mdash;and the toursist industry must be seen as one of the great growth areas if we can maintain stability and the type of society that we have that attracts people.  Among he factors which will <Col N="88" /> be attractive to the tourist is the ability to fish.  Let us not talk about fishing rights and the duke and his ghillie.  All forms of water recreation involve pure water; therefore, pure water is a fundamental objective to be attained by the best means available.  Among our problems are these: we must be extremely prudent and careful about the use of our resources.  I wish every newspaper printed daily on the front page: &ldquo;In Ireland, as distinct from the United Kingdom, the average <i>per capita</i> income is only £70, compared to their £100&rdquo;.  Therefore, our resources are limited and we must manage them all the more skilfully and carefully.</P>
    <P>I see lurking behind the section requiring local authorities to put their house in order, to curb their flow of effluent, the question of the ability to finance it.  Why put an obligation on them that on a date unspecified they must provide all these things?  We do not know when this Bill will come into force: somebody should tell us. It may never become law if an order has to be made making it a law when it is enacted, if I read the Bill correctly. How slow will the Minister be to do this, if the result is that money will have to be provided out of public funds to set up laboratories suitably staffed in 26 or more local authorities all over the country?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has said that examination has been made of the different systems in various countries.  I would like to know the result of that examination.  In the United Kingdom there is a water council to co-ordinate all water managements.  I would like to see this Bill amended so as to give to an established body, with access to the skill of which there is a limited amount available, the power itself to licence.  Or at least this body should be technically so equipped that they would specify the qualities to be attained on a statutory basis before the Minister made the orders with which people engaged in either agricultural or industrial development would have to comply.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary fairly said in his small revelation in regard <Col N="89" /> to the comments made on the working group's recommendations submitted by a number of interested bodies that these views were carefully considered.  If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government can have the opportunity of considering them why cannot we have the same opportunity when we are considering a Bill enacting some but not all of the provisions of the inter-departmental committee's report?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said that, while there was general agreement on the type of measures needed to control water pollution, there was and may still be some difference of opinion on the issue of who should administer the new controls.  I am sure there was a great difference of opinion.  No matter how conclusive the conclusion of the Government may have been, a conclusion is as good as the arguments on which that conclusion is reached and no better.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the working group came out in favour of controls at local level.  But there are alternatives. Some people favour control by a national board, others by regional or river authorities.  My own view with regard to what is proposed on this aspect is that it is a totally untenable position to have local authorities exempted from requirements.  The section dealing with local authorities is so wide open that I could see myself talking about it here in ten years' time &mdash;assuming I was still here&mdash;and that section might not have been operated. It is an untenable position that local authorities which themselves pour effluent into rivers or harbours should be prosecuting somebody who is giving employment to perhaps 2,000 people and that these authorities should be empowered after the third year to change a licence which has been granted.  This situation should be changed.</P>
    <P>Could I explain why I think this general debate on environment and preservational development unnaturally puts one group against another? I do not want to argue that the lamb should lie down with the lion and feel entirely safe in yielding to the blandishments of the lion; but as regards <Col N="90" /> the sort of society we wish to create I think the national interest is united.</P>
    <P>It will be in our interest&mdash;putting it on a grossly material basis&mdash;to attract tourists.  That is a conservative point of view and when people talk about others being conservative, there are all sorts of conservatives.  Some conservatives must be very progressive and active to conserve and preserve things that are worth conserving and preserving, and the purity and tenderness of our waters is one of these.  That is merely for the tourists coming in, to provide us with income which makes it possible for our children to obtain employment&mdash;those 20,000 extra jobs a year&mdash;and create demand for the products of Irish industry.  But the very enjoyment of life by our people will be involved.  The attractiveness of this place as one in which to invest can be greater if we preserve some of our waters which&mdash;I am thinking of the Donegal region&mdash;are I understand, among the purest in all Europe.</P>
    <P>Coming late to the industrial game we can learn from other people's mistakes.  It is interesting to note that one of the Acts we are repealing is the River Pollution Act, 1876.  So, a hundred years ago we began to think there might be a pollution problem.  I should imagine it was the men with the fishing rights who got that piece of legislation through.</P>
    <P>Could I explain the problem of somebody who is thinking of setting up a business here?  I do not at all think purely in terms of foreign industrialists who have provided a dynamic element in our development in the last 15 to 20 years, but we may well have to think of activating our domestic savings by a suitable scheme. One of the things I have often been asked by foreigners is: &ldquo;What is to be our position in regard to environmental control?&rdquo;  They know that environmental control should exist in any sophisticated society and should match the needs of the people.  All I could say up to this was: &ldquo;It depends on what the planning authorities will say is required and I think they will be affected by what the Industrial Development Authority will require.&rdquo;  I could not give them a clear <Col N="91" /> statement as to what they had to comply with and attain as a basis on which they could measure out the cost of the operation for them.  If there was a central authority specifying the environmental requirements this would meet the position.  The Americans, in particular, love to see the legislation to see what their rights are and what it will cost them and what their obligations are.  Very often these people have a half-a-dozen options before them when they are considering the location of a new industry.  They become very dissatisfied if they do not know clearly how they will be fixed.  The Minister has come out very quickly with the finding in relation to the Dublin Bay refinery project and that is good.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Deasy said about the impact of this on the farmer because, as the Parliamentary Secretary will know, slurry is only pumped eventually into rivers that are controlled.  There is no control at all in this Bill in the case of the farmer who spreads his slurry at inappropriate times&mdash;or appropriate according to the view he takes&mdash;so that the water washes it off to the river.  I recognise also the difficulties in enforcing control.  The Parliamentary Secretary is probably right when he says that it is only through the agricultural advisory service and the education of the people concerned that this kind of problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>Those who have to report our proceedings here in the morning paper find that if they do not get their material out in time the people will not read what we said here today.  If there is a date line it must be complied with unless there is some tolerance with regard to the date line, as I suspect there may be in certain situations. Assuming we are going to be stuck with the local authorities operating this spread-out machinery, dispersed manpower and skill, there is a right of appeal but there is no time limit on when the Minister may decide. I know that if I were able, and if I say to people who who would look to me for information: &ldquo;There is no time limit; I will tell you in 1990&rdquo; they <Col N="92" /> would then go off to somebody who would tell them in 1976.  We are the Legislature; we enact the laws.  The Executive propose the laws to us.  The Executive may not like some of the obligations of the laws.  I suggest we impose on the Minister and his advisers an obligation to make up his mind on an appeal within a specified time.  If we do not, we may stop projects which will not go on because the promoters will not wait indefinitely.  Other things quite unconnected with Ireland happen when time is passing.  A decision which is being made in favour of Ireland for a development is changed and the project is lost.  The quicker the standards are discoverable either by publication or from a central authority, the better.</P>
    <P>I would favour, though I am not an administrative person, the advice of some central authority.  The fact that these regulations are discoverable and changeable from time to time is important. They must change because there are technological changes affecting the effluent itself.  There will be increases in knowledge as to the effect of it, whether the effluent is changed in nature or not. There will be the general impact of a development on the people.</P>
    <P>In this House there were times when everybody thought you could spend money on anything and Senator Russell and I always said that there was a limit to the resources available whether you were referring to the city and state of New York or Ireland in a very bad depression.  There is always the limitation: you have to make a choice.  At this moment we have a situation in which we know we will have a growing population that we know will have to be housed when they grow up and marry.  It will be a national defeat of the first order if emigration starts again. It would have appallingly bad consequences on the people who remain. We know these things.  We know that they will need new schools and better facilities.  We know our resources are limited.  We know that the sewage and sanitary problem will be aggravated by the additional accommodation required.</P>
    <P>At this moment domestic savings are at an extraordinary high level. <Col N="93" /> There may be technical difficulties in the matter of borrowing in the sense of the ratio that is to be preserved between the level of national borrowing and the gross national product of last year.  But at this moment launching expenditure, financed by savings that are positively bulging out of the banks, to provide employment that would generate income which would provide revenue and come in relief with the Exchequer would surely be justified.  It would be, to a large degree, self-financing and would provide for a future when we know that all those things will be needed.</P>
    <P>I do not know who made the decision about the £20 million Grand Canal scheme but it was a good decision. That, with the developments in Ringsend and Poolbeg will greatly reduce the amenity problem created by the disregard of this problem over the previous 20 years.  Dublin Bay was one of our great glories from the point of view of the enjoyment of it by people who came to, or who lived in Dublin.  We should not regard the sums involved in coping with the Clondalkin Paper Mill effluent coming into the Camac and polluting the Liffey as anything other than creating wealth for the people even if it does not generate immediate cash.  Schemes like this should now be considered to put people to work.  This can be done without any foreign borrowing.  I would face the consequences of looking at the EEC Commission in a slightly repentant and explanatory mood with far greater heart than I look at the consequences of people unemployed who could be doing good work for the future of the country and for the future of their children.  In relation to this Bill I mean by that that the licensing should be taken away from the local authority and given to some central group or regional group advised by a central group.  The local authorities should be told: &ldquo;You have got such and such a period of time to put your house in order.  Here is a new scheme financed which should be well presented to the people which is going to be for the investors' benefit and the benefit of their children.  Their savings being <Col N="94" /> eroded in the bank by inflation are not going to be much good to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill for prosecutions by no less than three different authorities for breaches. That does not make any sense.  In relation to a new industry, Governments should consider, as they do in regard to their own manpower, the proper utilisation of manpower in the new industry, so that their work is worth while and properly directed. There will be communications to the boards of conservators, to the local authorities, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  Any one of the three can prosecute.  Any one of the three can make entry at any time, apparently, although, I presume reasonable times will be inserted in the order.</P>
    <P>With regard to the effectiveness of the prosecution, there is to be a presumption that what is certified to be the result of the analysis of a sample taken is correct.  There is no provision such as there is in the UK that, when the inspector of the water authority comes in and takes a sample, he must divide it into three parts and give one to the intended accused, so that the intended accused can find out what answer has he got.  In this case the public authority take the sample. There is no obligation to give any part of it to the alleged offender.  Is that fair?  Is that the Just Society we looked for&mdash;that the presumption should be in favour of the authority without any obligation on the authority to provide the persons alleged to have committed these environmental offences with a sample.  I do not think it is fair and I suggest it ought to be amended.</P>
    <P>I have covered a good deal of what I wanted to say, but I would not like to end on a note which did not recognise something I think ought to be recognised.  I am sure it may even lie behind the reason the Government, or the Department, have advised the Minister that the system of planning permissions has worked reasonably well.  Indeed it has, and it is right that I should say it.  In fact, since about 1970, when there was an increasing awareness that you could get industry <Col N="95" /> at too great an ultimate cost to the people, there has been an increasing tendency for the planning authority to specify what advice it has got in regard to what should be done by the company proposed to be set up.  Of course, both new and existing industries have found themselves in the position in the last five or six years, particularly the last three&mdash;and I am not saying that for a political reason but it happens to be true&mdash;that the Industrial Development Authority will not give grants to new industry and will not assist in the adaptation and re-equipment of old ones unless they can comply as far as possible with environmental requirements.</P>
    <P>In a situation where there was no legislation the answer one had to give people was, &ldquo;Look, the planning authority are sensible.  They are aware of the problem and concerned about it. The same applies to the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.&rdquo;  In the context of what I have said before, to some extent the work of these bodies has been anticipating the solution of the problem which has been raised for public debate, properly raised for public debate here.  But the debate is insufficiently informed about the nature of the criticisms.  First, there is the inter-departmental committee's report.  We do not know their recommendations. But many of these people must come from semi-Government bodies and therefore they are not buccaneers like ourselves who can say what we like. Their recommendations should be published. We should know what these criticisms are.  We should know what the problems are in full dimension.  If it is a question of cost, let us say it and let us know it.</P>
    <P>The fact that industrial pollution has to a very great extent been improved should be noted, though there are limitations.  Senator Russell, coming from an area where there is a lot of old industries, is aware of it.  It is all very well if you are looking for a re-equipment grant and are told that you will get it if you provide for the effluent resulting from the expansion involved. If I am informed correctly about <Col N="96" /> Limerick, there are 40 separate outlets pouring effluent into the waters in the area.  At least, Senator Russell said so. You see the nature of the problem.  It is very important.</P>
    <P>I will be saying a lot more on Committee Stage.  I will just mention one thing of purely academic interest.  Are there enormous problems in defining the sea, or is it simply good sense in not to having regard to the Law of the Sea Conference?  It is not in the Interpretation Act.  It had been defined in various statutes in different countries.  It would be useful for us, I think, to know.  Should there not be a definition of the sea?  Should we not look at it and perhaps have a lengthy debate on the definition section on Committee Stage and have a look at the words which appear throughout?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamWhyte" hpid="Mr. Whyte Mr. Whyte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Whyte</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming this Bill.  It is a Bill we ought to have had many years ago.  We are inclined to credit ourselves with having clean rivers and waterways.  We are entitled to do that because our country is largely undeveloped industrially, although it is well developed agriculturally. We have a considerable amount of pollution at present.  I suppose it is not reasonable to expect that this Bill could solve all the problems.  These problems could have been solved before now and ought to be solved from now on if we use our workforce properly.  Many of our towns and cities still discharge untreated sewage into our rivers.  This was not dealt with in the past because we had not the necessary legislation. In some cases the will was not there either.</P>
      <P>The authorities should take a serious look at this problem and do something about it.  I know it costs money, but it would create employment and use our raw materials.  The local authorities should not be the ones to grant licences.  While they may not be the major offenders, they offend in one way or another.  Therefore it would be hard to expect them to enforce the law when they are infringing it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of pollution <Col N="97" /> of our waterways is due to the new methods of agriculture.  The major portion of this pollution cannot be solved by any Bill.  The rain falls onto the land.  In earlier years the run-off from the land was pure and did not harm our streams.  Because of intensive agricultural production a considerable amount of artificial manure is being used.  Nobody notices this.  If you are passing along the country in a car you do not notice that artificial manure has been spread.  It does not offend your sense of smell and therefore goes unnoticed.  This concentrated manure gets into our rivers and streams and causes a considerable amount of damage.  No matter what laws we introduce it will not improve this position.  It is something that scientists will have to have a look at. I am sure it is being considered by scientists all over the world because many of the problems we are experiencing here are being experienced in other countries as well.</P>
    <P>There is no easy answer to this. When somebody refers to the fact that the law in relation to agriculture is not severe enough, I do not accept this.  A lot has been done up to now to minimise the amount of slurry and silage effluent going into our rivers.  In fact very little, if any, gets in because it is in the farmer's interest to ensure that slurry is available for the farm.  It may be offensive to your sense of smell, but it is doing less damage than artificial manure.  The farmer in his own interest will ensure that available manure is kept and spread on the land.  The laws in relation to pig stations, creameries and so on are fairly strict at present. Most of our advance in these matters has been made during the last few years.  The laws are there to ensure that pollution will not occur.  People engaged in the production of pigs on a large scale must ensure before they get a licence that they have either enough land to spread the slurry on or a proper disposal unit.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter which is of concern to a lot of people in my area: the pollution in Lough Derg.  It is one of the finest lakes in Europe and a lot of damage has been done already.  Much of the damage has <Col N="98" /> been done by those people I have referred to already, and it is not easy to do much about it.  Lough Derg was clear a few years ago but now in the summertime the water is green.  Many people who used to swim there do not like to do so anymore because you need a bath after swimming in Lough Derg.  A lot of pollution in Lough Derg is due to the run-off of artificial manure into our rivers and streams, which eventually finds its way to Lough Derg.  There is not much we can do at present but future scientific knowledge may help.</P>
    <P>We should do something with regard to peat pollution of the lake.  The production of peat is one of our biggest industries, an industry that has done a lot of useful work and gives a lot of employment.  I refer to Bord na Móna. I do not know whether research was done into the pollution caused by using milled peat, but it is evident that this is the most damaging way of using peat.  It powders up and is blown by the wind into rivers and streams.  It goes down-stream and settles in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>All of the Shannon from the midlands, where the inlets from the bogs are, down to the upper half of Lough Derg is dead as far as fishing is concerned. There are no fish there and it is moving further down Lough Derg every year.  In the Portumna area there was always very good fishing.  There is no fishing there any more, even on some of the strand you can see where peat has been washed up.  I accept that this has happened.  The people concerned with tourism in that area would be quite prepared to accept that it has happened provided this was publicly acknowledged by the authorities responsible for it and some effort made to ensure that it did not get any worse and that it would be improved in the future.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna may have come up with the answer and perhaps it may be that all that is needed is settling ponds for the silt before it gets into Lough Derg.  We have plenty of space to make these ponds.  We have plenty of sand and cement, if that is what is needed.  Our unemployed would be glad to work.  Even if it does cost a <Col N="99" /> lot to maintain silting plants, this is something that should be seriously looked at.  A few years ago, Bord na Móna found it difficult to sell their produce in competition with coal and oil.  Now the situation has changed.  It was a liability on the ESB to use the product of our bogs when oil was plentiful and cheap.  Now oil is very dear and the produce of our bogs is very competitive for the ESB.  There is no reason why, with this change in the financial circumstances of Bord na Móna, a considerable amount of money should not have been set aside to ensure that the pollution was lessened or stopped.  Now they propose to develop further bogs in that area and on the western side of the Shannon, and they have already made arrangements to ensure that it will not happen there.  They have made arrangements to provide a new source of water for one town.</P>
    <P>It is right to look back on the harm that has been done and to ensure that it will not continue to happen.  Lough Derg is one of our finest lakes, probably the finest lake in Europe, extensively used by people for swimming, boating and so on.  The fish life is destroyed there.  Nothing has been done about it.  We are told that teams of officials are looking after it, taking measurements.  We do not need this. All you need to do is to walk by the lake and you can see what is happening. All you need to do is go down to the lake in summertime and see the colour of the water.  This will have to be tackled.  We have the manpower and the native materials and we should have the will.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to imply that Bord na Móna have done a bad job.  They have done quite a good job.  They have given a lot of employment and produced a lot of material for use by the ESB.  The ESB have been doing a good job in so far as our fisheries are concerned.  They continue to restock our lakes and rivers.  The source of the problem is our main waterway. Peat pollution is causing a huge problem there.  It needs to be seriously looked at.  If this debate does no more than highlight this problem then it <Col N="100" /> will be doing a useful job.  That is my main interest at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  We should have had it earlier, but better late than never.  I should like the Minister to particularly consider the items I have raised with regard to Lough Derg to see if anything can be done to improve the position that obtains there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWalsh" hpid="Miss Walsh Miss Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue because we have been operating on laws which are antediluvian as regards pollution.  Pollution has in recent years become a commonplace word&mdash;20 years ago it was hardly ever used&mdash;but so has the word &ldquo;industrialisation&rdquo;.  We need to ensure that, in promoting industry, we will not sacrifice our national heritage, which embraces pure air, green grass and clear water.  Are we going to sacrifice this heritage on the altar of employment?  A clear line of demarcation must be used and we must get our priorities straight.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for many reasons.  I welcome it particularly because the Minister is going to impose realistic penalties.  Heretofore, an industry could be fined a nominal sum of £50 or £100, which was ludicrous. The difference between the installation cost of anti-pollution devices, or whatever machinery that would have to be installed to alleviate pollution from any particular industry, and the maximum fine is enormous.  The fine for a first industrial offence, or even an agricultural offence, should be at least £1,000 and for a second and third £2,000.  This is a very serious problem.  We speak of Ireland as a tourist country.  We advertise lavishly in every country in the world our fishing, hunting and shooting.  We cannot fish in polluted water because there are no fish to fish.  It is as easy as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of pollution under the archaic Act was that it was deleterious matter, that is, any substance, either liquid or gas, which was harmful to fish or the food of fish.  We must get a definition of pollution which will cover all modern pollutants.  This would embrace the disposal of disused <Col N="101" /> cars and of plastic containers of all descriptions.  The Slaney is, perhaps, one of our finest fishing rivers.  Within less than 30 yards of the main road, there are up to 40 disused car bodies dumped in that river.  Perhaps car bodies do not create pollution.  I do not know whether they rust or disintegrate sufficiently to kill fish, but nevertheless they are unsightly objects in a river as important to our national fishing industry as the Slaney.</P>
    <P>We have been far too lenient.  I disagree with the idea of planning authorities having the final say in this because they have been and are at present some of the biggest offenders with regard to pollution.  In recent times, since the passing of the Planning Act, 1963, much more care has been given to the disposal of sewage.  We have got to deal with those towns and villages where sewerage systems are still leaving something to be desired.  To give the final say to the planning authority would be like going to law with the devil and holding the court in Hell.  I would hope, as Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, there would be a three-way system with regard to the enforcement of penalties.</P>
    <P>I agree with the promotion of agriculture in all it facets, but I do believe &mdash;and I withdraw it if my information is not correct&mdash;that the pollution from one silage pit is equivalent to the pollution from a town with a population of 12,000 people.  If that figure is correct, I would hate to think of the amount of pollution that is being created in all our rivers.  Many silage pits have been established on farms throughout the country, and planning permission was not sought for some of them.  In fact, it is just a case of establishing a silage pit on any disused corner of the farm, irrespective of where the effluent is going to go.  This is vitally important and must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that when it becomes law any infringement of it will be dealt with as severely as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I did not intend to speak on it because sufficient has been said on it already, but I feel it is only right that <Col N="102" /> some member of the agricultural community should reply to some of the statements made today.  What I have to say deals with agricultural pollution only.</P>
      <P>The last speaker stated that one silage pit can do as much harm as a town with a population of 12,000.  I do not know where the Senator got this information but I doubt that it is true.  I do not think anyone would believe it.  The Senator mentioned that farmers did not care where they built silage pits.  That is true.  Farmers did not need to get planning permission and they still do not need it.  I never agreed with that because farmers are inclined to build pits near public roads and, if nothing else, these pits are unsightly.  However, that situation has been rectified to a certain extent because a grant will not be given to build a silage pit unless a septic tank is built as well.  I know that a septic tank could also be built on the side of the road and that would create further problems but at least any silage pit now being built will not pollute rivers because a septic tank must be provided.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald spoke about farmers spraying liquid fertilisers.  He implied that some of this fertiliser was washed away and eventually entered the rivers.  I do not agree with that because liquid fertiliser is not a heavy spray and could not be washed away. It is a mistaken idea held by many people that artificial fertilisers sprayed on the land eventually seep into the rivers.  I do not believe that.  Artificial fertilisers are expensive and they are spread only at a ratio of three or five cwts to the acre.  There is no doubt there could be seepage into rivers from pig stations but, on the whole, the amount of pollution caused by the agricultural sector is very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  In regard to the timing of the Bill, the circumstances in which it has been introduced and the course it should follow in its general application, planning for anti-pollution methods and devices, whether in industry or in agriculture, is something <Col N="103" /> which has become necessary in the recent past.  That being so, additional requirements should be associated with education rather than with the provision of penalties as a deterrent to people who might transgress the law.</P>
      <P>As far as the agricultural community are concerned, every Member of this House who has an agricultural background will be able to recall silage pits located on river banks. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries paid grants for these pits.  It was only in more recent times it dawned on departmental officials that silage pits were a source of pollution, a danger to fish life and to cattle drinking polluted water, to say nothing of pollution seeping into wells from which domestic water supplies were taken.  These are some of the problems of water pollution with which everybody has become acquainted in the last eight to ten years.  It follows inevitably that, with the greater use of silage and greater industrialisation generally, more pollution will occur and so the protection of our water supplies has become an urgent necessity.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken the right course in this matter.  In order to ensure that penalties will not be incurred as a result of this Bill, those who might possibly transgress, be they farmers or anybody else will now be put on notice that a very rigid code has been laid down to control pollution from whatever source.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish the Parliamentary Secretary success with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. O.J. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my sincere and grateful thanks to Senators for their contributions to the Bill.  I am pleased that this legislation has received a general welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said this legislation is long overdue.  I do not dispute that, but Senators will recall that three years ago, when the National Coalition Government took office, they planned <Col N="104" /> a detailed policy in relation to the environment.  Certain priorities had to be laid down in implementing that environmental policy.  First, the Government had to deal with planning. Local Government Planning legislation came before the Dáil and the Seanad.  Then, in order to keep to priorities, it was necessary to introduce this Bill dealing with water pollution. There is great need for this Bill. I was pleased to hear so many Senators express their views in relation to the importance of this Bill.  I appreciate the variety of expressions of opinion.  I know that to cover all aspects of the Bill on Second Reading is almost impossible but there will be an opportunity on the Committee Stage for examining it in detail and I assure Senators that any amendments they submit will be fully considered.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that the control of water pollution will require a tremendous amount of co-operation from all sections of the community, from the industrialist, the farmer, local authorities and so on.  But, even if we have their full co-operation, we will also require the support, sympathy and vigilance of all the people.</P>
    <P>Questions were raised by Senators with regard to the position of local authorities.  In my opinion the local authorities are the proper authorities to implement these provisions.  If we were to establish new catchment boards, regional boards or a national board to deal with the problem of water pollution we would have to start from scratch.  In local authorities a structure already exists with engineering staff and other technical advisers. It is right, therefore, that local authorities should have full control and be responsible for licensing.</P>
    <P>The Government are pledged to give greater responsibility to local authorities. It is our policy to encourage local authorities to take more responsibility and so we are making them responsible for licensing and for other controls under this legislation. They will become more involved.  The elected representatives will be in close touch with the public and they are fully alert to the seriousness of the problem of water pollution.  They will be quick to observe pollution by <Col N="105" /> obnoxious discharges into rivers and lakes.  It is essential that this responsibility should be given to local authorities.  With sincere, genuine activity and zeal there will be a marked improvement in the position.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that no time will be lost in giving effect to this Bill. Senator West said that environmental legislation was not given the degree of importance to which it was entitled so I am concerned that this Bill should be on the Statute Book with the least possible delay, together with the Planning Bill which has had its Second Reading in the House.  When we are dealing with the environment it is essential that we should deal with every aspect of it.  Indeed there is a need for even wider legislation to deal with environmental problems.  We have for example a serious litter and waste problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Aherne referred to the cleaning of beaches, removing litter and broken glass from them and making them safe and attractive.  She also referred to the problem of sewage and polluted water flowing on to beaches.  It is vital that this should be remedied.  The Senator spoke about Ballyheigue and Ballybunion.  Unfortunately the same conditions prevail on a number of our beaches.  Something will have to be done to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of improving our environment that in new housing schemes electric cables should be placed underground as far as possible.  If finances permit, telephone cables in both new and old housing areas should also be put underground, if possible.  There must be an energetic drive to keep our country clean and tidy to ensure a clean and healthy environment.</P>
    <P>It is tragic to read of the damage done by pollution to our rivers and lakes.  We have some of the best coarse fishing in Europe.  Some of our best salmon fisheries are in the south.  We also have excellent trout fisheries.  It is nothing short of criminal the way in which stocks have been on occasion wiped out by pollution.  The Inland Fisheries Trust have done a tremendous amount of work in stocking <Col N="106" /> our lakes and rivers and the expenditure involved has been considerable. Tourists, particularly the French, are attracted here to enjoy our fishing facilities but, because of carelessness and neglect, because of the poisoning of our waters, we are in danger of losing the much needed business generated by these visitors. It is regrettable that because of carelessness we should deprive ourselves of the great benefits that should accrue from our fisheries.  It is time an effort was made to put a stop to this pollution.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will be the best people to deal with the situation. Members of county councils and county borough councils will not be slow in reporting to the responsible local authority officer if fisheries are injured or the facilities available are damaged in any way and suitable action will follow.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that the penalties provided can be regarded as more severe than those we have had in the past.  Senator Walsh thinks they should be more severe.  I sympathise with the Senator because quite an amount of this pollution can be prevented and steps will have to be taken against those who continue to pollute our waters.  It is not true to say the local authorities will be subject to no control under the Bill.  The Bill will enable the Minister to impose standards governing discharge from local authority sewerage systems and the local authorities will be legally obliged to comply with any such standards.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have stated that local authorities are themselves the greatest offenders.  That may or may not be, but it should be borne in mind that many older sewerage schemes have recently had treatment facilities provided. Improvements are in progress or in planning in other cases.  Senator Keegan referred to a case in Mullingar and I would like to inform him here that improvements were carried out there.  As time goes on the situation will be more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In 1972-73 £8 million was provided for sanitary services.  That figure has increased to £19 million in the current <Col N="107" /> financial year.  There are proposals in the Department of Local Government which when put into effect will be of tremendous assistance to local authorities in solving this problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the water pollution advisory council.  The council have performed an outstanding service in this regard.  They have given consideration to the question of an educational programme, with suitable publicity, aimed at creating greater public awareness of the need to prevent water pollution.  Publicity projects already undertaken by the council include the provision of the stand at the recent RDS Spring Show.  I am sure many Senators who visited the Spring Show took great interest and pride in that stand.  I have already paid tribute to the water advisory council for their foresight in providing such an attractive stand, a stand which created such interest.  The uses and abuses of our water resources were illustrated. An anti-pollution poster slogan competition was also promoted for schoolchildren and that competition generated immense enthusiasm among the younger generation.  Over 1,700 entries were received.  That shows the younger people are actively concerned with this problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the question of industrial pollution.  Industrialists usually take every possible precaution to ensure that pollution is avoided and, when this Bill is passed, I am sure there will be greater co-operation between industrialists and the local authority representatives and officials. I am sure many of the problems that now exist will be solved.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority, through the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, carried out a survey of pollution in Ireland. The following is an extract from page 6 of an edited form of the survey published in April, 1976:</P>
    <P>The adequate and satisfactory disposal of piped sewerage will improve substantially when work on schemes now under construction is completed.  Then more than 88 per <Col N="108" /> cent of the country's domestic sewerage will be disposed of without any threat to our natural water resources.</P>
    <P>That report is encouraging and this Bill will be instrumental in bringing about a satisfactory solution.  This legislation is not alone desirable but should have outstanding beneficial results for the future.</P>
    <P>I wish to express thanks to the Senators for the common-sense manner in which they have approached this problem and for the tributes they paid to the Bill.  It is encouraging that the Bill should receive such a welcome from both sides of the House. It is not possible to go into all the points raised but I will give them full consideration.  I am not dealing with the special or individual areas of pollution mentioned.  We have them all over the country and it would not be right for me to mention one without mentioning all.  Pollution is a very serious problem and the co-operation of every local authority and, above all, of the general public is essential in solving the problem.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I am sure many Senators feel there is room for improvement in this Bill. We will have an opportunity, of course, of dealing with it in greater detail on the Committee Stage.  I strongly recommend this Bill to the House.  If Senators have any strong views on any aspect of the Bill there is nothing to prevent them putting down suitable amendments.  I want to assure Senators that all information which they may require about any aspect of the Bill will be made available to them in order to reinforce them in the knowledge that this legislation is both necessary and desirable. I agree it is overdue but something is now being done to solve this important problem, something recognised as a matter of the greatest possible urgency.</P>
