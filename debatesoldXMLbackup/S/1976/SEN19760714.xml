      <P>It is proposed to take No. 1 and to break for lunch from 1 p.m. to 2.15 p.m.  I should mention also that the Taoiseach proposes to make a statement to the House arising from the recent EEC Summit meeting and I propose that we interrupt business at 4 o'clock to hear the statement of the Taoiseach. I think it would be proper at this stage to express appreciation from all sides of the House that the Seanad is being recognised in this way.  I think it is the first occasion on which it has happened, presumably because the other House is not sitting.  It is well to record that the position of the Seanad, as one of the Houses of Parliament being in session, is being recognised in the fact that the Taoiseach is coming to make the statement here.  I suggest we interrupt business at 4 o'clock to hear the Taoiseach and whatever other contributions are allowed following it and then resume on No. 1.</P>

      <P>Let us not anticipate what the statement might contain.  As Senators are aware, there is no precedent in the House, as Senator O'Higgins has mentioned. I will permit a short comment by the Leader of the Opposition and one comment from the Independent Senators. In the Dáil, which is the nearest precedent we can act on, they allow comment from the Leaders of the Opposition parties.  Senators will appreciate that it is not a debate.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that it is not a debate but, at the same time, if the Taoiseach feels that this is an important statement and, as the Leader of the House said he is honouring the Seanad by making the statement here, I think it would be wrong to have Members of the Seanad gagged in making observations on the subject matter of that statement, whatever it might be.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to appropriate formally the amounts voted by the Dáil for the supply services.  This year's Bill follows the general pattern of previous Appropriation Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 1, which is the principal section, appropriates to the specific services set out in the Schedule to the Bill the sum of £1,693,491,010 comprising the sum of £171,559,010 in respect of Supplementary Estimates for 1975 which were not included in last year's Appropriation Act and £1,521,932,000 in respect of the Estimates for 1976. The section also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts, amounting in total to £157,304,504, as appropriations-in-aid: these are detailed in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Authority to issue out of the Central Fund in respect of the items to be appropriated is contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act, 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> The debate on the Bill gives the Seanad an opportunity to debate in detail the expenditure contained in the Bill and to discuss expenditure and financial policies in general.  On this occasion, I wish to avail of the opportunity to discuss the general economic situation.</P>
    <P>As everyone is by now aware, 1975 was for the western world one of the worst years in economic terms since the depression of the 1930s.  Output in most western economies fell and unemployment rose sharply.  Because we, as a nation, are dependent to a greater extent than most on trade with other countries, we could not escape the effects of a recession which afflicted so severely the economies of our trading partners.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that our national product fell by an estimated 1 per cent in 1975.  What is surprising and, in the circumstances, gratifying is that the fall was not greater.  Indeed, many economic commentators writing in the closing months of the year were expecting declines in real GNP for 1975 of between 3 and 4 per cent.  They were wrong.</P>
    <P>The fact that our economic performance last year was somewhat better than expected is due to the recovery which set in during the final months of 1975.  This was in marked contrast to the earlier part of the year when industrial output and employment were falling, consumer demand stagnating and investment being curtailed.  In this period, too, the underlying trend in unemployment was rising.  The lowest point of the recession was, however, reached during the third quarter of 1975.  The economy began to recover in the last three or four months of the year and this welcome trend is continuing.</P>
    <P>The single, most important element of domestic demand is personal expenditure on consumer goods and services. Accounting, as it does, for about two-thirds of GNP, the implications of a slump in consumer demand for the growth of our national product are obvious.  During the recession rising unemployment and inflation combined to erode real incomes.  In addition, the prevailing <Col N="1264" /> economic uncertainty helped to push savings to abnormally high levels. These factors reduced the level of real spending and this led to a sharp fall in the volume of retail sales in the first eight months of last year.</P>
    <P>The budgetary measures of June, 1975, which cut the rate of inflation, boosted real incomes in the remaining months of the year.  That, coupled with rising social welfare payments and a recovery in agricultural incomes, stimulated consumer expenditure. In the last four months of 1975 the volume of retail sales rose by almost 5 per cent as compared with the same period in 1974, contrasting markedly with the 6 per cent fall in their volume in the previous eight months.  Nevertheless, the recovery was not sufficient to offset the depressed conditions of the earlier part of the year and real consumer expenditure fell by an estimated 2½ per cent in 1975 as a whole.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the average increase in the consumer price index was almost 21 per cent, more than 3 per cent below Britain where the increase in consumer prices was 24¼ per cent.  The lower inflation rate in Ireland in 1975 was attributable to steps taken by the Government to cut the increase in consumer prices and so initiate a winding down of the price/wage spiral.  Subsidies on certain food and other items in the consumer price index were introduced.  These had the effect of reducing the increase in the consumer price index at mid-August by four percentage points.  In fact, between May and August, 1975, the consumer price index recorded a net fall of 0.8 per cent&mdash;its first decline in 12 years.  VAT was also removed from clothes, footwear and other items.  This was followed by a rise of less than 3 per cent at mid-November. The deceleration in the rate of inflation in the second half of 1975 was so dramatic that in the six months to mid-November the total rise in the consumer price index was less than 2 per cent as compared with 14½ per cent in the previous six months.</P>
    <P>Following the record balance of payments deficit of £288 million incurred in 1974, last year saw a remarkable <Col N="1265" /> turnaround in our external payments position.  The balance of payments deficit in 1975 is estimated to have been only £15 million.  This development is largely attributable to a sharp decline in the volume of our imports&mdash;a reflection of the low level of economic activity which pertained for most of the year.  On the plus side, however, an exceptionally high level of agricultural exports, together with higher receipts from tourism and a significant increase in net transfers from the EEC, also contributed to the reduction in the balance of payments deficit.</P>
    <P>While the volume of imports fell for the year as a whole, they revived strongly from September on.  This was particularly evident in the case of imports of materials for further production, reflecting both the improvement in domestic output which occurred at that time and the reconstitution of stocks which had been run-down during the recession. Because of the low levels of activity in the economies of our trading partners early in the year, our industrial exports were depressed for most of 1975.  However, with the onset of recovery in the major economies in the second half of the year our industrial exports in the last four months of 1975 began to grow rapidly again.</P>
    <P>The volume of industrial output fell by over 6 per cent in 1975 as a whole. As in the case of consumer demand and trade, however, there was an improvement in its trend within the year. The decline in the trend in production, which began early in 1974, was halted in the third quarter of 1975. With the revival of consumer expenditure and increased demand on foreign markets for our industrial goods in the final quarter of the year, the trend of production turned up.  Output in the manufacturing sector was 3 per cent higher in the fourth quarter of 1975 than in the previous three months.</P>
    <P>Output in the building industry is estimated to have fallen by about 6 per cent last year, largely due to depressed activity in the non-housing area of the industry where the effect of the postponement of investment decisions during the recession was most severely <Col N="1266" /> felt.  Towards the end of 1975, however, some improvement in building activity became apparent.</P>
    <P>While for most of 1975 conditions in the non-agricultural sector of the economy were depressed, it is heartening to review developments in agriculture. Last year was, in fact, one of the best ever in this important sector of the Irish economy.  In complete contrast to 1974, there was strong demand and a great improvement in prices for our agricultural products on foreign markets.  As a result, sales of livestock and livestock products increased substantially. Indeed, the fact that there was some growth in total exports last year is entirely attributable to buoyant demand abroad for our agricultural output.  Because of the growth in its main products and, it must be added, a decline in inputs such as seeds, feeding stuffs and fertilisers, the volume of net agricultural output rose by about 10½ per cent in 1975 and, as a consequence, farmers' incomes increased by over 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>With the decline in economic activity in 1975, employment also fell.  In transportable goods industries the average fall in numbers at work was 15,000 or almost 7 per cent.  Employment in the building industry fell by nearly 9 per cent.  At the same time, the underlying trend in the number of unemployed persons on the live register was rising.  The emergence of recovery in the last three or four months of 1975 was, however, echoed in an improvement in conditions on the labour market.  At the end of the year the decline in industrial employment was halted and the trend in unemployment began to stabilise.</P>
    <P>In drawing up their policy for 1976, the Government had to contend with the two major problems besetting the economy&mdash;unemployment and inflation. Inflation had to get priority. Firstly, it was to a great extent of domestic origin, whereas the unemployment problem was basically a product of the international recession. Secondly, it seriously jeopardised our longer-term prospects for growth and job-creation.</P>
    <P>The Government have long made clear that, because of our dependence <Col N="1267" /> on exports, a substantial cut in the rate of income increase was essential to our future economic progress; indeed this was the object of the novel measures introduced in June 1975.  It was also felt that inflation in Britain and the depreciation of sterling, which had hitherto afforded a measure of relief from the erosive effect of wage inflation on our international competitiveness, would not last much longer.  The Government therefore proposed a solution, which the Taoiseach put to the social partners and the nation in December last.  This was stark but simple&mdash;a pay pause after the end of the 1975 National Agreement.</P>
    <P>As regards the immediate employment problems, scope for budgetary action was restricted by the undesirability of increasing the difficulties in the public finances, a consequence both of the recession itself and of the many steps taken to mitigate its impact on the domestic economy, especially on employment.  The 1976 budget was designed to provide the greatest possible stimulus, within this constraint, to economic activity. Priority was given to expenditures which contribute significantly to economic activity in general and to employment in particular.  The central element in this strategy was the public capital programme for 1976 which was settled at nearly £600 million&mdash; almost £130 million, or 28 per cent, more than capital expenditure in 1975.  The current budget, although largely redistributive in nature, also took account of the needs of the economy, the revenue necessary to meet general increases in costs and to raise socially desirable transfers being derived from taxation of less-essential commodities.  Overall, the effect of budgetary policy was estimated, assuming a pause in domestic incomes, to raise this year's growth rate by 1 per cent to about 2 per cent with consequential benefits for employment.</P>
    <P>Nearly six months have now elapsed since the budget.  In the interim the pace of world economic recovery has turned out to be rather stronger than earlier envisaged.  However, our <Col N="1268" /> dependence on the UK market, which is still expected to grow relatively slowly, will hold back our exports. Nevertheless, it is clear from the trade statistics that we are already benefiting considerably from the recovery in external demand: in the first five months of this year our industrial exports were 30 per cent higher in value than in the same period of 1975.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front, all the information available points to a continuation of the recovery so far this year.  In the first quarter, the volume of retail sales&mdash;the prime indicator of consumer demand was 7 per cent greater than in the same period of 1975.  While this may well include some additional buying in anticipation of the tax increases, it does suggest an improvement in consumer confidence. Indications of investment, too, are evincing signs of improved activity. Further evidence of a general revival in demand and output is provided by the upward trend of imports in the first five months of 1976.</P>
    <P>We have as yet no hard information on industrial production this year but recent business surveys show a consistent improvement in output.  The new constant-tax price index which is the best indicator of underlying inflation showed rises of 4.5 per cent and 4.4 per cent at mid-February and at mid-May respectively.  But, as happened last year, we anticipate that inflation will slow down for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The major uncertainty in looking forward to the rest of 1976 and indeed to the years beyond is the trend of incomes. Regrettably the Government's call for a pay pause until the end of the year did not receive the response which could have conferred most benefit on the whole community.  The possibility of a national pay norm remains unsettled. The Government are anxiously pursuing with the social partners the best way of obtaining income developments compatible with the overall national interest.  I hope that the pay settlements which may emerge will be sufficiently moderate to meet vital national economic needs.</P>
    <P>Given the increase in this year's capital budget and an improving economic climate supported by orderly <Col N="1269" /> and reasonable pay developments, demand should show a further increase in the second half of the year.  The volume of industrial exports should continue buoyant over the coming months.  Because of supply constraint the outlook for agricultural exports is less favourable.  As for investment, the large increase in the allocation for the public capital programme should, despite the likely sluggishness of private sector activity, induce an overall volume rise.  In brief, a GNP growth rate of slightly more than 2 per cent now seems a realistic prospect.  Those who would point out that this forecast does not accord with another one recently published would do well to remember that last year's outturn was better than some pessimistic forecasts said it would be.</P>
    <P>While imports, in view of last year's abnormally low level and the outlook for home demand, may show a substantial volume increase, the balance of payments deficit for 1976 should be of manageable proportions.  As regards inflation, the quarterly rate of price increase is expected to slow in the second half of the year so that the annual outturn should be better than in 1975, if nevertheless still disquieting.  Although the employment situation should begin to improve towards the end of the year, in response to the renewed expansion of output, unemployment in Ireland as elsewhere in the European Community is likely to remain at an unacceptably high level for quite some time.  So far as Ireland is concerned unduly generous wage settlements at this time would, through their effect on competitiveness, be seriously detrimental to export prospects in 1977 and later and thereby make more intractable the primary national problem of unemployment. We must remember the longer-term dimension of this problem which is undoubtedly the more important.  We have to create many thousands of additional jobs annually for the next few years, both to cater for our growing population and to reduce unemployment from its present level.  The targets we will have to meet are much greater than those achieved over similar periods in the past.  Clearly, a radical approach is required&mdash;in particular a fundamental change in our attitudes.  A high <Col N="1270" /> rate of export-led growth is a prerequisite to the solution of our longer-term, as indeed of our short-term, unemployment problem.  Although we can anticipate assistance from a more rapid pace of expansion internationally, especially in the post-recession phase, this alone will not suffice.  We must capture an ever-larger share of world markets, recapture and hold on to a larger share of a growing home market, an outcome which relies to a large extent on whether or not we disimprove or improve our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have now sketched out the general economic background against which this year's Appropriation Bill is being introduced.  The problems facing Ireland are not of recent origin.  Some are attributable to disadvantages of naure and geography and others to a certain lack of discipline in our national character.  As the National Economic and Social Council pointed out, they have been with us for a couple of decades and no group&mdash; political, vocational, privileged or unprivileged&mdash;is entirely blameless for many of our shortcomings.  In so far as our difficulties were at least in part preventable or curable by our own behaviour, we have lost out unnecessarily. As a nation we have not faced up to the hard decisions which have to be taken to get and keep this country on the right tracks.  The time for knocking is over.  The nation needs and, above all, has the right to expect from its public representatives objective criticism and sincerity. The kind of knocking to which I refer is exemplified in <i>The Irish Press</i> today, which carries a headline saying &ldquo;Budget Rule by Brussels.  EEC Aid&mdash; But With Strings&rdquo;.  The same newspaper contains a leading article which has several falsehoods.  As the whole tenor of the two articles in question is at variance with what the EEC has said about the Irish economic position and as the effect of the articles, if taken seriously, would be damaging to the country, I feel it is necessary to refer to them.  If knocks are delivered then those who are knocked have a right and an obligation to defend themselves particularly when the interest of the nation is at stake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> The leading article in today's <i>Irish Press</i> says that:</P>
    <P>The European Community is unhappy about the way the Government are implementing the conditions attached to our last loan of £150 million.</P>
    <P>That is a falsehood.  The EEC have not expressed any view whatsoever about the fulfilment of the conditions. If they were to express a view, the view would have to be that the Government are conforming entirely to the conditions which are policies which the Government themselves of their own volition have spelt out in the budget statement which I presented in Dáil Éireann in January last.</P>
    <P>Further statements in <i>The Irish Press</i> today, to the effect that the EEC proposes to dictate to this country how to manage its current and capital expenditure, are also without foundation.  The reality behind the story is that Ireland, in common with other countries, has been pressing for better efforts on the part of the Community to see a convergence of economic policy.  This involves a transfer of resources from the better off areas of the Community to the less well off. That is inherent in the obligations of the Rome Treaty.  Therefore, rather than having any reason to disapprove of any exhoration from the heads of Government in Brussels yesterday, this country is glad to hear that what it had been pleading for for so long has now been accepted as being the correct policy for the Community. That is one which would see a proper convergence of economic policies which is a great deal more than the question merely of convergence of budgetary policies.  Common economic conditions require that those areas of the Community which are unable from their own resources to attain the same standards of living as the better off sections of the Community should receive help from that Community in order to move in the direction which the Community was set up to achieve for all, and that is a better and an equal standard of living for all members of the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> This country is proceeding on the lines that our own prudence requires us to follow.  Those lines are also in conformity with the general objectives of the Community.  I am glad that the Community accepts the need to give assistance to the less well-off members of the Community so that Community objectives can be achieved.</P>
    <P>We can discuss our economic problems. We will no doubt have disagreements about them, but I would hope that the debate in this House as elsewhere in the next few months will be constructive and that old style of knocking and the attitude of &ldquo;You are always wrong and we are always right&rdquo; will be left behind.  I would remind the House that a distinguished economist, Professor Patrick Lynch, said on radio last Monday that the reason for the failure of the three economic plans in this country since 1958 was due to a lack of discipline, which, he said, was not on the part of the Department of Finance but on the part of other Departments.  He considered that the public sector behaviour was not as good as that of the private sector.  I am not saying that the Department of Finance are without blame.  I am not for one moment suggesting that I, personally, have not got my shortcomings.  What I am saying is that when an objective expert says that blame has to be shared by all, then objective people ought to bear that in mind whenever they propose to make comment on the economic and financial situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard a speech which, even by the standards set by this Minister, seems to be an astonishing one.  He has come in here at a time of grave national crisis, at a time when not merely in this country but in other countries and throughout the EEC, there is a recognition that the situation of Ireland is very grave indeed and that Ireland is now capturing attention as the one country in the EEC which has very serious economic and financial problems with no real prospect that outsiders or Irish people can see of solving them in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> In this current situation we have a speech from the Minister which ignores the gravity of our problems, suggests that all is going pretty well and things are improving.  The impression that a complete stranger knowing nothing about our affairs would get from this speech would be that while we have problems&mdash;all countries have problems&mdash;ours are no worse than those of anybody else.  It was an extraordinary speech, even by the standards of this Minister who has come in here year after year, since 1973 saying: &ldquo;Well, all right then, there may be this difficulty, there may be that difficulty, but the second half of the year is going to be grand.  Everything is going to improve; there is no real need to worry&rdquo;.  This is the kind of impression that the Minister always tends to give.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech he apparently opted out of Government.  He said that no group, political, vocational, privileged or unprivileged, is blameless for many of our shortcomings. The Government are not mentioned of course.  He said:</P>
    <P>In so far as our difficulties were at least in part preventable or curable by our own behaviour we have lost out unnecessarily.  As a nation we have not faced up to the hard decisions which have to be taken to get and to keep this country on the right tracks.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to this question of knocking which, coming from the champion knocker of all times when he was in Opposition, strikes me as rather curious.  Nonetheless, as a nation we have not faced up to the hard decisions.  How can a nation, as such, face up to hard decisions when we have at present enormous unemployment, inflation worse than anywhere in Europe and a serious balance of payments problem, which the Minister does not appear to consider a problem?  There are economic, social and financial problems of the utmost gravity.  In these kind of circumstances a nation, as such, cannot deal with these problems.  It is a matter for our Government.  The Government have to a large extent <Col N="1274" /> created them, but whether they have created them or not it is the duty of the Government to tell the nation how these things can be solved and not just tell the nation to take the necessary action.  To try to fob the whole thing off by saying cheerfully that no section is blameless, the nation needs to do something about it and so on, is ludicrous.  The Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance are responsible.</P>
    <P>At the end of his speech, after his reference to knocking, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The nation needs and, above all, has the right to expect from its public representative objective criticism and sincerity.</P>
    <P>He then refers to <i>The Irish Press.</i> I have not read the leading article so I am in no position to defend it. Whatever the leading article may have said, the Minister's definition of the Community attitude to Ireland is not in accordance with the known facts.  I understand that no decision has been taken about the Community in regard to economic policies which would be binding on the Government.</P>
    <P>I should refer to the preliminary report of the proceedings of the European Parliament for 7th July when as reported at page 183 a statement was made by Mr. Gundelach on behalf of the European Commission with regard to the condition of the Irish economy.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the latest Communication to the Council on economic policy to be.  followed in 1976 and in the budgets for 1977,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I take it that this communication to the Council is the one that is now being accepted by the Council and was commented on in this morning's newspapers</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Commission recommended that Irish budgetary policy in 1977 should aim, in conjunction with an appropriate incomes and prices policy at a strict limitation on <Col N="1275" /> salaries, social transfers and other current expenditure together with possibly a modest increase in taxation.  These guidelines are in line with those approved by the Council when fixing the conditions for economic policy in connection with the Community loan to Ireland.</P>

      <P>This is an official pronouncement on the part of the Commission made last week to the European Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying what the Commissioner told us in the European Parliament.  But the Minister has been very casual with regard to the conditions laid down for this loan.  He was interviewed, for example, on the day the loan was announced by one of the newspapers&mdash;I think it was the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;and he said that these are not conditions, they are more in the nature of exhortations.  They are not exhortations and it was dangerous in the extreme, hazardous in the extreme, reckless in the extreme for a Minister for Finance who had just borrowed £150 million on conditions, to start saying in public that these were not conditions at all, that they were merely more in the nature of exhortations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the implications of this statement of these conditions.  I take it that the Minister hesitated very long before he agreed to borrow this money because of the type of conditions that would be imposed.  The finance of the country had been put by him into such a state that it was essential in order to keep us going at all to take £150 million.  But as a <i>quid pro quo</i> he agreed to those conditions. In other words, he agreed that there would be strict limitation on salaries, that social transfers would have to have a strict limitation.  We have already seen in this budget for 1976 that social transfer, that is social welfare payments, old-age pensions, unemployment assistance, unemployment <Col N="1276" /> benefit and so on, have not in any way matched the potential increases in the cost of living.  The increase in the payments was around 10 per cent but in the first six months of this year the cost of living went up by 14 per cent&mdash; helped considerably, of course, by the Minister and his Budget.  There will be a further increase in the next six months.  One does not know whether it will be 4, 5, 6, or 7 per cent but those who need these social welfare payments, the old, the unemployed, the sick and so on, will have a fall this year in their living standards and apparently they will have a still more severe fall next year because the Minister has agreed with this condition that social transfers, that is social welfare payments, will be subject to a strict limitation in his 1977 budget.  He also has agreed that there will be a strict limitation on current expenditure, that is current expenditure generally.</P>
    <P>This is a poor look out for employment.  It is a poor look out for education, the health services and all the other services that have to be maintained by the State.  The Minister who complained so bitterly about references to these matters in this morning's papers has apparently completely forgotten that he agreed to these conditions when accepting the EEC loan.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner went on to say in the next paragraph:</P>
    <P>If some guidelines will not be followed&mdash;here I am specially thinking of the pledge for an incomes and prices policy&mdash;other measures will need to be adopted, if not employment and the balance of payment shall be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>We all know, of course, that the pledge for an incomes and prices policy is not being followed.  The incomes and prices policy if it ever existed at all is in shreds.  It would appear that an 18 per cent increase is the minimum one can expect. That would involve a 4 per cent increase in the last six months of this year which would be pretty low. We shall be very fortunate if we can get out of it that well.  The figure may well be 20 per cent but certainly <Col N="1277" /> 18 per cent is as low as one can reasonably expect it to be.  Quite clearly that will mean that the type of prices policy that the Commission expected us to follow has not succeeded.  Incomes policy is quite obviously in shreds.  The wages agreement, had it held, was in any event at a rate which was far above what was desirable in Irish conditions. What will happen now no one knows but either way it is quite clear that from the point of view of the EEC Commission our incomes policy has failed.</P>
    <P>Therefore as the Commission say, other measures will need to be adopted.  Otherwise employment and the balance of payments will be jeopardised.  The Commission went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Community has and will in future by way of loans and subsidies contributed to solving structural problems in Ireland.  The Commission is presently together with the Irish authorities studying the problems in order to fix priorities for the financial assistance.</P>
    <P>I take it from this that the Government and the Minister are at present negotiating with the EEC for a further loan to be made next year and that they are fixing the priorities which are the conditions for this financial assistance.  It is strange to say that one must go to Luxembourg to find out these things.  The Minister is even now apparently denying it.  Our Government have so ordered their financial affairs that they have been forced to take large loans from the European Economic Community on the basis of conditions which have severely circumscribed the possibilities of Government budgetary policy and which will circumscribe them still more in the coming year.  It is absolutely clear that if a further loan is agreed to next year the conditions will be considerably more severe than those laid down for this year. However, I will come back later to this matter.</P>
    <P>This Bill which incorporates, as far as the Seanad is concerned, the Estimates <Col N="1278" /> which are dealt with in the other House one by one, enables us to review those Estimates and to review the whole <i>corpus</i> of Government policy and leadership, or lack of it.  One thing which is demonstrated clearly by this Bill is the complete lack of financial control that has been allowed to take place under the Government.  The Minister has claimed on many occasions that the extravagance of his spending operations were required in order to cut unemployment and that things, as he put it, would be worse if the Government had not spent so much.  A more accurate view of matters and one which is being adopted more and more by economists here and abroad is that the Government in this way have created unemployment.  The extravagance of a financial policy, the complete lack of any sort of efforts at control over expenditure, have created unemployment by vastly fuelling inflation.</P>
    <P>For the first couple of years of this Government, the first years of responsibility of the Minister for Finance, that Minister used to deny that inflation was rising.  I remember him, in 1973 and 1974. saying that the figures showed that things were improving, that prices were really not rising any more rapidly than formerly, even less so, as he told us on one occasion.  Certainly, he told us, that prices were rising just as fast as anywhere else but it was nothing to do with us and there was nothing the Government could do about it.  The Government have at last come to realise that their own activities have had a great deal to do with the creation of inflation.  They have at last come to realise, very late in the day, that our inflation is, indeed, higher than elsewhere, that it is to a large extent created by ourselves.  While, of course, the Minister would no doubt put this down to national indiscipline and so on, the more serious view of it has been taken by people less enthusiastic than the Minister in defending Government policy.  The general view here and elsewhere is that the Government have been responsible.  This year at least 5 or 6 per cent of the inflation since the beginning of January has been directly due to the Government's budgetary policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> The problem has been that from the start the Government's economic policies have been governed less by economic realities, less by what was needed here than by an absolute iron determination that, whatever else happens, they must win the next election.  Money had to be spent in order to win popularity and convey the impression, as it was put so often, of a Government with a social conscience who would do things overnight while the lumbering Fianna Fáil machine needed a rather longer period to accomplish.  We have the position therefore that current expenditure, which in 1972-73 when this disastrous Minister took office was £663 million has increased, as shown in this Bill, to £1,693 million this year.  Formerly it was 29.6 per cent of total gross national product but it is around 40 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>One of the curious aspects of this has been that while we have had this rise of almost 200 per cent in current expenditure there has been a much smaller percentage rise in capital expenditure.  One would have thought that, from the point of view of the creation of employment, and the improvement of the national economy generally, capital expenditure should have risen by far more than current expenditure. There appears to have been a complete collapse of the supervision normally applied by the Department of Finance.  Obviously, one cannot blame the officials of that Department even if one was permitted to do so by the rules of order.  I have no doubt that they are as effective and efficient as they always were.  One must blame&mdash;not just because of the rules of order but because of the realities of the situation&mdash;the personal decisions of the Minister and of the Government. There has been the most extraordinary collapse in recent years of the ordinary budgetary constraints which ought to affect any Minister and any Government.  There was the extraordinary situation of the two budgets last year, the original and the mini budget, when the deficit <Col N="1280" /> planned or promised or whatever in January was £125 million.  By June, less than six months later, that had almost doubled to £241 million. By the end of the year it had risen still further to £259 million.  This year it is £327 million as against £5 million when the Minister came into office.</P>
    <P>The experience of last year showed that the Government were apparently quite incapable of adhering to the expenditure laid down in the budget.  The simplistic Coalition view that the more one spends the greater the growth of the economy is now thoroughly discredited. If there was ever any truth in it, it could never have applied in Ireland, whatever about other countries.  We have one of the most open economies that exists anywhere in the world.  The major effect of spending a great deal of money in Ireland is that it goes into imports from abroad.  It has been calculated that something like 40 per cent of every additional pound which goes into circulation in Ireland is sent abroad in order to pay for imports.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, obviously, believe in deficits where the circumstances are correct.  We do not, never have and never will believe in the concept of budget deficits in order to avoid political problems.  That is, of course, one of the great problems we have had with this Government.  So often politics and finance have been allowed to mix.  Deficits are correct in certain circumstances and, in particular, money should be borrowed for capital expenditure rather than for consumption.  One of the great tragedies of the last three years has been that we have been borrowing enormous sums of money not in order to provide employment or to help the economy, but, basically, in order to pay for popular domestic current expenditure.  If one borrows money, even on a very large scale, for capital expenditure, provided it is spent in an intelligent way, the economy will develop over the years and resources automatically become available in order to repay the <Col N="1281" /> loans.  What is now happening is that because of the extent of the borrowing conducted by this Minister and the manner in which it is being used in order to buttress current expenditure, in order to buttress consumption, we have now the position that not only is the Minister borrowing in order to fill his current budget deficit but he is even borrowing in order to service the costs of borrowing.  Borrowing, as we have been shown only too well in the last couple of years, in itself fuels inflation.</P>
    <P>We have the appalling position that the national debt has risen from just under £1,300 million on 31st March, 1973, to an estimated £3,200 million by the end of this year.  We have been relatively fortunate here. Because we were not involved in major wars we did not have to raise very large military forces, and we were able to conduct our business with a relatively small national debt. In relation to our gross national product now, our national debt is one of the highest in the world.  A lot of this is external.  The figures are rather interesting.</P>
    <P>I have a list of the external public debt of the nine members of the European Economic Community as a percentage of gross domestic product in each case.  In Belgium the proportion was 0.2 per cent; Denmark, 3.3 per cent; Germany, 0.1 per cent; France, 0.4 per cent; Italy, 0.6 per cent; Luxembourg, 2.8 per cent; the Netherlands, almost nonexistent, 0.02 per cent; The United Kingdom, 4 per cent; Ireland, 16.2 per cent.  That is four times the figure for the next worst off country, Great Britain.  This is the type of situation in which the Minister has got us involved.  Nobody knows how we will go about repaying these loans, or how we will even maintain the annual payments for servicing these debts.  The annual cost of maintaining them is a huge impost on the budget.</P>
    <P>This vital programme of borrowing, this huge increase in the national debt, might be justified if the policy had succeeded.  Unemployment <Col N="1282" /> in Ireland has risen as fast as it has elsewhere.  We have an inflation rate which is the highest in Europe. In the UK, our near neighbour, they are reducing their inflation rate quite rapidly this year.  We are not. Our output fell as rapidly as elsewhere. In most other countries there is a rapid process of recovery. The Minister said it has taken place more rapidly than one had expected. This will be a pretty good year in most countries.  Next year may well be a boom year, while we stagnate after all this borrowing, all this enormous increase in the national debt, all this frightful burden which has been placed on the taxpayers which will last for our lifetime. For the rest of our lives we will all be paying for the ludicrous extravagance of the Minister, and for nothing.  It has left us in the position of being the sick man of Europe.  All other European countries, including the United Kingdom, are showing real signs of a recovery in the tradition built up before the oil crisis.  What of the immediate financial future?  The Minister will not be surprised if I quote from the recent Report of the Economic and Social Research Institute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very anxious to play down what they say when he does not like it.  I noted he quoted them with approval at the end of his speech when they said something he thought could be interpreted in a favourable way. One can only assume that the general drift of their remarks will prove to have been a correct interpretation of the position.  They say the GNP will rise by ½ per cent this year and the Minister may say it will rise by 1 or even 2 per cent.  The general effect of their remarks is incontrovertible.  They say, for example, that non-agricultural employment will fall by 12,500 over the year.  If the Minister wishes to challenge that figure, he ought to tell <Col N="1283" /> us what he thinks the figure will be. They say the GNP will rise by ½ per cent.  The Minister says 2 per cent.  I suspect he is being optimistic. The figure could be nearer 1 per cent.  Whether it is ½, 1 or 2 per cent, it is not a good figure.  In view of the heavy fall in output over the past couple of years, in view of the fact that we have over 100,000 people unemployed, it will take far more than a ½ or 1 or 2 per cent rise in GNP to make any practical difference to us.</P>
      <P>Personal consumption, they say, will fall by 1 per cent.  I would have thought that was in line with the general view held by industrialists, economists and others.  They say consumers prices will rise by 18 per cent.  It would seem, if anything, that is a modest estimate. One cannot conceive of it rising by any less.  They say exports will rise by 3¾ per cent in volume.  That is a fairly optimistic estimate which the Minister probably will not challenge.  They say imports will rise by 8 per cent in volume which is in line with what seems to be happening.  They suggest a balance of payments deficit of about £200 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his opening speech that the balance of payments deficit should be manageable.  Does he consider £200 million manageable?  If he considers that is too pessimistic an estimate, he ought to give us his view as to what the balance of payments deficit is likely to be this year.  Looking at the trade figures, my personal view would be that £200 million seems about par for the course.  In 1974 we had a balance of payments deficit of £310 million which was an appalling deficit. Last year, as the Minister said, it fell to £15 million.  He mentioned this almost as if he should be proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said to the Minister on the Appropriation Bill before Christmas, 1974, that the then trade figures which were beginning to change rapidly at the end of 1974, would appear to show that there might be a very low balance of payments deficit in 1975.  I said the Minister's policy should have been such as to avoid this because a very rapid fall in the balance of payments deficit <Col N="1284" /> would be a reflection of extreme depression in the economy.  I said the Minister should get this £310 million down to something more practical but he should not allow it to fall too rapidly because this would be a reflection of a disastrous fall in public spending.  This is, in fact, what happened. The £15 million deficit in the balance of payments last year is not something about which the Minister should be proud.  It is a reflection of the absolutely appalling state of the economy and consumer spending last year.</P>
    <P>However, this year it looks like being around £200 million, and the difficulty there of course is that it shows, if any showing was needed, that our balance of payments problem, which is a very grave one, is in no way solved, that last year was a pure chance due to the state of the economy generally and consumer spending in particular.  This year is not a year in which consumer spending will be on a large scale, but even so this year the balance of payments will be about £200 million.  If there should be an improvement in the economy, if ever there should be a recovery in consumer spending and therefore in imports, how is the Minister going to solve this problem? He cannot just toss the thing off in his speech, as he does, by saying that he thinks the balance of payments deficit this year will be manageable; I think that was the word he used.  I do not think £200 million is manageable. Certainly the prospect of a further increase, perhaps a very considerable increase, next year, should there be some improvement in the economy, is a very serious one.</P>
    <P>That is a statement made by the Economic and Social Research Institute, and I think it is a fair statement. They go on to say: &ldquo;Agricultural incomes will rise by 20 per cent.&rdquo;  I take it that the Minister will not disagree with that.  Wages, they say, will rise by 13½ per cent.  Again that seems to be a modest estimate; it is hard to see them rising by any less, and in the present position, which has been so mismanaged by the Government that it is chaotic, anything can happen, but I think that is a reasonable estimate; and then they expect profits to rise by 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> Three months ago, the quarterly report says, they were estimating a 2 per cent growth rate this year; they now estimate only a ½ per cent and they blame the budget and the proposed national pay agreement for forcing a downward revision of this projection. They go on to say that the budgetary measures introduced were at variance with the expressed economic goals of reducing the rate of price increases and halting the rise in unemployment.</P>
    <P>All these things are said by the Economic and Social Research Institute in their quarterly economic commentary. The Minister, as usual, said he did not agree with them.  But I think the problem from the Minister's point of view is that these kinds of statements are now being made by economists, industrialists everywhere, not just by this particular institute. One of the great problems we face here at the moment is that confidence has been completely eroded not merely by the economic developments that have taken place but by the fact that the Government in general and the Minister in particular do not even appear to be able to accept the realities. They live in an ivory tower and do not appear to be able to accept the basic facts of our national situation. Then in the most gloomy tones the institute go on to talk about difficulties which seem to be insurmountable. In all the years of reading reports of this kind from various institutes, the Central Bank and so on, I have never heard a statement like that about difficulties seeming to be insurmountable. I think in fact they are not insurmountable.  I fear they are insurmountable by the present Minister, because he is simply unable to accept that there are things that need to be surmounted, and that one is not going to surmount them by talking vaguely about the lack of national discipline. I have no doubt there is a lack of national discipline, but equally, whether it is in an army or a nation, one is not going to get discipline without leadership, and that is precisely what we lack.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who says these people are wrong in their commentary, forgets that if ever there was a commentator <Col N="1286" /> on economic matters who has been consistently and universally wrong it has been the Minister himself. If it were worth the bother I could bring in an immense stack of quotations from the present Minister made in this House about balance of payments, budget deficits, development in the economy, national income, every single one of them outrageously and grotesquely wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems we face at present is the fact that our neighbours in the United Kingdom have had a sudden, startling and unexpected success in dealing with inflation. One had grown to assume over the years that, bad and all as we might be in Ireland, at any rate we could be matched, blow by blow, by our neighbours in Britain, that they also were apparently either unable or unwilling to control their economy. But there has been this sudden change for whatever reason; it need not concern us here.  We have therefore the 4½ per cent wage agreement in England.  We have the already pretty considerable cuts in expenditure being made by the British Government.  We have the prospect that by the end of this year inflation in England may be not much over 10 per cent, and the extreme likelihood that by the end of next year it may be down even to 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  Faced with that we have the almost certainty that this year, as I have mentioned, the cost of living will be at a minimum 18 per cent higher over the 12 months' period and the extreme likelihood that nothing very startling will happen within the next 12 months or so to reduce that rate.  I think the general opinion is that even up to late next year there is no real likelihood that there will be any substantial fall in the Irish inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The Irish inflation rate is already double that for the Continent.  Until now we have been cushioned by the fact that 50 per cent of our exports go to Britain, whose inflation was just as bad as ours, and the Minister was at pains to point out that at this time last year it was even higher than ours.  We are no longer cushioned by this fact.</P>
    <P>This will have a very serious effect <Col N="1287" /> on our exports because it will make our exports uncompetitive, while our imports from Britain, which of course are in direct competition with our own manufacturers at home, are very much cheaper.  As the Minister said himself in his budget speech: &ldquo;We must set ourselves a programme no less ambitious if we are to secure our future prosperity&rdquo;.  That was some time ago and, as so often with the Minister, is a statement with which one can agree, but naturally there has been no programme produced in order to secure our future prosperity.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Confederation of Irish Industries <i>Newsletter</i> for 8th June, 1976, has some interesting examples of what happens when our costs get out of line.  They pointed out:</P>
    <P>Less than two years ago footwear exports and imports were in balance. In the first four months of this year we imported almost twice as much as we exported.</P>
    <P>From being in balance, we now import almost twice as much footwear as we export.  Then over the last four years our favourable export balance of clothing products dropped from 33 per cent in 1972 to only 10 per cent in 1975.  In the first four months of this year the situation had deteriorated so that we imported 10 per cent more than we exported.  That is the kind of situation that arises when, as is happening with us in this country, one allows one's costs, particularly one's labour costs, to get so badly out of line.  They go on to say that the relative performances of the textile and clothing industries provide a good illustration of the very direct relationship which can exist between movements in wage costs.  These industries employ in all about 40,000 people.  The greater part of their exports are traditionally to the British market.</P>
    <P>As pointed out in the <i>Newsletter</i>, during the four year period 1971 to 1975, unit wage costs in the textile industry in Ireland rose 17 per cent more slowly than those in Britain, whereas Irish textile output increased 19 per cent more rapidly than did the British. <Col N="1288" /> At the same time, unit wage costs in the Irish clothing and footwear sector grew 12 per cent faster than those in Britain, whereas output in the Irish clothing and footwear sector declined 17 per cent more rapidly than output in these sectors in Britain.  There is a very direct relationship between wage costs and output.  They point out what is quite clear, that Irish earnings and unit wage costs are going to go more rapidly out of line with those in Britain during the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which is of importance to us because of our high rate of unemployment is that it is particularly in the labour-intensive industries that wage costs are so important. Because of increased earnings here far beyond anything that is going to be payable in Britain, we are going to have the position that larger numbers of people are going to be out of work&mdash;a great many have lost their jobs but others will lose their jobs&mdash;in these labour-intensive industries, particularly textiles, clothing and so on.  These are industries that tend to be locally owned, owned by Irish people, and they tend to require a relatively small volume of investment per job created.  These are the industries which are declining and closing down.  To the extent, therefore, that these labour intensive industries are lost as a result of higher labour costs, they will have to be replaced by industries which are much more capital-intensive.  In other words, as a result of our excessive costs we are losing industries where a relatively small amount of capital invested will create a considerable amount of employment.  We are going to have to replace them with industries in which a great deal of capital is required to create a very small number of jobs.  This is one of the serious aspects of the present situation.</P>
    <P>We have this strange matter of the economic plan.  The Government, and the Minister in particular, have said on many occasions that they do not believe in planning.  They do not believe that in present circumstances it is possible to produce a plan.  One would like them to produce a policy now and then, but I suppose a plan is <Col N="1289" /> a more elaborate version.  If they cannot produce policies one can hardly expect them to produce plans.  They have told us on many occasions that they do not believe in it and they cannot.  Now the Minister has come out and said he is going to produce some kind of a plan in mid-summer.  It is already mid-summer, but nonetheless I presume that, whatever about the climatic aspects of it, he means that he will produce it by September. I would be interested if he could give us some indication as to what type of plan it is going to be, whether it is going to be guidelines or what.  One wonders why it has taken so long.  It has taken three-and-a-half years in office, a steady decline in national output, increasing unemployment and all the problems we know about.  One only hopes that when the plan does appear that it will at least point the way to some kind of reasonable improvement in our affairs.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us, which is a reflection of the spending side of the 1976 budget, in so far as it is a reflection of budgetary policy solves none of our present problems.  It does not even begin to do so.  We have a much larger current deficit, we have further considerable increases in borrowing, it has speeded up the rate of inflation by about 5 or 6 per cent and, in spite of what the Minister has told us, it leaves unemployment relatively untouched. Unemployment at the moment is over 100,000, and it has been over 100,000 for more than 12 months.  It would be a brave prophet who would suggest that it will fall below 100,000 by this time next year. Public spending has gone up from 42 per cent of GNP in 1972-73 to 54 per cent last year and 58 per cent this year.  The Taoiseach, in speeches recently, has admitted at last that this enormous rate of expenditure&mdash;nearly 60 per cent of total national income &mdash;is one of the main causes of inflation and unemployment.  Having admitted all this, a further increase in the percentage of public spending has taken place this year.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that I should like to talk to the Minister about because of the reply that he gave at the <Col N="1290" /> end of the Second Reading of the Finance Bill in this House.  It is the much-argued question of equal pay. The Minister's performance has been extraordinary.  Now we know, in regard to the question of equal pay, that this is a principle which is being pushed by people for many years.  It was incorporated in the Treaty of Rome as an ideal that should be achieved as rapidly as possible.  There was a long and excessive delay in doing anything about it but nonetheless when we entered the EEC we knew that equal pay was going to come at some time in the future.  The legislation needed to introduce equal pay was enacted through the Dáil and through this House in 1974.  It came into force on 1st January last.  The EEC directive, which has the force of law in effect in Ireland, was passed in 1975, was agreed by the Council, including the representative of the Irish Government, on 10th February, 1975, and came into force so far as the EEC law was concerned on 10th February, 1976.  It was known, therefore, a long time ago by the present Minister and Government that at a certain fixed date equal pay was to become the law of Ireland.  In particular, the cost in the public service was known by the Minister as to exactly what would be required in order to give equal pay for equal work.  Nothing was done until the very last minute when an application was made to the EEC Commission for a derogation to allow us not to bring in equal pay.  I do not know why the Government thought such a derogation was possible.  All those who were involved did not realise that it was impossible to be given a derogation of this kind.  I do not intend going through all the gory details about how, when this derogation was unanimously refused, the Minister for Finance spoke about the &ldquo;irresponsible attitude&rdquo; and so on.  At column 319 of the Seanad Official Report for 26th May last the Minister was replying to the Finance Bill and he made a few remarks on which I want to comment.  He said:</P>
    <P>Senator Yeats is very good at wearing his European heart on his sleeve when he can cause political embarrassment to Ireland abroad <Col N="1291" /> and at home.  Maybe he ought to wear it at all times and not be selective on the occasions in which he uses it.</P>
    <P>I wondered what this referred to and I can only conclude that the Minister believed that when the Government are in breach of their EEC obligations, in breach of the directive which is the law of the land, and in breach of their own legislation which has passed through this House with the support of all sides, nothing should be said about it; that the matter should be concealed abroad in case there would be political embarrassment to the Minister.  All I can say is that so long as the Minister and the Government continue to be in breach of their obligations under EEC regulations, so long as they continue to break the law of the land and to break the law of the EEC which under our Constitution is also the law of the land, I propose to complain about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to realise that things have changed, that the European Parliament is not a nonpolitical assembly like the Council of Europe.  The European Parliament is a place where one discusses EEC matters relating to the Community as a whole or to individual countries.  If it is necessary, in order to push the Minister into the fulfilment of his obligations, to raise the matter in Seanad Éireann, the European Parliament or anywhere else, I propose to do this.  In EEC conditions that is what one ought to do.  I can think of nothing worse than to enter into a polite conspiracy to conceal from our fellow-members of the EEC that this Government are in complete breach of their obligations to introduce equal pay.</P>
    <P>I am buttressed in this belief by the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions made a very violent and public representation to the EEC Commission, much more violent than anything I said.  At all times I have been polite and restrained in the remarks I made.  On the occasion on which the Minister first launched his <Col N="1292" /> attack I had not even mentioned the Irish Government.  However, the ICTU made a representation in the most violent tones.  They were right. I am not complaining.  They described the Minister's attitude, particularly in regard to equal pay in the public service, as a mere subterfuge.  If the Minister feels I should not, as he put it, cause political embarrassment abroad, he should address his remarks even more so to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which probably caused him a great deal more physical embarrassment abroad than I have been able to do or had wished to cause him.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister what he thinks will happen to his new scheme in the public service.  Instead of introducing equal pay in the public service, the Minister has, as the ICTU said, by subterfuge, said there will be discrimination by marriage rather than sex, in other words, married people will get the full rate of pay and a lesser rate of pay will apply to those who are unmarried, whether male or female.  The Minister says this is not discrimination.  The ICTU made a representation to the Commission and stated that this was not in accordance with EEC rules.  I suspect that it is not.  There is a timebomb hanging over the Minister's head and one of these days he may be told from Brussels that his proposals for the public sector are not in accordance with EEC rules and that he must introduce genuine equal pay. I am interested in hearing what the Minister thinks will happen in regard to this.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear there has been no genuine effort made by the Government to introduce equal pay in Ireland.  For example, one has only to consider the question of equal pay officers.  Equal pay officers were provided for in the Act which introduced equal pay.  They would be employed by the Department of Labour and would travel throughout the country to ensure that all women workers concerned were in a position to get their rights under that legislation. Two equal pay officers have been appointed for the Twenty-six Counties, <Col N="1293" /> just two.  This is the bare minimum which the Government feel obliged to do.  It would appear that the Minister in particular and the Government in general have no interest in equal pay, have no desire to see it introduced and have made no genuine effort to introduce it.  Of course, there was the ludicrous situation when the original notice advertising the posts of equal pay officers provided that there should be unequal pay, that female applicants for these posts would receive a lower rate than male applicants.  It was one of the most ludicrous performances ever perpetrated by a Government.</P>
    <P>In any event, two officers, whatever they are paid, were appointed. This kind of situation is conclusive proof that the Government have no wish to introduce equal pay.  They would like the whole matter to blow away.  It will not blow away.  Even if the Government sought to amend the legislation, which is now the law of the land, they could not do it.  As from 10th February last the EEC law, which is effective in this country, is that there must be universal equal pay, whether in the public services or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the Government's entire record shows that they are either incapable or unwilling to run the country's finances in a rational way.  The trouble is that it may take years to solve the problems created by the Government.  It is depressing in the extreme.  After three-and-a-half years, during which the economic condition of the country has deteriorated steadily, the budgetary position has become steadily more catastrophic.  We find the Minister, after all this time, coming in and making a speech which, in effect, suggests that things, after all, are not so bad and they will improve by themselves.  The plan, whatever it may be whenever it appears, may, perhaps, restore some confidence but there is nothing in the record of either the Minister or the Government to date to suggest that it will do so.  We do not oppose this Bill, it is necessary to provide for the continued running of the country, but the Estimates contained <Col N="1294" /> in the Bill do not suggest that the Government have any idea where they are going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I only missed a short portion of Senator Yeats's speech.  I hardly think he chose the moment of my absence to make a constructive contribution, to make one suggestion as to what should be done in the present situation, a situation which Senator Yeats sought to attribute entirely to the decisions of this Government without specifying the nature of the decisions, without specifying what schemes, if he were in Government, he would not have approved that they should borrow for. As one concerned with the future of one of the last free democracies in the world, I find this contribution, coming from the spokesman of Fianna Fáil in this House, at this time to use his own word, depressing.</P>
      <P>He referred to what is described on the cover as &ldquo;The Quarterly Economic Commentary of the Economic and Social Research Institute&rdquo;.  That commentary, as I think the Minister pointed out to him, is a commentary only of two persons in the Economic and Social Research Institute.  I find the judgments of the commentary unimpressive in the language which was used by the two authors&mdash;&ldquo;The economy is now faced with difficulties which seem to be insurmountable&rdquo;&mdash;particularly when I am able to turn to a contribution of one of the two authors, made in February of this year after the budget&mdash;which, by the implications of his language created the insurmountable problems &mdash;at a seminar organised by the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs.  In the course of Mr. Durkin's contributions&mdash;that is the author to whom I refer&mdash;he is good enough to tell us that, personally, he would have preference for a lower average standard of living for those in employment if it meant that total employment was higher.  It was gracious of him to express that preference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on in the course of his contribution which, apart from the first anachronist chauvinism from Mr. <Col N="1295" /> Anthony Coughlan of Trinity College, Dublin, contained many interesting and useful papers, to speak of the widespread misapprehension that the fall in exports was due to a loss of competitiveness.  This, he indicates, is a type of delusion which it is difficult to get the Establishment to get rid of. If one turns the page and reads on one finds him saying, in reference to one action of the Government and one external decision which the Government would have had nothing to do with, that the increased oil prices and the increased social welfare contributions of employers&mdash;£1 a week per employee&mdash;must necessarily damage competitiveness.  He also says&mdash;this man who thinks that the Establishment is deluded with this idea that we have suffered through loss of competitiveness abroad&mdash;that there are people out of work in Ireland because of loss of competitiveness abroad.  One finds him saying that the great pity is that incomes did not grow more slowly in the early part of 1975, thus possibly keeping the volume of exports and hence production and employment rather higher.  I find it difficult to be depressed, therefore, by the judgment which is shared by a man who contributes such contradictory statements in another article published as part of the seminar organised by a trade union.  He says: &ldquo;The economy is now faced with difficulties which seem to be insurmountable.&rdquo; The economy is now faced with difficulties but I do not believe them to be insurmountable if the people have a will to surmount them.  I believe the people can and will have that will, but they will not have it unless they face the realities of their own situation, realities which are insufficiently referred to in the quarterly commentary&mdash;not merely this quarterly commentary but other quarterly commentaries of the same institute.  The people will not accept the limitation of resources which faces not merely them but the Government also.</P>
    <P>I find, in another paper by another member of the institute at that seminar, a superior comment about the Government, <Col N="1296" /> the Department of Finance and, indeed, the EEC to the effect that they seem to be concerned merely with accounting, with Government expenditure, and not with the whole business of production of the economy.  This, I find, totally irreconcilable with the extremely impressive document which we have recently had&mdash;one of many&mdash; from the National Economic and Social Council, which recognises the seriousness of the trend and the proportion of the resources of the community which the Government and the public sector absorb and which refers to an analysis and a consultant's report which did not relate to the period after the formation of the National Coalition Government, but related to the period preceding their formation.</P>
    <P>If there is a trend for the Government&mdash;using that word to describe the whole public sector&mdash;to absorb an increasing proportion of the national resources, that trend set in the previous ten years.  Paragraph 1.4 of the report says:</P>
    <P>Over this ten-year period, real public expenditure on goods, services and transfers, grew at a rate substantially above that of the real GNP (6.88 per cent as against 4 per cent), As a result, the share of total real public expenditure in gross national product rose from 34.4 per cent in 1963-64 to almost 44 per cent in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>If there was such a trend, this Government did not start it.  You may say about certain of their decisions that they accelerated the trend, but I do not remember howls of criticism from the Opposition benches when the Government decided to make adjustments in favour of people in receipt of social welfare.  I do not remember any opposition to the proposed increases in social welfare either in Dáil Éireann or in Seanad Éireann.  I remember cautionary notes being expressed by Senator Russell and myself on this side of the House about these increases. But let us face the facts.  Let the people face the facts.  Let us tell them the truth.  Let everyone who writes tell them the truth.  Let everyone who publishes, publish the truth.  The truth <Col N="1297" /> is that the <i>per capita</i> income on the average of the citizen of this Republic is one half that of the <i>per capita</i> income on the average of the other EEC countries.  Yet the Government are faced with expectations based upon the belief that what can be afforded elsewhere can be afforded here.  That is untrue, and if we are in difficulties now, we are in difficulties because we did not face that truth.  But maybe this is the downside, that we are facing the difficulties now, that we are looking at realities, that we will have to reshape our expectations in the context of the reality of our resources.  Some of these expectations are greedy and some as the National Economic and Social Council on page 45 said, at paragraph (D) 5.18:</P>
    <P>Because of the increasing popularity of international conferences of professional bodies and the influence of professional journals, a very strong &ldquo;demonstration effect&rdquo; is at work: the higher standards in the richer countries tend to become those to which it is believed Irish standards should be raised.  However, this does not increase the ability to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>I will give one illustration.  A favourite recommendation of many organisations who are very properly concerned to effect reforms in the law is to constantly refer to the great desirability of family courts.  I will not go into the technical arguments for and against family courts.  I make one point which no one that I know of who writes on the subject in any depth will ever deny. They are extremely expensive as they involve the bringing together of highly professionally trained, and generally highly remunerated professional skills, to work with other skills that have to be trained to meet them.  Even in America whose resources are very many times our own complaints are expressed about the cost, apart from the other criticisms as to the workability of the family courts which is another matter for another debate on another day.  I merely make the point that that is an example of where a desired improvement, if the discipline that persuades the person of the desirability of it is to be properly adjusted <Col N="1298" /> to our realities, must become inter-disciplinary.  This is one of the great needs at this moment in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the very good things about the very unhappy fact that taxes are so high, and that there are so many unemployed, one of the very good things about this, a very bad thing is that there is a great and serious national debate taking place with regard to how to solve our problems.  I have read writings from people trained in disciplines other than my own, agricultural economists, technologists, economists, bankers, managers, and trade unionists, and what seems to me to be lacking&mdash;and this is a well-known frailty of the ecology of the brain&mdash;is that when the brain develops one particular technique, it seems to become unbalanced to some extent, so that someone who gets absorbed in accounting tends merely to be interested in the accounting and tends merely to be interested in balancing the budget.  The man who knows all about how a tax operates tends to be interested only in the operation of the tax and not to be interested in the economic consequence of the tax.  The man who is interested in macro-economies and thinks about swelling up demand, pumping in from somewhere money to create demand, is not aware of the legal and the business difficulties of the negotiation of loans or of the financing of the demand so to be pumped in.</P>
    <P>If the political parties in this House would more honestly forget their petty differences, because they are petty and personal, it would be better. If there was an ideological bias on the other side more decisively against that to be found on this side of the House than there is, we should tend to have rational debates instead of nitpicking kind of speeches.  I think we are at a point where we will either make the wrong decision or the right one.  We should first spare a moment for scathing condemnation of all those who pursue their sectional interests without regard to the common good. Scathing condemnation should be their lot and it should come not merely from this side of the House but from all parts of the side of the House and from all parts of the other <Col N="1299" /> side of the House.  The greater the degree of knowledge they have of the situation the greater their guilt. The more inherited resources, the greater their guilt.  The more they received from their educational system or the more they enjoyed the privileges of having an inherited tradition of education, the greater their guilt. The more they are members of professions who in making special claims on the Government in this situation disregarding their other incomes, including my own profession, the greater their guilt.</P>
    <P>What can you expect the ordinary man in the street to think when he sees highly-professional bodies claiming substantial increases in their incomes to be paid for&mdash;by whom?  They have to be paid by people who are much less well-off than those who are going to receive those incomes.  The more the people are in quasi-monopolistic positions and look for more the greater their guilt too.  They are not all on the employed side and they are not all in manufacturing or rendering services.  Some of them are in farming. The more shrieks that go forth from the farming population who are within the range of taxation&mdash;and small is their number&mdash;when they are asked to make a contribution the more indignant I become at their failure to appreciate the need for all members of the community to restrain themselves in demands.  If these demands continue to be made without regard, if this complaint about the cost of Government services being shared by all with incomes continues, we will end up handing each other useless pieces of paper.  We are engaged in a type of economic cannibalism, of eating our own children's future.</P>
    <P>We can make the right decision. There is a great deal of exciting seminal work being done, published and unpublished.  Indeed, some of it is to be found in this brochure which I got from ASTMS.  It is a difficult word to pronounce unless you are one of the elite and know how to pronounce it which I do not.  There is a lot of good material in that brochure, of recognition of our realities, <Col N="1300" /> of suggestions.  One of the recommendations which I would make to the Minister and the members of the Cabinet in the preparation of their Green Paper is not to reject anything or the consideration of any contribution merely because it can be seen to have been in some degree intemperately expressed or biassed in some unhappy direction or another.  I get value and light from most of the contributions that come.  I do not get value and light, being concerned to reform the system, from revolutionaries who tell us that what is wrong is the system.  It will be a great comfort to us all while the wrong system is being trampled upon, presumably, and replaced by its alternative.  I do not find myself unable to accept suggestions whether they come from ideologues of the left who generally know themselves to have an ideology or ideologues of the right who generally do not, but are.</P>
    <P>I think that one of our tasks is to try to see what shape of society we want to have, based on the facts we are now faced with, what decisions we may have to make which will be &mdash;and must be, I think&mdash;radical and involve restructuring in some cases. They must be courageous.  There must be some element of risk-taking in them because the image is not that of someone who can go to a library for two years and produce the perfect text to solve the problem which will have become a great deal worse by the time he has produced his text.  It is not the activity of the professional man who likes to give all the time in the world to trying to receive and reach the perfect solution which we need at this juncture but rather something like the decisions which men make under fire, whether they be soldiers in the field or policemen on duty.  We shall not make the decisions which will put right, as can be put right, the problems of this country unless we are prepared to make some mistakes.</P>
    <P>There has been frequent mention of plans.  An interesting fact has emerged and that is that the capitalists&mdash;if I may call them that&mdash; now want a plan just as much as those on the left looked for a plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak that fact as loudly among capitalists as among my fellow impoverished Senators for it is true.  However, there will be difficulties and I think that the Minister's approach of producing a Green Paper is the right one.  With a view to having the plan successful it must be based on some consensus as to what is desirable and based also on some clear-sighted recognition of facts.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that in the words, not my words, of the National Economic and Social Council&mdash;by the way, you can call it something other than a plan if you have a hang up about something you said in the past about planning.  I am prepared to eat plenty of words and I invite everybody else to be prepared to do the same as a necessary aperitif to the meal to be enjoyed&mdash;they call it a development strategy.  They say that no such strategy has existed since the mid-sixties.  That will come as a great surprise to the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil because the mid-sixties was 1965 and this Government did not get into power until 1973 so, if we are three years late with it, Fianna Fáil were eight years late with it.  They say there were, of course, the Second Programme for Economic Expansion and the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, but the extent to which Government was committed to them was at best always ambiguous.</P>
      <P>Neither of these programmes was debated in Dáil Éireann.  Neither of them seemed to be widely accepted in the public service as a frameword for thought and action and indeed, very little was heard of the Third Programme after it was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we do not want a Fourth Programme about which little will be heard after it is published.  The way I would like to start planning is, first of all, in the realism involved in the recognition of the limitation of resources, in the emphasis which the objective plan must place upon the importance of solving the problem of unemployment. <Col N="1302" /> Psychologically, may I say that I am not certain that that should be, from the point of view of stimulating private investment, the description of the plan.  It is necessary to disabuse the public by continued promotional exercises that there is any possibility whatever of this society creating viable employment, and it is viable employment we want, unless there is a recognition of the crucial role of profits, crucial to future employment. Recognition of this should be a task shared by everyone in this House.  Call it additional value, call it anything you like, whichever system you work, be it a free system or a repressive tyranny, the test for the success of the enterprise is: does it reward the savings, whether they are freely invested or represent compulsory savings?  The criterion must always be when the profits, whether goods or services, are marketed in response to the needs of the markets they must reach, do they generate a return which rewards the investor?</P>
    <P>The first thing I would say about profits, as published in the Press, is that they do not represent the figures they appear to represent at all when regard is had to inflation.  If there is not a proper provision for the replacement in inflationery terms&mdash;there is no admission that inflation will be encouraged or wished for here involved in accepting that fact&mdash;because we are a linked economy and always have been, very much more dependent on the world trade than the most dependent of the rich countries: the most dependent rich country on the trend of world trade is Britain and we are broadly twice as dependent as Britain. We cannot ignore the world save at our peril.  If there is inflation in the world which inflates the price of goods and produces an inflated cost in replacing machinery, which the very highly equipped and modernised Irish industry has, that very highly equipped and modernised Irish industry must earn sufficient profits to be able to replace it&mdash;and the profits we are talking about are not distributable in any real sense&mdash;or, else, in due course the company will go out of business.  At the end of the lifetime of the machinery <Col N="1303" /> in question, if there is not money there to replace the machinery out of accummulated profits, there will not be employment for those who work on with or direct those machines.</P>
    <P>Another fact about profits, at the present level of taxation&mdash;I am ignoring the various reliefs which do not apply in certain types of cases anyway; I am ignoring export tax relief which will taper off and peter out in 1990&mdash;the company in question already has the State half-partner in every company making profits because half of them go to the State in taxation, or such proportion in any given case as the various allowances ultimately determine.  One only has to read the list of bankrupt companies to see that the people who go into business take risks of losing all.  Those who take risks must earn money by way of return for the risks they take in excess of what they can get from a dead deposit in a banking or a financial institution.  If they can get 14 per cent on a safe loan to the Government, or whatever the current percentage is, the percentage return must be high if they are taking the risks of seeing their profits in certain years recede altogether.  The better we can make them, the better chance there is of the industry in question not merely staying in business but expanding its business.  Expansion of Irish business is vital.  As James Callaghan, Prime Minister of Britain, recently said, &ldquo;Today's profits are tomorrow's jobs.&rdquo;  That is a fair phrase.</P>
    <P>It is not simply a question of profits. We have just got to get the catechism of the clichés cleaned up a bit.  That is one of them.  Another one of these things that comes into this catechism is the multi-national.  The multi-national, I gather, among some people who have the benefit of being employed by them is criticised by representation which comes undoubtedly from the left, which undoubtedly is basically chauvinistic and is basically anti-American.  The multi-national is as good as or as bad as you are.  There are good multi-nationals and bad multi-nationals.  I know of one multi-national <Col N="1304" /> who have a system of constant renewal of their directives to people managing their affairs and the two notes they strike in the texts they circulate throughout the world are: innovation and integrity.  They have elaborate machinery to discover malpractices designed to secure an increased turnover for the multi-national in question.  We have the youngest active working population in Europe.  I have not the percentages now but it is increasing at a rate slightly more than the Netherlands, that is something like six times as fast as Denmark.  It is more than twice as fast as France, it is 50 per cent up on the rates of increase in Italy and it is 30 times the rate of increase in Western Germany.  See what affluence did to them.  It was Herbert Spencer who pointed out a long time ago the close connection between affluence and procreativity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>I was about to invite Senator Robinson, with everyone present, to celebrate the fact that we have reversed the trend of the famine, to celebrate the fact that we have an increasingly young active, and it must be our duty to see, educated workforce available as one of our strengths.  We have strengths and this is one of the strengths if we make the right decisions about them.  The young people are more mobile and, while I suppose that mobility has its dangers, I believe that this increased mobility will fit into the type of programme we ought to be shaping for our children and grandchildren.  We have a regional industrial policy but we really have not got a regional infrastructural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis with regard to this young and active population of ours leads me to the second point I want to <Col N="1305" /> make with regard to it, namely, the emphasis there must be, and that there is increasingly, on the necessity for technological training of that work force.  I know you can get to a point such as was reached in America where all the colleges and universities were dismissed as merely existing to supply labour to the armaments industry and so on.  From what I know of the young people of Ireland, they would be very glad indeed if they were given the skills which would get them jobs and I regard the creation of employment for these people and the adaptation of those who have been rendered redundant as the first of our social services. May I pause to congratulate AnCO on the increasing success and extension of their activities in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am on very dangerous ground in questioning any assumption made by so very learned a man as Professor Brendan Walsh but I wonder if one of his assumptions is necessarily correct, that there is going to be such continued outflow from agriculture into employment. My impression, and this is where one is setting impressions against scientific calculations and that is a dangerous business, is that a lot of the outflow from agriculture has been mortality, simple death and the collection of the holdings resulting from death.  But with regard to the more developed countries, whether during the period of his projection which is an arbitrary period anyhow up to 1986, I do not know if we will reach that stage of development.  Certainly his namesake, Dr. Walsh of the Agricultural Institute, records that there is evidence that this trend of movement from the countryside to the cities is being reversed.  Certainly in some of the richer countries it has stopped and in some cases reversed as people move out from urban centres to the countryside and reinvest their accumulations there or place their children there, financed by their accumulations.  At any rate the potential of agriculture is very great.</P>
    <P>I have not got the exact figure but, broadly speaking, the last figures I saw would put the average milk yield of an Irish cow at about one-half that of the average continental <Col N="1306" /> cow.  From what I know, a great deal of scientific work has been done capable of being applied to agriculture which has not been applied as yet extensively to Irish agriculture. I am told&mdash;those are the figures that Dr. Walsh gives&mdash;that there are approximately 18,500 scientifically trained people in Ireland at whatever date he made his calculation and that of these there are only 550 employed in agriculture.  He gives a basis for his definition of scientifically trained people&mdash;this may be acceptable or unacceptable&mdash;and these are approximately the figures he gives.</P>
    <P>Questions arise with regard to the effect on the self-confidence of rural society of the movement of children away from the countryside into urban centres for education.  The questions arise because there is a deadline in the percentage of people who are doing rural science at a time when there ought to be an increase.  When referring to the importance of clarifying the public mind on profits I said that profits were not everything.  Certainly they are not.  When they are distributed you can see what kind of characters can emerge.</P>
    <P>I should have thought that the meat export industry was a fairly profitable operation over the years.  Again, according to Dr. Walsh, only .02 per cent of their turnover was applied to research and development, so there may have to be some strings attached to some of the tax reliefs which are available.  Here the questions of choice will require to be made because the evidence seems to suggest that what might be apparently good agricultural economics may not be good business for the food processing industry.  I am told, for example, that the supply of milk on the Continent is of more uniform quality throughout the year, that the seasonality of milk production has positively increased in Ireland with serious consequences to the degree of capital investment required in the food processing industry because they have to be ready for the peak and able to cope with it, and that the peak does not produce the high protein fat casein content. I understand that copper, <Col N="1307" /> apparently, is one of the elements we take when we drink a glass of milk.</P>
    <P>The very advances in agricultural techniques and science applied to Irish agriculture may have added to the problems of the Irish food producing industry.  I am still talking about manpower, moving from agriculture through food processing generally on to manpower.  Undoubtedly, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have done good work in relation to this.  The Waterford CoOperative Society and others have introduced a bonus scheme to try to spread out milk production throughout the year.</P>
    <P>Later in the afternoon I will be suggesting to the Minister that he must not reject the possibility that appropriately designed tax reliefs may be less costly to the Exchequer than direct grants.  Stimuli which lead to the spread of technology between firms to the acquisition of technology from abroad&mdash;it is being rendered available here under one scheme or another&mdash;ought to be a prime object of public policy.</P>
    <P>director of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  There is a</P>
    <P>I referred on a previous occasion&mdash; I refer to it again because of the extreme importance of the paper which I think is now published&mdash;to Mr. Cranley's paper.  I think he is the message which the president of certain element of truth in the famous Harvard sent back when he visited the University: &ldquo;Everything going fine here.  There is a spirit of pessimism prevailing in every department.&rdquo; That, up to this moment, has been more or less my theme.  As the lunch hour rapidly approaches, appropriately my optimism is beginning to lead me into some description of reasons for hope, grounds for optimism, and not merely the lunch bell, which surely must ring any moment, while we take advantage of the improvements in the food processing industry.</P>

      <P>Before lunch I referred to the things that are <Col N="1308" /> going for us.  There is need to emphasise these things in the present situation because a spirit of pessimism prevails.  I referred to the rate of increase in our active young population, active in work and ready for the tasks which lie before them.  I want to refer to the resources available now compared to the situation which existed when the State was founded. The proportion of our population engaged in industry at that time was approximately the same as the proportion of the population engaged in industry today in India.  Our industries were based on imported raw material and 98 per cent of our exports went to one market&mdash;the United Kingdom.  Those who have noted the change in our population position have done so in a scientific fashion and have properly evaluated the particular problems relative to it. The high dependency ratio means that the output per person employed in industry in Ireland must be much greater than that of the output of persons employed in industry in this large market to which we now have access because of the number of dependants they must support.</P>
      <P>In 1922 the agricultural sector had low productivity because it was dominated by a price-fixing market, the United Kingdom, and represented a high proportion of the total output. The proportion of the work force engaged in agriculture, still with a lower productivity than the services industry, has, at last, access to a price-fixing market with an institutionalised system of stabilising prices; an institution which, admittedly, is under danger of assault.  Our voice is represented where it never was before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very different day from the days in 1938 when we celebrated the Anglo-Irish Treaty, a very different day from the day when we celebrated the 1948 agreement with the United Kingdom.  We are now part of the negotiating team which negotiates the price for our agricultural produce. We have a young, adaptable, highly-intelligent and highly-educated population.  We had the wit to use our independence.  That wit was expressed in many ways by the activities of <Col N="1309" /> people on both sides of this House and that wit can be expressed now at an important moment of decision.</P>
    <P>We were put in a position on the 6th December, 1921, when we signed a treaty&mdash;we are not going to go back on that now&mdash;which was described by Michael Collins as a stepping stone to freedom.  Do not mind what view is taken on either side of this House on that decision; just look at one effect of it.  The wit of this State, the wit of the politicians elected by people of this country, the politicians in this House and in the Lower House &mdash;as I jocosely refer to it&mdash;changed, transformed, the British Commonwealth of nations, so that it was a different thing, a totally transformed institution, when the world war broke out in 1939.  That freedom which was a stepping stone next to freedom was then exercised freely and properly to achieve and then, with skill, exercised to maintain our neutrality, whatever view one takes about that decision.</P>
    <P>Our position is transformed because we also had the wit first, in the thirties, at a time when the depression was of a kind where protectionism&mdash;as I now think, though I did not then&mdash; was appropriate and we began the first development of industrial skills in the country, their first full expansion. The wit of our people was again exercised when it established the Industrial Development Authority 27 years ago.  The independence and the wit of our people were exercised again when recognising our interdependence towards that of Great Britain&mdash;itself the most dependent of all the large countries on the trade of the world&mdash;when we introduced the export tax relief.  There has been a large expansion of industry induced from these two decisions.  Many skills developed.  Nobody, for one moment, is satisfied that that has solved our problems.  But it has created one good problem for us&mdash;emigration has stopped.</P>
    <P>We have a growing population.  The managing director of the Industrial Development Authority is not, according to his published words, dug in behind the methods, the priorities or the preferences that have been <Col N="1310" /> applied.  He has operated the whole debate to criticism.  It is wide open to criticism, that is to say, criticism not so much about what has been done&mdash; which, in a way, is for the historians and for our great-grandchildren to read about and who might become frightfully tired in doing so&mdash;but as to what we should now do.</P>
    <P>The debate breaks out in some forms &mdash;should it be capital intensive, should it be labour intensive?  It is, I think, a question which does not get a simple answer, yes or no, to one or other question.  It is a question of where one locates the capital intensive and where one locates the labour intensive industries. If our problem now is the employment of our people most specifically, having got ourselves off the ground by our own effort, it seems reasonably clear to me that you do not finance capital intensive industry unless you have got a fair projection, that your own judgment tells you there will be linkages, downstream or upstream, that these are either going to create a demand for goods that are here, raw materials that are here for them to take into their industry, or a demand of industry for what they produce.</P>
    <P>Our export tax relief is under nobody's control in the sense that, technically, it is a revenue, a fiscal right, but grants can play their part. The capital intensive industry if it does not create a demand for raw material must create a supply which will create new industries.  The technological advantage of having the half-way process is now too expensive for us to have.  The location of the capital intensive industry must be where there is the most ready access to the skills, the amenities, the technologies, the sciences, the super infrastructure, indeed the superstructure&mdash; on the whole, in the large centres.  But we should be looking as well for the employment intensive industries.  We must look at these in the context of that world which has changed as much as I describe to you when I say that in 1922 our industrial segment was about the same proportion as that of India today.</P>
    <P>At one stage of my life I had the job of lecturing on commercial law and in the textbook then relevant the illustration <Col N="1311" /> given of a contract that was absolutely void was a contract of persons engaged in the enterprise of flying to the moon.  I faithfully parroted that out.  There has been an enormous sociological change here.  Taking 1,500 as being an average sort of small town, the percentage increase between 1961 and 1971 of that was quite extraordinary and the implications of that are remarkable, implications for the distribution of industry.  I can go on and argue the importance of a regional policy.  A regional policy is being practised by the Industrial Development Authority, but it has got to be practised in the context of what is happening to the services, the infrastructure, as well, the road transport system, the sewage disposal, water purity and all those elements.</P>
    <P>Ross and Baker, two members of the ESRI, prepared a splendid paper on the town and country situation here.  They drew a distinction which is arbitrary in its way&mdash;it is sufficient for our purposes&mdash;between what they called the autonomous sector and the induced sector.  The autonomous sector would be industry, tourism and agriculture which is not simply supplying the needs of the locality but oriented nationally, whether on its way abroad or on its way to the city of Dublin.  It has shown that the less developed the area the more service employment is induced.  The employment generated at a certain point of development in the induced section by the location of the industry in that area will reduce, but efficiency results and there is also the possibility of this technological transfer between the number of autonomous units.  Included among the autonomous units, incidentally, and this is very pertinent to Government policy, are the decision makers with regard to education, health and many of the local government operations. The analysis shows that where these administrative decisions are delegated there tends to be a growth of employment quite outside the number of people employed by the particular authority that has the decision making business operating there.</P>
    <P>In relation to any plan this seems to <Col N="1312" /> be a most vital element One ground for hope is past success.  Somebody said once something like: &ldquo;plucking the flower of safety by grasping the nettle of danger&rdquo;.  We plucked a free democracy out of a civil war and never let us fail in Leinster House to congratulate ourselves on that but never let us fail to examine ourselves as to whether or not we are still living up to the performances of those people on both sides of the divide, some who never held office, people like Tom Johnson, who played their part in the history of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves how relevant are our debates.  We must make them relevant if parties are going to retain credibility.  Our economic geographies when we were children, even the youngest of us, told us we had no resources but when Navan is on stream we will replace Australia as the third largest exporter of metal in the world.  Our fish exports have increased by 600 per cent over a period of years and all the logic of our position is that we should become, as Mr. Cronleigh said, and Dr. Roy Johnson in an admirable article pointed out, the fish factory of Europe.  I am not one of those who thinks that everything civil servants say is wrong and that what fellows like us say is right; not for one moment, but I ask the Minister, on this point, to examine the statute book.  He will find that up to recently &mdash;I did not have time to look up the legislation&mdash;there was a restriction imposed by law as to the size of boat that could be used by an Irishman when fishing in Irish waters.  I happened to have been involved in that. I never could row a boat; I had difficulty in falling out of one when someone else was rowing.</P>

      <P>My ambitions are reasonably careful.  The point I wish to make with regard to that is that public policy in regard to fisheries was under a particular influence. I will leave it at that.  It was not a political influence but it was misdirected.  I led deputations to Ministers of both parties and they were all about as open-eared as deaf but not mute people can be as to the recommendations I was making.  We must grasp these opportunities and we cannot grasp them unless we are prepared to be decisive, radical and prepared to revise and forget what we all said in the past.  I am among those who will have to forget things I said in the past about lots of things.</P>
      <P>On afforestation, in 1920, 1 per cent of the acreage of Ireland was under woodlands.  Full credit to the Department of Lands, or whatever title it happened to hold during the relevant years, as it has a tendency to change its name, that figure is now 5 per cent and in 1978 there will be an outflow of products from all of that patient restraint.  That money could have been set aside for the pleasures of the people, but it was employed to build up something of real value for the future.  With regard to things like woods, mines, minerals and gas, it seems to me that in all of these things there must be crucially involved technology in alliance with economics. The engineer or technologist does not tend to count the cost, but the economist tends to count the cost.  That is his job.  There is evidence that the relevant institutes that exist at the moment are collaborating together, and these disciplines are working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with regionalisation.  I know there is the problem of the loss of efficiency if you break up a Department of State and move it away from Dublin.  They think their children will not get the same opportunities as others, and so on, and there are all sorts of human problems.  With regard to decentralisation we may have to go back to the whole question of local government.  The system in relation to local government, in my view, ought to be the same.  I believe <Col N="1314" /> in capitalism not because of its ugly face, not because of the greed of some of those who operate it, and that does not include all of them: for many of them it is mere proof of the success of their enterprise.  The really important thing about the reformed capitalism we are talking about in 1976 as distinct from the exploitative capitalism which Marx wrote about in 1848, is its decentralised decision.  That is why it is bound to be better run, assuming there are proper laws curbing what they can do and the resources at their disposal, and fiscal laws.  This I approve of and I should like the Minister to know that.</P>
    <P>There is a corollary to taxing fringe benefits and the corollary is this.  Now that we have got the incomes commensurate, let us tax them so that the ambitious are left free to do the good work in Ireland they have done abroad.  Their ambitions should be inspired, of course.  That should be the tone of our society.  They should be inspired by a concern not merely for their own children but their neighbours' children and they should have a cosmic altruism which takes in not merely this generation but all the generations of men.  This is not a specific requirement, or limited solely as an approach to the christian.  Anyone with a sense of common humanity would have it.  We damage everyone if we hold back the ambitious.  We damage everyone if we deny educational opportunity merely because it has been proven that giving educational opportunity does not achieve equality.  How could it achieve equality?  Horses that lose in the Grand National are not capable of running in the Derby.  Is it likely to be different with mankind?  Men who could win the equivalent Derby might create employment for thousands of our men if properly inspired and motivated.</P>
    <P>Perhaps their ambitions should not require the inspiration of a pecuniary reward.  And it is not always as I have said necessarily a pecuniary reward. But excessively high direct taxation creates a sort of a sense of resentment that such a percentage is scooped off, more than the loss of the <Col N="1315" /> pecuniary reward very often.  It is the irritation of it.  I should have thought there are all sorts of other ways in which the ambitious can serve the community.  In any case, the Minister for Finance, although in an important position, is not the rector of a Franciscan Friary.  No rector of a Franciscan Friary receives more penitential punishment than the Minister, whether to correct him for his own sins or simply to improve him still more.</P>
    <P>People must be governed as they are, and we all know they are.  The motivation is different in many cases. We may have to make a choice of vices which are good for society.  A famous 18th-century pamphlet was written on that subject called &ldquo;Private Vices: Public Virtues&rdquo;.  There is no doubt in the order of vice, where you would put greed and envy, greed ahead and envy below.  Envy is damaging not merely to the envious but to the envied.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by saying our problems are real.  In my view, it would be very unjust to say these problems have been created by the Government.  If I thought that they were, I would say it.  Perhaps this Government, in their entirety, did not become aware of the problems created by the desire to solve the real social problems which existed earlier.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is true, but our problems can be solved if our people's virtues are employed.  One of the things I find most distasteful in reading economic literature is the odd piece that comes out, which is generally in relation to this theme, a sort of short-term comment on the defect in demand, as if some farmer if he did not go off and buy a washing machine to please his wife, has in some strange way damaged the economy, that he has reduced the real disposable income expressed in demand.</P>
    <P>I put my flag up and hold it high among those who save in this community, but anyone who knew the Kevnes analysis of this knew there could be a savings investment gap. There is need for close attention to be given to the institutions that receive <Col N="1316" /> the savings.  There may be justification of the regulation of their investment, provided the Government realise&mdash;as I think the Government realise and as the NESC certainly realise&mdash;that resources will be better managed if the decisions about them are decentralised to the people who know how to manage them.</P>
    <P>There is an necessity to clarify the idea of profit.  We want a new wording for it&mdash;the value which is added by the combination of imported skills, locally developed skills, the acquired machinery, the bringing together of the whole enterprise, the management.  It amuses me to note that those who complain about profits are very quick to say that the management is at fault when a company goes into liquidation. The management is at fault when a company goes into liquidation but the management is not entitled to profit when it does not.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will be making decisions and, as I understand the approach, the right ones.  Things have been topsy turvy worldwise.  We are tremendously dependent on the whole world.  The earlier report of the NESC stated quite clearly that there was no agency that could affect world events in Ireland, but that does not mean that, while we cannot affect world events, we cannot damage ourselves or improve ourselves.  We certainly can.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the Minister is shortly to issue a Green Paper.  Perhaps that should contain some basic decisions.  Being out of earshot of what is going on, I have to guess that it should in some way relate not merely to the short term and the medium term, but also to the long term.  There is nothing sacrosanct about 1986.  People say: &ldquo;We have to have projects to identify.&rdquo;  There is no way of doing that.  Projects will emerge if you identify where an investment is capable of receiving support, producing the up-stream or down-stream linkage which is so valuable. The outside world is not a fool. It knows our situation, and among the advantages of our situation is this very growth in our young, active labour force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I could see increased stability resulting from this.  I see advantage in young marriage.  One of the social evils that nobody has talked about is to see young people with plenty of cash in their pockets.  Apart from the dangers of the various diseases that can beset those who have money of that kind to spend at any age, it is not good for them.  An increase in their real disposable incomes might improve some quantity in a quarterly report issued by the Economic and Social Research Institute, but it might be very bad for them.  The responsibility of early marriage will lead to a concern for their children, and it is concern for the children of this country which should predominate in the tone to be struck in the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>If I see justification for the capitalist system in freedom, may I say quickly in case any one has doubt about it, that I have not the slightest objection to national enterprise, State-sponsored bodies engaging in industry.  I would have thought that it should be classed as a duty on all State industries to have a retraining department so that if people become redundant they are trained and the company has the resource and the legal authority to enter into conjoint ventures and set people up again.  It is a world in which we have reached the moon.  We have reached the stage when questions arise on another level, whether the regulation of technology will not be the next problem in other terms than the terms we are talking about.  We cannot afford to talk in terms of the advantages of leisure when we have such numbers of people to provide for.</P>
    <P>The first element of the infrastructure is the stability of the State. There can be a stable State and a repressive police regime for the medium or according to the degree of repression in the long term.  That is not the sort of State the Irish people want.  The Irish people want a stable State in the sense that justice is administered according to law by those whom they freely elect to govern.  The people are free to change them if they do not like them.  Among the structures that may have to be <Col N="1318" /> changed&mdash;and this is a free decision for all of us&mdash;are the structures of our parties themselves.</P>
    <P>Maybe the very structure of Government itself will have to be changed. If our situation in 1922 was that there was about the same proportion of the population engaged in industry as there is now in India, I do not see why our Cabinet should be more or less the same size.  You can kill a cat with cream, they tell me.  I have found more expensive ways of doing it.  You can kill a cabinet by overpacking it, by blocking it with lots of decisions that should be made elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of solutions to that problem.  One of them occurred to me in reading the OECD debate the other day when Senators present at the debate may have noticed that there was a sort of top group who, I imagine, spend most of the time in the Bahamas.  Then there was an advisory board and secretariat.  We have talked about junior Ministers and so on and that is down a dead lane obviously. People are not going to be satisfied with a plan that is going to be operated by an overburdened cabinet. We could have a national planning agency which could be overburdened by detail that ought not be going up there.  I would visualise the advisory board or something like it equivalent to the national planning agency, the kind of term I do not like.  The decisions should really formally come from the cabinet, but the work ought to be done by the National Advisory Board and behind it the secretariat.</P>
    <P>The secretariat clearly must be provided by the Department of Finance, because we come back to the beginning do we not?  We are talking about the Appropriation Bill, about the amount of the resources that the Government requires in order to administer the services that the people are demanding.  It is the Department of Finance which historically has been the practitioner of discipline of the kind that the country has always needed, never more needed than during those 20 years when the world boom was on before the recession hit us, and never less operated.</P>
    <P>No plan can be managed without it <Col N="1319" /> being adjusted on a yearly or a two-yearly or three-yearly basis, whatever it may be.  I am not skilled in the administrative sciences but all over the field science must be applied, administratively as well as socially, in industry and in agriculture.  We do not want quick gains or quick profits.  We want the solid profit of a really intelligently administered capital employing skilled people.  The people whom I hope we will live to see employed here will be in skilled occupations, and then all the questions about the conditions of their work will arise.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned profits, I would like to say that I am not going to suggest to the Chair and the Parliamentary Secretary that there should be any compulsions on this, but I quite honestly do not think, and I do not even desire, that we are going to get full co-operation in getting full return for the teamwork unless the team generally enjoys the benefit.  At the very start I would remove all fiscal disincentives to transference of share-holdings to employees or employee trustees.  I would change company law to make is quite clear that the company must have regard not merely to the interests of its shareholders but also to its employees, and must have regard too to its consumers.  The science that I talk about that should be applied to administration, social activity and the public sector of course&mdash;which I dare not venture to make more efficient&mdash;and produce the same service at less cost&mdash;should also be applied to the conditions of employment and the kind of schemes capable of being worked out, so that misconceptions on both sides with regard with this as being a trap of some kind my be dissipated.</P>
    <P>I said I was ending, but I had forgotten that I had told the Minister before lunch that I had a point to make with regard to fiscal incentives, and that will be my ending.</P>
    <P>One of the problems arises in relation to what I mentioned earlier in regard to the family courts.  I do not see quite how it fits in there, but there are other fields where it does in the demand for community service, youth <Col N="1320" /> activities and the countless voluntary operations.  I hope I am not misrepresenting David O'Mahony of Cork when I say that he said that goods provided to the poor&mdash;and that is an unscientific word&mdash;collectively are provided more expensively than when provided by the market mechanism.</P>
    <P>The market mechanism, of course, is an unfortunate capturing by the operatives of one technique of the very valuable concept which I wish the socialists were aware should be richly active among their concerns, and that is the concern for freedom.  It is not a question really of choosing one washing powder over another: it is very much more vital and important than that.  It is being free to do something for your children or not according to your choice but not according to the State's choice.  It is being free to stop working if you want to, to deal with your income if it is that kind of an income so that you can.  It is a whole lot of other things that I need not tell this House are involved in freedom.  But the National Economic and Social Council, supporting David O'Mahony spoke about the relative price effect&mdash;&ldquo;the Government pay more for everything, in effect, than anybody else.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In this quite interesting&mdash;however it may have been inspired&mdash;brochure by ASTMS, there is a very interesting, very relevant and I must say rather unexpected piece which fits in with the quotations from David O'Mahony and the reference, which I cannot say was more than that, to the NESC.  It was in the paper by Mícheál Ross, which is a very good one and it reads:</P>
    <P>Not all the aspirations of Irish people can or need be met by the State.  Given the growing shortage of funds, the example of developing countries bears imitation.  Could funds be diverted for the training of professions to develop para professional services under professional supervision?  Is it necessary for veterinarians to inspect meat, dentists to inspect schoolchildren's teeth? Gynaecologists to inspect pregnant women?  etc., etc.  Other countries say no.  Should students in physical <Col N="1321" /> education be selected on their academic achievements?  Is the provision of education wasteful in terms of the needs of society?  Could hospitalisation trends be reversed?  The lowest infant mortality rates in the world are those in The Netherlands where childbirth is in the home, normally under the supervision of a trained midwife.  This would release hospital beds, restore job opportunities to women, reduce State costs, etc., etc.</P>
    <P>Will you for God's sake wake up to the fact that direct taxation is too heavy, that you are going to increase people's freedom of choice if you give them an incentive to give their money tax free?  Let the State in its informed wisdom decide which of these are entitled to benefit, but let people say: &ldquo;I am going to give it to Gael Linn this week; I am going to give it to the Irish League of Credit Unions next week&rdquo; and so on.  The point is that it all started when they abolished tax relief in respect of charities because they thought the Church was getting too much money years ago.</P>
    <P>These are the very bodies that need to be supported and that people should be encouraged to give their money to by appropriate tax reliefs, because they will get it and spend it much more frugally and much more intelligently than if it were pouring out of any Department.  Look at the tidy towns competition.  How much does that cost the country?  How much would that have cost the country if it were run by the Department of Local Government?</P>

      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary.  The point is that all these things work and would work better and would relieve, if they were appropriately controlled and regulated, pressures that are genuine, because they are expressing real needs if people were not greedy for themselves but were anxious for other people, they would relieve part of the pressure on the Government.  There could be a system whereby they could <Col N="1322" /> be relieved.  They could go to others to give tax relieved contributions to aid them in their enterprises.  Could anything be more important at this moment than to provide, for example, proper provision, playing grounds, interests for the young and so on? Everybody knows that all the rich men of America have got together and created charities whereby they pay their great-grandchildren salaries of $50,000 a year.  All of that is capable of control and all of that is exactly the kind of thing that the Revenue Commissioners can control.  I conclude with that particular recommendation.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will faithfully report the last piece of my speech.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is fair to say that this Bill gives us an opportunity to pass judgment on and discuss the way that the £1,693 million is being spent, money which has been collected by way of taxation squeezed out of the taxpayer and supplemented by way of borrowings at very exorbitant interest.</P>
      <P>On one of today's papers it was mentioned, and it has been adverted to already, that our partners in the EEC seem to be very unhappy at the manner in which this Government are implementing the conditions attached to the last loan of £150 million which this country secured from the EEC. The EEC have demanded that we introduce more stringent measures to help to protect our economy.  That statement has appeared in a very reputable newspaper, one that there is tremendous weight to.  It pinpoints quite clearly that for the first time in the history of this State our Government have gone abroad borrowing and were unable to secure their last loan in a foreign capital, among their own friends in the EEC, without entering into a type of negotiation and without asking those people to more or less be guarantors that this loan be repaid.  Since the State was founded, irrespective of which Government were in office, we paid our way right down the line.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has denied this and it is not true, that is all right.  I would feel very annoyed if the good name of this country had been sullied abroad in any way, in other words, that we would have to go cap in hands to foreign capitals to borrow money.  Since the present Government took office they have indulged in a spate of borrowing unheard of since the foundation of the State.  We all know from the old proverb that &ldquo;He who goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrying&rdquo;.  It would be all right if the money borrowed had been used for capital development but so far as I know, and the statistics are there to prove it, out of every £100 spent in this country, £34 is borrowed money. I do not know if the Minister wishes to deny that but these figures can be substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be the aim of any good Government, among other things, to try to slow down the rate of inflation, create employment, stabilise the cost of living and keep down prices. These are some of the measures the people expect the Government to aim for at present.  I cannot see them fulfilling any of the worthy objects contained in the 14-point plan submitted to the electorate and which they promised to do.  I admit there was an oil crisis, as the Minister might say when he is replying, and we have been fair about that.  It has been admitted that much of this <Col N="1324" /> inflation has been caused internally and has escalated our troubles.  This is because the Government did not take corrective action at the proper time.  They were warned about this two or three years ago.  The salient facts are that the Government took office at a time when our economy was never better, the budget was balanced&mdash;there might have been a deficit of £5 million in 1972 but in 1975 we had a deficit of £259 million. If the projection is reasonably correct, it appears it will be £365 million by the end of this year, £1 million per day.  That is not the type of government the people expect and it is not the type of tax load one would expect any Government to impose on their citizens.  I feel it is bad policy to borrow such large amounts unless this money is used to increase employment.</P>
    <P>It does not matter what documents learned Senators quote from&mdash;and we have had a number of them today&mdash; the salient facts are that there are up to 120,000 unemployed.  We cannot run away from that figure.  The ordinary man-in-the-street will say that the true test of a Government is the answer one gets to the question: &ldquo;What are the Government doing for their people?  Are they making a reasonable attempt to provide employment for their citizens?&rdquo; Recently, reference was made to the number of youths in our population. I admit it may be reasonably difficult to obtain these figures but the reason for this is that last year the Government were so short of money, despite all the borrowing, they were unable to take a census, which was the practice since the foundation of the State. In an effort to save money, they neglected one of the most important tasks of any Government.  Statistics of our population are vital for planning for the future.  It was wrong for the Government, as has been said before, not to carry out this important duty and provide these necessary statistics.</P>
    <P>According to the OECD report this year, we have a higher rate of inflation than any other developed country. I would not be proud of making such a statement: it was made by <Col N="1325" /> people who had done a reasonable amount of research to back up their statement.</P>
    <P>These are some of the problems aggravating our people at the present time.  When we joined the EEC in 1973 we had great expectations of securing, for the first time in our history, an alternative market for our produce.  In 1933, as Senator FitzGerald mentioned, we introduced an industrial arm and worked very hard to build up industries, train our people and produce manufactured goods.  We were doing well as far as agricultural goods were concerned, but we were handicapped by the fact that we had to sell most of our agricutural produce to the British market. Because of that, Britain&mdash;when it suited her&mdash;paid us whatever price she thought they were worth.  We never knew what to produce: if the commodity was scarce it was dear, and if we over-produced we were penalised. It was only when we entered the Common Market&mdash;it was one of the main reasons for our joining&mdash;that we had a window in Europe and felt we would have alternative markets for our agricultural produce.  Agriculture is one of our main industries.  If it is doing well, there is a good chance that there will be a reasonable amount of employment.</P>
    <P>As things are at present in the EEC we are not being made aware of what is happening in agriculture.  We are getting conflicting reports from one week to the next.  One week we are told of the milk powder mountain, the next it is the beef mountain, and all this is very misleading for the farmer.  Last year the farmers were told to produce more milk, but that is a very expensive undertaking, as Senator Butler knows.  When a herd is built up, it is poor consolation for the farmer to know that the more he produces the less he will get for it.</P>
    <P>One would expect the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his officials to ensure that practically all the surplus agricultural produce of this small country, which probably produces only 2 per cent of the total agricultural output of the EEC, having regard to the distance that our <Col N="1326" /> products have to be transported, and so on, would be absorbed by the EEC. He could even go so far as to walk out, as was done by some other countries when the EEC decided to allow eastern countries to export beef to the Common Market or agricultural produce from other non-EEC countries, to the detriment of our farmers who were labouring under very primitive and adverse conditions at home. We have an excellent climate for producing agricultural produce.  Everybody in agriculture knows that the cheapest food is what the animal can eat out of the ground&mdash;in other words, grass.</P>
    <P>There should be more scientific research done so far as trying to ensure that the farmer would be able to keep his cattle longer out in the open, so that he would not be forced to take them off the grass for six months of the year.  Irrespective of what scientists may tell us about poaching soils and so on, there should be some type of grass developed that would ensure that the soil would not be damaged so much and that the period could be extended.  This is one way in which the Government and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries could help the farmer.  All over the country there are committees of agriculture and scientists attached to agriculture and all this talent should be harnessed so as to ensure that we will play our full part so far as the EEC is concerned. It is vitally important to this country.</P>
    <P>Thousands of jobs depend on agriculture, not alone out in the fields but in the manufacture of farm machinery of all classes, the manufacture of milk powder, cheese and cream, and its associations, and the services industries that back it up.  More important than ever, most of these industries and co-ops are located in rural Ireland and it is high time that co-ops and industries located out in the country got every encouragement to survive and to stay there.  We do not want a situation whereby most of the people will rush into the capital and leave the rest of the country bare.  One way of ensuring that that will not happen is to ensure that the Government, the Minister and his team will <Col N="1327" /> lean over backwards to help those who are engaged in the hazardous and difficult occupation of agriculture. There is no time schedule or no five day week, so far as the farming community are concerned.  It is a hard slog for the farmer from Monday morning to Saturday night and, indeed, even on Sunday, from the time he is a small boy until he is an old man going out the other end. These things are of tremendous importance so far as the farming community are concerned.  Our agricultural policies should be overhauled, particularly now that we are in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The meat industry is closely connected with agriculture.  Any intervention payments that are coming back from the EEC, any payments that are coming for TB or brucellosis tests and so on, should be made direct to the farmer.  It should not be beyond the officials engaged in agriculture all over the country to devise some type of a scheme whereby the producer would get the actual money that is coming back rather than allow the situation that arose last year or the year before, when the meat processing industry cleaned up at the expense of the ordinary farmer.  People are now lamenting and moaning over the fact that the cattle population has decreased.  A cattle population that should really be on the increase has gone down by 600,000 in the past couple of years.  That is one of the reasons for the collapse of the fertiliser industry.  It is one of the reasons why many people are becoming unemployed.</P>
    <P>When agriculture goes down many of the other associated industries go down alongside it.  That is detrimental in the situation in which we now find ourselves.  There is no doubt about that.  It should be the aim of all, irrespective of which side of the House we are on, to try to get people to work, even one, two or three in every area.  There is no easier way of doing that than trying to increase the agricultural output, thereby providng employment in agriculture and its associated industries.  It will not cost the <Col N="1328" /> £4,000 or £5,000 that it often costs the Exchequer to put one man into a job in industry behind some machine.</P>
    <P>As far as city dwellers are concerned, grants applicable to farmers have been boosted and a picture has been painted that the farmer is rolling in luxury and that he goes to the races a couple of days a week.  Half of that is tommyrot.  This type of farmer certainly does not exist in my part of the country, and I doubt if he exists in many parts of this country. Those people are not true farmers at all.  It is important that some of this money should be used to ensure that these grants, if necessary, would be increased to keep the farmer in production.</P>
    <P>I deplore the attitude of this Government this year in introducing a tax on the co-ops.  It was bad policy, apart from the political structure of it. It was wrong for a Government to tax an industry, particularly at this time when we were trying to make our mark in Europe.  The co-ops were built up by the farmers throughout the country over a long period and they were working under very difficult conditions.  They have to go into the banks and try to get loans to buy the machinery that might sit in their yards for one or two years before it is bought.  They have to buy in large lots.  They have quite a lot of overheads. I, certainly, would have been in favour of removing the tax the Government imposed on the co-ops. As I said, co-ops are factories in rural Ireland.  They are places that keep families living on the small farms.</P>
    <P>The best way to get rid of small farms is to tax the co-ops out of existence and have a big co-op at a centre far away.  That will mean that families will move away from the small farms and into the big centres of population.  There will be vacant schools, vacant churches and vacant community centres in rural Ireland. We will be faced with the difficult problem of trying to build skyscrapers for some of the rural families in our big cities.  This will create health hazards and other hardships for our population in the future. It is very important that this money <Col N="1329" /> for agriculture should be used for the very best advantage of the farmer because he is at the centre of this issue.</P>
    <P>Some reference was already made to industry.  Those in the Industrial Development Authority and the county development teams who are charged with trying to provide industry in various parts of this country have a very difficult job.  I could not agree more with Senator Alexis FitzGerald when he says that there must be a profit element in this.  Let us be fair to the people who come together and set up a little industry in any part of Ireland and put their own money into it.  They are entitled to get some type of profit out of that. Surely no man would be foolish enough to put his money into an industry and take the chance of losing it unless there was some incentive for him to do that.  The incentive for him to do that is there only if the Government and their team try to negotiate markets and help them open up new markets through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the IDA.  The industrialist is a very important person. He is putting his money in there and will create a few jobs in his area. That is very important because no matter what our population structure may be people will not stay around if there are no jobs.  If there are no jobs these young people about whom we have heard so much today and who are a very important asset so far as this country is concerned will eventually be forced to revolt.  They cannot hang around doing nothing; they want work and the duty of this Government is to lean over backwards to try to provide employment for them.  Local authorities also play a small part in this.  Our local authority in County Cavan have, over the years, given exemption from rates for an extra three years to any industrialist coming into our county and setting up factories.  We are not being over-generous in doing that because we realise that when an industrialist comes into the county he usually builds a house for himself and later a few other houses and eventually the county council will be recouped so far as rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> As regards industries already established, the Government should be very quick to come to their aid if they are in trouble.  It is not good enough for people working in an industry to wake up some morning and read that the receiver has been called in, as happened in my constituency very recently.  An effort should have been made beforehand, if accounts were being produced, to try to salvage that industry, because when an industry closes in an area it has a very bad effect on the people living in the area and indeed a very bad effect on the workers despite the fact that they may get redundancy payments and other benefits. That is not the solution.  They would be much happier working in their jobs.</P>
    <P>There should be more liaison between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It is wrong that in many parts of the country the Land Commission can come along and acquire farms for afforestation without consulting the neighbouring farmer living in the area.  In every case where a farm is coming on the market or is being sold secretly to the Forestry Division there should be a notice in the local paper.  Or there should be consultation with the adjoining farmers because if an adjoining farmer was encouraged, got a loan and was allowed to buy that particular farm it might make the difference between him remaining in the area and emigrating. There is much more employment potential in the land as it is than when it is planted.  It may look all right for tourists and other people to see large parts of mountain and wasteland planted.  We are in favour of that and we are glad to see that happening, but there are very many acres of land already planted that would have been much more productive producing sheep or cattle and keeping a family living in that area and families are more important in rural Ireland than trees, irrespective of how dainty or attractive the trees may be.</P>
    <P>More research could be done regarding deep ploughing of wasteland and hilly or mountainy land.  I have seen in Kerry where they imported a <Col N="1331" /> machine from Italy, I think, some years ago and ploughed up the side of the mountain and they were very successful in reseeding and replanting that land and now they are growing green grass on it.  It is no harm to say that the Acting Chairman is an expert in this and I know that he has very efficiently transformed a piece of and in my constituency so that you would not be blamed for thinking you were in County Meath if you were walking across that mountain.  This is an example of what can be done.  It creates employment in an area and it is the type of effort that should be encouraged by the Government.  The man who is living locally and is willing to put his capital into it should be considered because he is not a fly-by-night, he has an interest in what he is doing and is creating employment in the area and that is of tremendous importance for the country.</P>
    <P>Some of this money is being used by the Department of Health and it will be fed back to the health boards. Many of the health boards are at present in trouble because they are not getting as much money as they expected to get.  Because of inflation, giving them the same amount as they got last year does not solve the problem at all: it means that there has to be a cutback.  I would freely admit that perhaps the health boards were not the best solution and that there may be quite a lot of expenditure in cases where there would have been other means and ways of doing some particular thing in a cheaper way.</P>
    <P>When health was under the county councils they had a greater say in what was happening.  At the same time we must admit the health boards are fulfilling a very useful function and now that they are there and the buildings are built and so on, I suppose we must keep them there.  The idea behind them all is to try to provide a better service for our people and any civilised country such as ours should lean over backwards to try to help people who are sick or infirm or who are ill.  The able-bodied men, whether unemployed or otherwise are at least able to cater for themselves, <Col N="1332" /> but when people are maimed or sick it is the duty of a nation to try to do everything possible to alleviate their sufferings.  That should be our duty here.</P>
    <P>There is another small point that I mentioned before and which I thought this Government would have been able to concede long ago.  It is in relation to children who are between the ages of 12 and 16, who leave primary schools and who go to post-primary schools and because they go to a post-primary school they are denied dental treatment.  That is very detrimental to the health of these people later on.  As a matter of fact, I think they are denied all medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was a great furore in this country about fluoridation and efforts were made to try to ensure that people in future growing up in this country would have their own teeth at the age of 50, 60 or indeed 70.  There is no reason why they should not.  There is no substitute for ordinary teeth.  It would be money well invested for a nation to try to get over that problem.  I admit that it is not completely a Government problem because there are many areas in the country where you cannot get dentists irrespective of what you pay them.  Somebody will have to consider this situation: many professional people qualify at our universities and on third-level strata and are helped in their education by the taxpayers but these professionals are then often unwilling to take up positions in any part of their own country except perhaps in a large town.  Yet, they will go to some of the Third World countries or somewhere else and they will work under very adverse conditions.  These people should show a little patriotism and realise that they owe some return to the State.  It is not good enough in 1976, despite all our third-level education, that we would have this scarcity of dentists and that our young people would suffer because of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The main reason they are suffering is not because of the scarcity of dentists but because they <Col N="1333" /> do not look after their teeth properly when they are very young and their parents do not make them.  The Senator should put a bit of emphasis on that side of it also.  The State cannot be responsible for watching the children's teeth as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will get time to reply if he wishes to reply later.  But I want to point out that we are paying through taxations this enormous amount of money and we expect to get service for it.  I would expect that the Parliamentary Secretary and any man with a family would be very concerned as regards the health of his children especially if he were not able to pay for the dental care and he would expect the State to ensure that the period between 12 and 16 years would be bridged and that the service would be provided.  That is a vital period in the life of any individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time a county medical officer speaks on this subject &mdash;which is very frequently&mdash;he says that the main reason for the bad teeth in this country is that parents allow their children to eat ice-pops and biscuits and do not assist them in washing their teeth properly.  The Senator ought to concentrate on people's responsibility towards themselves and their families and lay off the State for a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I am not getting off this subject: I am pursuing it until eventually some Government will concede that the children in this country between 12 and 16 years of age are entitled to free dental <Col N="1334" /> treatment if the parents cannot afford it.  They should have it and no Parliamentary Secretary or Minister should come here and try to crib about it and say that it is the fault of the parents and that it is the fault of the food they eat and so on.  Have the Government not some responsibility?  Why was a case brought in Dublin regarding fluoridation before the Supreme Court.</P>

No State could stand up under that burden.  I am listening to the Senator saying that the State must do this and the State must do that and I am still waiting to hear him saying that the parents ought to do something or the children themselves must learn to wash their teeth and not be eating things that will damage their teeth.</P>

It is one I would make anywhere, and feel justified in making it, because I would be fighting for the lower income group who cannot at that vulnerable age afford to have their teeth seen to.  It is the duty of the State to try to ensure, by the medical and dental services provided, that our citizens grow up healthy.  This is most important when the children go on to secondary school.  I make no apologies to anybody for saying that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is so worried about the money the State would be spending on this, let him talk to the Minister for Health who, very recently, was doing his very best to ensure that there would be free medical services for every Tom, Dick and Harry from the lower income group to the greatest swank in the country.  He promised he would introduce these free medical services at the top.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary or any Minister will not shout me down.  I am trying to take a stand on behalf of the youth between the ages of 12 and 16 and I will continue to do that while I am in public life in the hope that problems will be resolved successfully for the betterment of the health of future citizens.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I can move on now to another matter.  I refer to the amount being spent on Posts and Telegraphs and the operations of that very important Department.  In many parts of the country we are totally dissatisfied with the performance of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because of the absence of a good telephone service. I heard a parliamentary question answered with regard to the number of telephones installed in Dublin.  That may be good for the citizens of Dublin but I can assure you that the people in rural Ireland are very conscious of the need for telephones.  The latest effort by the Minister is very unfair because he is now trying to entice the local authority, through the ratepayers, to erect telephone kiosks in various areas.  From the beginning that was one Department which paid its way and did so for a long number of years.  In that situation it is very unfair for the Minister now to expect the ratepayers of County Cavan or County Monaghan, or any other county, to subsidise the erection of telephone kiosks.  Very recently a new telephone kiosk was needed at Ballyhaise, which is a Department of Agriculture College, and the Minister was not satisfied a kiosk should be erected there.  It is a very thickly populated area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that some money could be made available for painting and decorating post offices. They are very important buildings. The people who run them are hardworking. They take charge of quite an <Col N="1337" /> enormous amount of money and protect State finance by way of saving certificates and so on.  Indeed, they often handle as much money as many of the banks do and yet the same respect is not afforded to them.  The work in post offices is done very efficiently.  They are places tourists visit.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, I would like to make a statement.</P>
      <P>Since the Paris Summit of December, 1974, it has been the practice of the heads of Government of the member countries of the European Communities to meet three times a year.  The purpose of these meetings is to ensure the development and overall cohesion of the activities of the Communities and of the work of political co-operation which is carried on separately from the ordinary business of the Communities under the Treaties.</P>
      <P>I need not say that the meetings which have been held have been varied in their effectiveness.  Some have been highly successful&mdash;like that in Dublin in March, 1975, dealing with the British renegotiation of the terms of entry to the Communities.  Others have not been notable for substantive conclusions.  However, I think it would be a mistake, simply on this account, to underrate the significance of these meetings&mdash;between the heads of the Government of some of the most powerful nations in the world, working towards the common goal of European Union, in accordance with understandings and procedures laid down in the founding and accession Treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of views on the nature and purpose of these meetings, I think <Col N="1338" /> that the Council meeting held in Brussels on 12th and 13th July was notable for its effectiveness and brevity.  In a meeting time of little more than a working day it reached decisions or orientations for decisions of great importance to this country and for the future of Europe.  It was one of the more satisfactory Councils, so far as we are concerned, both in its tone and conclusions.</P>
    <P>The first decision of importance related to direct elections to the European Parliament.  Obviously many countries have a direct and vital interest in this.  The allocation of seats to the different countries of the Community was the subject of a number of different proposals by the Parliament itself, by the Irish Government, the British, the French and the Luxembourg Presidency.  The accord reached yesterday gives this country 3.66 per cent of the total of number of seats&mdash;the same approximately as in the original Parliament proposals. But this is not the main point.  The benefit lies in the fact that instead of ten members, as at present, or 13 under the Parliament's proposals, we will now have 15&mdash;and, because of the increase, we will be better able to serve on various committees and in the work of the Parliament itself.  The numbers allocated to other countries are 81 each for France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, 25 for the Netherlands, 24 for Belgium, 16 for Denmark and six for Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>The Government will be considering in the next few months the question of constituencies, methods of elections and other technical issues.  It seems likely that the first elections will be held in May or June, 1978, as I originally proposed at the Paris summit in December, 1974.</P>
    <P>There was considerable discussion at the Council of the situation in Northern Ireland.  We urged the case for a minimum of three seats for the area.  The British proposal, involving 78 seats for each of the four larger countries, which provided the main basis of discussion at the meeting, was amended to increase this figure to 81, substantially to enable that Government to allocate a third seat <Col N="1339" /> to Northern Ireland.  This makes it possible to make arrangements for the Northern minority to be represented in the European Parliament, together with representatives of the majority, according to their respective voting strengths.</P>
    <P>Fisheries was the second item of major importance to Ireland.  There are two principles underlying our approach.  The first is the need for conservation.  The future of the industry is being undermined by gross overfishing off our shores, which is rapidly destroying fish stocks.  This depletion is not confined to stocks such as herring which we have known for some years were declining.  As I mentioned at the European Council last week, information emerged at a meeting of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in Portugal to the effect that in the past two years one non-member country&mdash;the Soviet Union&mdash;took over 500,000 tons of mackerel in the waters around Ireland, Scotland and southern England, the so-called western area. Because of this the Commission's scientists consider that not more than 250,000 tons or so should be taken by all countries in this area in 1977 in the interests of the conservation of the stock.</P>
    <P>Effective conservation measures are now extremely urgent.  The quota system administered by the North-East Atlantic Commission has not, regrettably, proved effective in conserving stocks in the North Atlantic area.  I am disturbed at the fact that at last week's meeting of the Commission agreement was not reached on national quotas in a number of very important North Atlantic fisheries in 1977.  The issue is further complicated by the stated intention of some States, including America and Canada, to declare an exclusive economic zone of 200 miles shortly.  This action would mean that countries which have traditionally fished in those waters would soon move to other areas, including the areas around the countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>The second principle underlying our approach concerns the place and <Col N="1340" /> potential of fishing in our economy. Fishing provides a bigger share of GNP and employment in Ireland than in other Community countries, with one exception.  It is, moreover, especially important to the poorest and least developed parts of Ireland, and thus has a special significance from a regional policy viewpoint.  I made these points at the heads of Government meeting.</P>
    <P>Senators will note that the Council issued a statement indicating their determination to protect the legitimate interests of Community fishermen. To this end, the meeting decided to invite the Council of Ministers, at its meeting on 20th July, 1976, to give consideration to a declaration of intent on the extension of fishing limits of the Community to 200 miles.</P>
    <P>The question of coastal bands and their extent within the 200-mile exclusive zone will obviously be the subject of further discussion within the Community.  I made clear this country's vital concern with a coastal band of up to 50 miles around our coasts.</P>
    <P>Terrorism is a difficult subject for obvious technical, legal and political reasons.  The Council declared that recent events have again shown that no country, no people and no government can expect to be spared from acts of terrorism, kidnapping and hijacking unless all countries agree to effective counter-measures.  The Council asked the Ministers for Justice of the Nine to draw up a Convention on which the Nine will commit themselves to extraditing or prosecuting terrorists and will invite other countries to join in it.  I do not wish to go into further detail except to say that I regard the outcome of the meeting on this point as highly satisfactory. In particular, we gained recognition by the nine heads of Government of the principal of trial in the country where a terrorist is caught&mdash; as under the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act&mdash;as an alternative to extradition.</P>
    <P>There was general agreement on the appointment of Mr. Roy Jenkins to succeed Mr. Ortoli as President of the Commission.  His appointment will come into effect on 1st January, 1977, <Col N="1341" /> but the fact that he is designated now as Mr. Ortoli's successor will enable him to have a say in the appointment of his fellow-Commissioners.  This will obviously make for a better Commission and is fully in accord with the proposals I made in my memorandum to the Council before the Rome Summit last December, and the similar proposals of Mr. Tindemans in January last, that member governments should first agree by common accord on a President-designate.  I understand that Mr. Jenkins will be visiting the capitals of the Nine to discuss relevant matters.</P>
    <P>There was a full discussion on the economic situation in the Community and the world.  The constructive results of the recent tripartite conference between governments, employers and unions were generally welcomed. Several speakers emphasised that governments alone could not control the economic situation&mdash;they must have co-operation with employers and trade unions in decision-making.  Stress was laid on better co-operation between the social partners.  I supported this analysis and welcomed the start of a consensus at European level with unions and employers as helpful to similar situations on a national level.</P>
    <P>The Dutch Presidency has made certain proposals designed to strengthen the internal economic and financial coherence of the Communities and has suggested that the medium-term economic programme of the Communities should be made to play a role in a periodic review of national programmes.  The proposals also referred to economic guidelines for member countries and to exchange rate developments.  I emphasised the need to ensure that any guidelines should take full account of the real problems, particularly those of a structural nature, which impede progress towards a more cohesive Common Market.  I said that otherwise we would find that we are setting ourselves impossible objectives.  With other heads of Government I supported the suggestion for a full discussion of the matter, particularly the Dutch proposals, in the Council of Finance Ministers.  This, despite <Col N="1342" /> certain Press reports to the contrary. was the extent of the discussion and the scope of the decisions on the economic issues before the Council.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, a conference of seven countries took place recently in Puerto Rico and discussed matters, some of which were within the competence of the Community&mdash;without a Community presence as such.  There was agreement at the European Council that in future there should be consultation before any similar conference especially on how Community interests will be defended there and, where Community competences are involved, that Community procedures and obligations would be respected.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of officials about the same time as the European Council, which discussed the opening of negotiations for Greek membership, we secured an understanding for which we had been pressing for some months past, that the resources of the Community would be expanded in an appropriate manner to take account of the admission of Greece. We regard this as a very important precedent for any future expansion of the Community.</P>
    <P>I regard the outcome of the European Council as a success for Europe and indeed for this country.  We achieved the go-ahead for direct elections at the time we proposed, 15 seats for this State, and an additional seat for Northern Ireland; the decision to move towards the establishment of a 200-mile exclusive Community fishing zone; the recognition for the first time in a European forum of the principle of trial in the country where a terrorist is caught, as an alternative to extradition: agreement on the new President of the Commission and acceptance of his role in relation to the choice of other members; constructive discussions on the economic situation; a decision with respect to any future Puerto Rico-type Conferences; and the understanding that the resources of the Community will be expanded appropriately in relation to Greek membership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> In accordance with practice, I shall arrange to have laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course copies of formal declarations or statements made at the meeting.</P>

      <P>As this is a rather unique occasion in the Seanad it might be of assistance to the House if I outlined the following procedure. As there is no motion or Bill before the House the statement by the Taoiseach cannot be made the occasion for debate.  As regards the number of statements, if any, which may be allowed neither the Standing Orders nor the practice of the Seanad provide any guidance.  However, I have noticed that in such circumstances in the Dáil the Ceann Comhairle has discretion to allow further statements from a spokesman nominated by a party in Opposition.  Having considered the matter carefully I have come to the conclusion that I should allow the Leader of the Opposition and a Senator nominated by the Independent Senators, whose name is communicated to me, to make a statement. I should emphasise that such statement should be fairly brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be fairly brief. First of all, to go through the essentials in the Taoiseach's statement as far as the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad are concerned, we totally welcome the decision at the Summit to initiate direct elections to the European Parliament.  We have always felt very strongly&mdash;indeed this view is I think shared generally across the board among all parties elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;that direct elections will bring a sense of participation on the part of the people of our country in the whole area of the European involvement, and that the heretofore nominated system from political parties has lacked that special involvement on the part of the people who actually go to a polling station, record their choice, vote for people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always felt very strongly, as a member of the Committee of the European Parliament concerned with processing the whole aspect of European direct elections that has now <Col N="1344" /> been finalised by the Summit, that this actual personal involvement on the part of the people of Europe was the basic cement in the whole structure. I feel it will be so and that it will be the real step in making the European Community mean something as far as the people of the Community are concerned and the people of our nation are concerned. In my view it is all important to get this off the ground.  It is a very excellent step that has been processed a little bit ahead of time, indeed it is an argument for having Summit conferences that we are having this in 1978 because some two years ago the thinking was that we might not have it for 1980.  We will have it now, hopefully, mid-summer 1978.</P>
    <P>As regards our 15 seats I will not raise the point one way or the other. We are getting what we deserve, no more, no less.  We are getting 3.66 per cent, which out of 410 seats represents the very same percentage as originally recommended by the Committee of the European Parliament.  That is all right and I do not propose to make any point about whether we should have had any more or not.</P>
    <P>The question of fisheries is a very important aspect, to which the Taoiseach rightly referred.  I thought he might have mentioned the regional importance of fisheries.  Our strong point along with Britain, who is also seeking to get a 50 mile band within the 200 mile limit, is the regional consideration.  Britain will be seeking it, particularly in regard to Scotland.</P>
    <P>We should be pushing it very strongly on regional considerations. These particular regional considerations that apply to the north-west of Ireland, the western part of Ireland, the south-western part of Ireland and to the whole western coast of Scotland are considerations that do not apply to any other present member state. They would apply if Norway was in as well.  There is a very strong argument on regional considerations for getting this 50 mile band.  It is all very well to talk about regional policy, regional considerations and regional funds but here is a practical way to help a regional area through the development <Col N="1345" /> of our fisheries, especially the small and medium sized fishermen who operate from Kerry to the Hebrides.  It is on that basis that we should pitch our argument.  I note that it is not mentioned in the Taoiseach's speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad it is there. I failed to see it but certainly greater emphasis should be placed on this one.  Regional considerations is our strong point in pushing the case in regard to the 50 mile band.</P>
      <P>In regard to the economy as a whole, I feel that the Taoiseach's speech is on weak ground.  The economic situation gets a half paragraph in the Taoiseach's statement. Here we are dealing with something very fundamental where we are out of line with every other member of the Community at the present time. In various ways all the countries in the EEC other than ourselves are tackling the inflation problem, the prices problem and the incomes problem.  We are dragging our heels in this area.  This is an area that requires political leadership of the first kind that has heretofore been lacking. While the rest of the Community will have inflation rates curbed to under 10 per cent we are running into an inflation rate nearing 20 per cent.  That is the crude and cruel situation facing our economy at the present time <i>vis-a-vis</i> the other economies in the European Community.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are both hiding from the public the fundamental fact that if we are going to solve our economic problems we will require aid from the Community.  If we require aid from the Community we will have to observe Government budgetary disciplines that we have not observed heretofore by reason of a profligate attitude on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to quote from the Report of the European Parliament of the 7th July, 1976, page 182, when I had a question down about the Irish <Col N="1346" /> economic position within the Community. The reply was given by Commissioner Gundelag reported on page 183: I quote from the second paragraph:</P>
    <P>In the latest communication to the Council on Economic Policy to be followed in 1976 and in the budgets for 1977, the Commission recommended that Irish budgetary policy in 1977 should aim, in conjunction with an appropriate incomes and prices policy at a strict limitation on salaries, social transfers and other current expenditure together with possibly a modest increase in taxation.  These guidelines are in line with those approved by the Council when fixing the conditions for economic policy in connection with the Community loan to Ireland. This loan demonstrates the Community's willingness to alleviate the Irish short-term economic problems.</P>
    <P>That is in reference to the existing loan of £150 million.</P>
    <P>If some guidelines will not be followed&mdash;here I am specially thinking of the pledge for an incomes and prices policy&mdash;other measures will need to be adopted.  If not employment and the balance of payments shall be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>What the Community is saying in that reply given by Commissioner Gundelach to me last Wednesday in effect is that if the Taoiseach and the Government do not put the national house in order, the Taoiseach, the Government and this country will not get the help needed to pull this country out of its very serious economic and financial problems.</P>
    <P>In plain language, that is what that reply means.  It was given to me last Wednesday by Commissioner Gundelach of Denmark, who is a responsible and senior member of the Commission emphasising the fact that this Government should get down to the practical business of running this country properly, that they can only run this country properly by observing very positive guidelines and disciplines which for the past three-and-a-half years they have completely ignored <Col N="1347" /> and that, as far as the European Community is concerned, the game is up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is such a petty comment that I do not propose to go down that <i>cul-de-sac.</i>  I am engaged in a statesman-like exercise with the Taoiseach of the day.  He and I know that we must follow these guidelines and observe these disciplines.  If this is not done and if the required political leadership is not given to ensure that the environment is right for such measures, that such guidelines can be adopted and effective action can be taken, we are into a very catastrophic situation as far as the future economic and social development of our community is concerned.  These are the realities.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of them.</P>
      <P>It is a question of political will.  The Government do not appear to have the political will to exercise the type of attitude that I am advocating.  If they do not have the political will, then the answer is to get out.  That is the fundamental democratic answer to all situations where government by paralysis develops.  If government by paralysis develops and if the people in charge of Government become paralysed in regard to taking the appropriate action that is needed, then there is a place to go.  There is always a rest home to go to in Opposition and there are always people willing to take over and to take action.  What is needed at present is the political will to take positive action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of responding to the Taoiseach's statement following the European Council.  As you have ruled, there can only be one Independent speaker this afternoon and I should like to thank my fellow Independents for allowing me to fulfil this role. Obviously I do not speak for them but I do speak from their ranks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not share the Taoiseach's enthusiasm for the outcome of this <Col N="1348" /> European Council.  He has proclaimed it as a success for Europe and a success for Ireland.  To some extent success depends on your expectation.  If your expectations are very low you can then rate any decisions taken as being a success.  In that context the outcome could be looked upon with a certain qualified approval.  However, on examination, the Taoiseach's statement does not show that the European Council made significant decisions of key importance either to Europe or, more specifically, to this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the development of the European Council. The Taoiseach has referred to it. He referred to the fact that it now meets three times a year and that some meetings, such as the so-called Dublin Summit, which finalised the renegotiation by Britain of its terms of entry to the EEC, are regarded as successful whereas other meetings&mdash; for example, the meeting in April&mdash; were most unsuccessful.  Whether successful or unsuccessful, the development of the European Council is bad for this country and bad for the Community in general.  It is a body which purports to be an institution of the Community, but it is not a true Community institution.  It is an inter-governmental institution in which there is no proper set agenda, in which the big powers predominate and in which there is all the aura of inter-governmental big-country decisions being taken in the context of what purports to be a Community institution.  This sort of development is not in Ireland's interest as a small member of the EEC.  Far from supporting the further development of the European Council we should be trying to bring that body within the normal procedures of a Council of Ministers.  This would allow the Heads of State and Prime Ministers to attend a meeting of the Council of Ministers where they would not just take &ldquo;political orientations&rdquo;, where they would take Community decisions, where they record those decisions, and where those decisions are in the interests of the Community and not in the narrow short-term self-interest of the four larger countries <Col N="1349" /> in a forum dominated by those larger countries.</P>
    <P>I do not welcome the emphasis placed on the success of a European Council as justifying this body.  It should be examined critically as intergovernmental in form and as lacking a Community base and a Community identity which undermines the position of a small country such as Ireland and undermines the Community interest in general.</P>
    <P>Turning to the first matter which the Taoiseach referred to&mdash;the question of direct elections&mdash;like Senator Lenihan, I welcome the fact that it was possible to come to a decision on the allocation of seats, although it was clear that the real negotiation was going on between the big powers, which is part of the context of a European Council.  It was not really a Community decision.  It was a decision between the big powers as to what they would agree to.  The Taoiseach is right that it is a breakthrough for the European Parliament and that he can be reasonably satisfied with the combination of 15 seats for Southern Ireland and three seats for the North of Ireland.  It was rather shocking that the question of representation for Northern Ireland had to be negotiated at that very late stage; that there was a lack of appreciation that unless Northern Ireland got at least three seats there would not be representation of the two communities at the European level&mdash;representation of the minority. It is striking that there was not the political understanding of this at a much earlier stage and an assurance that there would be adequate representation of the two communities from Northern Ireland.  A decision on direct elections is only a very small step, the European Parliament still lacks legislative power.  It still lacks real control over decision-making, either in the Commission or in the European Council.  It still lacks a key place in the overall structure of the Community.  It is a small positive step. Now it really depends on the sort of follow-through, both in this country and in the other member states.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Taoiseach made reference to the fact that the Government <Col N="1350" /> will be considering in the next few months the question of constitu encies, methods of election and other technical issues.  I hope this implies that our approach will be on the basis of defined constituencies rather than on the basis of some list system for the whole country.  There would be an immense value in having regional representation linked to the European Parliament and a development of that sort of infrastructure in our political system.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the question of fisheries as being an item of major importance for Ireland. Nobody in this House would disagree with him.  He spoke about the two principles underlying our approach: the need for conservation and our very substantial dependence on the potential of fishing to our economy. But he did not say that good decisions had in fact been taken in relation to fishing.  He said that the question of extending the Community's fishing limits to 200 miles had been deferred to a meeting of the Council of Ministers later this month.  It looks as though the Community will, as other large states have done, decide on a unilateral basis to extend the economic zone to 200 miles.  But what about the key issue of protection of Ireland's fishing industry?  That has not been safeguarded and has not been guaranteed.  Indeed, the phrase at the end of that section is an extremely oblique one: &ldquo;I made clear this country's vital concern with coastal band of up to 50 miles around our coasts.&rdquo;  But what was the reaction to that?  There was no commitment given.  Should we not examine our own consciences in this regard?  Have we done our home work on our potential of fishing?  To what extent are we credible when we say we want a 50 mile exclusive zone? Are we able to fish 50 miles out?  Do we know what the potential is?  Have we geared ourselves to be credible to the Germans, the French and the British when we argue for an exclusive 50 mile zone; or are we coming in on the coattails of Britain and trying to let them make the running for us instead of being quite sure that we will argue coherently and authoritatively <Col N="1351" /> for our fishing industry, specifically related to the regional context, as Senator Lenihan said?</P>

      <P>Hopefully, yes, there will be better conservation.  I agree, there may be a unilateral extension to 200 miles with the result that others will be policing our area to ensure that there is no exploitation by the Russians.  The next matter is terrorism.  The reference by the Taoiseach to this is brief to the point of being cryptic.  It is rather difficult to understand the precise nature of the discussion which took place between the nine Heads of Governments. I do not agree that it would, in principle, be desirable to have the concept or principle of trial in a country where a terrorist is caught, as under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, as an alternative to extradition. That would undermine the civil liberties interest.  It would undermine the protection of the individual concerned. I would prefer a system where the types of offences for which extradition could be obtained between countries did not allow an exception for &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; acts, in other words, it would be better to narrow down the types of offences for which a country will not extradite.  We should not extend the principle where a person can be prosecuted where caught rather than where the act was purported to be committed and where the evidence would be.  There is not enough in the statement by the Taoiseach to get the full sense of it but I do not accept that the principle is a good one to extend at Community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there has been explicit reference to Mr. Roy Jenkins as the new President of the Commission although I think this is a watered-down version of what had been intended.  Indeed, Mr. Tindemans had proposed in his report on European union the creation of the position of president of the Commission as a key person in choosing the rest of the members of the Commission <Col N="1352" /> in order to heighten the political role of the Commission.  All we know now is that Mr. Jenkins will be consulted when he visits the capitals &ldquo;to discuss relevant matters.&rdquo; Presumably, he will come to Dublin and have discussions with the Government. I would urge the Government to be prepared to give a lead in ensuring that whoever goes to the Commission from Ireland next January will be somebody of considerable calibre, chosen after due consultation with Roy Jenkins to form part of a homogeneous, effective, political commission which can keep Europe on a right course at this very difficult point.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then referred to the economic situation.  His statement here lacks credibility in particular because he refers to the &ldquo;constructive results&rdquo; of the recent tripartite conference between Governments, employers and unions, which he welcomes. That particular tripartite conference itself lacked credibility because it agreed on achieving full employment by 1980.  There was an underlying cynicism in this approach, indeed, there was a lack of substance in a one-day meeting of that sort approaching the very difficult problems of ensuring comparable rates of employment between the different member states.  I do not know what is meant by a reference to &ldquo;economic guidelines for member countries and to exchange rate developments&rdquo;.  In the debate on the Appropriation Bill today there has been enough gloom to make one wonder to what extent that proposal is a real proposition for this country.</P>
    <P>I shall be brief about the other points.  The Puerto Rico conference, although referred to, seems to have been accepted by the small countries. They seem to accept that conferences like Rambouillet and Puerto Rico will continue, that the big powers will continue to exercise a solo role apart from the Community in these, after some sort of consultation with their Community partners beforehand.  I regret this.</P>
    <P>On the question of enlargement to admit Greece, the Taoiseach refers <Col N="1353" /> to the fact that we made the point at a meeting of officials that there should not be further enlargement unless the resources of the Community would be expanded &ldquo;in an appropriate manner&rdquo;.  That is too nebulous, too vague.  We should be much more explicit.  We should make it clear that there should not be further progress in expanding the community unless there is willingness politically, at the level of the Heads of Government, to ensure that the regional fund, the social fund, FEOGA Guidance and Guarantee Section are enlarged proportionately to keep pace with the further political enlargement of the Community.  This is not just to safeguard Ireland's interests as, at present, the poorest member: it is to ensure that the Community continues as a viable entity.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, although I am glad that the Taoiseach has taken the opportunity of coming into the House to make a statement, I do not share his view that this European Council has been a success either for Ireland or for Europe.  It has not been the dramatic failure that the European Council last April was, but, as a way of doing business, it is not in our interest to have continuous European councils of this sort.  We should insist on operating through the ordinary meetings of the Council of Ministers, with power to take political decisions and we should also ensure that our position is more explicitly safeguarded at these meetings.</P>

      <P>In this Appropriation Bill we are accounting for a very large sum of money.  The amount for the health services, about £37 million, is a very formidable sum.  Naturally, one expects that with such a large sum of money involved it should be spent to the best advantage.  The main concern should be the patient.  Everything in the health services should be directed towards helping the patients.  I referred <Col N="1354" /> already to the inability so far of the Government to provide a dental service for those between 12 and 14 years.</P>
      <P>I referred to the amount of money for the telephone service and emphasised how necessary this service is in rural Ireland.  I regret that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has found it necessary to ask ratepayers, apart from contributing in their ordinary taxation, to contribute in the rates towards the provision of local telephone kiosks in various areas.  This service had been paying its way all along and often had a surplus of money and it is wrong that places such as Ballyhaise in County Cavan, where there is an agricultural college, should be without a telephone kiosk.  It is not fair to ask the people of Cavan to provide one.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said we were expecting too much from the Government.  With all due respect, I should like to point out that the people of County Cavan are not built that way.  We have put a fair amount of effort into it and if he wants evidence of that he should check on the number of times various towns in Cavan won the Tidy Towns Competition.  Those results were not attained by Government grants; they were attained through community effort by the citizens of the county.  I am sure the Minister has some knowledge of this as his grandfather was a Cavan man. That pinpoints the fact that we are not always crying for handouts.  We make a good local effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Department of Local Government, I deplore the fact that in recent years we were denied amenity grants which were of great benefit to rural Ireland.  They helped provide amenities for many years. Counties such as Cavan.  Monaghan. Donegal, Louth and Leitrim are problem areas.  The Government, after six or seven years of trouble in that area, should be considering some way of granting special facilities to such areas. Now that we are in the EEC&mdash;the Taoiseach has told us that members of the European Parliament are to be elected from both sides of the Border &mdash;it should add to greater co-operation <Col N="1355" /> on both sides of the Border.  There are many fields in industry, tourism and transportation in which we could play a prominent part.  The local authorities in Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Donegal, Tyrone, Derry and Fermanagh met in Enniskillen for talks recently.  Such talks are very necessary for those areas.  While we up north may not have the right end of the stick we feel that quite an amount of the finances collected by way of revenue go to the east coast or down south.  It is necessary to give a greater injection of capital into the western and Border counties.  As chairman of the regional development organisation of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, I can say that about 13 per cent of the unemployment of the country is in that area.  We have been badly hit because of the recession in the footwear and textile industries.  I am also aware that an industry in Bailieboro is in trouble.  While these may not be big factories they are in sparsely populated areas and are tremendously important.  Any financial injections the Government can afford to give to keep people in employment there would be welcome and would eventually pay dividends.</P>
    <P>Quite a substantial amount of money is devoted towards local government.  Local authorities are charged, among other things, with providing houses and one method of assisting people to build houses is by Government house grants.  The time is overdue when these grants should be substantially increased, particularly because of inflation and the fact that people in rural areas build houses because of need.  Giving grants for building houses in this manner is better than putting people in a queue for local authority housing.  It is better to encourage an individual to select his site and become the proud owner of his own home.  The State should encourage him because, eventually, the State will reap the money back in rates and so on.</P>
    <P>Group water supply schemes agitate us a lot in Cavan.  Two years ago Cavan County Council sanctioned the appointment of an engineer <Col N="1356" /> to act as a liaison officer between the county council and the organisers of group water supply schemes but the Local Appointments Commission have not, as yet, appointed an engineer to do that work.  We would like these schemes to proceed as quickly as possible in view of the fact that agriculture is so important, and the fact that we have such excellent creameries as Killeshandra, Bailieboro' and Lough Egish in that area.  Those co-ops give great employment and make a great effort to foster and help design group water supply schemes so as to ensure their suppliers will have piped water.</P>
    <P>The Government, or whoever is in charge, should ensure that the Local Appointments Commission appoint somebody to this post.  We are not aborigines or anything like that in Cavan or Leitrim; we are just ordinary people.  The climate is fairly good and the people are nice.  If an engineer ventured down there he would survive and his family could live in the area in reasonable comfort. We cannot tie such people and tell them where to go.  Many of them feel it is a vocation to go abroad but at the same time it should be a vocation for them to stay in their own country and give the benefit of their experience to local communities.</P>
    <P>Another point that has crept in recently concerns planning permission. The planning Bill has not gone through both Houses yet but I am very perturbed that often when people are applying for planning permission in a small town they are asked to sign a contract saying that they will provide £1,000 or £2,000 for a car park in the area.  I know a man who bought an adjacent premises with the intention of expanding it and, eventually, when he looked for his planning permission he was told he would have to provide this money. County councils provide car parks at places of worship.  This is a necessary amenity.  In small towns, especially in a county such as ours where the population has been falling steadily over the past 20 years and where people should be encouraged to stay, there should not be this unnecessary <Col N="1357" /> imposition of an extra £1,000 or £2,000 to provide a car park.  The provision of that car park should be a matter for the primary road section. In housing estates the general policy is to try and provide green spaces.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is causing the hold up regarding grants for main roads or primary roads.  In my own county some money was provided for a bridge but I notice that we have tar barrels on a small stretch of the main road.  They have been there for almost 12 months and are almost eaten with rust.  That is not good enough.  It is a national primary road and, because of the troubles in the Six Counties, it is being used much more extensively than it might have been in days gone by.  It carries an enormous amount of manufactured goods from Killeshandra, Ballinamore and Ballyconnell up to the city.</P>
    <P>Let me again make reference to the road here from Clonee into Dublin. I do not know whose baby it is, but it is there for quite a long time and somebody is responsible to the citizens of the north west for forcing us to try and negotiate difficult, narrow dangerous bends behind big articulated lorries on their way into the city with manufactured products from County Cavan.  It is no wonder indeed that we in the regional development organisation of Cavan, Monaghan and Louth are trying to get grants to make a regional road that would take us out to Greenore and by-pass Dublin city altogether.</P>
    <P>There is a fair amount of money in this for educational facilities for our people.  In the past we were very generous.  We have now come to the stage where we are providing not only primary education but post-primary education for our people.  This is a good thing.  People at post-primary level can now go up to the third stratum and they can complete a course in third-level education.  That is something our parents dreamed of lonk ago.  It is of great benefit to rural Ireland and to the country as a whole. We fully realise it is a very costly business.  Any efforts that can be made to pare down the cost without interfering in any way with the <Col N="1358" /> efficiency of the service would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>In many areas buses are taking pupils to schools, some of them to national schools and more to post-primary schools and taking them into towns.  If they operated in the other way there might be a new look at this whole venture.  In the midlands somebody decides to close five or six national schools and take the children into a town.  That immediately causes a traffic hazard.  It may be said it is giving a better service.  I do not think it is.  The first day the school opens it is all right but after that it is certainly a hazard for the children and it is difficult on the mothers.  Pupils would be much better at home in their own areas in two or three or four teacher schools in rural Ireland.  If the tendency was reversed and we tried to get them to come out from the towns into rural Ireland we would be giving a good service and we would be helping to preserve rural Ireland as it is.</P>
    <P>There is not much difference between town and country now that we have rural electrification and so on, and I do not see any reason why it should be necessary to take these children into the towns by bus.  Within a year or two the manager or the management board have to erect a prefab and then there is a call to have a new wing built on.  In Dublin city new housing estates are springing up and then they are faced with the problem of providing new churches and new schools.  Together with the burden of paying for a new house, for a newly married couple that is a very heavy imposition.  It should be avoided especially in the years of a young married couple's life when they need the money and are trying to rear a family.</P>
    <P>The same applies to post-primary education.  So far as the top stratum is concerned we in our area find that if you draw a line from Dublin to Galway&mdash;I said this before&mdash;there is no university in the northern part of the country.  There are universities in Belfast and in Coleraine, but in the whole western area, covering Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Longford, Louth, Meath, there is <Col N="1359" /> none.  It is wrong that the national university constituent colleges should have been placed in such a manner as to exclude that whole area.  I am quite sure there are many people in our area who would benefit from third level education.  There is a move, and a good one, to provide colleges of technology such as we have in Sligo and Dundalk.  There should be a centre in Cavan, but there is not.  This has been a disadvantage to the citizens of both Cavan and Leitrim.  There is a vast area between Longford and Cavan and Leitrim that would benefit immensely if the Government decided to provide a college there.  I wrote to the Minister on this matter and pointed out to him that it would be much better if he would add a building to the present college in Cavan rather than to extend, as he intends to do, the college at Dundalk and the college at Sligo.  In that way he would give the people of Cavan the chance of doing the first year or second year at home in their own area and they would only have to travel for the third year.  The number of people who go to those colleges now is very small because they have to go to live in those areas.</P>
    <P>I mention these few points not by way of criticism but because they would be of immense benefit to the area and might cut down the educational bill as a whole.  As a public representative and as chairman of the vocational education committee in Cavan, I realise that education is a very costly business, in particular the provision of rooms and transport and the various aids which are necessary if we are to make progress.  Anywhere there is overlapping we should try to eliminate it and have as much co-operation as we possibly can at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>Some money has been allotted for tourism.  At present tourism is at a rather low ebb mainly because of the fact that we have had very severe budgets.  Petrol is much dearer here than it is in the Six Counties.  So are our butter, food, drink and, indeed our hotel prices.  In many hotels it is impossible to get a meal unless you <Col N="1360" /> call at a particular time when they say you should be hungry.  Owners of public houses should be encouraged to serve &ldquo;pub grub&rdquo;.  I do not know how we would get over the difficulty of bringing members of the family who are under age into a licensed premises.</P>
    <P>To go into an hotel at present you would want to be a millionaire or very near it.  Prices are very high and unless you are there at lunchtime it is very expensive.  If you have to dine <i>a la carte</i> you do not know where you are going to get the money to pay for it.  You might find yourself working all week for the price of one meal. That is not good enough in a country with a good climate which can produce good food and which has sold into intervention thousands of tons of beef that was lying off the coast of Cork or Kerry for quite a long time and then taken to Russia.  The Government have helped the hotel industry in the past and we would like to see them doing well.  It may be a question of staff or of money but there is such a thing as courtesy and there is such a thing as providing meals for people who are travelling, not alone tourists but our own people.</P>
    <P>While I am on this topic I should like to mention the question of people who supply boats on the River Shannon and various other rivers.  It was pointed out to me recently by a man who wanted to book one of these boats for a week that it cost him £100.  That would not be too bad if they were charging those prices to Germans, Austrians and so on, but an Irish person might like to spend a few days in a boat on one of the rivers. That is an exorbitant price.  Those boats would not be rented out unless they were being taken for the whole week.  That is very wrong because those people were helped by the State to buy some of these cruisers.</P>
    <P>There is a good potential in farm guesthouses if they could be encouraged rather than the hotels.  A traveller could go to one of these guest-houses and get a meal there that he will enjoy whether he is rich or poor. There is no use in issuing fancy brochures and telling people about the <Col N="1361" /> great scenery that is in some particular area.  From my own experience&mdash; and I am sure many people will agree with me&mdash;I find that if you are hungry you are not interested in the scenery, but if you get a meal then you can enjoy it.  It is the first essential.  If we want the hotel and tourist industries to recover we will have to encourage people to go into this industry and provide good meals at anytime. Tourists are very important to us because they buy drink, cigarettes and so on, and when they are on holidays they do not want to be told they have to sit in a room for maybe two hours before they can be served.  That is not the type of service to give to our people.  I do not know how that problem could be solved, but it is affecting our tourist industry.  The tourist industry is only in its infancy, especially in my own area where there is cross-Border co-operation in regard to the lovely lakes and the interest taken by English and Continental people in fishing particularly.  I know there are several towns in England from where you could send maybe 10,000 people into any county in Ireland.  English people are very nice no matter what we may say about them, and they are very welcome.  They are not looking for anything grandiose.  They are quite content to sit beside a lake and fish, and even when they catch something they often throw them back in.  Such people should be encouraged, and when we are discussing a Bill like this the Government should look into the matter.</P>
    <P>Hamlet said, &ldquo;There is something rotten in the State of Denmark&rdquo; and I think that applies to our own State.  I do not want to be overcritical, but there is something radically wrong when a Government after three years in office have succeeded in escalating our balance of payments from £5 million to about £365 million, and have borrowed millions of pounds at exorbitant interest rates and when there are 120,000 people unemployed and thousands of teenagers who do not know what they are going to do. I am not saying this in order to cause trouble, but a public representative must certainly be concerned about a <Col N="1362" /> situation such as that.  Any Government worth their salt must try and solve that problem.  It is no good saying that it is a matter for the Opposition or some other group to come up with a solution.  It is the Government who are in charge and they must give a lead.  The Government have been imposing wealth tax, taxes on farmers and so on, and while they may think that such taxes were popular at the time and worth implementing, they will have to sit down together and find a solution.  This will be very difficult for them to do because the Fine Gael element and the Labour element in the Government do not seem to me and to many other people as an outsider, to dovetail.</P>
    <P>The immediate task for the Government is to restore the confidence of the Irish people in themselves.  That is very much needed.  One method of doing that would be if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would inject some national spunk into our television and radio services, so that we could stand on our feet and not be ashamed of being Irish that we could say a few words of Irish and sing Irish songs through the media in a country where 50 per cent of the people know the native language.  We should not be ashamed of the traditions that have been handed down to us.  We should not always be suffering from this imported politeness and trying to be more English than the English themselves. The time has come when, if we want to assert ourselves as an independent nation in Europe, we will have to be more concerned about our image as a nation.  We should be patriotic enough to buy the food, clothing, drinks and so on that are produced in our own country.  We should also encourage Irish songs, the Irish language and everything pertaining to Irish life.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has said, we will be sending representatives to Europe. We should be very careful to ensure that those who go to Europe will be representing not England but Ireland, that they know their own language and have pride in their own country.  It does not matter what their political outlook may be; we just want them to be good Irishmen, and we cannot be <Col N="1363" /> good Europeans unless we are good Irishmen.  By good Irishmen, I mean living as good Irishmen.  I do not mean advocating violence.  The Government can play their part in this by using the media at their disposal.  It may perturb some people to learn that the Government seemed to make an effort to take Radio na Gaeltachta off the air altogether or put it on at a time when people could not listen to it.  That is not good enough.  We should be proud of our national heritage and ensure, without forcing people to do so, that we keep it.  Television and radio have a tremendous influence on our youth I have seen programmes for children between six and nine years and there was not one word of Irish in the whole programme.  This is disgraceful, seeing that it is being taught in the schools. What we should be aiming at is to have not alone Irish included but French as well.  At that impressionable age those children could pick up languages, which are no great burden for anybody to carry.</P>
    <P>A language is the hallmark of a nation.  It is important that it should not be disregarded.  If we want to restore confidence in our economy the Government will have to tighten their belt, shake themselves out of the lethargy in which they find themselves and try to instil confidence in the people, give leadership and reduce the number of unemployed.  If we on this side of the House can do anything to help in that matter, irrespective of what policy may be, we shall only be too delighted to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to discuss the economy.  This is the only occasion in the year that the Seanad get an opportunity to discuss the economic situation of the country. I would like to deal with industry and the volume of production and employment. They are vital statistics which may have some bearing on the thinking of Senators and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the industrial side for the fourth quarter of 1975 we get an interesting picture.  Regarding the period from 1972 to 1975 in my opinion the picture is not as bad as <Col N="1364" /> we have been led to believe.  The volume of production for 1975 for industry and transport based on 100 for 1953 averaged 257.4.  That increased in 1973 to 283.7 which was 10.2 per cent increase.  In 1974 there was a further increase, the figure being 291.6, an increase of 13.3 per cent over 1972 and 2.8 per cent over 1973.  We know that the world crisis and the oil crisis had a detrimental effect on production.  In 1975 there was a figure of 273.0.  That is a decrease on 1974 of 6.3 per cent.  One would imagine, having listened to the prophets of doom that there would have been a substantial reduction. There was not.  There was a reduction of only 6.3 per cent which we do not like, but that was almost all due to the oil crisis.  If we examine it in relation to the 1972 figure we find there is an increase of 6.06 per cent. Therefore the picture is not as gloomy as that presented in some of the reports published.  I think it is an achievement for this country to have an increase over the 1972 figure of 6.06 per cent.  Of course if it was within our power we would have had a higher increase.</P>
    <P>We now examine the volume of employment, using the same base, 1953. Again we average industry and transport and in 1972 we get a figure of 202.7.  In 1973 employment increased to 208.8, an increase of 3 per cent.  The volume of employment in 1974 further increased to 210.8 which is a 4 per cent increase over 1972 and almost 1 per cent over 1973.  In 1975 the full effects of the world's economic crisis were felt and we had a figure of 196.3 which is a reduction of only 3.1 per cent over 1973.  The volume of employment, taking all aspects into consideration, was a reduction of only 3.15 per cent over 1972.  That was an achievement and industry must be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>Those figures indicate that the employment situation is not caused by the reduction in the volume of production. The increase in the unemployment position is caused by non-emigration of our people.  It is good that people stay at home and wait for the opportunity to get employment <Col N="1365" /> here.  It shall be relating the 1976 figures later and it will be evident from the figures that we now see the light at the end of the tunnel and are increasing the volume of production and the volume of employment.</P>
    <P>I come now to average earnings.  In 1972 average earnings per week were £23.56.  In 1973 they increased to £28.36 per week which is 20.4 per cent, a substantial increase.  If one takes into consideration the increase in the volume of production of 10.2 per cent and the volume of employment of 3 per cent. we had an average earning increase of 20.4 per cent in 1973.  In 1974 the average earnings were £33.81 per week.  This is an increase of 19.2 per cent over 1973 but 43.5 per cent over 1972.  This is an enormous cost in production.  I am not saying that those people should not have got this increase; I agree that workers are entitled to an increase.  The value of the £ has decreased due to inflation.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill refers to 1975.  In 1975 the average earnings per week were £44.38, an increase over 1972 of 88.4 per cent.  The hourly increase over 1972 was 97.8 per cent. Looking at those figures I would think that people who were in production would have to say to themselves: &ldquo;Are we going out of our minds?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That type of percentage increase, which in 1974-75 was 31.3 per cent, is the type of increase that is being carried into 1976.  It may go on to 1977. Then we could not increase the volume of production because it would cost too much.  If we are going to produce for export and if we are going to produce at a high cost then we will not be able to sell on the export market.  We must balance the situation.  If we want to sell our produce we must produce it at a competitive cost.</P>
    <P>With the type of build-up in earnings, we are going in the wrong direction.  Of course people are entitled to pay increases but they must base their increases on inflation or in some way to production so that we will be able to export at competitive prices.  As well as the increase in average earnings per week over that <Col N="1366" /> period the weekly hours worked were reduced, which added a further cost.</P>
    <P>If we look at the ratio of production to employment, and this also comes into the picture, in 1972 the ratio of production to employment was 1270 to every 1,000 in employment. In 1973 the ratio of production to employment had increased to 1357 to 1,000 in employment.  In 1975 the ratio of production was 1390 to 1,000. The ratio of production to employment has increased from 1972&mdash;1270 to 1,000&mdash;to 1390 to 1,000, but only barely increased from 1973.  Therefore, the ratio of production to employment is almost the same as it was in 1973, but the ratio of earnings in the production line increased in 1973 to 1975 by 56.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am not an economist, but reading those figures it is very plain to me that something must be done in this regard and it is very plain to me today, having listened to people speaking about national wage agreements and having read some of the demands that are now been made by certain unions and industry, that this cannot go on.  We must have a national agreement that will take into consideration all that I have said, that will allow extra employment, that will get us extra production, that will get people back to work.  It is the people who are demanding too much who are keeping others out of work.  I have no doubt about that.  I am involved with people working.  I know the situation.</P>
    <P>I know the type of demands that are now being made by unions and I think some of the unions who are making those demands want a national agreement but want to ensure that the increase will be as high as possible.  The message should go out that the type of national agreement one must have must not alone take people into consideration but must take the livelihood of people into consideration, the right of people to work.</P>
    <P>Having looked at those figures I think we moved the line of earnings too quickly and that had an effect on production.  The world situation had a greater effect on the cost of production, but earnings must have <Col N="1367" /> had their bearing as well.  I would ask the people, the trade unions, to consider these points and to look at the figures that I have quoted.  They are in the industrial inquiries reports for 1975 to be calculated and examined carefully before any demands are made.  People out of work are the unhappiest people of all.  If we want happiness we must have people at work.  It will cost those people who are now working a little to share with others the happiness that they have.  I think they should make that sacrifice.</P>
    <P>When I studied those figures I also looked for the consumer price index for the same years.  In 1972 the CPI figure was 220.2 and in 1973 it was 245.4, which is 11.44 per cent more. The increase in 1973 in earnings was 20.4 per cent, so it had substantially increased over the CPI.  In 1974 the CPI figure was 287.0, an increase over 1972 of 30 per cent and over 1973 17 per cent.  But in 1974 the increase in earnings was 43.5 per cent over 1972 and 19.2 per cent over 1973, again increasing the margin of 30 per cent, 17 per cent, 43.5 per cent and 19.2 per cent.  That is based on weekly earnings. If it were hourly earnings the increase would be much higher: the increase in the hourly earnings in 1974 was 49.2 per cent and in 1973, 21.9 per cent and as I said the CPI increase was 30 and 17 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>Again we must take the figure for 1975.  In 1975 the CPI was 347.0 which is an increase over 1972 of 57.7 per cent.  The increase in earnings per hour was 97.8 per cent, or 88.4 per week, over 1972.  The increases given in 1975, if one compares them with the CPI, and compare it with the volume of production, were much too high and have created a problem for 1976.  Given that figure in 1975 in earnings, the demand is now that that figure will be still further increased in 1976.</P>
    <P>I think that we are going out of our minds.  If we want production and if we want less unemployment we must base our figures not alone on the figures that I have mentioned but on how we can sell our production and what we will get for our production. <Col N="1368" /> The unions must take into consideration those two facts and many more. They must take into consideration the CPI.  Salaries and wages are included in that figure and would have reached that type of proportion.  Unless we look at that from the point of view of what it is costing, then we might as well be talking to the wind.  The cost of production is the same, whether it is for the home or export market.  If production costs are too high, the cost of the products will be too high and the sale will not take place.  If we are going to produce, we must sell.  The wages cost per unit volume of production for a week in 1972 was £18.40.  In 1975 it was £32.27, a 75.38 per cent increase over 1972.  That figure in itself proves that we have gone overboard.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a trade union and my members always accepted the national wage awards.  They demanded the national wages award which was given last year.  That was their right.  All unions will demand a national wage award because a national wage agreement is their right. In my opinion, the national wage award for 1975 was far too high.  I do not know whether the Minister or anybody else agrees with me, but that is the way I read the figures I have before me.  If that is the case it is necessary, if we are going to have a national wage agreement, that all sections sit down and discuss it.  It is very important to do that.  I know demands outside of the national wage agreement are being made; they are talking about increases of £15 or £20 a week, a shorter working week, extra pay for this, that and the other, which increase any monetary figure by maybe 20, 30 or 40 per cent.  If we are going to demand that, not alone will the small industries suffer but the big industries and the producers are going to suffer. If the producers suffer, then industry will not be able to go into production and the country will collapse.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we take a national pride in ourselves and in our country by making a sacrifice to accept only as much as the country can afford. Who tells us what the country can afford to pay?  We must have a get-together of employers, unions and the <Col N="1369" /> Government.  If we have only the unions and the employers meeting across the table, the whole picture cannot be put across.  We will have too much brow-beating and no national wage agreement will be settled because one vital group are missing&mdash;the Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this evening:</P>
    <P>... The constructive results of the recent Tripartite Conference between Governments, employers and unions were generally welcomed. Several speakers emphasised that Governments alone could not control the economic situation&mdash; they must have co-operation with employers and trade unions in decision making.  Stress was laid on better co-operation between the social partners....</P>
    <P>That is exactly the situation and that is the way we should do our business. We must bury our pride and all sections of the community must get together to try to negotiate a fair wage award.  If we do not do that, our loss of competitiveness in the world market will be very substantial. We will not get outside investment. We will not get industrialists from abroad to invest in this country if they are going to lose money by that investment.  Those people invest to make profit.  Any person who invests hopes to make a profit.  We should guarantee these people that profit.  I know some of the industries that came to this country from time to time earn exorbitant profits.  But all that can now be relegated.  We must look to the future.  We must learn from the past and take that learning into the future with us.</P>
    <P>All Governments made mistakes in the past and we will make mistakes in the future.  But let us make as few and as small mistakes as possible. A greater pride in the nation by everybody will ensure that those mistakes will be very small.  We must have a greater involvement of our people in making decisions, a greater involvement of our work force at floor level, and greater involvement of people in the Oireachtas not alone in legislation but in advising the people <Col N="1370" /> on what the Oireachtas are thinking and taking advice from those people if we feel it is necessary.  Producers, manufacturers, workers, employers and Government must come closer together for the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow's problems can be reduced if we have that type of coming together and if we have a greater knowledge of what the nation needs and what is happening all over the world.  People realise what damage can be done by placing too much of a demand on the resources of the nation.  We could be a very strong and very influential country; we have been in the past.  We will not influence any country unless we are able to look after our own affairs. We must have a strong hand in looking after those affairs to show those powerful countries that we will, at least, do our part here and we would hope that other countries would do their part and bring not alone this country but the whole world to use common sense.  Even though our country is small, we owe help to those undeveloped nations, nations that cannot do for themselves.  We owe them a little bit of help, and in helping them we hope that other countries will take example from us. We were a poor nation and we know how it feels to be undeveloped.  We have developed to a very high degree and we should take from our history and from what we have seen in the past something that we can contribute to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister that we must have the type of national wage agreement which will help the economy and all those who need help and especially those who cannot work for themselves.  The standard of living of those people must keep pace with the rest of the community.  I do not want to make political points but since the change of Government the less fortunate of the community, people on social welfare and so on, have benefited and the Government should be congratulated on that.  Recently, I attended an opening of houses for underprivileged people and you could <Col N="1371" /> see the joy in their faces when the first door was opened.  It created joy not alone for them but for all present.  It showed that at least something was being done.  It might only be a drop in the ocean but we hope that that will develop and that unfortunate people will have some happiness in their own country.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector, in which I am involved, was mentioned a few times today.  It is our largest industry and all our agricultural produce is either consumed here or exported. We have to import very little in order to manufacture our agricultural produce. We hope that when gas is brought ashore at Kinsale, and our fertiliser plant is in operation, we will be able to produce fertilisers required for crop production.  When that happens we can nearly say that our agricultural produce needs no external assistance.  That time is not far off, so we should take a greater interest in agriculture.  We should encourage farmers, through their organisations, to produce more.  Farmers have their own trade unions and they, like all trade unions, demand more money for their produce.  Taking everything into consideration, it is only since we joined the EEC that the farmers have got greater confidence in agriculture and have gained from being in agriculture. They are not now dependent on the British who before our entry into the EEC, bought our agricultural produce at the lowest possible price. We cannot blame them for that, it was business; whether it was good business or not is another matter. However, farmers can ask for too much, too soon.  They must take into account also the effect their increased costs will have on the rest of the community.  However, the farmers, like those engaged in industry, must be paid for their production and they must get a fair profit.</P>
    <P>The year 1974 was a very difficult year for farmers.  Although we were members of the EEC we learned a lesson from that year.  I do not think that situation will arise again.  The farmers had to accept much less than they deserved.  They accepted £10 or <Col N="1372" /> less for a calf.  The farmers are now more organised and the EEC understands our position better.  Taking into consideration the fact that much of the stock of 1974 had to be held over, 1975 was a good year for farmers.  In that year we had an increase of 114 per cent in the export of fat cattle, an increase of 20 per cent in the export of store cattle and an increase of 2,000 per cent in the export of calves.  I am worried about the latter situation.  Altogether in 1975 we exported 695,307 cattle, which was an increase of 55 per cent over 1974.</P>
    <P>That is a very big interest.  For me that was a benefit to the country as a whole.  I believe that only for our agricultural exports in 1975 the picture would have been very black.</P>
    <P>We must give credit to the farmers for the help they have given the economy.  People will say that 1976 is not so rosy.  Of course, we will not export as many cattle in 1976 as in 1975.  We cannot do it because the 1975 export figures for cattle took into consideration the surplus from the bad year of 1974.  Therefore, we cannot and should not expect our figures in 1976 to be as good as 1975. Anybody looking at our balance of payments for 1975 will see that but for agriculture it would have been very bad.  As it was, our balance of payments for that year turned out to be the very best for many years.  I hope the farmers will get the credit that is due to them.  The Minister for Agriculture has congratulated them here and has helped them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>And taxed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>We will talk about tax in a few minutes.  The Minister for Agriculture has done his best for this country: nobody can say otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regard the farmers who are being taxed, I really have no sympathy for them.  They are substantial farmers and if they keep accounts and do not make a substantial profit they do not pay tax.  If they do not keep accounts and if they have more than £100 valuation it is only right that they should be paying some tax.  We are all paying tax. <Col N="1373" /> The farm labourer has to pay substantial tax on the earnings he is getting from the farmer.  Workmen working long hours doing overtime pay tax not only on their basic pay but also on any overtime earnings.  If this country needs extra finance, it should not be looking to those who are now heavily burdened with tax but to some other source.  Farmers of more than £100 valuation have come to me and said it was &ldquo;an awful shame&rdquo; that they should now be taxable.  Of course, it is not a shame: of course, they should be taxed.  Our sons and daughters who are working and bringing home small wages are taxed.  We must have finance so that some of it can be distributed to those in need.</P>
    <P>If big farmers have not got a social conscience they should develop one very fast; they owe it to the nation. They have a duty to educate people who cannot educate themselves.  We were not all born equal; we were not all born with the same facilities but if we believe in social justice, somebody must help the weaker sections.  The Minister for Finance must get the money to help them.  We know the demands. We are all politicians and we all meet people asking for this, that and the other, all involving financial help from the State.  We cannot expect the Government to wave a magic wand and say: &ldquo;There is money for you&rdquo;. It must be got from those people who are well able to pay it.</P>
    <P>Some help, as I have said, should be given to the industrial section of the farming community, most of which is controlled by the co-operative movement. I think the Government made a mistake in taxing the co-ops.  Many people do not agree with me and they are entitled to their views.  The Minister knows, because he has met many deputations from the farming community and from the co-operative movement, that the type of profits being made by the co-ops are needed, first, to develop the co-ops and also needed to process the farmers' produce, a substantial amount of which more than 50 per cent, is for export.  I do not know if I am in order but I would suggest that to compensate the <Col N="1374" /> co-ops some tax exemption should be given for the export of this produce.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House as I am sure there will be other speakers on agriculture.  I think that if the Minister, the unions and all concerned take to heart all I have said, if something is done in regard to a national wage agreement and if something is done to help production, there is no fear for our country.  We have a great future ahead: I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill relates to expenditure by the Government and hence to their financial policies and the overall management of the economy.  It allows Senators to assess and comment on the effectiveness of the Government in their overall approach. However, the Bill also poses problems in that it is difficult to respond in a useful way to the challenge of identifying key problems and making useful suggestions for a new approach. I have been impressed, as I am sure the Minister has been, with the seriousness of approach of the various Senators who have spoken.  There is one factor on which we should concentrate and that is that we are debating the Bill against the background of a promise by the Government that a Green Paper on economic planning will be published in the next few weeks.  It is, therefore, appropriate for us to approach the whole subject from the context of the basic and fundamental need for planning and for coherence and co-ordination in the devising and implementation of such a plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such co-ordination and coherence is strikingly lacking at present.  One hears conflicting statements from various Ministers about the scale of economic problems, and about the way in which these problems should be approached and tackled.  This has caused great public unease.  Here I am not making a political comment. I am trying to be objective in my approach.  I think there is a lack of a sense of cohesiveness and purpose in what the Government are doing. There have been conflicting approaches to various problems, such <Col N="1375" /> as the recent Bill arising out of the bank dispute, the approach to the unemployment problem, to the national wage agreement, to the equal pay issue.  There has been no sense of the Cabinet getting down to serious consideration of these problems and reaching united conclusions on them.  I hope the promised Green Paper will allow for such a unified and coherent approach.</P>
    <P>The lack of apparent consensus within the Cabinet undermines the authority and credibility of the Government and we need a Government with authority and with credibility.  It is not so much a matter of a detailed plan as a coherent overall approach which will inspire and restore confidence in the people and confidence externally, confidence in our trading partners in the EEC, confidence in the United States and confidence in those other countries which do business with us.</P>
    <P>The order of magnitude of the problem we face has been referred to in some detail by other Senators.  It is becoming increasingly apparent to the people.  There is a danger of spreading panic in relation to our situation and I here join with those Senators who are not totally depressed to the point of being unable to respond to the situation except by trotting out further evidence of the difficulties; of our high unemployment rate, the intolerable inflation rate, the imbalance created by loans from outside.  We must approach these problems in a constructive attempt to resolve them rather than increasing and spreading further panic and hopelessness about our situation.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment takes first place in my consideration of the different types of difficulties we have.  Fortunately, considerable homework has been done in this area recently.  I would like to refer here to a paper by Dr. Brendan Dowling, which he prepared for a conference organised by the Irish Council of the European Movement in March last on the economic implications of the labour market in the next ten years. He made it clear he was speaking in his personal capacity, that his remarks <Col N="1376" /> were his own and did not necessarily reflect the views of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to whom he is economic adviser.  He pointed to the essential requirement of our recognising that the problems of unemployment are problems of a structural rather than a cyclical nature and that we must respond accordingly by the sort of radical measures which alter that structural nature, which respond to the fact that it is not cyclical unemployment but rather structural unemployment.</P>
    <P>He referred to the fact that too few politicians or too few people in public life have seriously analysed the unemployment situation for the very good reason referred to by the previous speaker and several other Senators, namely, that we have allowed emigration to deflect our attention from the problem.  Up to now the problem has been solved by the unemployed emigrating.  This is no longer the case, and we are faced with the reality of our situation.  In looking at that reality Dr. Dowling considered the effectiveness of our present industrial strategy and he was very critical of that industrial strategy.  He said:</P>
    <P>The industrial strategy adopted by successive Governments has been the use of State funds to attract foreign enterprises to Ireland, to grants based in part on the level of capital expenditure and in part on the level of projected employment.  More recently a substantial amount of State funds have been devoted to capital grants to Irish based industry for expansion and for re-equipment.  Indeed the influence of the IDA on the level of industrial investment in Ireland is such that no firm would conceive of undertaking new investment without first trying to obtain aid from the IDA.</P>
    <P>The important question is whether this policy is successful and whether it is likely to lead to adequate employment growths in the future.  In terms of net job creation the answer must be that the industrial strategy pursued to date has not been able to create sufficient <Col N="1377" /> new jobs to offset the decline in existing jobs in industry, the increase in the labour force due to democratic factors and the flow of labour from the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Of course this inadequate rate of job creation could be due to the inadequate allocation of funds for promotion purposes and this would suggest that much more of the same strategy would yield greater results.  However, I think that the evidence that allocations for industrial development funds have been under any type of budgetary restraint in the past is slight and that further funds have been made available as they were required.</P>
    <P>He then went on to analyse this industrial strategy, to be very critical of it as being capital intensive, as not relating to our real problems of structural unemployment, as not showing that it is coping with the marked increase in our unemployment and the problems which this poses.  He went on to examine the question of employment and public expenditure and he covered some of the ground that Senator FitzGerald covered this morning about the necessity to be aware of the size of the public cake, if one could call it that, in deciding in what way it might be sliced.  Senator FitzGerald, I think, looked around at me when he talked about the calls for reform in areas such as the establishment of family courts and implied we cannot afford this type of reform.  But that depends really on our priorities and on our overall social costing.  I would agree totally with Dr. Dowling's conclusion on this aspect.  We cannot afford to live like lords in the sort of serious economic situation we have. We cannot afford the same standard of living the Germans can afford.  Indeed, we would be very foolish and very reckless if we believed we could. We have to decide on our particular priorities.  I agree with Dr. Dowling when he says:</P>
    <P>This is not to argue, as has been common in the past, that social reform and income redistribution can only take place in a growing economy.  To do that is to sanctify the <i>status quo</i> and to ensure that <Col N="1378" /> little action will ever be taken in these areas.  The proponents of this view tend also to be the proponents of the view that the time is never right for social reform.  However we will be forced to recognise, through the constraint on public expenditure that reforms and redistribution will involve the transfer of resources within the community, will require sacrifices from the vast bulk of the community and not just the &ldquo;rich&rdquo; and that the redistribution cannot be achieved through increased expenditure unmatched by higher taxes or cuts in other services.  Such a revision of policies and emphasis will not be easy and will not go unchallenged. Indeed the objections may well come from those groups who on the face of it are the strongest supporters of redistribution.</P>
    <P>I agree with Dr. Dowling: it will come as something of a shock to certain people that they too must pay, that they too must accept a lower standard of living, and must assume part of the burden if we are going to have a genuine capacity for redistributive policies and for social reform in order to promote social justice and equity in our system.  The problems are very real ones; they are new in their order of magnitude and new in the way in which they are coming to us in a cumulative fashion.</P>
    <P>In response to these sort of problems it is not enough either for the Taoiseach or for the Minister for Finance to look into their heart and say that there must be a pay pause, or there must be a willingness to exert discipline.  It needs a much more coherent, thought-through and consolidated approach than that.  It needs, in other words, the authority of a national plan, the authority of the sort of social planning which will give a sense of purpose to the whole exercise, which will allow people to realise that if they must accept a lower standard of living, if they must accept a pay pause and incomes restraint, if they must forego certain services and certain advances, that it is all in the interest of a coherent overall policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> In that regard I would like to refer to a speech made by Deputy Halligan &mdash;he was Senator Halligan at that time&mdash;in March last which has become known in the national Press as the Halligan Plan.  Deputy Halligan is to be commended for a serious attempt to formulate an overall plan for our economy.  He is in favour of a radical new approach to the problem which is not just a continuation of the earlier national plans.  He says under the heading &ldquo;Economic Planning&rdquo; at page 7 of his script:</P>
    <P>We need a third stage in our economic development process because the dimension of the employment problem, as we have demonstrated, is way beyond the capacity of the present policy, mainly geared around the IDA and completely dependent on private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We need a fundamental reorientation of policy by resorting to economic planning and by simultaneously accepting the legitimacy, indeed by asserting the necessity, of state enterprise.  We need to take the State out of its supportive role where it has acted as a crutch for private enterprise and to place it firmly in the centre of the economic development process.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to criticise the absence of planning in its true sense, in the formulation of policy and in the thinking of politicians here in Ireland.  On page 8 he states:</P>
    <P>There is no real philosophy of planning in this sense in Ireland. There is no understanding of its philosophical underpinnings, of its ethical drive, of its institutional requirements or the scale of political and economic change it would involve.  Worse still there has been no real debate.  People are talking glibly of a process whose nature they have never analysed adequately and do not understand.  &ldquo;Planning&rdquo; has come to be a synonym for the economic cure-all without the realisation that it requires in the very first instance a philosophy of <Col N="1380" /> society fundamentally different to that which now dominates ours.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that his philosophy, his balance in the various conflicts of interest and the various approaches to solving the problems we face, would be:</P>
    <P>In terms of a philosophic base for planning in Ireland what we need is a middle way between the traditional liberal market economy and the detailed centralised and authoritarian type of planning which existed, and still exists, in the Eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Halligan is General Secretary of the Labour Party, which is one of the parties of the Coalition, and yet in no way could an objective observer get the sense that this approach of his is a unified Government approach to our present problems. This is regrettable because I think it would be desirable that there be a coherent overall approach.  I personally would subscribe, in almost every aspect, to the type of approach formulated by Deputy Halligan in that paper.  One does not get the sense that this is the way in which the Government as a whole will approach the devising of a Green Paper setting out provisions for economic planning for the short, medium and long-term.</P>
    <P>Apart from that type of overall approach, I think it is necessary to consider the very important area of rural development in Ireland.  This was referred to by Senator Dolan when he spoke of the essential necessity to counteract the attraction of the capital city and the other larger centres in order to have balanced regional development in the country. In that context I would like to refer to one other paper submitted to the March conference on Social Planning in Ireland.  It is a paper prepared by Fr. Harry Bohan in which he makes a very strong case for a micro-economic approach to rural development in Ireland.  This should form a very significant part of any social planning.  He states:</P>
    <P>Irish economic policies since the 1950s have been promoting export-orientated industry capable of competing <Col N="1381" /> on world standards and doing this largely by bringing in foreign firms already accustomed to these standards.  In effect, we have been in the business of leasing or selling production facilities, land, buildings, plant, labour to industries from overseas.  While these moves have proved a profitable investment in terms of social as well as individual enterprise, a number of problems of economic and social development have remained unresolved. Some of these are occasional such as the uncertainty of the performance of individual firms, but others concern the permanent framework of Irish society and the Irish economy, for example problems of distribution of wealth or of rural development, urbanisation and regional development.  It is now evident that more and more people have become increasingly aware that reliance on foreign industry needs to be supplemented by the exploitation of home resources both from the viewpoint of economic development and national self-determination.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to give an account of very significant voluntary initiative in this area, that is, the establishment of the Rural Housing Organisation. He puts this forward as a counterbalance to centralised, city-based, foreign-industry based development and he states:</P>
    <P>Through our work we discovered that villages within commuting distance of employment centres continued to decline in population even though jobs were available locally.  It followed that the distribution of population was determined not just by jobs but by other factors as well The effect of development did not spread far beyond the growth centres.  This was because housing was not available in villages.  Due to this, young couples who might otherwise have remained in their own communities drifted into the larger towns where housing was immediately available.  The result was that villages were needlessly bereft of new development.  As older inhabitants <Col N="1382" /> die no younger families take their place and population declines begin to occur.  In other words, conventional methods of employment have uprooted people, have separated the generations to such an extent that serious social problems have been created and massive social welfare policies are needed as a corrective measure.  In our work in the Rural Housing Organisation we have concluded that to survive as social entities villages must change their functional purpose.  The traditional function was that of a service for an agricultural hinterland.  With rural population loss this function is not adequate to maintain the village.  A new function must be added.  This is to act as a residential centre for young industrial and service workers who live within the village and work outside it initially.  There is evidence to suggest now that housing can act as a primer for industrial and agricultural developments.  This means that people who return to live will also find work in the local community.</P>
    <P>He feels that there is a great deal of room for this type of initiative in providing houses in villages to give an impetus to rural development there, which leads to community centre projects, to younger people remaining in or going back to the smaller community dwelling.  We should focus very substantially on this micro-economic level, on the need for a medium- and small-term industrial development, on creating and reinforcing the rural economy so that we keep people where they want to remain if they can get houses and then, consequently, jobs and employment and a useful life-style there.  This is extremely important because of the sort of natural resources that we have and which have been referred to; the fact that we have land, that we have a young, active population, that we have all that immense potential which at the moment we are not using, in many cases because we do not appreciate it.</P>
    <P>So much for the micro-economic side.  Looking at the more macroeconomic <Col N="1383" /> side, the European level, Ireland should be approaching the present developments in the European Community much more seriously than is evident at present.  Reference has already been made&mdash;I have referred to it on previous occasions&mdash;to the fact that the gap is widening in the European Community between the more developed centre and the regional areas, the peripheral areas.  The gap between Ireland and the golden triangle of the Community is wider now than it was in 1972 or 1973.  The disparities are greater, the imbalance is even more against us.  We are failing to get across the message that if the European Community is to function as a community then very substantially different approaches are necessary at Community level.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to endorse very strongly the approach suggested by Dr. Whitaker in a speech at a conference in July, 1975 on the possibility of a European Monetary Union and implications of the sterling link.  He referred to the basic objective of the Treaty of Rome, the task of setting up a Common Market and progressively approximating the economic policies of the member states to promote harmonised development in the Community.  He went on:</P>
    <P>If that objective means anything it will be necessary to pursue policies both in the member states themselves and, at Community level, in regard to the member states which are quite different. The countries which lag behind will have to be helped to catch up with those which are relatively more advanced.  A measure of what is needed in our own case is given by the recent estimate that only a sustained growth rate would enable us to catch up with the standards of the other smaller EEC members by 1986.  In short, what the implementation of co-ordinated economic policies should mean is an attempt to achieve a tolerable degree of similarity&mdash;not necessarily equality &mdash;of economic experience in the member states.  This means substantial resource transfers to the <Col N="1384" /> less advanced areas.  Otherwise attempts at phased progress towards monetary union will fail, because the diversity of economic conditions, particularly of rates of inflation, will prise exchange rates apart&mdash;or else put unbearable pressure on the free trade or common agricultural policy fronts.  One can surmise that the less advanced members of the Community are likely to have more difficulty in controlling inflation than the more advanced, if only because of the greater disparity between resources and aspirations.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to what extent we are carrying through that message at the European level? It is not adequate, given the present level of disparity, given the different rates at which countries are controlling inflation and keeping down unemployment, to have identical policies in relation to economic controls and regulations.  We need to have conjunctural policies.  We need to be going in the same direction, but Ireland needs to be arguing that we must have the capacity to take the steps necessary to allow us to catch up with the more developed regions of the European Community, the golden triangle at the centre.  We must be allowed to do the sort of things which are against the strict letter of the law of a common market and free competition. We must be allowed to take special measures to enable us to narrow that gap which has widened while the pure theory of the free market at the European level has been promoted. In this context I would agree with Brendan Harkin, now President of the ICTU, when he spoke at the Symposium on Social Planning in Ireland and said:</P>
    <P>If the Community is to establish any credibility outside its golden triangle it will have to make important changes in its whole approach to the distribution of job opportunities to its peripheral areas.  This means making more money available through the regional development and social funds.  It also means recognising the fact that the outlying areas <Col N="1385" /> may have serious geographical and other disadvantages which merit abrogation of the rules of competition. A lot of work was done in Brussels on establishing criteria for regional development aid.  The guidelines were based on levels of deprivation in terms of unemployment, emigration and low per capita income.  Where these standards fall below an agreed mark, say, twenty-five per cent below the Community average, it should be possible to effect special measures. These could include such steps as subsidisation of employment and restrictions on imports.  In addition penalties should be imposed by way, for example, of special taxation on industrial development in those already overcrowded areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the reference made by the Taoiseach in his statement in this House earlier this afternoon to co-ordination of development policies of the member states.  I should like to ask the Minister what is his understanding of what is meant by &ldquo;guidelines on co-ordination of economic policies&rdquo; in that context?  The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The Dutch Presidency has made certain proposals designed to strengthen the internal, economic and financial coherence of the committees and suggesting that the medium-term economic programme for the Communities should be made to play a role in a periodic review of national programmes. The proposals also referred to economic guidelines for member countries and to exchange rate developments.  I emphasised the need to ensure that any guidelines should take full account of the real problems, particularly those of a structural nature, which impede progress towards a more cohesive Common Market.</P>
    <P>To what extent does this include a well-planned approach at the European level arguing the substantial need for Ireland to be able to take the sort of special measures to protect our economy, to build up our exports, to protect our employment situation, <Col N="1386" /> to create employment here which go against the pure theory of the present state of development in the European Community but are in conformity with the political aspiration for European union and which will dramatically narrow that gap between ourselves and other more developed regions of the Community?  To what extent are we making that argument?  To what extent are we pushing it at the European level?</P>
    <P>This approach is extremely important at this stage of Ireland's participation in the European Community, in particular in the context of possible enlargement of the Community to admit another country like Greece, which bears considerable similarities to us and which would face the Community with the political necessity either to enlarge very substantially its redistributive policies, its regional, social and FEOGA guidance and guarantee funds and other supports for peripheral areas, or else resign itself to a very different type of two-tier Community.  In such a two-tier community there could be an inner core, possibly with institutional developments within it such as a directorate where the larger and economically more developed countries control the entire evolution of the Community, and the outer core composed of less advantaged countries which make the inner core safe for further advancement.  At the Community level there is necessity for serious homework and for awareness of these dangers.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Yeats in agreeing that the approach of the Government on the equal pay issue does not tend to breed confidence in their handling of this type of problem. One gets the impression that the argument may be going by default because it is not being well presented at European level.  We should be arguing for the type of parallel but not identical approach to converging economic policies which would allow us to take our place as a country supporting the principle of European union but needing to come from behind in a dramatic way in order to participate realistically in that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> Senator FitzGerald referred to the resources of our country; to our active young population, to our natural resources.  These resources are there and it is important to remind ourselves of that.  The problem is the political coherence of our approach to exploiting those resources, using those resources and having the benefit of those resources distributed fairly and equitably in our society. That is back to the political weakness of the present situation, the lack of cohesiveness in our institutions.  I would agree with Senator FitzGerald that in order fully to realise our potential we may need much more substantial institutional reform; a better approach to local government and a new regional infrastructure. The two things are related.  Until we have greater political cohesiveness we will not avail of and use our natural resources and we will not speak with the authority and credibility which will restore confidence in this country and persuade people to accept hard political decisions of this time; persuade them to accept that they must have a lower standard of living if they are going to continue to have economic and social stability, if there is not going to be a degree of social unrest and malaise which could further undermine our political and institutional structures.</P>
    <P>The real challenge is a challenge of a political nature and it is reflected in our institutional approach.  I was not quite sure at the end of his contribution whether Senator FitzGerald was proposing some type of national planning advisory council, which would have a very significant role in advising the Government on overall planning.  I have often felt that there should be some possibility here of a counterpart to the central policy review staff which works alongside the British Cabinet and relates to the Prime Minister there.  This would help to foster the image of a cohesive approach, would help to remind Ministers that the activities of one Department must be related to the activities of another and that the Ministers must also speak with one <Col N="1388" /> voice on important economic issues and on approaches to the key problems in our area.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable amount of public analysis by independent economists, the sort of people I have been quoting this afternoon and that others have been quoting.  One does not sense this is necessarily getting through at Government level.  I say this because I found the Minister's opening speech less than imaginative in its approach to the sort of problems which Senators have been discussing and debating today.  He uses the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo; approach but he does so in a context which leads me to believe that he does not think in terms of a radical approach.  He says towards the end of his speech introducing the Bill to the House this morning:</P>
    <P>Clearly, a radical approach is required&mdash;in particular a fundamental change in our attitudes.  A high rate of export-led growth is a prerequisite to the solution of our longer-term, as indeed of our short-term, unemployment problem. Although we can anticipate assistance from a more rapid pace of expansion internationally, especially in the post-recession phase, this alone will not suffice.  We must capture an ever larger share of world markets, recapture and hold on to a larger share of a growing home market, an outcome which relies to a large extent on whether or not we disimprove or improve our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>It is not that this is something one can particularly fault.  It is a continuation of the same approach as before.  It is this same approach which Dr. Dowling criticises, which others whom I have quoted, say is not going to solve or not going to meet the genuine economic problem here.  We cannot go on the same as before because the order of magnitude of problems is different.  We no longer have emigration deflecting us from the question of our unemployment. We must ensure within the context of the European Community that we maintain our level of parity with <Col N="1389" /> other countries, that we close the gap with the more developed countries in the European Community, that we provide the framework for the generations to come.</P>
    <P>This is the final point that I should like to make.  There has been considerable reference to our active young population, to our unique demographic structure.  There is, to say the least of it, a broad range of reasons why this is so.  Some of the reasons may include a limited choice in relation to voluntary population control here.  I hope there will be another opportunity in the near future to discuss that aspect of it at some length. It is a richness to have a young population but it is also a very significant challenge.  We have a very high level of young unemployed, and we have an enormous problem of increasing school leavers who are going to come on the labour market.</P>
    <P>In the present climate and attitude towards a person being unemployed it is a very serious failure of our society if we are not able to provide either jobs, training or retraining of these young people.  If we leave them feeling that they are useless, unproductive and uncontributing people in our society then we will reap a very bitter harvest.  We will reap what we deserve in the circumstances.  Consequently one would expect a massive expansion in education.  Even if there are problems in regard to the size of the cake, one would expect that there would be a very real emphasis on education.  That is not reflected in the figures.  We are not expanding in the way in which we should both the formal education possibilities and the training or retraining.</P>
    <P>In the overall context, the most important of all is continuing education, the possibilities and opportunities for advanced education, adult education throught life.  We are now expected to change jobs three or four times during a working life.  There is no preparation for this at a serious Government level.  There is no real response to the aspiration of married women after a certain period to come back to make a productive and creative contribution to the economic and social life of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> We cannot just pride ourselves on our natural resources of an active young population and a unique demographic structure and leave it at that. It is the biggest challenge that we face and it should form a key part of the sort of overall plan which one hopes will come from the Government in the next week or so and which will explain in a coherent framework why it is necessary for people to take the sort of serious and unpleasant steps that the Government have been haranguing them and that other people have been haranguing them to take.  Haranguing people to take difficult steps outside of an overall framework is not a credible or authoritative position.  It is only when it is placed in an overall strategy towards the development of our economy, towards our future and our children's future, that it begins to become acceptable to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak on the two aspects of the Minister's speech which I think are the most important. I refer to and I am not the only Senator who has referred to them, but I want to re-emphasise what has been said already&mdash;the subjects of unemployment and inflation which continue to be the greatest problems for this Government and indeed every Government in the developed countries today.  We must admit that other countries have been more successful in tackling their inflation problem than we have to date, although we have made some welcome progress in recent months in that direction.</P>
      <P>It is now generally accepted that we cannot solve one without tackling the other, that the problems of inflation and unemployment are interlocked and that success in one cannot come unless success is achieved in the other. This is a point of view that has not been generally accepted until quite recently. It was generally believed that you could, to put it rather crudely, &ldquo;have your cake and eat it&rdquo;.  That comforting belief rested in every sector of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general workers have been accused of seeking wage increases beyond what the country or the industries concerned could afford.  We <Col N="1391" /> can lay the blame broadly across every sector of our people, because as a nation over recent years we have been trying to take more out of the economy than we have been prepared to put into it.  While this might sound as a very simplistic reason for inflation, it seems to me to be the basic reason why we have been suffering from excessive inflation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to listen to the contributions this afternoon and even more interesting to listen to the contributions from experts that have been quoted by various Members of this House over the past few hours.  I have read the contributions and articles by a number of these experts in recent years but I failed to find a consensus among any of the experts as to the cause of inflation or its cure.  Possibly the reason for this is that for the first time in the world's history, and certainly in its recent industrial industry, we have the phenomenon of inflation and recession.  This used not to be the case in bygone years; but you had inflation with boon conditions: you had increasing employment, you had a type of prosperity which in most cases was short lived before the inevitable slump came again.  But we and all other developed countries have been experiencing this unusual state of affairs in recent years where high inflation has been accompanied by recession or depression and heavy unemployment in most countries of the world.</P>
    <P>The fact that it has been difficult to find a solution is indicated by what I have been saying, that experts in their particular fields, men who have given the greater part of their lives to studying these problems but who have failed to find a solution.  I suggest the solution may be simpler than the experts suggest, that it may be basically the fact that we as a people, and other people also, have been trying to get a lot more out of the national pot than we have been putting into it. This situation has been accompanied by widespread inefficiency to some extent in industry, to a considerable extent in distribution, and to a far greater extent in the working of <Col N="1392" /> government, national and local, Senator Alexis FitzGerald suggested that every time the Government or a Government agency carried out a task which involved the distribution of resources from one section of the community to another it was the most expensive way of doing it and that a smaller organisation could do this task much cheaper.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that in a small country like ours we do not make more use of voluntary or small organisations to undertake this task.  There is a tremendous pool of goodwill in this country that remains untapped.  If there was more co-operation sought by central government and by local government agencies, more help and more co-operation extended to voluntary organisations, these necessary tasks to assist the weaker sections of our community could be carried out with a great measure of goodwill and would be far cheaper.</P>
    <P>Nobody from this side of the House will contest the charge that has been repeated by Senators on the other side over the past hours, that by any standards we have an unacceptably high rate of unemployment.  We ought to be realistic about it and remember that unemployment unfortunately has been endemic in this country for as long as most of us can remember, in what are sometimes euphemistically described as the good old days, the days of the fifties and sixties, up to the seventies.  In those days it was not unusual to have 70,000 people unemployed and a rate of emigration running at 30,000 or 40,000 a year. Another point to remember is the type of unemployment we have in this country.  Senator Robinson touched on this.  The type of unemployment we had in past years was largely the unemployment of the unskilled labourer who depended largely on construction work or in older days on road work or bog work and when he could not get this he emigrated to England.  He was the man who in England built the roads and the railways, the hospitals and who helped to build industry.  That type of unemployment is now radically changed and the unemployed man is the <Col N="1393" /> skilled man largely.  We have now added to that category the young people coming out of schools and technical colleges and universities. The type of employment that was available some years back for the unskilled worker is not available now and is not applicable to the type of employment to which they are geared and educated for.  A very careful study needs to be done, first of all of the type of unemployed we have and, secondly, the type of employment which is required.</P>
    <P>In this House, about this time last year, I remember that forecasts of up to 200,000 unemployed were made from the other side of the House. Fortunately we have not reached anything like that figure.  However, our unemployment is too high, it is well over 100,000 or about 10 per cent of our employed.  It is too high but it could have been substantially higher if the Government had not&mdash;what they are now being criticised for doing&mdash;secured substantial extra funds by taxation and by borrowing.  I am a critic in regard to excessive borrowing powers.  Anybody who has any experience of finance will appreciate that the position is serious when a nation or, indeed, an individual over-borrows. I should like to ask the Senators on the other side of the House what was the alternative to heavy borrowing by the Government during the past two or three years?</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech last year, if I remember correctly, spelled out the dangers of the policy of borrowing but pointed out that in the circumstances the Government had decided that the risks of massive unemployment and the social unrest that would follow were far greater than the risk of borrowing substantially. In the circumstances they were right, but this is obviously a policy that cannot go on.  We have to moderate our demands for incomes right across the board and here again I should like to emphasise that when one talks about incomes one tends to talk about wages.  One should remember that incomes are made up not only of wages but also of salaries, dividends, fees and so on.  If we are <Col N="1394" /> going to have what I think is required, a national policy on income restraint, it must be applied right across the board, even if it requires Government legislation to curtail the payments of salaries and dividends.  That proposal was made some months ago as a corollary to a moderation in wage demands.  Unfortunately, neither one nor the other was implemented.  We are still endeavouring to pay ourselves more than we can afford.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should remember one or two fundamental facts about our country, and recall certain economic defects which will not go away.  This should be emphasised because we have delusions of grandeur from time to time.  We are a very small country with a population of some three million and a gross national product of just over £3 billion. Obviously, there is a limitation to what we can do within these resources. We have a wide open economy, possibly the most open in Europe. Therefore, we are vulnerable to outside forces, more so than most other countries.  The proportion of our GNP that we export is amongst the highest in the world and the same applies to our imports.  We are dependent to a greater extent than most countries on external trade and we can only trade at prices that our customers abroad will pay.  We can only buy at prices at which our suppliers will sell to us.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty which has compounded our situation is the fact that the comfort of a protected home market which we enjoyed for quite a number of years has now virtually ended.  We find ourselves in the position that unless the quality and costs of our goods are competitive not only will we not be able to expand our export trade on which employment opportunities in the long-term must depend but we will also lose a substantial proportion of our home market.  These are the facts of life; they will not go away and we cannot turn our backs on them.  It is becoming more evident, and I hope this has sunk in in all sections of our community, that unless we pull our socks up, reduce our costs, moderate our demands and tone down our expectations we <Col N="1395" /> will be in very serious trouble in the years ahead.  These might be old-fashioned ideas but they are as relevant today as they ever were.</P>
    <P>Until we learn to apply them we will continue to have a high rate of unemployment and continuing inflation. This is more important than academic arguments about whether private or State enterprise is best for the country; whether private enterprise has failed and State enterprise is the obvious answer to all our difficulties.  Unless we as a nation, as a people and as individuals are prepared to moderate our demands it does not matter very much whether we depend on private or State enterprise or a combination of both. The basic facts of life are that if we cannot produce goods at competitive prices and the right quality for the export markets it does not matter who manufactures or distributes them in the long-term.  The basic requirements are missing and if that happens nothing else will fall into place.</P>
    <P>Some indication of the enormous task facing the country if we want to achieve full employment within the next decade is indicated by recent reasonable estimates of the type of employment figures, the number of jobs required over the next ten years. It is not unreasonable to take one of the estimates made more often than others, a figure of 300,000 new jobs over the next ten years if we want to take on the unemployed, look after school-leavers and those leaving the technical colleges and universities.  A low estimate is £3,000 per job.  That is low because according to a recent issue of the Confederation of Irish Industry <i>Newsletter</i>, the fixed assets included in jobs has varied between £2,000, in the case of small industries which are always the cheapest and in many ways the most effective to assist, and up to £15,000 for jobs for foreign industry.  That crude sum works out at something in the region of £9 billion over the next ten years, an enormous figure which we cannot hope to provide from our own resources.  If we doubled that figure it would probably be nearer to a realistic estimate of the capital involved <Col N="1396" /> in providing employment over the next ten years.  It is a formidable figure.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect which we cannot forget.  It is obvious in financing any new industry or distributing enterprise that a substantial proportion of the capital must come from our own resources if we want to maintain a majority holding for Irish industry in Irish hands.  It might be a solution to our problems if we allowed private capital to take over a substantial, even a majority holding, in industrial development in the country but it would be disastrous for us as a nation.</P>
    <P>If we want to protect industry and maintain it in Irish hands we must put up a substantial amount of the cash. We can only get the cash from a limited number of sources, by generating profits, by taxation, if the Government are to develop semi-State industry or assist private enterprise or by borrowing.  Obviously, there is a limit to all three sources.</P>
    <P>It is essential&mdash;Senator Alexis FitzGerald also made this point&mdash;that if private enterprise continues to finance a substantial proportion of industrial development it must be allowed to earn reasonable profits.  It is unreasonable to expect that private industry can exist unless it can generate the type of profits which will allow a reasonable reward to the enterpreneurs, the owner-promoters and ensure that enough is left to reinvest in extensions to existing industries and businesses, provide new equipment and establsh new industries. This must be done.  The talk which takes place sometimes about the profits in industries is ill-advised and, in many cases, misunderstands the situation. I am not speaking about excessive profits but about reasonable profits related to investment in industry. The same applies to State industries. State industries, whether they call them profits or surpluses, must have sufficient capital generated to reinvest in extensions and keep equipment up to date.  These are the type of problems which face our country today. They are problems applicable to most small countries.  If we want to exist <Col N="1397" /> as a small independent nation&mdash;we all want to do that&mdash;we must be prepared to make certain sacrifices.  The first and essential sacrifice is the limitation of demands on employers, on industry and taking too much out of the national cake.  It cannot be done.</P>
    <P>We have many advantages here. We have an ample supply of good, intelligent labour, to which tributes have already been paid and a huge potential in the young people leaving schools, technical colleges and universities. If they are to secure employment at home we must accept the necessary financial disciplines and restraints which will ensure that adequate finance is available for the development of private and State industries. There is no other solution.  If we are not prepared to do this we should not be cribbing about high unemployment and inflation.  If a limited number of our people want to have a good time at the expense of the rest of the community the situation should be clearly explained to them and they should accept it.  If we want to ensure growing employment for an increasing population we must accept sacrifices and restraints.</P>
    <P>This is difficult, very often, in a democratic society.  In the type of economy they operate on the other side of the Iron Curtain they can do this because they can direct investment into industry.  They can virtually tell people what to wear, what to eat, who is going to have a car and who is not.  In a democratic society we must depend on the good sense, the loyalty and the patriotism of our people to make the necessary sacrifices in the interests of all, particularly in the interests of the young population who are now coming on the employment market.</P>
    <P>It is illusory to think the Government alone can solve these problems. We are all in this together, every section of the community, and we must accept the fact that the battle against inflation and the provision of new employment opportunities are not matters for the Government alone. We are all in it and all of us have a part to play.  That is the important <Col N="1398" /> message for the Government to get over to the people.  I believe our people will accept sacrifices and restraints.  I believe they are prepared to moderate their demands if they understand that we, as a people, are totally involved in this national effort.  We often made calls on our people for patriotic efforts and they were magnificently answered in past and dangerous days.</P>
    <P>The patriot is the man who does a good day's work, moderates his demands for salaries, wages or dividends, and stands by the country in its hour of need.  He will not get any headlines in the newspapers but he is the man who is really going to save this country.  He must get a lead from the Government of the day.  Almost certainly that will necessitate the Government taking difficult and unpopular decisions.  If they have to be taken they should be taken.  I believe our people will answer a lead if it is given. Just to say it is all a matter for the Government and the rest of us can sit back and take it easy is a complete hallucination.  It is a matter for the Government and the people combined.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied&mdash;and I think most people would agree&mdash;that if we stop trying to have our cake and eat it, if we are prepared to moderate our demands, if we are prepared in our different ways of life to do a good day's work for a good day's pay, we will then have the capital to provide new industry.  We will then have the capital to provide the facilities for the weaker sections of our community, hospitals, education, schools and to help those who cannot help themselves. We cannot have these things and at the same time have a good time at the expense of the community.  It is a time for national restraint.  It may be an unpopular policy to advocate.  I see no other policy.</P>
    <P>I believe in the good sense of the trade unions.  I believe in the good sense of their leaders.  Obviously they have a job to do in the best interests of their members.  At long last the penny has begun to drop and the powerful forces outside Parliament who nowadays have an enormous impact, an enormous say in the economy <Col N="1399" />&mdash;the trade unions, the farmers, the employers&mdash;are now realising that their influence and actions can have an all-important impact on the future of the country and its prosperity in the years ahead.  I believe that, given the necessary lead, the Government will get that co-operation.  I want to emphasise what I have probably over-emphasised already, that we are all in this together and none of us should endeavour to opt out and to go it alone.</P>

      <P>In the past three years, almost four now, since we were elected to the Seanad I have observed speakers on the Government benches consistently but never until today have I seen such sadness in their expressions.

      <P>Not particularly from this side of the House.  I have never seen so many people smile together for the same reason.  Of course, they have extraordinary problems because no matter how they try to manipulate only about half of them will be back after the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to Senator Russell, suddenly everything changes.  Now the new national heroes are those who apply restraint, those who do not look for more money and say nothing, those people in this island who today are suffering because of the confusion created by the Minister for Finance during the past three years.  Now they are the new national heroes if they do not look for anything exceptional, or if they do not look for what they are entitled to.  I do not agree with that. I do not agree that the Minister for Finance was, at any stage, correct in his application of the distribution of the wealth of this country for which he, as Minister for Finance, was responsible since he took office.  He even expressed that himself in this House this morning when he opened <Col N="1400" /> this debate.  In my opinion he begged for mercy in this House when he said that he wanted not a look back but a look forward.</P>
    <P>One realises immediately that the Minister for Finance had a reason for that.  His record in borrowing by this nation is unequalled.  He has borrowed more money abroad since 1973 than this State has borrowed since its foundation.  He has borrowed money for purposes which certainly have not been constructive.  Since the Government took office, Fianna Fáil, both in this House and in the other House, have asked persistently for an economic plan, for an economic policy. Even up to two months ago the Minister said that was not possible.  He said that on television.  Ex-Senator Halligan was converted to our way of thinking in his demand for an economic plan.  This week, yielding to the hounds of the Labour Party&mdash;as is usual&mdash;the Minister for Finance announced that we are to get a Green Paper, or a blue paper, or some coloured document, in midsummer setting out a new economic plan.</P>
    <P>The dogs are now loose in the Labour Party.  They are barking and biting and everything and anything will be done by the Minister and by the Government to keep them quiet for a little longer.  They will come to a very sudden and sad end quite soon.  As I said, we have borrowed and borrowed from every nation that had anything to give.</P>
    <P>As has been said, &ldquo;Every shaky sheik was shaken&rdquo; to see if we could get a few bob from him.  At 31st March, 1973, £1,298 million was the amount borrowed by this country.  At March 31st, 1974, it had gone up by approximately £100 million; at 31st December by £300 million; at 31st December, 1975, by £1,200 million; and at 31st March, 1976, when all the Arabian money was collected, this nation had borrowed £3,200 million, an increase in three years from £1,200 million to £3,200 million&mdash;fascinating figures.  It now has come to an end and we cannot borrow any more, not because we would not but because we cannot get it.  The culmination was the recent borrowing from our EEC <Col N="1401" /> partners and, as was illustrated by Senator Yeats and Senator Lenihan here today, that was under certain conditions and terms of reference. The sheiks are gone now and we are left alone and little wonder that Senator Russell would rise and call the new patriots of this nation those that do not ask for what they duly deserve.  We can now see properly the realism and the attitude of the Government benches when they find themselves in this frustrating situation.</P>
    <P>The performance over the last four years has been the responsibility not of the officials of the Department of Finance but of the head of that Department, the Minister for Finance, who is responsible to the Government. He begged and borrowed his way throughout the world and has created the confusion we have today.  Now the word is out in the Government benches that they rise steadily one after the other, and particularly all the Fine Gael people in the Government benches, because they are the only ones who spoke today, oddly enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not here now, but they are following instructions, and coming in one by one. There has not been one Labour spokesman as yet.  Why?  Because in their heart of hearts they could not justify this performance and they know that the people who have suffered more by them are the workers, the people they purport to represent.  Then the Minister begs for mercy.  He is not getting much mercy from us because he was asked&mdash;indeed at one stage commanded in this House and in the other&mdash;to produce an economic policy.  The Government Senators will dribble in here one by one until this debate is over, hoping that it will be over sooner rather than later, because it is very hard for them to find speakers to justify the present situation.  They have not seen the green paper or the blue paper for this new economic plan.  I personally feel that it is far too late for one.  Government <Col N="1402" /> spending demands a borrowing of at least 40 per cent of the national budget each year to continue in existence, and that obviously they will not get.  They are incapable of getting that, because no nation, no matter how far away, will give or lend their money to this Government who have destroyed the credibility and the creditworthiness of this nation over the last three or four years and who would not listen to anybody and particularly to people who had 16 years experience.  Ex-Finance Ministers of this party advised them consistently, but they would not listen.  Now they find themselves in this chaotic position in which they beg for the mercy of the working people, who find themselves in an infuriating and incapacitating situation in regard to their incomes.</P>
      <P>The National Debt is a national catastrophe.  I have not worked out the figures per head of the population, but I am sure that every man, woman and child in this country owes a little more than £1,000 per head, and that is certainly a terrible debt for the National Coalition Government to put on the child who has yet to be born. I have never heard of it in any nation, and certainly it has never happened before in this nation.  But now it has come to an end.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, stated in this House this morning that he was delighted, that after his persistence and the Government's persistence in the EEC chambers of Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg they have conceded the necessity for economic policy.  How has he the audacity to talk, and from what platform could he and the Government he represents talk, who never had a policy and who persistently and openly said that they could not have one under the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of spending, as I said, has to be financed to the tune of approximately 40 per cent by borrowing.  How can this continue when the Minister cannot borrow the money to pay? Taxes and the demand on workers are extraordinary.  Social welfare demands on workers are again extraordinary. The demands on workers over the last 12 months have been so great that it <Col N="1403" /> is now as profitable for a man to be idle as to work.  That is disgraceful. Small businessmen are vanishing.  The constraints on small businesses are such that, as anybody coming into this city or any major town can see, they are closing at an enormous rate.  This is sad, and it is a problem that still could be tackled if the Minister would realise the necessity of doing something to alleviate their problems.  It is absolutely imperative that all those people in small businesses be helped now rather than hindered.</P>
    <P>At present 10 to 12 per cent of our people are unemployed.  There are over 120,000 people on the live register wanting work and none there for them.  What is even more sad is that there is no effort being made to give them employment.  We have gimmicks day after day and the most recent one of all was the one by the Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, who is responsible for AnCO when, three or four weeks ago, AnCO ran a course for six weeks for leaving certificate students of last year who were not yet employed and who were signing on in the social welfare offices.  A sum of £2.75 per hour was paid to teachers of a description, some with qualifications some without qualifications; £15 per student per week was paid for those courses.  There was no set type of course.  It was up to the teacher or the principal of the course to set whatever type he desired.  It appeared they wanted to waste the amount of money that seemed to have been left over in that section of the Department, totalling £500,000.  That is only my estimate; it may be much more than that.  I have not the facts about the number of centres in which those courses were carried on, but I know how many there were in the country where I live.  They are still going on.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Finance to tell me what purpose is the end result going to serve in this waste of public money?  Can it be that for the moment the number on the live register of the unemployed requires to be dropped while the leaving certificate result, which will be out soon, will <Col N="1404" /> increase it in another way?  Is it just a ploy to increase unemployment steadily rather than rapidly?  It is a point which needs clarification.</P>
    <P>Would it not be better to have spent that £½ million on facilities for primary education where we find day by day, week by week, more pressure on families&mdash;rural families, in particular&mdash;to bring their own children to school and taking away from them the bus service that was there for them?  It is happening, and I am sure the Minister is aware that it is happening.  It appears that it is a saving, a saving on primary education, the first essential in the training of any human.  Because we want to bring down or steadily increase the live register of unemployed, we will spend £½ million that could so well be spent on the transport of children to primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance must be responsible for the enterprise of the semi-State bodies.  I have listened year after year to Senators from every side of the House making suggestions about what could be done by State enterprises. We have semi-State organisations who are not playing their part, not for their own reasons but because they lack the finances to play that part.  A lot could have been done here to help people who are unemployed and who want employment.  We see that chaotic state of CIE, where only three weeks ago the chairman of the company said that they were broke. What effort can the Government make to bring CIE into line?</P>
    <P>We all know that CIE are top-heavy with management and certainly lacking at the bottom.  We saw the disgraceful performance by the Government with CIE management in Dublin when they closed a main line in Connaught.  It was CIE's policy.  I do not think that we shall ever forget it. I do not think that this Government will ever be let forget it.  Small towns depended on that line and they wanted its existence under terms and conditions which seemed appropriate to any sensible person.  I am sure that there are people employed in CIE who over the next two or three years will plan the closure of many more lines.  Where the finances of that particular line are <Col N="1405" /> going I do not know, but I am sure that the people representing those areas know.  People will be employed in CIE to phase out a new line and all the reasons will come up again as they have come up before.  The sad part about it is that it is main lines that are being closed down now and not sublines. Such a catastrophe as happened to the line from Ballina to Limerick via Athenry should never again be tolerated.  Indeed I would go so far as to say that the Minister for Finance should look into this and should view it as a possible opportunity of creating more employment by running a proper service.  We do not want the service which CIE gave us on that line.  What we want is a commuter service, properly organised to bring people to work to Galway, Limerick and Ballina &mdash;three very important points on the western seaboard.  We want to bring children to school, to third-level education in Galway and Limerick, and back home because the cost of keeping those children in cities in flats is now reaching astronomical figures which parents are no longer able to afford. For this very reason consideration of the reopening of that line would not be out of line for any Minister.</P>
    <P>CIE and their freight service have certainly to be reviewed as well and in particular in regard to the bleak parts of the west, where some people still have to live, where services are so disgraceful. I can point out a few if the Minister wants them specifically.  A shopkeeper in one part of Connacht will order goods from a traveller on a Monday with one month's credit.  After that month's credit is up the bill will come to that shopkeeper for the product and the product will not have arrived at his door.  That is the type of service CIE are giving us in many parts of the west of Ireland.  The service in parts of Mayo and Galway is disgraceful, to say the least.</P>
    <P>A review of these services is absolutely necessary.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance as well as of the Minister for Transport and Power to give orders to the members they appointed to the board.  It is well known why they were appointed to those boards.  They stood outside <Col N="1406" /> every polling booth in the last general election and it became obvious they would take instructions from the Minister and that they would be responsible to the Minister who appointed them to do a job of work for the Government.  They are failing disgracefully to the extent that some of them are resigning from semi-State bodies because they are not allowed to do the job they thought to be correct. There may, of course, be other reasons for more of them to resign.  I will not go into that.  An immediate review of CIE is absolutely necessary. CIE can give a service if they act to give a service.  If this reneging is cried halt to and if the board are operated properly, it can be done.</P>
    <P>I have asked for a commuter service from Ballina to Limerick.  Proposals are in CIE headquarters explaining in details, even to the extent of timing and schedule, from people who seek a public service to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>How was the deficit of £250,000 arrived at?  That question has not been replied to.  I am sure the Minister for Finance will be canvassing in my constituency at the next general election and he will be able to back up figures with what he calls facts.  If he is not, we will be there to remind him.</P>
    <P>There is an outstanding case for a commuter service between Ballina, through Galway city, and Limerick.  It would be used by children attending the regional technical colleges in Galway and Limerick and the university in Galway and by workers employed in local industries.  It would help to alleviate the problems faced by parents who have to keep their children in those cities right through the term.</P>
    <P>Since the fondation of the sugar factory in Tuam it has been the life-stream of the town.  But there has been a noticeable decline in the potato industry.  There were only a few working weeks in the potato plant last year.  The farmer always seems to get the blame, but not always are those who blame correct and not, indeed, often those who are blamed are the people who may be correct.  I did not condone then, nor do I so <Col N="1407" /> now, those who signed contracts and did not supply potatoes.  Neither would I condone a semi-State organisation buying potatoes from the farmers of Connacht at £34 a ton, transferring them on to a lorry and sending them to the Dublin marts at £148 a ton.  It is commonly known that that is what the sugar company did in Tuam.  Does the Minister for Finance condone that type of action? Will he say publicly that he does not condone it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say it now.  I would not condone it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he convey that message to those whom he appointed to the board of the sugar company? Will he ask them to stand up and say that they do not condone it either? Will he ask them not to make petty statements saying they were trying to save a few shillings?  It was on the cards from the beginning that the company would carry out this action.</P>
      <P>The farmers of Connacht have, because of their geographical position, a particular type of &ldquo;glic-ness&rdquo; which is absolutely necessary to them.  It was very necessary to them on that occasion that they had that intuition about what this semi-State body would do.  The sugar company may not be to blame for their lack of purpose and energy which they could use to the benefit of the community, and particularly the community of Tuam.  They make their million for the State each year but obviously the State took the million this year and did not hand it back for reinvestment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked several times that something be done about the millions of pounds that we are paying for imported manufactured products of farm implements which are arriving on our shores day by day from as far away as Czechoslovakia and Russia.  I believe the sugar company have the technical know-how, the engineering staff, the ground staff, the connections, to make a viable proposition of the manufacture of farm machinery.  My pleas have always been ignored.  It is a way out of this impasse that the <Col N="1408" /> Government and the Minister find themselves in with regard to investment. They could, by direction to the board, instruct the sugar company to invest this million pounds they will make again this year back into the production of farm machinery.  I do not specifically mean beet harvesters.  If they did not move with the times in the manufacture of beet harvesters and beet equipment, they would not have any beet today.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the other types of farm machinery needed in agriculture. They have the technical know-how. For nine months of each year they have the finest technical staff who could go into the manufacture of farm implements, who could, if they so wished, manufacture some of the finest implements that could be put into Irish agriculture.  They are much needed today in these days of rising costs and rising demands.  Not alone would they meet a necessary need but they would save a massive import capital that is being squandered, and they would also give necessary employment in towns similar to the one that I live in, Tuam.  They have the finest equipment.  They have the ground staff to sell.  They have the communications already there in their industry, they would have no problem selling their products and servicing farm equipment.  I ask the Minister to impress upon his board to change the direction of the sugar company and ask the new executive who have been recently appointed to give their views on this point.  The £1 million profit they will make this year would be very little to ask them to invest in a project of this type, which would help the weakest section in the country&mdash; our section in Tuam.</P>
    <P>Another Department has reached its peak performance of minus zero, that is, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If you live two miles outside the speed limit of any town the Minister will guarantee that for the next five years you have not got a hope of getting a telephone.  I am sure every Senator and every individual who wrote to that gentleman over the last 12 months knows quite well that the circular from that Department states. <Col N="1409" /> Everybody who made an application for a telephone has got one.  They have no hope, while the present Minister is in that office, of ever getting a telephone if they live outside the speed limits of the town.</P>
    <P>If you live inside the speed limits of certain towns you have not a hope either, particularly in the west where we have an astronomical number of exchanges still with numbers like Athenry 1, Athenry 2, Athenry 42 and Athenry 407.  After 50 years there are only 408 telephones in operation in that town.  You have to ring the operator in certain areas before 11 a.m. or 10.30 p.m. or you will not make any connection.  We had statements by the Minister recently where he blamed the union&mdash;I think they call themselves members of the Irish Post Office Engineering Workers' Union&mdash; and said they were responsible for the lack of our telephone communications. Everybody knows that if the Department do not have the money they cannot perform.  It is a simple calculation and has been in existence since Adam and Eve&mdash;and that is some time ago &mdash;and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, headed by Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, the Minister, are still in that age and have not moved forward. Those of us in the agricultural community first, and in small businesses second, know that if we want to apply for a private telephone or for a public telephone kiosk in the neighbourhood, we will have no hope for six years.  Nothing is being done and no money is being put aside to help in this direction.  As I am sure the Minister for Finance is aware, the first things he sees every morning in his office is at least two or three telephones. If he had not got them there he could not exist in his Department as readily as he is trying to exist&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Any more you might. There was a time when you spent so long ringing Iran and Iraq, and all those places, arranging to borrow that if you had not the telephone you could not have got it.  and maybe it would have been a godsend to this <Col N="1410" /> country if you could not have made the communication and you would not have put us into debt to £3,200 million.  That would have been a blessing.</P>
      <P>If telephones had been provided in the west to small farmers and businessmen who need them to perform their work, it would have been a far better investment and we would not have been half as badly off.  The telephone situation is desperate.  It is no good the Minister blaming members of the union and holding them responsible for the bad service when everybody knows that he and this Government are totally responsible for the lack of investment in that Department.  If the Minister says that they have made an enormous amount of money available to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I may believe him but the people of my country have no intention of believing him.  That is certain because it is no less than a national scandal that enterprising farmers and small businessmen cannot have a necessity of life&mdash;a telephone&mdash; and no effort is being made and no promise can made that they will ever get one.  That is the most serious aspect of it.</P>
      <P>Because of the promises made by the Government in 1973 we find our health boards in a desperate situation. Day by day the poorer sections of the community are suffering because of this inept Government.  Patients in rural areas have no public transport available to take them to their hospitals. We put schemes into operation where taxis or public transport of some description could be arranged to bring them to the hospitals.  If we paid now for that transport they could still be brought.  We find that an order from the Department of Health to the health boards stated that they no longer can pay for this service and that we no longer have authority to pay transport services for elderly people, who need to be brought to regional or central hospitals.  This is very bad, particularly in my area where we have no public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It always is a good thing on Appropriation Bill to remind the Minister that the weakest in the community <Col N="1411" /> are always the first to suffer when, as he so classifies it, we have to tighten our economic belts.  A new approach to medical cards has been adopted by the Western Health Board. Now you do not get the chance to review your card.  You are told by some hypnotic way that due to circumstances recently come to notice, you are now considered ineligible for a medical card and they ask you to post in the one you have post-haste because they need it urgently.  Some people will go to their local representative of one party or another and he will do his utmost for them, naturally, and will write to the necessary places to get forms, and will help that person, as is his duty, but there are many people who do not use that service and who find themselves lost.  About 60 per cent of those who send back their medical cards are people who do not approach public representatives. They are at the mercy of their local doctor and their local pharmacist until such time as their own view will permit them to make an application for a new medical card.  The levels of income required and the method of assessment for a medical card should be published in every local newspaper for three weeks running so that everybody would have the opportunity of understanding how they could be eligible for a medical card and be in a position to assess whether they are eligible or not to a reasonable degree so that if this medical card is taken from them they will be able to re-apply for it and state that because of what they read in the local paper recently they think they are entitled to a medical card and that they would like a new application to be processed properly.</P>
    <P>At one time the Department of Health was the biggest employer of young girls who had got their leaving certificates.  We now have a situation in my area and in the two neighbouring counties of Mayo and Galway where there is only one training hospital where 900 girls attended interviews for 80 places last year.</P>
    <P>This year I assume there will be an increase of at least 20 per cent on that figure for fewer places, because <Col N="1412" /> it has now been announced that such places as Castlebar Hospital, Roscommon Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, and other smaller hospitals will no longer be able to train young nurses.  It has been Government policy that without fear or favour every married woman in this country should be employed.  This is the one department where that policy has upset the situation.  I agree that some married women need work because they are settling down and have huge mortgage repayments to make.  They are not helped now by the State because Deputy Tully was good enough to take the grant away from them last year aided and abetted by every Minister in this national Coalition Government.  They have to work in order to meet this initial cost of setting up house and home.</P>
    <P>But there are thousands of others, some of them whose husbands have more than a normal wage&mdash;I do not know what the new normal is to be, but whatever it is some of them will have even double that&mdash;who travel to those hospitals day and night to take positions as nurses as a sideline or as a way to get away from the kitchen sink.  This is the new ideal dream of women, that they no longer belong to the kitchen and that they should never have been their in the first instance.  In any event, they are now taking the place from their daughters or if not their daughters, their neighbours' daughters who used to get good employment as nurses in those hospitals.</P>
    <P>In this particular aspect of Irish employment, I ask the Minister for Health and his Government or somebody in the Government who could be classified as responsible to ask or command those people to desist from taking up these very much needed positions for our young girls so as to stop them emigrating by the thousands as they will have to in this situation. They can no longer go to England. They must go further afield and that makes it sadder.  I ask the Minister for Finance to please act immediately on this aspect of employment and start again that great flow of training young girls to be nurses.  It is a profession <Col N="1413" /> which, it is believed, they have a vocation for.  So many fine girls have to be left on the unemployment exchange when they could be trained as nurses for the future.</P>
    <P>There was much talk today and during the last few weeks on our Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. I should like to deal with the fisheries section of it.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald, with his lecturing right arm told us today about the great fields of fish and about the great industry which lies on our shores.  This could be true. But what do we know expect what we are told and what we expect may be the truth?  We should have been one of the countries, along with Iceland and America and other countries who declared some time ago that the sea fishery limits should be extended to 200 miles.  But we are bound and rightly so, within the context of the EEC to define an exclusive limit for ourselves.  For the first time since we entered Europe we are in the very envious position that we have at least one of the longest coastlines and as regards certain species of fish we have one of the richest coastlines in the EEC.  We should set about the task of telling the EEC that we want and that we must have a limit which we define as proper.  It is not correct for us as a people or the Government as a Government to broadly accept that the exclusive rights should be just 50 miles and no more or no less.  We must do a quick educational course on fish, fish life and location&mdash;all aspects concerned with fish conservation&mdash;and then state what our limits must be in order to conserve this fish.  We just cannot say that 50 miles is enough.  In some areas, it may be too far and in others not enough.  We know that your Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Murphy, is making an effort to conserve the herring stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;with special responsibility for fisheries&mdash;I think that is his proper title, who gave instructions to the fishing fleet to conserve, on special days of the week, the herring stock. We had Russian trawlers as well as Danish boats&mdash;and Denmark is a member of the EEC but is never mentioned in connection with the plundering of the sea&mdash;only 100 yards outside the limits on days when our fishing fleets could not fish.  They were mother ships rushing in their small crafts to clear out our stocks.  We are trying to conserve and they are engaged in their effort to destroy.  The effort to destroy was much greater than the effort to conserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a valid point in any argument that the Government, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs, may use in their efforts for conservation. It is essential to determine the extent of the fishing zone, whether it be a mile, 50 or 100 miles, and it should be clearly defined.  Mackerel are being taken in thousands of tons from our shores also.  When we negotiate our exclusive fishing zone I hope we will know exactly where the fishing grounds are, the movements of fish and their spawning grounds so that we can control the stocks.  We can <Col N="1415" /> learn a lesson from Iceland.  After they had destroyed their own herring stock they made sure that their cod stocks would not diminish.  They fought hard for this and I assume have won the battle to preserve their cod stocks.  We have the richest herring and mackerel fishing grounds in Europe.  We must show the way, not be shown the way.  We must explain clearly why we must have this zone. We must back up our claim with a newer and more up-to-date fishery patrol service.  There is an absolute necessity today for a coastguard airship to patrol our fishing grounds.  In Iceland, their patrol service can photograph a fishing ship from the air and show exactly where it was fishing and this is upheld in court.  When the crew of a ship is brought to court and found guilty of fishing illegally, it is not the catch and equipment which are confiscated but the trawler or whatever type of boat is used.  It is time we also took such measures.  We must tell the EEC that it is necessary that we conserve our fishing stock and that we intend beginning by introducing legislation under which the penalty will be so severe as to deter people from coming within our limits.</P>
    <P>We will have to lead the way at the Conference of the Sea next August or September.  Countries outside the EEC have imposed a 200 mile limit and it has resulted in serious problems, particularly when we consider the position of Germany, where approximately 69 per cent of the total catch is caught in foreign waters; 36 per cent of Britain's catch is outside their own territorial waters.  Were it not for the fact that Denmark still have access to Greenland's waters, they would find themselves in a similar position. Holland must certainly suffer.  As a result, ships suitable for deep water fishing will come on the market I assume and I would ask the Minister for Finance to convey to the Government the necessity to purchase those ships and make necessary arrangements through the EEC.  Now is the time to train crews for these ships. This can be done without embarrassment to those countries.  We can, in return, guarantee them supplies of processed <Col N="1416" /> fish, but not fish in the sea.  It is something that must get a great deal of thought.  It is an argument that the Minister for Foreign Affairs can use, an argument we are quite entitled to use.</P>
    <P>The recent directive from the EEC about inshore fishing, with grants being paid to people, particularly the Germans, to scrap their boats and discontinue inshore fishing is an indication of the thinking in those countries. Before these large vessels are scrapped, before the EEC pays grants for them to be scrapped, the EEC could make a grant to us to purchase them and use them.  That is a very logical argument any normal thinking person would apply and, if normality has returned to this Government, they could apply that little bit of normal thinking on this aspect of the economy.</P>
    <P>Since the Appropriation Bill of last year we have had some records created.  We have had inept Government and, having exhausted all world sources of borrowing, we must now face stark reality.  We are now going to be asked to tighten our economic belts and face the issues at stake.  That is exactly what Senator Russell said. We must now face the facts and the facts are becoming plainer daily.  This Government should have the common courtesy to dissolve and give the nation an opportunity of judging whether or not the National Coalition was a catastrophe.</P>

      <P>I am always astonished when I hear people speaking as if nothing has happened during the past 56 years, or so, since we won the right to handle our own affairs.  I say this particularly because of the contribution of Senator Yeats this morning. The Minister pleaded with us to be objective.  I took it he was asking for objectivity because we have been through a very difficult period, particularly in 1975, and we might have some useful suggestions to make.  Of course, simple me, I was naïve enough to think that that course would be pursued.  Unfortunately, that has <Col N="1417" /> not been the case and, because of Senator Yeats's approach this morning, it is now necessary for me to alter my approach.  His approach necessitates my going briefly over the history of the past 50 years to take issue with him on some of the points he made.</P>
      <P>One would think that the Opposition did not have the opportunity in 33 years to take a certain course of action and do the things they now advocate.  In 1926 we had 1¼ million people in work in the country.  Fifty years later the number was less than one million.  I do not think that anyone could get away with implying the present Government are responsible for that situation particularly in the light of the well recognised characteristics of the Irish economy in failing to absorb into the workforce the natural increase in population and the drift from the land.  Those are two aspects that have been neglected from the beginning.</P>
      <P>Emigration was a great safety valve. Nothing effective was done to tackle this question of absorbing the growth in population into employment.  There was no effective policies.  Certainly there was programming and certainly there were efforts made in certain directions.  Conveniently, the argument is advanced as if the situation today is the very same as it was during Fianna Fáil's long period of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the thirties Scandinavia had a GNP comparable to that of Ireland. They now have a standard of living which is three times better than that of our people.  It is hard to have to listen to those who are very critical of a Government dealing with a very difficult situation.  That situation is widely acknowledged throughout the world.  How is it that Scandinavia, which had the same sort of GNP as we had in the thirties, could adopt methods which would bring the standard of living there up to three times that of Ireland?  There was no such thing as an EEC then.  We had a Government.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government which had 33 years of office operating within the private enterprise system.  They had the opportunity of doing something very <Col N="1418" /> like what was done in Scandinavia but, in fact, that opportunity was never availed of.</P>
    <P>The approach by the Government who had 33 years in power, 16 of those on a continuous basis, to solving unemployment was emigration for both the unemployed and the unemployable. Not only did we allow our able-bodied people to use the safety valve of emigration but we also allowed some of our disabled people, the unemployable people, to take the emigrant ship.  Because of a lack of policy and foresight no steps were taken to absorb workers into the services and manufacturing employments even though there was a downward trend in agricultural work.</P>
    <P>There is no mention of the fact that emigration was the solver of the problem and it is conveniently overlooked that there were one million Irish-born people resident in the UK. Quite a lot of that emigration took place in the period of office of the Fianna Fáil Government.  They are now critical of this Government but they are not comparing like with like in their arguments of how the present Administration are tackling their problems today.  They do not have regard to the fact that 1975 was the most critical period in our history, except for the 1930s.  It may even have been worse than the thirties.  They make the arguments as if nothing had happened, nothing had changed, that the circumstances are exactly the same as when they were in power.  They overlook the fact that in the 1950s there was heavy emigration which actually left an imbalance in the age groups.  As a result of this imbalance there is a very high dependence on social services among the young and the old, which this present Government are trying to provide. That is something that was inherited. It cannot be denied; it is a fact of life. It is necessary to spend money now on the young and the old, and quite rightly so, but there is no appreciation of this fact by the Opposition, there is no acceptance of the need to deal with this particular contingency in the way it is being dealt with.  This is despite the fact that the previous Administrations held office for a period of 33 <Col N="1419" /> years, which included the 1950s when there was high emigration.</P>

      <P>In the 1950s there was mainly Coalition Government. That was the crucial period to which the Senator is referring.</P>

      <P>If the Senator will wait a little, as I did until he had finished, he will discover that I am not confining my arguments to the 1950s.  There were other periods and I would like to draw that to his attention.  Let me put it another way to the Senator.  You cannot blame the terrible 1920s, you cannot blame the awful 1930s and you cannot blame the war in the 1940s.  If you take the war during the 1940s, there were 250,000 in the British armed forces which again was a solution in its own way.  You have not got that excuse to fall back on, so you can take your pick.  As a boy in the late 1920s and early 1930s I lived in poverty, I knew what it was and knew what high unemployment was.</P>

      <P>I remember when Jim Larkin persuaded de Valera to go into politics, to stop his nonsense, to come in and make a contribution to the political situation and I am <Col N="1420" /> pleased that he did, in a way. But you had those solutions, you had the emigration for the bulk of that time.  I admit that in the early 1960s Fianna Fáil could lay some claim to a time of sustained economic growth.  It was a good measure of success.  In the 1960s, 50 years after taking charge of our own affairs, after 33 years of office of Fianna Fáil, we had a 4 per cent per annum growth rate of the economy.  That was good. Exports rose by 6½ per cent in real terms.  The industrial sector expanded by 6 per cent.  Yet despite those particular growth figures the astonishing fact was that compared to 1926, when there were 1.25 million people at work, we had only 1.05 million people at work during the 1950s. There was progress, expansion and good growth in the 1960s but nothing effective was done about putting people to work as the population grew.  No provision was made for the growth of the population and the decline in agricultural work.</P>

      <P>It is all about putting people back to work and if the debate had started off on that basis we would have been all right but unfortunately it did not.  At least I have started my contribution on a particular basis and I hope to develop it.  However, I will be critical where it is necessary to be critical of the present Administration.</P>
