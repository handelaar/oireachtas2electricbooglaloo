      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 3.  If business has not concluded at 1 p.m., it is proposed to break for lunch from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. As regards No. 1, I fully appreciate the position of an Opposition faced with a guillotine motion but, clearly, it is necessary from the Government's point of view in the exceptional circumstances which exist in relation to banks.  Once the Government decided as a matter of policy on bringing in the Bill, clearly in the present circumstances it is necessary that it should be passed.  So far as I am concerned while there is a deadline set out in motion No. 1, I am prepared to adopt the attitude that either acceptance or passing of this motion need not rule out subsequent agreement with regard to time but in that connection all of us would wish to remember that this is Friday, that Members of the House will be seeking to catch trains or buses to travel home and for that reason it does seem that the hour of 4.30 p.m. would be the appropriate one.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, the reality of the matter is that it includes once again, very shortly after a previous guillotine motion on the Finance Bill, yet another guillotine motion which is, of course, basically a denial of democratic expression in Parliament.  It is a matter that should only be introduced as a matter of extreme urgency. That is its basic end and for that reason we must oppose the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the guillotine motion relates to a Bill that has been brought <Col N="678" /> into the Oireachtas by the Government in a panic reaction to a situation where negotiations are still taking place.  The real action in regard to this unfortunate bank dispute is not taking place in the Oireachtas.  The real action is taking place elsewhere from 10.30 this morning under the aegis of the Labour Court in negotiations between the parties involved.  We are going through a charade here in this House, as happened in the Dáil yesterday. This is Government by bluster and Government by bluff and it has all arisen as a direct consequence of the intemperate announcement of the Minister for Finance and I cannot describe it as anything else, last Thursday week as published in last Friday's papers.  It was an announcement in which he sought to wield the big stick, to threaten people into a settlement of the dispute, an industrial dispute in which negotiations are still proceeding. Furthermore this legislation is seeking to pin a section of the community to the national wage agreement of 1975 which is a totally unreal situation.</P>

      <P>I must interrupt the Senator.  I think he is going around the merits and demerits of the proposed Bill.  We are dealing with the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we are opposing the inclusion of this motion for two reasons.  First of all because it is a guillotine motion designed once again very rapidly after a previous guillotine motion, to interfere with the ordinary process of democratic debate in a national Parliament.  We are opposed to the Order of Business and the inclusion of this guillotine motion for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, we are opposing it because it is a massive irrelevancy having regard to the fact that negotiations are proceeding now and the reality of power and decision in this matter rests within a negotiation room away from this Parliament and does not arise in this Parliament.  We are going through a day's charade here in debating a matter that is in reality being really settled and discharged <Col N="679" /> elsewhere.  On those two grounds I am opposing this guillotine motion and opposing the Order of Business that includes with it a Bill that is a total irrelevancy as item No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>A guillotine motion is in its essence and by its very definition a restriction on the freedom of speech and the curtailment of the debate in this House.  It is something which should be used very rarely and very sparingly by any Government. I find it very strange that the Leader of the House in setting out the proposed Order of Business starts with the guillotine motion and then uses the words &ldquo;and if business has not concluded before 1 o'clock the House shall break for lunch&rdquo;.  In other words, the Leader of the House does not believe that this motion will be necessary.  By these words he does not believe that the debate will carry on even until 4.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>This type of motion should be very much in reserve if it is absolutely necessary and should not be trotted out in order to prescribe a debate which should take its natural course. I would ask the Leader of the House to vary the Order of Business at this stage and to take just items No. 2 and 3, the Bill and the motion for early signature by the President, and if at lunch time it appears that the debate is going to carry on an unreasonable time then he can retable the guillotine motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the suggestion of Senator Robinson. I think it seems very reasonable that before putting down a draconian motion such as No. 1 on the Order of Business some regard should be had to the way in which the debate goes.  This Government appear to be getting into the habit of rushing in with these guillotine motions before any thought has been given to the question as to whether they are necessary.  We are opposing the Order of Business as it stands because all three items are items which ought not to be on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> The guillotine motion&mdash;Senator Lenihan has spoken about this&mdash;is an undemocratic procedure which ought to be used only if it is absolutely necessary.  Apart from the question of the length of the debate &mdash;and no one can tell at the moment whether it will be such as to render in the Government's view a motion such as this necessary&mdash;one must query whether this Bill is urgent in that sense of the word or whether in fact it might be of some benefit to the country, and in particular some assistance to the negotiations now taking place, if this Bill did not pass into law until next week. After all, the Government have now published this Bill.  They have made known its terms.  All the parties concerned are aware of the terms and of the implications and the mere act of passing it into law does not appear to alter the position except in a negative sense that it makes it more difficult to conduct the negotiations. The Bill is now there.  It is known to all the parties in these negotiations. I would have thought that not merely is it not necessary to pass it today, but there would be real advantages in leaving it over until, perhaps, next week.  We oppose also the second item on the Order of Business, the Regulations of Banks Bill, because it is not required by the present circumstances. It is wrong in principle and, of course, we will be dealing with it later.  We oppose the idea of taking it today.</P>
    <P>I oppose also No. 3 on the Order Paper where, for the seventh time since last December, we have a motion requesting the President to sign a Bill at short notice, presumably today.  I notice, incidentally, that the remarks made the last day about vellum copies of Bills, and so on, apparently do not apply this time. The President will have to sign without the vellum copies which we were told on the Finance Bill were so essential.  I would have thought there would be some slight advantage in holding up the signing of the Bill. From the point of view of those taking part in the negotiations there would still be no law.  It would not become <Col N="681" /> law until it was signed by the President next week.  For that reason alone motion No. 3 seems quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In any event, the whole frame of this Order of Business appears to show that the Government have ceased to pay any regard to the Parliamentary process, the democratic process which this Parliament stands for.  They appear to feel they can take decisions, come bounding into both Houses of the Oireachtas, rush Bills through, and ramrod Bills through in any way they like without giving adequate time for consideration.  For these reasons we cannot agree to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this proposal opposing the inclusion of this item on today's Order of Business. On the question of the principle of the curtailment of discussion and debate, Senator O'Higgins may be correct in so far as the business may not be continued at undue length. The imposition of the guillotine is very rarely justified but, if ever justified, it could only be after attempts by the Opposition to harass the Government and, by means of filibuster or some calculated prolongation of business, to make it impossible for the Government to continue their business.  There could be no question of that happening here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it seems to me that the obvious lack of control is becoming more and more common, not only of the national finances by this Government, but over the business of the Oireachtas.  One reads of the other House going through an enormous amount of work, and so on.  Here we appear to be faced with a position where the Government are attempting to undo the damage they are very obviously facing.  They are in complete disarray in facing great crises, not just with the banks, but the whole economic situation.  They are trying to undo the damage done by the Minister for Finance in his intemperate and improper intervention in this dispute earlier on in the week.  There are all the signs of a Government who have lost their nerve and are attempting <Col N="682" /> to redeem the near disaster situation brought about to a considerable extent by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>They seem to be faced with a crisis on Monday and we are being asked to intervene in order to save the Government from their own mistakes and try to undo the damage.  In the circumstances, Senator Robinson's suggestion should be seriously considered and, if the Government find themselves in continued difficulties, we could reconsider the matter again. On the face of it, it is a bad precedent for a Government to introduce a guillotine in these circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said most of what I want to say with regard to motion No. 1.  I do not want to duplicate discussion on it, assuming the Order of Business is accepted.  Senator Lenihan describes this as Government by bluster, Government by bluff, and a charade.  I recall that the last time it was necessary to move a guillotine motion in this House, Senator Lenihan also described it as a charade.  That was some days before the two by-elections and, as I recall it, Senator Lenihan on that occasion was talking very much for the hustings and, in fact, was calling for a general election.  Today he uses the word &ldquo;charade&rdquo; again, but merely as a residue of his pre-by-election speech.  We do not hear any calls for a general election today, because the two by-elections have taken place in the meanwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told this is a mass of irrelevancy by Senator Lenihan.  That is a point of view, I suppose, but we should remember this situation has not been brought about by, and has not been sought by, the Government. It rests with the Government to deal with the situation which has come into being, to deal with it as a matter of urgency, and to deal with it immediately.  That is what the Government are doing.  The university Senators made what I can only describe as debating points.  Senator Robinson took my normal courtesy in advising the Seanad of the arrangements of the day as a profession that I did not believe this motion was <Col N="683" /> necessary.  I assure Senator Robinson that she is quite mistaken in that.  It was merely as a matter of normal courtesy to Members on both sides of the House that I suggested if business was not concluded we would break from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock for lunch.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident of the ability of Senators facing me and, indeed, of Senator Robinson and Senator Browne as well, to carry on this debate for as long as they like.  No Senator who has any experience of politics will be naive enough to believe that, if we break for lunch from 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock and then decide it is necessary to introduce a guillotine motion at 2.30 p.m., any Opposition members who were opposing that motion would not have the ability to talk it out until 4.30 p.m.  We have had experience here of filibusters, of one speech lasting something over seven hours.  I do not think we should approach a serious motion of this nature&mdash;and it is serious; I agree with Senator Browne on that&mdash;by putting up what could only be regarded as university debating society points.  I wish Senators would consider it seriously.  The motion is necessary for the reasons I have already given.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat again the offer I made at the outset.  Acceptance of this motion does not, as far as I am concerned, rule out reasonable discussion and negotiation and possibly <Col N="684" /> agreement with regard to the actual hour, if it is felt the discussion should proceed beyond 4.30.  My own view is that the majority of Senators would not desire that.  If there is a strong feeling that a minority in the House are being placed under a disadvantage by the curtailment of discussion at 4.30 p.m., that point can be discussed and possibly some extension agreed.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Lenihan, in particular, as a former Minister will appreciate the unfortunate position we are placed in in having to bring forward this motion.  It is not something I like doing.  It is, as a number of Senators correctly pointed out, a curtailment of the liberty of Members of Parliament to discuss anything, so long as they are relevant, for as long as they like. But, circumstances have dictated the necessity for this step&mdash;circumstances which neither I nor anyone on this side of the House is in a position to control.</P>
    <P>Senators who contribute to the discussion may find that, if they cast around for views outside the city of Dublin, their point of view in this matter will not obtain very widespread support. Senators from rural constituencies will find that the feedback to them is that the Government are right, that they should take this step, and that it is essential for the Government to do whatever they can in this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of this Government has much in common with the French Revolution.  They started full of hope and, possibly a certain amount of glory in their own eyes and they are now drawing to a squalid close in a spate of hysterical and indiscriminate guillotining.  It seems that there is no longer any real plan, pattern, or thought in regard to Parliamentary business in this House. I will not comment on what is happening in the other House.  It is really disgraceful, the way the Seanad has been asked to deal with Parliamentary business in the last few years.  We never know when the Seanad will meet again, or what business the House will have, and there are constant changes in relation to the business that is promised and the business which we do not get.  I cannot really blame the Leader of the House or the Whip, because it is quite obvious that they are as much at sea as the rest of the House.  So we have <Col N="686" /> this kind of stop-go approach to Parliamentary business.  The Seanad is sometimes waiting for weeks for business, then we find ourselves with a number of Bills which, almost always, must be put through at once. There is constantly the question of early signing orders, constantly the situation where Bills which have been hanging around in Ministers' offices and in the other House for months, sometimes for years, when they reach this House must be completed in a day or two, and more and more often a guillotine is being applied.  The Government's approach in regard to Parliamentary business is completely inefficient.  It shows the Government's utter incompetence to carry on Parliamentary business, to put business before this House and to get Bills and other measures through the two Houses.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when we look at this Bill coming before the House today, and when we look at the situation in which the Government are asking the Seanad to put this Bill through in a matter of a few hours, it would be wrong to say that we are surprised, because that is what the Seanad has come to expect from the Government. The Seanad no longer expect Bills to reach the House in an orderly fashion with a reasonable length of time to consider the various stages and to have a proper discussion on them. More and more, we find that this is the norm and what should be the norm hardly ever occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing now with a Bill which is or should be relevant to the national wages agreement, to the economic situation, and the question of wages.  This situation, which has existed for the last six months, is a situation for which the Government are responsible and about which they have done virtually nothing apart from making a few half-hearted efforts to deal with it.  Once their bluff was called they retreated very rapidly. Once again we have the situation where, at the last moment, the Government are trying to rush something through.  They are trying to do something now and, as always, are trying to do it in a matter of hours rather than in an orderly fashion over weeks <Col N="687" /> and months as they had plenty of time to do.  It is quite obvious from the urgency with which this Bill is being put through, that it is merely a gesture. The Government will adjourn the Dáil next week and before they beat a hasty retreat from the Dáil, they want to put through a Bill of this kind just to show that they really mean business, and that in this kind of situation they are willing to put through a Bill.  It is only an empty gesture, which highlights the fact that the Government have not faced up to the problem of inflation, to the situation of wages agreement, or to the really drastic problems facing the country.</P>
    <P>We have a situation in regard to the operation of a Government, which have lost control of the economy, of their own members, and have now lost control of Parliamentary business. Consequently, it is not surprising that this Bill and this guillotine motion should be before the House.  All we can do is oppose the Bill and do our best to ensure that a normal pattern is restored to this House.  It must be obvious to everyone that this Bill does not have to go through the House today.  There is absolutely no reason why the Bill should be completed today. If the Government want to make this futile gesture of passing the Bill, then it can be passed before the Houses adjourn for the summer.  However, as has already been pointed out, it would be much more conducive to a settlement if this Bill did not go through, and if it was merely ready to go through.  Those who have any faith in the Bill must concede that, in so far as it has any merit, in so far as it will be of any help in solving the real problems facing the country, it would be better if the Bill did not go through for another week or two.</P>
    <P>The idea of forcing it through the Seanad, the idea of having a gullotine, that it must finish at half-past four today, has no merit, no justification and no sense, when it could be calmly considered in relation to what is happening elsewhere.  If the Government felt that it was really necessary, it could be put through next week or the week after. Leaving aside for the present the <Col N="688" /> merits of the Bill, there is no merit or justification whatsoever in this guillotine.  The justification for it is not apparent to anybody.  It only shows that the Government have, in fact, lost their nerve in this respect and in every other respect.  It is an hysterical attempt to rush through a Bill, which in itself has very little merit.  Even at this stage the Government should reconsider the necessity of having a guillotine motion and should allow the debate on the Bill to proceed in an orderly fashion.  They should consider the problems thrown up by this Bill and the problems still facing the country instead of rushing this Bill through in an hysterical indecent fashion.</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Ryan, I am not certain which side he is on, whether it is the side of the angels or the others.  He complained about what he called the lack of Government control of the situation and yet he proposes to oppose this measure which will empower the Minister for Labour to exercise control if there is a lack of control by the people involved in the banks situation. I am sure the Senator will agree with me that there is a clear contradiction.</P>

      <P>This is an enabling measure which need not come into effect if reason is displayed by the people who are involved in this very, very awkward and undesirable development on the banks front.  The country does not want to see a bank closure.  People have made that perfectly clear over the last week or more.  Because some people apparently have an incapacity to think, they often use my good self as the whipping boy and we have had a clear example of this in attacks which were made on me because I dared quote exhortations issued by the banking community which urged everybody to exercise restraint in income demands.  It has been suggested that this has, in some way or other, exacerbated the situation.</P>
      <P>The facts should be put on record and the diary noted: strike notice was issued on Monday, 14th June after there had been a rejection of an offer which was well above the terms of the proposed national agreement.  That notice was given on Monday, 14th to take effect on the 28th.  In the meantime, it became clear that the banks proposed to make a further unacceptably high offer which was well above the norm which could be operated in our economy this year.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that the legislation is not conducive to a settlement.  A settlement can always be obtained to every dispute <Col N="690" /> by agreeing to whatever is demanded but a settlement of such a kind as is being demanded in this case would do very, very serious damage to the economy and would let this whole incomes structure run riot and out of control.  I gather from what Senator Ryan said that he considers that the Government should not allow that situation to develop, that the Government should adopt all measures possible to prevent that happening.  In this legislation the Government are offering the remedy which was supported by Fianna Fáil twice in the last two years from the Opposition benches and is not out of line with what they proposed on another occasion when they were in office.</P>

On many occasions I pleaded in the House that sufficient time be given to the Seanad to discuss legislation but other people decided that the Seanad would not be given that time.  The Government are not prepared to come to this House and put up with criticism for delays which have been caused by others.  I suggest once again, and this is about the fifth time I have done it, that the Fianna Fáil Senators would do better to speak to the members of their own Oireachtas party in the other House in order to get the legislation here earlier.  Of course, none of that is relevant to this piece of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know what on earth is the thinking behind their efforts.  At one time I know they endeavoured to court popularity and do whatever they thought the majority of the people of Ireland wanted, but apparently now they are in such despair that they do not have much ambition left.  The majority of the people want to see sanity on the pay front in respect of banks and everywhere else as well, and they want to see inflation defeated, and this measure, as soon as it is passed, will enable that to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an enabling Bill.  In itself the passage of this Bill would not mean that the Bill would be applied by the Minister for Labour.  Therefore, it is still open to the people involved in the bank dispute to continue their negotiations in a reasonable and calm manner and I suggest that that could best be done with the withdrawal of strike notice and by continuation of negotiations to produce a formula which would <Col N="693" /> conform with the national norm.  If that is done, the stay which it is suggested the Minister for Labour could apply would be lifted and everybody would be happy, business could continue normally, the banks could remain open and our economy can avoid all the destruction and all the unhappiness and all the unease which will otherwise be inflicted upon it.  This Bill attempts to achieve that objective.</P>

      <P>The sort of performance we have just had from the Minister for Finance illustrates the reason why this Government are drifting into chaos, because this type of unrestrained outburst which we had is a sample of his attacks earlier in the year in the European Economic Commission. We had a further example of it last Thursday week in his intemperate remarks, as published in the newspapers last Friday.  His intemperate remarks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;exacerbated and aggravated a very delicate and sensitive situation.  Of course, everybody wants to see this unfortunate industrial dispute ended.  I would make an appeal to all the parties concerned to ensure that the negotiations taking place now are successful, but the reality of the matter is that this Bill has nothing got to do with the successful outcome of the negotiations that have been taking place as and from 10.30 in another room elsewhere in this city.  The reality is there of the parties concerned meeting under the aegis of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an empty formula.  This Bill is a charade.  This Bill is another example of Government by bluff and bluster, as I said in an earlier debate, and the guillotine motion that we discussing here is part of the same charade.  It is a flexing of Government muscle; flexing muscles in public by pushing motions through the Dáil, pushing motions through the Seanad, motions to chop debate.  That will not settle this industrial dispute or any other industrial dispute and flexing muscles is not the way to run the country or deal with the economy. <Col N="694" /> It was the Minister present who rightly said the horse has galloped away.  The horse of inflation is galloping away at the rate of 20 per cent this year.  The Minister is seeking to close doors that should have been closed two years ago in his handling and management of the general economy.  It is bluff and bluster to come in here with a guillotine motion at this stage when the real parties are meeting elsewhere and the real action is taking place elsewhere and when whatever happens in this House on this Bill is a total irrelevancy.  The Minister is aware of that and it brings Parliament and the whole meaning of Parliament into disrepute to bring in irrelevant legislation that has nothing got to do with the issues at hand and to bring in a guillotine motion to chop debate and push that legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The public should be told loud and clear in straight language that that is what it is all about and I propose to say it here and repeat it right through the course of this day.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance had ample channels to go through.  There are the appropriate negotiations for a settlement of an industrial dispute of this kind.  There are ways and means of doing this sort of thing, not parading the matter in public.  But this Government have an unfortunate habit of parading their thoughts in public when in fact this is a matter on which the Minister for Finance might expend his energies privately and quietly through appropriate channels and in the right way. If energies were bent privately and quietly 24 hours in the day every day towards the solution of this matter it might be solved now.  It will not be solved by ministerial outbursts.  I suggest that ministerial outbursts of any kind in the course of any industrial dispute can do nothing but gravely aggravate the situation.  Indeed, this week we had the spectacle of the Minister for Labour, the appropriate Minister, spending most of the week in Geneva&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was here the Minister should have been during this week, here conducting the diplomatic and private, properly secretive and confidential, negotiations that might have led to a sensitive and delicate handling of the matter and brought it to a successful conclusion.  But the guillotine motion that we are now discussing has been caused by the fact <Col N="696" /> that the Minister for Labour was not here to introduce the Bill on Wednesday. The Minister for Labour had to hustle back from Geneva on Wednesday and take his Bill a day late and accordingly it is now a day late here, and a guillotine motion had to be introduced because of the absence of the Minister for Labour in the earlier part of the week.  That is one of the reasons why we are having a guillotine motion today&mdash;because he chose not to be here to handle the Bill in the Dáil on Wednesday.  He chose instead to relax in Geneva, presiding over some fuddy-duddy meeting that could have been handled by any of his deputy presidents.</P>
      <P>These are the facts.  Along with the Minister for Finance intervening with an outburst, we had the Minister for Labour fiddling away his time in Geneva instead of dealing with emergency legislation.  Of course, I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister for Labour in hopping on planes. He has problems in that respect.  But at the same time, Geneva is not in the Far East.  Geneva is in Europe and Geneva is easily accessable as far as Dublin is concerned and certainly a little haste by the Minister for Labour to return here to his chores of handling the industrial disputes of the country might have meant a more orderly parliamentary debate of this matter.  It would have given an extra day at least of parliamentary time because the Bill was available on Wednesday morning and could have been taken in the Dáil on Wednesday by the Minister for Labour were he not fiddling away in Geneva.</P>
      <P>So we finally got the Bill, anyway, on Thursday when the Minister for Labour deigned to arrive here poste haste by plane and announced dramatically in all the media that he was coming back to handle the growing problem of the bank dispute.  So on Thursday we got the Bill and the Bill is chopped through the Dáil and on Friday we have the Bill being chopped through the Seanad.  We are going through a completely meaningless farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the reality of the matter. We are going through a completely <Col N="697" /> meaningless farce.  Far from contributing to the solution of this very difficult and intractable problem, he is undoubtedly adding further fuel to the fire.  There is no question about that.  With the Minister's intemperate remarks on the introduction of the Bill and the guillotine motion, we have a fine example of playacting, of Nero fiddling while Rome burns while the real fire brigade operation is taking place in another room from 10.30 this morning and will, hopefully, lead to a successful outcome.  Whether this Bill is guillotined or not is irrelevant to the, we hope, successful outcome of these talks.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect I should like to mention.  The real action is, hopefully, the conclusion of the national wage agreement; and the Minister is well aware of this too. There is a delegate meeting of Congress scheduled for 3rd July to consider the ballotting that is taking place at the moment on the part of the various unions.  That is where the real action is taking place.  Why is this Bill being rushed through while the unions at the moment are balloting, hopefully in a positive way, on a national wage agreement, which, hopefully, will emerge at the Congress delegate conference on 3rd July? That is where the real action and issue lie.  Why was this Bill brought in at all?  Any Fianna Fáil legislation of this kind was brought in on the basis of a national wage agreement, the implementation of such an agreement and, hopefully, the adoption of such an agreement.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said earlier is untrue.  This legislation is basically and fundamentally different from Fianna Fáil legislation brought in to deal with the problem of wage agreements. This Bill has nothing to do with the national wage agreement.  This Bill, as it stands before us, seeks to hold the bank officials to the agreement concluded on 4th July, 1975.</P>
    <P>If such was required, a far more realistic approach by the Government would be to await the outcome of the conference&mdash;which will be finally decided tomorrow week&mdash;then consider whether this legislation would be necessary.  The Minister will answer <Col N="698" /> that the bank strike will take place on Monday and he could not await the outcome of the national wage agreement talks.  That point is valid only if this legislation would be effective in dealing with the situation that hopefully may not arise but may arise on Monday.  This legislation can do nothing about it.  If, through misfortune, the talks going on at the moment do not succeed and we proceed to a strike action situation on Monday, what can this legislation do about the matter?  Is this not the reality of it all?</P>
    <P>The only legislation of this kind that can be seen to be effective in the minds of the public, is legislation introduced in the context of the national wage agreement.  Such was the only type of legislation of this kind we ever introduced in the Oireachtas.  This legislation is meaningless. It will not affect the matter one way or the other.  As I said earlier, the real action is taking place elsewhere.  Hopefully, the discussions taking place elsewhere will terminate successfully, there will not be strike action on Monday but there will be a positive response to the ballot on the national wage agreement and then we can proceed on that basis.  This Bill does not contribute one iota to the successful conclusion of the discussions which I desire and I know he desires.  This Bill is irrelevant in that context.</P>
    <P>It is deplorable that Parliament should be reduced to debating irrelelent legislation that cannot affect the situation.  Passing guillotine motions to bring in ineffectual legislation is the sort of thing that brings parliament into disrepute.  It beats Banagher for madness.  It is like the mad tea party in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> or something of that kind.  This is the reality of the situation.  If we stand back and look at the matter clinically and coolly, we will see that this legislation and motion in no way help towards the successful outcome of talks.  That is a fact.  The whole thing is a complete charade, a complete removal from reality.  The introduction of the Bill, together with the Minister's verbal intervention last Thursday <Col N="699" /> week, has done, in my view, positive harm.</P>
    <P>What we want to see working out can, hopefully, be worked out in the course of the present discussions taking place and by a positive response by the trade unions in the ballot on the wage agreement.  They are the matters that count.  Abusing this Parliament by bringing in unnecessary and irrelevant legislation that can do nothing to affect the constructive outcome in regard to the events I have mentioned is only bringing this Parliament into disrepute. We should only bring in legislation that is meaningful, that can affect events, that can positively affect people and improve situations.  That is what legislation should be about.  That is what legislation was meant to be about.  It was not meant to be used to abuse parliament by bringing Government action of bluff and bluster into the legislative process, huffing and puffing from Geneva to Dublin, and huffing and puffing legislation through the Dáil on a Thursday and through the Seanad on a Friday, to pass legislation and get an early signature of the President to a Bill that does not matter a thrawneen in the ultimate solution of events and matters.  That is the reality and the Minister knows I am telling the truth.  There is nothing extravagant in what I am saying.  It is absolute factual, truth.</P>
    <P>The sooner this Government get down to governing and not putting on an appearance of action, an appearance of government the better.  That has been going on now fairly successfully for the past three years.  There is no question about it.  The massive appearance of activity has been there, hopping on and off planes, from Bangkok to Geneva to Dublin, and a great waving of flags, a great deal of headline-making and speech-making. The reality behind the facade is very sad.  The reality is total failure in regard to the economic management of the nation, and in regard to handling industrial relations.  It is going to be left to the good sense of the trade unionists of this country to pull this Government out of the <Col N="700" /> trouble into which they got themselves. The good sense of the Irish trade union movement is what really matters in this context, not the Government. That is the reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House very long.  I support the motion.  Senator Lenihan talked about a charade.  If the motion is a charade, Senator Lenihan's contribution is a farce, and not all the huffing and the puffing come from the Minister's side. I disagree entirely with what Senator Lenihan said&mdash;that the motion before the House will not have any impact on the present situation.  On several occasions Fianna Fáil spokesmen said that the Government took no action, or if they took action, they took too little and too late.  If certain things happened a couple of years ago we would have no inflation and our economy would be running on sound lines.  The people have given in the last few weeks their opinion of whether or not the Government were huffing and puffing or whether they were doing things in what might be described as the proper way.</P>
      <P>However, there is no need for panic. The speeches being made by the Opposition will do more harm in the present situation than anything the Minister for Finance might have said or done during the past week and for which he has been taken to task by the Fianna Fáil spokesmen today.  The Government have shown that they are prepared to take action in a situation such as was envisaged and which we hope does not occur in relation to the banks' dispute.  We all hope a settlement will be arrived at which will be satisfactory to all parties concerned and which will not endanger our economy to any greater extent than exists at present.  We all want to see this settlement instantaneously but we also want to see a Government prepared to take action and outline action, not alone in relation to this dispute but as a guideline to other things and other disputes that may be in the offing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dislike guillotines as much as anybody else.  Parliament and the Opposition have the right to criticise in every way any legislation, but criticism <Col N="701" /> and waffles such as we heard today will do no good in this type of dispute.  It would be better that it did not occur at all.  Too much debate on the state of an economy does not do much good.  The media at all levels are discussing every aspect of our financial and economic problems and the people know more about it sometimes than the Members of the Dáil and Seanad because they have the time to read and listen which many Members of the Oireachtas have not. There is nobody who does not know all the facts of inflation and, indeed, all the lies about inflation that are being circulated as well.  There is no panic.  If one walks around and listens to people in the street, in the pubs and elsewhere one will find that there is no panic.  Our people, in the main, are better off than ever they were before.  I do not know if Fianna Fáil realise this, but this is an absolute fact.  The decision in the two by-elections has shown that our people realised this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>We could spend all day talking like the Leader of the Opposition, that this is unnecessary, it is a charade that will serve no purpose and so on.  We could stand up to justify it but there is no need for a debate on it.  The proper action was taken.  Everybody, the Opposition and Government side know that holidays are about to come and that even Members of the Oireachtas are entitled to holidays.  If one looks into their hearts one will see that everyone agrees that it would be far better to be down the country making hay than to be sitting here listening to the kind of waffle we have heard so far.  I support the motion and I hope the debate will be much shorter than we envisage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill to which this motion relates is, as has already been said by Senator Lenihan, quite irrelevant to the real needs of this position. We are opposing this Bill, and the motion that is consequent on it, because it is wrong in principle.  It deals with one small section at a time when the entire wage situation of this country is in shambles.  If there is one man who, above all others, is responsible for the appalling position in which we <Col N="702" /> find ourselves, particularly on the wages front, it is the Minister for Finance who has just retreated from the House.  He has made it by his own actions, inside and outside his budget, almost impossible to persuade the workers to agree to any kind of a national pay award.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is no longer with us and we are glad to see the Minister for Labour showing an interest in this matter, but the Minister for Finance attempted to suggest that those who oppose this Bill are in some way encouraging a strike in the banks.  That is entirely wrong. Our objections to this Bill, and to this motion, are the very opposite.  The only criterion with regard to a Bill such as this, that the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Finance and the Government should have had regard to but did not, is: does this Bill make a strike more or less likely? One of the reasons we oppose it and this motion is that it makes a strike much more likely.  The concept of this discriminatory Bill is being opposed by the banks, on the one hand, and by the bank officials on the other.  We hope that by the weekend there will be a settlement in the bank situation, but if there is it will not be because of this Bill; it will be in spite of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was rushed through the Dáil yesterday, is being rushed through this House today with guillotine motions framed in the most rigid terms.  What is the hurry?  Why not wait until after 3rd July when we will know what the position is?  What is going to happen if the wage agreement fails, as seems only too likely? What are these norms the Minister is going to lay down for this one section? Is he going to continue to lay down some kind of notional norm of wage increases for this small, numerically speaking, section of the population and allow everyone else to have a sort of free-for-all or does he intend to be that for whatever reason the other sections?  The answer appears to be that for what ever reason the Minister, and the Government, do not want to have any democratic control over whatever they do after July 3rd. It seems that a concerted effort is <Col N="703" /> being made to prevent the Oireachtas, or more particularly, Dáil Éireann, from sitting after 2nd July, after the decision has been taken with regard to the national pay award.</P>
    <P>Next week, for example, in the Dáil the Government are going to attempt to push through eight Bills, a trustee order, a large number of Estimates and have an Adjournment Debate also&mdash;a ludicrous method of legislation, the only purpose apparently being to ensure that by the time the national pay award is agreed, or not agreed, the Dáil will be out of the way and the Government will not have to pay any attention to these democratic forms which they apparently dislike so much.  The adjournment of the Dáil and the adjournment of this House this year, if the Government have their way, will be earlier than has ever happened before, certainly for many years.  Senator Lyons says that one would prefer to be away making hay in this nice weather rather than here.  Of course, anyone would.  But Senators and Deputies have duties to perform and one of their duties appears to me to be that at a time of great national crisis, particularly the great national crisis that will eventuate in the event of the pay agreement not going through, we should all be here in order to discuss the situation that will arise and to hear whatever proposals the Government may have.  The Government are attempting to railroad this Bill through, a Bill which is calculated to make a strike much more likely.  They want to railroad through a large mass of other legislation in the same way in order to ensure that Oireachtas Éireann will not be sitting at a time when a decision is finally made on the pay agreement.</P>
    <P>The haste with this Bill is clearly undesirable.  The Bill itself, of course, is undesirable, but we will deal with that later.  It is calculated to make agreement much more difficult to reach.  It is not needed today.  It is not needed this week.  Now that its terms have been announced by the Minister, all those concerned know the thinking of the Government.  He could perfectly <Col N="704" /> well wait a few days; better still he could wait until after July 3rd. In the event of the pay agreement being turned down on July 3rd, this Bill will become utterly meaningless. It will merely give the Minister the power to impose a wage freeze, but that is all.  It gives no guidance.  There will be no guidance at all as to what kind of a decision with regard to wages in the banking industry could be allowed or would be allowed by the Minister.  The Bill, which is already relevant, will become utterly meaningless.  If it were left over until after July 3rd there would be a much better chance of reaching an agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister, one does not know whether he is using the device referred to by Senator O'Higgins, the Leader of the House, of a university debating point or whether in fact he believes what he is saying.  He protested his innocence when accused by Senator Lenihan of being a very important influence on the question of this dispute in relation to the bank officials.  But it is quite obvious without bothering with what he said that, following his statement on Thursday week last, that the negotiations were simply broken off.  What he had said or whatever he meant to say, the implications to the banks and to the bank officials was that all further negotiations were unimportant or irrelevant because he was taking the man-of-steel line.  The line taken by the banks at the time, which appeared to be likely to concede to the officials something of their demands&mdash;legitimate demands, in my view&mdash;would not be tolerated by him. This had not the effect he thought it would have because the immediate and understandable response was a total break-off and the strike for next Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister cannot exculpate himself or his Government from the crisis situation which was precipitated by his speech.  Further proof of that, indeed, of the influence of the Government and the Minister in this situation, is the very fact that when it was made clear&mdash;and I am sure it was made clear, not only publicly but <Col N="705" /> privately&mdash;to Mr. McDermott that further negotiations on a particular line leading to a settlement, leading to an increase in the pay of the bank officials, would be acceptable to the Government, we had the inevitable climb down from the silly position taken up by the Government on this issue.  This has eventuated in the discussions which are now taking place for a settlement on a situation which has not changed at all.</P>
    <P>The only thing that has changed are the conditions under which they are now being asked to reconsider the whole matter or the possibility of productivity deals and so on.  These possiblities were always there.  Nothing has changed except the Government's decision that they cannot stand on this issue of the bank officials going on strike on Monday, because obviously it is the final crisis to end all the crises of this Government in three deplorable years of misgovernment. For that reason they have simply deferred the day.</P>
    <P>I do not know if you remember the Admiral Byng affair, when the French Admiral said: &ldquo;Why is Admiral Byng hanging from the yardarm&rdquo;? The reply was: &ldquo;He was hanged pour encourager les autres&rdquo;.  This Bill is directed at the national wage agreement. We have this position where, to his eternal disgrace&mdash;I hope he is conscious of that as a trade union official and as a member of the Labour Party committed to public ownership of the banks, the present mis-called Minister for Labour, Mr. O'Leary&mdash;they are now faced with the very serious likelihood of having to bring in a national wage freeze, not simply a bank officials' freeze.  That is why this is an attempt to tell the people who are now considering what they will do at the July TUC delegates' conference what they are to do in relation to the national wage agreement.  It is a last desperate attempt to stave off the final pay-off, which I think most of us believe is going to come anyway, no matter what they do, in relation to what is euphemistically called the free-for-all.</P>
    <P>When it applies to workers it is called a free-for-all.  The ordinary <Col N="706" /> profit private-enterprise system is not called a free-for-all when it applies to profits and dividends.  It is only a free-for-all when it applies to people who are selling their labour, which is the only thing they have to sell.  The general puffing and blowing implicit in this Bill and the absurd proposal that we are limited to discussion until 4.30 this afternoon is bringing into our business a measure of chaotic, precipitated, ill-considered activity which has dominated the whole pattern of this Government's actions throughout their lifetime.</P>
    <P>Relatively recently the present Minister for Labour said that there could be no question of a wage freeze. Now he is bringing one in.  I hope there is a little bit of resistance, whatever is left, by the Labour leadership in the present cabinet, that there is at least some shame left among the Labour people who are in this cabinet. The idea that trade union officials should bring in a wage freeze has been anathema throughout the whole history of the trade union movement. Nobody has spoken more violently against wage freezes than the present Minister for Labour, Deputy O'Leary, in relation to Deputy Colley's time and Mr. Lemass's time.  Now one of our own Ministers in the Labour Party is bringing in this obnoxious anti-Labour, anti-working class law under this Bill.  This situation brings an air of the same confusion into our activities because of the precipitate way in which we have to discuss these measures and it has quite obviously conditioned the whole activity of the Government since its formation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally inside the space of a year we do not like to repeat the same words.  A year ago, when legislation of this nature was introduced I said that if the increased payment being sought or given, or which might be given to workers in any industries was the direct result of their competence and efforts to improve that industry and to make more of it, I would be very hesitant about legislation that might curtail their profits.  This, like so many other situations, is an effort by people who find themselves in a strong position <Col N="707" /> to take more than they have earned or worked for.</P>
      <P>Even on this side of the House we should examine our conscience about legislation like this.  If one goes around the country, it does not take a very astute politician to realise that there is plenty of support for the sort of action the Government are taking. Therefore, the Government feel strengthened in their resolution to carry on with this legislation.  We should also be aware that the bank officials are not the only people in the State who have demanded more than their fair share from time to time.  Governments have not, unfortunately, always found themselves with the same political trump in their hands that they have in relation to this Bill.  We must be especially careful about this sort of legislation since we know quite well that this sort of pressure must be applied selectively and not always with even-handed justice.</P>
      <P>I have met people in the organisation that proposes to go out on strike in a few days who are violently opposed to the line that their organisation is taking.  In supporting the Government and the Minister for Labour, Deputy M. O'Leary, I speak on behalf of a large number of people in the organisation of bank officials who say that this decision did not originally come from the rank and file but was made by people who had a mandate of old in different circumstances and then for the sake of solidarity and all the organisation tactics, ploys, and ideals that we hear so much about they must show solidarity when they come together and are asked for their opinion after decisions have been made.  I would say to these people that there is no point in their saying that they will not close their banks, that they will turn up for work, that they do not believe that what is being done is right. Those people should be more vocal in their organisation and should not allow it to get into the hands of people who delight to fish in troubled waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> The situation in which we find ourselves is that increasingly such decisions as this are being made by a very small number of people who, in an effort to justify the very big salaries they get, are continually stirring up trouble and seeking to promote a spirit of unrest not only among employees but in other sectors. They show no real concern for the living conditions, the environment, social conditions or housing conditions in which members of their organisation find themselves.  They want to have it to say that they were tough and fought and succeeded in getting an increase of £4 a week. They do not care if the people who got it go home and spend the last penny of it drinking whiskey and die of some disease as a result.  They could not care less.  The attitude is they want to be seen to be tough negotiators fighting on behalf of their organisation.  The best people in our country are too busy doing their job well to take note of the situation in which they find themselves by allowing power to slip from their hands into the hands of a small number of people who undertake to negotiate on their behalf.</P>
    <P>National wage agreements worked well for a comparatively short period. They are a good idea in one sense but not in another.  I have always had reservations about them.  All men are not created equal.  In spite of my Christian belief that every man is as good as I am and no man is better, if I go out to play football or do some other thing I must admit there is a better man on the field than I am and no matter how I feel about it, he will be the star and I will not.  When two men go in to do a day's work and one works twice as hard as the other, the man who lazes his day, wastes time, breaks his tools and equipment and spoils his opportunities and those of his comrades should not be paid at the same rate as the man who does a hard, honest day's work. National wage agreements continue the dangerous concept in which the lazy man gets the same rate of pay as the man who works hard.</P>
    <P>This is relevant to the subject we <Col N="709" /> are discussing.  As I said at the outset, I would not support this legislation if I firmly believed that the people who were seeking better conditions and higher remuneration had actually worked for it, earned and deserved it. I would not believe that they should be held down to the lowest common denominator.  If a settlement is reached the Government, who have taken this action and have kept a firm hand and a close watch on the situation, will deserve some of the credit. Many people in the organisation that is about to go on strike believe that the Minister is doing exactly the right thing by bringing this legislation in here today.  It is a pity that they should leave it to people like me to express this view for them.</P>

      <P>I am objecting to this on principle because no section of the community should be singled out for harsh treatment.  Everybody should get the same crack of the whip.  This is legislating for one section of the community as against other sections.  It will worsen a very bad situation and it is ill-timed.  The Minister should have waited until he sees how the national wage agreement will work out.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Browne that this is intended to frighten other sections of the community into not trying to get their just increases.  Even yesterday dozens of price increases were sanctioned.  I cannot understand how people will make ends meet if prices are increasing and wages will not increase accordingly.  For that reason, on the very principles alone, this legislation should not be supported.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words in particular with regard to the fact that the Government are introducing a guillotine motion.  This is at least the third time I can remember <Col N="710" /> that the Government have come along with a guillotine motion in this House to try to stifle discussion and prevent the elected representatives from making their various contributions.  That is very bad form so far as the national Parliament is concerned.  There should be free and open discussion on any Bill that comes before us.  There should be ample time to discuss it.  Those Government Ministers who have been talking about open Government and all the freedoms they were going to give to the people, on many occasions already have come into this House and the other House and have succeeded by weight of numbers in stifling proper discussion on matters such as these.  This is very relevant in this House where there are 11 Members selected by the Taoiseach and put in on top of the rest to make a very clear overall majority.  The result is that any time they feel like it they can guillotine any discussion in the House.  That is wrong.  This House was set up under the Constitution and it has a very important part to play.  It has been conceded by both Ministers and Members that the contributions and debates have been of a very high standard down the years.  In an important issue such as this it is fundamentally wrong that the first item we have this morning should be a guillotine motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators were requested to attend today; they knew what business was before the House&mdash;that does not happen very often&mdash;and it was wrong of the Government to have interfered. They should have allowed the debate to proceed in the normal way.  Perhaps they were afraid of the unpalatable things which might be said of their performance. The fact that there is a Bill to curb wage increases is an indication of the approach of the Government to remuneration, to prices and to the economy in general.  Every sector&mdash; whether the employed or the unemployed is being burdened with extra taxation and with weekly, if not daily increases in the price of practically every commodity used in households. The value of money is decreasing so rapidly that any increase given will be gobbled up in inflation.  As usual, the Government will lay the blame on <Col N="711" /> the poor Arabs, never admitting that they are responsible for the state of the economy.  I will speak on the Bill when it is before us but at this stage I want to protest strongly against the action of the Government in introducing a guillotine motion on this important subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

      <P>I was slow to rise because I assumed having listened to the last two speakers that the three other remaining Members of the Fianna Fáil Party would read from the same text which has been read to the House throughout this morning's discussion. This passion for rational discussion of the details of Bills which so marks the contributions of Fianna Fáil: to the debates in this House can be discovered from examination of the Committee Stages of many Bills.  I remember a Bill which was before the House not too long ago and until it had reached section 120 I was the only contributor to the debate, apart from the Minister concerned.  Suddenly, a mischievous thing in me said to Fianna Fáil: &ldquo;They divided on this section in the Dáil, you know.  Are you interested enough to pay attention to it now that it is before the Seanad&rdquo;?  A contribution was then made.  However, the contribution did not relate to the section. What have we been doing this morning?  According to my calculations, before I stood up we have devoted over one-third of the time available for debate today to a proposal to reduce the time available for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to that Senator, let him be as <Col N="712" /> resistant to provocation now as I was when I had to listen to the complaint about inability to discuss a Bill which was described as irrelevant.  If it is irrelevant, what do Fianna Fáil want to discuss?  If the real decisions are being made elsewhere, if this is all a charade, why participate in it?  This is very unfortunate language from people who talk about this as a motion damaging democracy to use the phrase which Senator Noel Browne generally uses and which he used again today.  The Senator usually talks about a charade but the charade he is referring to is the charade of democracy.</P>
      <P>I intend to make only one point. I do not know what the historian will finally say was the rightness or wrongness of introducing this measure.  I merely face the fact that all Ireland knows we are faced with the possibility of a damaging bank strike on Monday.  I pray with all those on this side of the House that it does not take place but I wonder if much thought was given on the opposite side as to whether any of their contributions would be helpful in that matter. Senator Ryan, to my surprise, said that we were in the strange situation of the French Revolution, where we started off with great glory and were now dithering down to disgrace.  It is a strange position for a member of a republican party to be complaining about the French Revolution.  If the Government are inaugurating something equivalent to the French Revolution in Ireland, thanks be to God, if it will have the final effect on Ireland the French Revolution had on the whole world.  But I doubt if that is quite the image that I would take from the actual performance.  It was a strange contribution to come from Senator Ryan, a Senator who normally makes very useful contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was described by Senator Lenihan in his repetitious speech, which he threatens to repeat on the two other motions that are yet to come before the House, as an empty formula.  The Senator could remain extremely silent about empty formulae, he could be silent on the whole Bill if it is an empty formula.  If it <Col N="713" /> is an empty formula we can pass it and forget about it.</P>
    <P>There are sections in the Bill which require serious attention.  The Bill is an enabling one and contains only one important element which has not been referred to by any Senator who has contributed, that is, the Title to the Bill which is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Regulation of Banks (Remuneration and Conditions of Employment) (Temporary Provisions) Bill, An Act to provide in the national interest&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senator Yeats will not remain silent, despite his experience in the Chair for a long period of time.  He should remember that he is not entitled to make remarks of that kind when I am making a contribution on the desirability of getting quickly to a discussion and letting the House hear from the Senators. Is it the proposal that they would spend so long at Second Stage that they will not debate any section of Committee Stage?  I must confess I was depressed because it is desirable and in the national interest that the <Col N="714" /> Seanad should hold itself forth as a worthy institution, capable of good discussion of real merit and not be a poor reflection of Dáil Éireann, as it has proved this morning from the contributions of people I am looking at this moment.  That is not good for the country nor is it good for the country if there is a French Revolution situation such as Senator Eoin Ryan graphically described it.  We do not see a Napoleon emerging from the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is not good for the country that Fianna Fáil are such an unpresentable party; that dismayed though many of the people are with the harsh conditions in which many of them must live, dismayed and baffled by the choice of the correct solution, they cannot see in the only Opposition party any possible alternative to this Government.  They will see it as a less possible alternative after this morning's debate and if this debate continues throughout the rest of the day that view will be reinforced.</P>
      <P>To me as a democrat who believes that democracy is not a charade, that is undesirable.  I recommend to the House the guillotine motion which has been proposed.</P>

      <Col N="716" /> On this Second Stage of the Regulation of Banks (Remuneration and Conditions of Employment) (Temporary Provisions) Bill, Senators were saying this morning it is a measure that is simple in its provisions though not in the consequences of the terms of the Bill before us.  Therefore, I propose to be very brief on the content of the Bill and propose simply to give some of the objectives of the Bill and a brief description of it.</P>
    <P>While the final decision on whether or not we will have a national agreement awaits the outcome of the Special Delegate Conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 3rd July next, no-one can seriously doubt that participants in wage negotiations over the next few weeks must consider seriously the impact that their settlements might have on the outcome of that important meeting.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware that balloting on that agreement is in progress.  In fact, members of the largest union in the country, the ITGWU, began balloting yesterday.  It will be understood that it is important to ensure that any current negotiations should not in their consequences influence adversely the outcome of the national ballot on the agreement.</P>
    <P>It cannot be said too often that the reduction of the present unacceptably high unemployment figures requires that our industrial costs be kept as low as possible so that our economy can participate as early as possible on the most advantageous terms possible in the export markets with our trading partners in the EEC.  I would not claim that wage increases are the sole cause of cost increases but they do form a significant proportion.</P>
    <P>The Bill in no way impedes continuation of negotiations between the banks and their employees for a new 1976 bank pay agreement.  As Senators are aware, such negotiations are continuing within the Banks' Joint Industrial Council.  They resume this afternoon. I am sure that I express the wish of all Senators when I say that a bank strike at this juncture can do grievous damage to the economy at this critical point in our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> This Bill is purely a holding operation for a limited period.  It may only come into operation on a day to be appointed by Order and will in any event expire on 30th November, 1976, or on an earlier date to be appointed by me.  The aim of this holding operation is to ensure that the pay agreement to be negotiated by the banks and their staffs will conform generally with the pattern of settlements emerging for other workers.  Contravention or failure by the banks to comply with the terms of any Orders made by me under the Bill will constitute an offence which would render the banks on conviction, liable to heavy fines.  There are no penalties of any sort directed against bank employees or their representatives.  I want to stress this as a fundamental difference from legislation prepared by our predecessors when in office. They had penalties directed against bank employees in their legislation. We do not have any such penalties.</P>
    <P>I would take this opportunity of once more asking the IBOA to withdraw their strike notice to allow time for a review of the difficulties which have arisen in the course of the present negotiations.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make an Order bringing the Act into operation. Whether I must do so or not will depend on the banks and the IBOA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to make it quite clear that as far as the Fianna Fáil Party are concerned we feel strongly that there should be, hopefully today or tomorrow or as soon as possible, a resolution of the present difficulties that exist between the banks and their employees.  It is quite clear that in the present economic situation of the country a bank strike for any length of time would be disastrous as far as the economy is concerned.  I am hopefully certain that good sense will prevail and that is the real hope in this matter.  The real action in this matter is not taking place in the Oireachtas; it is taking place elsewhere in Dublin at the present time in the course of what I should hope will be constructive and positive negotiations under the aegis <Col N="718" /> of the Labour Court between the parties concerned in the dispute.</P>
      <P>That brings me to a further point.  Everybody concerned with the economic improvement of the country would wish that progress could be made in the present balloting taking place in the various trade unions, the results of which will emerge at the special delegate conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on July 3rd.  It is in that area that all of us who are thinking in terms of the future development of the economy would hope for a positive result.  That is where the real action is.</P>
      <P>Where our party dispute with the Government and take very serious issue with them is with regard to the whole purpose of the type of legislation that is before the Seanad today and was before the Dáil yesterday.  In the context of what I am talking about, this legislation does not add one iota to a solution of the basic problems of securing a settlement of the banks dispute and of achieving a national wage agreement in so far as the country at large is concerned.  On the contrary, it has had a negative effect.</P>
      <P>A combination of this Bill and the mischievous outburst on the part of the Minister for Finance last Thursday week, as reported in the media last Friday, has been a contributing factor to fuelling the situation and making a very serious situation a lot worse.  It is on that solid basis that we in the Fianna Fáil Party raise serious objection to the Government's handling of the whole area of wage agreement, industrial peace and indeed the whole performance in regard to management of the economy generally. There has been far too much bluff and bluster on the part of the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Finance in particular and on the part of the Government generally in regard to these basic issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point now in talking about the need for restraint and the need to handle the economy properly when fundamentally our present inflation rate of 20 per cent for the present year, on top of the inflation <Col N="719" /> of last year, has been basically caused by the Government's inability to face up to the economic reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>This inability was never more clearly demonstrated than in May last year when the Government allowed a wage agreement to be negotiated without themselves taking any positive part.  One month later the Minister for Finance said the wage agreement was unduly generous and he brought in a budget to claw back the effects of that wage agreement and compensate for an inflation rate. There was a complete reversal of policy between May and June of 1975.  These are facts which cannot be denied or gainsaid.  That is part of the pattern in the handling of the wage situation and part of the pattern in the handling of the whole management of the economy by the Government. It is a question of a stop-go policy, a question of <i>laissez faire</i> at one stage, letting the employers and unions work it out and, when they work it out without any supervision by the Government, the Government then try to step in a month later when the damage is done.</P>
    <P>Is it not quite evident that as the major employer first of all and, secondly, as having the responsibility in this modern age for the overall management of the economy, the Government should participate at a very early stage in the whole process leading up to the preparation and the establishment of a national wage agreement?  The absence of the Government last year in the early stages of negotiation triggered off this situation. They adopted a reverse gear attitude compared to the attitude earlier of letting it rip between the employers and the trade unions.  From recent statements made by Government Ministers I gather they realise the folly of that and it is now agreed &mdash;and I should like clarification of this from the Minister for Labour&mdash; the Government will have to take a more positive attitude and approach in relation to the present and any future wage agreements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> Government involvement at a very early stage is fundamental if wage agreements are to be an important ingredient in the attempt to get out of the inflationary spiral and to get into a full employment situation.  If the Government are serious in their overall efforts to have some degree of economic management in order to achieve the goal of full employment, it is obvious they must be seriously involved at a very early stage in the preparation of national wage agreements&mdash;that is, if what the Minister said today in his opening remarks is a serious indication of what he intends. He emphasised the importance in regard to the economy, in regard to employment and exports of ensuring that industrial costs are kept as low as possible and that, of course, involves wage costs as well as other costs.</P>
    <P>That is where the basic mishandling of this situation started.  It is a continuing situation.  A Bill has been introduced into the Dáil and it is now before us.  It was processed through the Dáil by a guillotine motion and is being processed through here by a guillotine motion as well.  I should like to ask the Minister candidly: what does this Bill add to the solution of the two basic problems affecting us now?  The two basic problems are settling the bank dispute and ensuring a national wage agreement will eventuate.  What does this Bill add to that in any way short of being part of a game of bluff and bluster to give an appearance of activity on the part of the Government.  I do not think that is desirable on many grounds.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is an abuse of Parliament. It brings the Dáil and Seanad into very serious disrepute to introduce here legislation which is not serious legislation at all.  Legislation, basically, should be concerned with matters for economic, social, political improvement within our community. This is elementary civics if you like. This is what legislation is all about. We are reducing the legislative process by bringing in a Bill of this kind which has absolutely no relevance at all to the current problems I have just spoken of.  It does not matter one iota <Col N="721" /> whether this Bill is passed or not either to the solution of the bank dispute, or the emergence of a national wage agreement.  This Bill is entirely irrelevant to the solution of those two problems.  I should like to hear the Minister on that.  Can he give a single idea which has not emerged heretofore in the Dáil or in his opening speech? Can he give us, as sensible thinkers here in this House of the Oireachtas, some indication as to the value of this Bill if it becomes law by early signature of the President?</P>
    <P>The first problem will be settled, I hope, by negotiations today or tomorrow. The second problem will be settled by ballot on the part of the trade unionists over the next few days. What will this Bill do?  What is the purpose of this Bill?  This is what makes Parliament appear to many people to be an irrelevant institution today.  No Bill should be brought into either House of the Oireachtas unless it means something in the way of social improvement, or economic improvement, or political improvement. This Bill means nothing.  It is a complete non-event.</P>
    <P>I was critical of the Minister for Labour earlier on in relation to the guillotine motion.  Despite the apparent urgency of the guillotine motion today in the Seanad and yesterday in the Dáil the Minister for Labour remained on in Geneva engaging in chairing capacities which, I am sure, could have been delegated to the Deputy President of the ILO or someone like that.  The Minister may have got his priorities right.  The Bill did not really matter a damn, so why should he fly back to Ireland?  On reflection, he was probably right because, if the Bill was a serious Bill, I expect he would have been here on Wednesday and there might not have been any need for a guillotine motion.  He could have engaged in meaningful discussions with the bank officials, the usual round of private, diplomatic and sensible negotiations and discussions which, in the last analysis, settle all these problems.</P>
    <P>The problem will not be settled by outbursts from the Minister for Finance, such as his outburst on <Col N="722" /> Thursday week in a very delicate and sensitive situation.  They will not be settled by the withdrawal syndrome of the Minister for Labour in Switzerland. That is not the way you settle disputes.  You do not settle disputes by making speeches, or withdrawing from the scene, or bringing in Bills which mean nothing.  Disputes are settled by hard behind-the-scenes work.  Senator Kennedy is here and no man knows that better than he.  It is hard slogging behind-the-scenes work which settles industrial disputes.  You do not settle an industrial dispute by bringing a Bill into the Dáil and Seanad with a fanfare of trumpets and noise and bombast.  I hope the industrial dispute will be settled elsewhere today by sensible people sitting around a table negotiating something.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister for Labour and his officials and, indeed, the whole Government should have been engaged very actively and, hopefully, productively in this sort of effort behind the scenes without headline and without bombast over the past few weeks.  I was critical of the Minister for Labour, as I said earlier on, in that he was absent on Wednesday and the Bill had to be taken in a rush in the Dáil on Thursday and then rushed to the Seanad, but maybe he had his priorities right.  Maybe he recognises what I recognise, that this Bill means nothing, and that whether it becomes law or not it is not going to contribute one iota to a settlement of the basic issues that I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows I am telling the truth.  Indeed, anybody here in this House who knows something about labour negotiations knows well that I am telling the truth.  You cannot legislate for the settlement of matters of this kind or settle them by unwarranted outbursts on the part of senior Ministers in the public press. You settle these matters by hard slogging behind the scenes.  You certainly do not settle them by absence but by being there and working on them to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Bill that are ridiculous.  It is laughable to <Col N="723" /> bring in a Bill like this having regard to the sort of discussions that are going on in another rooms at the moment, a Bill that, under section 3 subsection (7) seeks to relate the pay of bank officials to the agreement of the 7th July, 1975.  Who is being real or unreal? This is like the mad tea party in <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> Everything is turned upsidedown.  This Bill suggests that this Oireachtas can relate bank officials' salaries to the agreement of the 7th July, 1975.  The only Bill of this kind that Fianna Fáil ever introduced was in the context of a national wage agreement and the only reality in a Bill of this kind is in the context of a national wage agreement achieved voluntarily by ballot on the part of the trade unions.  That legislation can then validly seek to prevent any wildcat departure from that decision. It is only in such a context as that that legislation of this kind can be introduced or should be introduced. We will know the decision on that agreement tomorrow week after free democratic exercise of the vote by trade unionists.  Then the Government can sit back and consider the situation and bring in the legislation they think fit if the wrong thing happens, and I would make an appeal here that a positive decision be made by trade unionists.  I say that in a constructive spirit, because it is important that we should have a constructive attitude towards that problem.  But it is only in that context that legislation is valid.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous to bring in this charade of legislation, seeking to relate the pay of bank officials back to an agreement of last year that is already out the door as far as agreement and discussion are concerned.  Does the Minister think seriously that the question of reverting to the agreement of May last year is an issue in the discussion taking place today between the parties to the bank dispute?  It is comic when you see the realities of the situation.  Here we are as a serious House, the National Parliament, debating a Bill that is completely irrelevant, that does not arise in the context of people who are seriously working at trying to arrive at a formula that may <Col N="724" /> settle the matter between now and Monday.</P>

      <P>I am long enough around to know that fines and penalties are not the answer to problems either.  That is the rock the Minister will perish on if he thinks that will solve any problems.  Fines and penalties are irrelevant in this context, and if the Minister is getting into this autocratic vein now, he had better rein in.  The Minister knows well that fines and penalties directed at anybody settle no industrial dispute of any kind.  I do not think that legislation does either.  Legislation in this area can only work in the context of a national wage agreement.  It cannot work in this way, directed at a particular section in advance of the ultimate decision on negotiations taking place, and in advance of the result of the ballot among trade unionists. Legislation is a complete charade, a complete waste of time, and an irrelevancy.  As I said, the Minister for Labour probably recognised that and decided to leisure on in Geneva for another day rather than come back to introduce it to the Dáil.  It does not matter one iota and it will contribute nothing whatever to the settlement of the basic issues that are under discussion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be putting down amendments on Committee Stage and these amendments will be designed to ensure that some reality is brought into the Bill.  The basic reality we want to import into the Bill is to make it contingent on a national pay agreement, a national pay award.  It is totally unreal to try to pin back these employees to an agreement of last year.  We want to make this Bill subject to a pay agreement situation and subject to that alone.  In our view, <Col N="725" /> that is the only way this Bill can be made realistic.  It is highly unrealistic as it stands at present and does not cope in any way with the fundamental problems of which I speak.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that in this situation the Government appear to be acting in this frivolous manner, because this is very serious.  The whole question of our economy at the moment is very serious.  The whole question of industrial peace is very serious.  The whole question of employment is very serious. It is time for serious debate, a time for serious and considered action. It is not a time for playing games, for playing political games.  There is one thing the present Government have been guilty of over the past few years. I say this in a considered way and I have said it before.  They are guilty of playing games for the public, putting on an appearance of action, putting on a bluff and bluster show.  Of all the Bills that have come before the House, this Bill is the most symptomatic of that sort of attitude and frame of mind.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to convey to the public that the Government are doing something about the bank strike.  That is putting it bluntly. Indeed, it was said in so many blunt words this morning by the Minister for Finance, when he said&mdash;I am paraphrasing his words&mdash;that we in Fianna Fáil had misjudged the political situation.  The public were all against the bank officials and that we were very foolish in opposing this Bill because the public were against the bank officials.  That is symptomatic of the attitude of mind of which I speak.  We are for industrial peace and for a settlement of this issue. The Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour are trying to convey to the public that the Government are trying to settle the bank strike.  This Bill has got nothing to do with that.  This Bill is an irrelevancy.</P>
    <P>The proposed bank strike will be settled hopefully today elsewhere by sensible people hammering out some formula.  The Government are not going to settle the bank strike.  The <Col N="726" /> Government are actually aggravating the bank strike (a) by the Minister for Finance's statement on Thursday week and (b) by the production of this legislation.  Over the last three-and-a-half years the Government have been all the time working for optics which is not good government and that has got us into our present economic situation.  Working for optics has resulted in the unemployment situation standing as it is at over 120,000 people. Working for optics has us in our budgetary difficulty and in this present situation.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about ensuring that in some way we get the economy going in an ordered manner by consultation in good time with all the interests concerned.  The interests concerned are the people who will fundamentally get it going and not the Government.  It is not a matter of Government action.  Legislation will not settle this industrial dispute.  This is a matter for the Government using all their action behind the scenes in hard slogging work in negotiations and discussions with the interests concerned. It is not a matter for the appearance of Government action in the form of legislation that is meaningless.  Not alone is this meaningless legislation negative but it is positively harmful in the present context.  In so far as one can get any <i>rationale</i> in regard to its production in the Oireachtas it is designed purely for optics purposes.  It is a public relations exercise, to put it bluntly, to con the public into the view that the Government are producing legislation to settle the bank strike.  That is what it is designed to do.  As far as the public are concerned the bank strike, proposed to start on Monday, will be settled elsewhere.  The national wage agreement will eventuate as a result of sensible decisions on the part of trade unions.  The Government will not settle either by the introduction of phoney legislation that is meaningless and irrelevant.  If it was just that it would be a comic opera as the Minister for Labour apparently thought, when he did not appear until Thursday and we could have a laugh at it.  If it was that it would be harmless enough.</P>

      <P>If it was merely a matter of comedy on the part of the Government it would not be that serious.  It would be just a matter of going through motions in order to con the public.  If we all knew this was a bit of gainsmanship, as it were, on the part of the Government it would not be too serious.  But, in my view two actions have positively and harmfully aggravated the situation&mdash; the Minister for Finance blasting off on Thursday week and the Government generally, through the Minister for Labour, bringing in this legislation. Both actions have served to harden attitudes in this dispute, to impede sensible negotiations and discussions. They are the sort of actions which should not be taken by a Government concerned about their business.  A Government concerned about their business would not have engaged in any public action, public manifestations or legislation.  They would have brought these people together to talk, and by talking would make sure that a formula would be worked out, a formula which will hopefully, be worked out today or tomorrow by the sensible people who are engaged in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should have been engaged in getting the people into that situation weeks ago.  They should not have been engaged in headline hunting or legislation production, or going for the optics, or public relations, but in solid hard work.  It is in that area that this Government have fallen down totally, not just in this matter, but right across the board in every aspect of Government activity. <Col N="728" /> Appearance is not the answer.  The work must be done.  The work is not done in Geneva or elsewhere but it is done here by the Government getting down to work and not engaging in the optics of public relations.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a lot of nonsense.  It is a total irrelevancy and does not matter one single bit as far as the solution of this problem is concerned, or as far as the greater problem of getting a pay agreement generally is concerned.  I hope both of these matters will be settled by the sensible people concerned.  I only deplore the fact that the Houses of the Oireachtas have been debased and brought into disrepute by the Government bringing in legislation that is irrelevant from the legislative and practical point of view of settling the matters at hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate the reasons which activated the Minister when introducing this measure. Nonetheless, this Bill gives some cause for anxiety not only to bank employees but to workers in general.  The parties to the various national wage agreements which have operated since 1970 and which have been negotiated through the Employer/Labour Conference are, on the one hand, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and, on the other hand, various employers organisations making up the Federated Union of Employers, the Building and Construction Federation, some State and semi-State companies and, finally, the Government.  The Government are represented on the Employer/Labour Conference merely in their capacity as employers.  There are some workers' organisations, including the Irish Bank Officials' Association, not affiliated with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  On that score, I suppose, the association may claim with some justification that they are not bound by the terms of any national wage agreement.  Similarly there are some employers' organisations and some individual employers not associated with any of the employers' organisations I mentioned. Nevertheless, the vast majority of employers and workers are represented either directly or indirectly on <Col N="729" /> the Employer/Labour Conference. Consequently they are bound to observe any national wage agreement emanating from that body.</P>
      <P>It is clear beyond doubt that if any small minority group of workers or employers are enabled to negotiate terms over and above those set out in a national wage agreement, or if either workers or employers are enabled to take industrial action in support of such claims, then it follows that a national wage agreement will fall to the ground and a free-for-all situation will ensue.  That is the main justification for this Bill; that was the justification for the previous legislation, introduced some two years ago, governing the fixing of bank employees' salaries.</P>
      <P>The situation now is entirely different.  In the previous case, the Bill was introduced in order to prevent the banks from increasing salaries in excess of the terms of a currently operative national wage agreement.  For that reason, I voted for the Bill at the time although I had some doubts about it even then because in principle, I did not believe then, and I do not believe now, that the Government&mdash;or any Government &mdash;notwithstanding the economic circumstances, should be legally empowered to limit the earnings of any group of workers, particularly if the embargo does not embrace all incomes, including profits, prices, rates, rents and so on.  However, the Minister, on balance, was fully justified in introducing that measure on that occasion.  The position in the present case is different, in that, the national wage agreement has expired in respect of bank employees.  The local agreement between the banks and the association has also terminated.  Consequently, both the banks and the bank employees may claim that, legally, they are fully entitled to negotiate without any restrictions whatsoever.  I suppose this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the banks and the bank employees are not alone in this.  In addition to bank employees and the banks, as employers, the wage agreements of tens of thousands of workers have terminated, notably in the building <Col N="730" /> and construction industry.  In that industry the national agreement expired, on 31st March last, more than three months ago.  In this case, the building workers and the tens of thousands of other workers whose agreements have terminated are prepared to wait, to hold their hand as it were, until the national situation has been clarified on 3rd July.  I do not see any reason why the bank employees should not do likewise.</P>
    <P>There may be no legal restriction on negotiations being carried on for amounts in excess of amounts set out in the proposed national wages agreement but there is a moral obligation. First of all, there is a moral obligation on the banks themselves not to negotiate, pending a final outcome on 3rd July, beyond the financial terms set out in the proposed national wage agreement.  Also, there is a moral obligation on bank employees not to take industrial action until the situation has been clarified.  It is pertinent to say this, that when we talk about bank employees we are inclined to forget that there are other workers employed by banks, porters, cleaners and maintenance workers who are also covered by agreements. They, too, like the building workers and others are quite prepared to await clarification of the national situation in a few days' time.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to bank employees not to run the country into possible disaster.  In asking them to do that, I want to assure them, in my capacity as an officer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that congress has their interests at heart and it is their desire that bank employees and all workers everywhere should benefit to the utmost in return for the value of their contribution to society.  I have no doubt that bank employees, of all descriptions, do a good deal for the citizens.</P>
    <P>The bank officials' association is not affiliated to congress.  It is also the desire of congress that bank officials should take their place with the organised workers of the country to fight for their rights; to fight in the only possible way that their rights can be obtained in full.  In this connection, <Col N="731" /> the Seanad is entitled to at least two assurances from the Minister.  One assurance is that if the proposals for a new national wage agreement are not ratified on 3rd July and, it follows that no national wage agreement is possible, this Bill would not be invoked. If there is no national wage agreement, if there is a free-for-all it will apply to everybody.  In a free-for-all situation bank officials should not be singled out for special attention.</P>
    <P>Bank employees, the Government and the whole country are the victims of the banking system.  Until that system is changed, until such time as the financial affairs of the country are taken out of the hands of private people&mdash;foreign private people in many cases&mdash;the difficulties we are speaking about today and even greater difficulties are bound to arise from time to time.  I want the Minister to give the Seanad an assurance that the Government will again consider the desirability of nationalising the banking system.  I want him to pay particular attention to a motion in this regard, adopted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions at their annual conference last year.  If I may, I should like to read part of that motion.  It reads:</P>
    <P>...Congress considers that the abolition of the glaring inequity in the distribution of wealth in Ireland and the unrestricted continuance of the practice whereby speculators can amass immense capital gains often contributing nothing to the community and sometimes causing the closure of productive enterprises must now be placed among the highest priorities of national policy. Congress notes with particular concern the part played by the banking system in financing to its own profit and without regard to the community interest a large number of these speculation deals thereby prejudicing employment, fostering the socially undesirable transfer of yet more wealth to the wealthy and making a significant contribution to increased inflation causing the Government in advance of the adoption of a policy of bank nationalisation <Col N="732" /> to take appropriate measures to secure that (a) the banks' policies on lending are brought within the terms of socially acceptable policy directives and (b) that the excess profits of the banking system are used to finance at low or nil rates of interest socially desirable objectives. Such measures should apply to all banks operating within the country including those with headquarters outside the State.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the organised workers within the country, including those with headquarters outside the State.  That is the view of the organised workers of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a breath of fresh air to hear the motion of Congress read out by Senator Kennedy. Is it not one of the greatest tragedies in the past 40 or 50 years of Irish public life that a Labour Minister should find himself in Government and find that in attempting to introduce a Bill effectively bringing about a wages standstill that he should have to be reminded by his trade union and party colleagues that of course that kind of motion had also been accepted by his own Labour Party in annual conference. Only last night the Dublin Regional Council accepted unanimously that the whole question of the banks is one which should be dealt with once and for all by this Government.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this whole question of the banks is central to the whole question of the authority, the quality of society and life within that society.  As far as I am concerned, it goes back 30 years when I recall the long running farce of the banks and the control of the banks.  In those days there was gross exploitation of the bank employees.  It first came to my knowledge when an attempt was made to get me to acquiesce to a Government order allowing for the closure of the banks and I declined to do so.  It is regrettable to recall that on that occasion, too, the person asking me to consent to what I considered to be a lock-out of the employees was a Labour Leader, the late Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Over the years I have continued to take a stand on the right of the employee to look for whatever he can get for the only commodity which he has for sale, that is, his labour. It does not matter to me but I regret that the Bank Officials' Association are not a member of Congress, in their own interests.  They should be but that is their own business.  Quite obviously divided, they can be more easily handled than if united within congress.  At the same time, in the great divide between the worker and employer I am on the side of the worker and have been consistently through all the proposals passing through this House whether initiated by the present Government or the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Some of my revolutionary socalist colleagues put the rather tenuous argument to me recently that I was wrong to oppose the idea of coalition.  The fact of the matter is that this Coalition are disclosing to the public, more rapidly than any other Government or Coalition, the inherent defects in the whole system of monopoly capitalism.  All the talk from both Government and Opposition, Senators Eoin Ryan and Alexis Fitzgerald, about the French Revolution and the sound of the tumbrils, is becoming more and more apposite in the context of western monopoly capitalism as we hear of the evolution of Euro-Communism and the advance of very radical views in all the once very conservative countries, particularly Italy.  To a certain extent France, Portugal and to some extent Spain, the beginning of what one hopes to be the effect of the collapse of one kind of corrupt western democracy.  The western democracies are corrupt and I dissent from Senator Alexis FitzGerald's portrayal of these places as democracies.  There is no demoracy in a society in which a literate electorate create a community in which a tiny minority own three-quarters of the wealth of that community.  There is obviously something very defective with that society.</P>
    <P>For that reason I felt that Senator Alexis FitzGerald was reminiscent of the ladies watching the tumbrils and <Col N="734" /> the gullotine, knitting away happily as they felt the decapitations of the then ruling class, the aristocracy, was in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The proposal that this kind of thing is in the national interest seems to me to be equally irrelevant in so far as this will not solve anything.  There is a certain amount of sense in Senator Lenihan's point that this Bill is absurd because the proposals in it are totally unworkable.  Whatever about leaving it open for some kind of settlement on a national wage level, the attempt to bring it back and to freeze prices at the 1975 level is obviously quite untenable.</P>
    <P>The point at the centre of this whole discussion is, of course, this question of attempting to operate a free enterprise economy&mdash;to try to operate that in two completely separate and conflicting compartments.  On one hand one has the kind of legislation that goes through the House easily with both Government and Opposition consent. That is in relation to the distribution of the enormous wealth involved in our new materials, oil, gas, minerals and raw materials of various kinds.</P>
    <P>Last week's amendment to the Sweeps Act gave away very considerable sums without any serious questioning as to the merits of the demands for this great wealth by a handful of private individuals in our society. Quite obviously, no restrictions whatever are placed on the amount of money which can be taken out of these particular enterprises.  There are others, of course, which are run on much the same lines.  There is the operation of cartels in order to exploit the captive public with price fixing and so on.  There is this one attitude to a minority within our society where there is, in fact, free collective bargaining, where there is the dynamic of private enterprise, where people are let loose to make whatever they can.  They are patted on the back and encouraged to do this by the whole system.  All the papers, <i>The Irish Independent, The Irish Press</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> will invariably congratulate the industrialist, the merchant prince, the private property exploiter, <Col N="735" /> if they make large profits, if they show big dividends.  If they are able to show that they made more than last year they are complimented for their enterprise. On the other hand, we have the worker who is imprisoned within what is now being described as the national norm.  To this extent I appreciate the hardships involved in what is called the free-for-all because, obviously, the more powerful unions will get more than the less powerful unions.  It seems to me that it is implicit in the acceptance of the concept of private enterprise capitalism, that this selfish driving power force in human relations must be free to everybody.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the private enterprise system, but I find it so confusing, conflicting or hypocritical for a Government to say that they stand or fall on the principles of free enterprise capitalism.  When a group within that society, whoever they may be&mdash;in this case the bank officials&mdash;say: &ldquo;we have our labour, we are skilled labourers of a particular kind, we are doing the service which we feel should be paid at a particular level, you cannot do it without us&rdquo;, the Government step in and say this must not be so. I have never known them to step in and say that there should be any limitation on the enormous wealth that is made in various other ways.</P>
    <P>This whole process of free collective bargaining, free-for-all, is essentially a selfish device and can cause great human unhappiness.  As I say, it is an inescapable component of the concept of free enterprise capitalism.  It has its educative effect, it has its educative influence in relation to the workers because as they see enormous money being built up on one side and relatively little going to them, this becomes the in-built conflict of capitalism, where wages and salaries are, to the employer, profits going astray and to the employee, profits are wages and salaries going astray, and this brings us to the inevitable conflict.</P>
    <P>Up to relatively recently, the pattern nearly always was the overwhelming of the worker within these kinds of conflicts.  We eventually had to accept a particular wage norm, fixed for him <Col N="736" /> by the power of Government, the power of the employer, or the fear of unemployment, or the fear of hardship and suffering of one kind or another. To me the turning point in this particular pattern of the worker accepting a <i>dictat</i> from the employer, or from the Government, happened with the maintenance men's dispute, when the worker began to understand that he did not have to take dictation from anybody because simply half a dozen men decided that they would withdraw their services, and within a very short time they closed down the whole enterprise of the society.</P>
    <P>The bank officials in the last week have done something similar.  As I said this morning, if the Minister for Finance could have got away with his bullying, hectoring, speech of last Thursday week, he would have been very pleased with himself.  He felt that there might be a climb-down by the bank officials and that they would not face the very serious hardship which is inseparable from going on strike, a hardship which is greatly increased by the present circumstances that most of these unfortunate people simply will not get work anywhere else because of the shortage of employment, not only here but in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>They are taking a very great risk with their own lives, with their own standard of living and the standard of living of those near and dear to them&mdash;their own families.  This is not the act of an irresponsible section in the community.  The bank officials are probably the most staid, stolid and conservative sector in our society. Here are these people at bay, being hunted and pilloried by most people, particularly by Government Ministers, and now being threatened by a Labour Minister with this absurd legislation.  It is a most tragic situation because even if one does not go on strike these days, for the average salary man, the average wage earner, life is becoming more and more intolerably harsh.  There is a very deliberate and conscious assault being made not only here but in Britain&mdash; but that is none of my worries&mdash;on the living standards of the white-collar, blue-collar, manual labourers and manual and industrial workers <Col N="737" /> of all kinds to avoid the very thing mentioned by Senator Kennedy, that is, that there should be any serious effective redistribution of wealth in this country.</P>
    <P>To some extent, protection was given by the Government to the appalling unemployment figures&mdash; 130,000 plus 50,000 youngsters, nearly 200,000.  This is horrifying in its implications in human terms of youngsters working so hard and finding that nobody wants their labour.  The cushioning which took place as a result of pay-related benefits and redundancy payments of one kind or another, of course, did not lead to any serious redistribution of wealth whatever.  It was simply the worker's own money taken from him and redistributed to him in the very clever way of benevolent capitalism. Nobody knows this better than the Labour Ministers in the Cabinet because they have connived at this mean and cynical trick in order to maintain this very conservative Government in power with all their continuing assaults on the unfortunate worker.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has always fascinated me is the way in which to a lesser extent than formerly&mdash; because, as I say, this establishment by the maintenance men and later by others, including the television people the other day who simply blacked out the television services&mdash; there is a growing consciousness amongst the workers.  They are very much more powerful than they ever understood.  They are beginning to do what Big Jim Larkin said: &ldquo;They only look powerful because you are on your knees; get up off your knees.&rdquo; They are at last beginning to see that these bullies who bullied them so painfully through the years, are men they can meet and defeat in anything like fair combat.  Of course, we are getting that now in the national wage agreement situation because of a new development. National wage agreements have gone on since 1970 and for the first time, a great new union, the Transport and General Workers' Union, have found that they cannot recommend the last national wage agreement to <Col N="738" /> their members.  There is a very serious likelihood that there is not going to be a national wage agreement and then we are into the free-for-all situation.</P>
    <P>The pomposity of the Labour Minister&mdash;I have no quarrel with, and I keep on saying this, with the Fine Gael people at all, Deputies or the Minister because they are fighting their corner with great determination and loyalty to their own people. I admire them for it.  I disagree completely with everything they stand for but I admire their adherence to the principles in which they believe and the way they have obviously fought and hunted in the most humiliating manner the Labour members of the Coalition.  I am sorry they have been able to do it for the sake of our Labour movement and our Labour Party but, at the same time I have this strange regard or respect for them, that they defend their own people in the way they have continued to defend the interests of their people all over the years. At the same time, we are now finding that there is a growing awareness amongst the ordinary members of both the political parties and the trade union movement that their leadership need not necessarily be infallible and, quite frequently, should not be trusted.  In some cases there is this gradual evolution of a consciousness among the workers much more politically literate than they ever were before in their lives. This, of course, is part of the great European movement, the extension of this idea of Euro-communism, Euro-socialism, whatever one likes to call it.  If one looks at Portugal, Spain, France or Italy one will see they have one common denominator, the social influence of the Catholic Church over the years of their existence has something in common.</P>
    <P>The position now in relation to this Bill is that neither the bank officials nor the grassroots who could not accept and would gladly, I would imagine, have much preferred to accept a national wage agreement simply cannot do it because the Government cannot have it both ways. There is something to be said if one <Col N="739" /> has not the long term interest that I have in the total changing of the society, the upending of private enterprise capitalism, the creation of a socialist workers' republic, which is my ambition.  If I had not that I could see that there is a certain amount for peace and stability in a national wage agreement even though I disagree with it because to me it is in conflict with the idea that the worker should take everything he can get from these people. He makes it, he creates it with his labour and it all belongs to him. I do not think any of it should go in the form of profits at all.</P>
    <P>However.  I can see that there is something to be said for it because some people get hurt and as a reasonably humane person I do not like to see workers getting hurt in long strikes and that is what happens to the workers, not to the employers. Quite clearly, the banks' officials are faced with the blank wall mentioned by Senator McCartin.  They are not going to get work elsewhere.  They are a poor association and have not got very much money and they are going to face a time of very great hardship. This is something that was clear in the discussions at the ITGWU conference in Killarney.  The worker does not lightly go on strike.  Nobody in his senses would lightly go on strike because life is so hard as things are with living costs and prices.  This, of course, is the key to the failure of the Government.  On one hand they lecture the unfortunate employee&mdash;and we will see more of this in the next few days&mdash; about what he must do.  The employee sees a few individuals being facilitated in making enormous sums of money and they are simply looking for enough to keep on eating, to keep on working, to keep on sending their children to school, providing books and clothes for them, to keep a roof over their heads.  That is all they are looking for. I have often said it is not for a second yacht or a holiday in Bermuda.  These are ordinary working people looking for very simple needs and they cannot provide those needs.  Less and less they are finding it possible.  I thank God <Col N="740" /> I am not a family man any more. I do not know how a man with three, four or five children, can keep them fed and clothed.</P>
    <P>It is the failure of the Government, of the Labour people in the Government to try to persuade the conventional conservative Fine Gael members of the Government that they cannot go on like this, imposing these enormous stresses on the ordinary people and expect them to go on accepting it. They are not going to do it.  It is quite evident that they are not going to do it.  Because of the clawback taxes referred to by Senator Lenihan, the penal imposition of taxes of various kinds on the workers as well as the continued frightening increase in prices of essential goods&mdash;the other day bread again, ESB charges, gas charges, fuel charges, up and up&mdash;the people are not being frivolous.  They are not being irresponsible.  They are simply responding to simple needs of ordinary people who find that in this community which has been under the care of this appalling government&mdash;the third National Coalition Government &mdash;they are unable to accept dictates like a national wage agreement on one hand or a suggestion like this in this Bill that they accept the July, 1975 agreement.</P>
    <P>As I said to Deputy Ryan this morning, one is not sure whether the Government were really playing at debating points or whether they believed what they were saying when trying to exculpate themselves, when they were trying to shift the blame on to somebody else.  The Minister for Labour made the hypocritical suggestion that, in fact, the only persons he really&mdash;he is hankering back to his good old radical days&mdash;wants to hurt are the owners of the banks.  He points out that he has not laid a finger on the employees.  He talked about the £10,000 fine, imprisonment and all these terrible things that he is going to do to the bank owners.  This is the cynical posturing to the Left, to the radical of his youth, that he really intends laying a finger on the really wealthy bank directors. He has no intention of doing that whatsoever because his Fine Gael friends will not allow him to do that <Col N="741" /> but he should not believe for one moment that in saying that he is attempting to penalise the directors of the banks he is not going to inflict any hardship on the employees.  Does he seriously hold this view when this is an Act to provide in the national interest for the regulation for a limited period of the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of employees of the banks?  That is the purpose of the Bill.  It is the employees he is getting at, not at the employers.  They will make sure of that.  He should not treat us with this kind of contempt in providing this kind of a formula&mdash;and this is the one thing this Government seem to have been able to do, that famous Mclnerney's Government of all the talents.  The one thing they have been able to apply their talents to is finding intricate, specious, hypocritical and cynical formulae for their continuing progressive series of disasters which have been associated with them since they came into power.</P>
    <P>If the Minister seriously believes that he is getting away with this kind of hokum he should throw his mind back to a couple of weeks ago when the Labour vote slumped in an urban working-class area, and their wellknown candidate, Senator Halligan, was elected on the fifth count without reaching the quota.  That is serious for the Labour Party, because it seems to tie in with the growing awareness of the ordinary people of the irrelevance of these Parliaments which I have been talking about for so many years and on which Senator FitzGerald chided me this morning. What goes on in them is parallel with the lives of the ordinary people. They do not use their power to change society, to change the way of life of our people.  What is more serious is that a politically enlightened working-class constituency such as Dublin South West, where there is a very high level of political consciousness should have produced a 55 per cent pole.  This is not apathy.  I have too much respect for the people there. It was a deliberate decision to withhold their support from Government and Opposition.  The result was a calculated decision that we, the <Col N="742" /> political parties, had completely betrayed the democratic idea of attempting to concern ourselves with the welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The particular injustice of this Bill is directed at the bank officials.  This is an attempt to get a cross-section decision affecting everybody equally. It is in conflict with the much-praised in-built factor which they say keeps private enterprise going: the right of each individual to get what he can for his commodity, whether it is industrial goods, products, professional services or his labour.  This is particularly obvious in the record of the banks.  It is the centre of all our troubles.  It is the centre of the success or the failure or the quality of social life, or the standards of living of our people, or in any society.  It is the key difference between a socialist society and a capitalist society.  It is the attitude to money lending or banks for the use of money.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the banks lent money at 3 or 4 per cent and for that reason this has a feeding effect growing through the whole economy. Now the rate is 15, 16 or 17 per cent. There is no limit.  Money lending has become usury.  There is no doubt about that.  Throughout the economy it has been most influential in the consequential increases required by the people in industry, in institutions, in hospitals, people trying to build houses. No matter what one does there is this need for capital.  Because the cost of capital is going up, the consequential costs to consumer goods or services is directly related to the cost of money from the banks.  The Government have made no attempt whatever to control the initial cost of money.  In a recent programme I saw that money for housing in Bulgaria is at the rate of 2 per cent, a nominal rate.  This is what it should be.  This is one of the great scandals of our society to which the Labour leadership in the present Coalition is a party.  That the present Minister should lend his name to this outrageous proposal makes it doubtful that he can ever seriously be accepted at any level in the Labour movement in the years ahead.  This kind of thing <Col N="743" /> will stand against him for the rest of his political life.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are working in the health services are finding that there is no money for anything nowadays, everything is being cut.  It does not change life for us at all but it changes life for the people we are trying to help.  The same situation applies to education.  There is curtailment of expansion of all kinds of services.  We have the appalling situation of a house for old people which cannot be opened because they cannot find the money.  This is the universal picture at a time when the total assets of the banks amounts to £4 billion. This is the money at present belonging to the four main Irish banks.  We are a poor country and yet we cannot afford to look after the various needs of our society: health, education, care in old age, housing and so on.</P>
    <P>What a paradox.  What an absurd contradiction.  I am not a bit concerned to see Fine Gael taking the line that we are a poor country, that we cannot afford to lay our hands on this money because it is privately owned.  The hungry go hungry and the sick go without getting cured, and the homeless go without houses.  It is an extraordinarily inhuman and if there is such a thing as Christianity, unchristian attitude to the demands of a society.  No wonder Communism is sweeping Europe.  We are on the periphery but it will reach us without a doubt.  In 1975-76 the accounts of the banks&mdash;and I am sure they are among the most fiddled of all accounts of private capital institutions &mdash;show a profit figure of £63 million, an increase of 24 per cent.  The Minister for Labour is telling the banks that they are not to pay any of this money to their employees.  The absurdity of this proposition.  How in the name of heaven can even the Fine Gael people stand over this kind of thing? Do not mind one declared socialist who believed that ownership and control of the means of production, distribution and exchange is vested in the workers.  Those were the days, the heady days.</P>
    <P>The profit per employee last year was in the region of £3,600.  This is <Col N="744" /> what they made for the banks, approximately £3,600.  Therefore the banks could double these people's salaries and still get by.  The money made is approximately £70,000 per branch of a bank and yet these people cannot get any increase.  We may talk about private enterprise, the right of the individual to make what he can out of his assets.  The £3,600 was the average for all the four banks.  The Bank of Ireland made approximately £4,200 per employee and £76,000 per branch, and none of this must brush off onto the unfortunate employee who made the money.  If one agrees with the stupid banking system, which I do not, it should be taken into public ownership.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that anybody should make money out of lending money for building houses or hospitals or schools or any of these other things.  It is incredible.  Fortunately people are rapidly&mdash;not half rapidly enough&mdash;beginning to accept that.  When Senator Kennedy, who is a very conventional member of the congress, reads out that type of resolution advocating public ownership of the bank, one must accept that this idea is becoming pretty widespread and pretty well accepted generally throughout the community.</P>
    <P>The profits per branch was £76,000 and the Minister has put an embargo on this money.  As far as I can see he would practically take money from the banks if he could.  Anyway, the 15 directors of the Bank of Ireland divide £264,000 between them and they get on average £18,000 per director out of that £264,000, a 30 per cent increase over the previous year.  Under national wage agreements workers get 4 per cent or 5 per cent if they are lucky.  Who wants to defend this kind of privileged society?  A Labour Minister? A socialist?  What is he in it for?  Is he no longer interested in the people and the public who put him in, the people of Ballymun? Has he gone over comletely?  Has he sold out altogether?  What is he getting, what is the bribe?  What is the justification for this betrayal?  A young man should not have caved in quite so easily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> This is the kind of situation in which Deputy M. O'Leary, the Minister for Labour, comes in and lectures the bank officials and talks about their moral responsibilities or suggests that they have a moral responsibility to do something or other.  He has a moral responsibility to look after the ordinary people. He has a moral responsibility to take some of this money that is in the vaults of the banks and distribute it where it is needed.  He certainly has a responsibility to stand up for the rights of the worker in a situation like this, where there is such an obvious disparity between the conditions of service of the minorities which I hope to deal with in my whole contribution, this minority whom the socialist Minister for Labour is now protecting.  He has the hypocritical aplomb to say in his speech there are no penalties of any sort directed against bank employees or their representatives.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not want to make an order bringing in this Act&rdquo;, remember?  We read about it, did we not?  &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked Pilate and they told him and he washed his hands. How long does the Minister for Labour think he is going to go on doing this kind of thing and get away with it? Both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour talked about the national interest.  Indeed it has been incorporated in what Senator FitzGerald was saying.  There is a lot to be done in the cause of the national interest.  There is no good in making a blanket condemnation of this Government and indeed their predecessors. Some of them were better than others, but certainly this Government in the three years of their office have time and time again shown that their only serious interest is in the preservation of the privileged-class-structured society which we have created here during the 50 years of the various Governments, a society of which 5 per cent own three-quarters of the wealth of the country.  There is no need in the world for the hardship that is to be faced.</P>
    <P>This condition is desperately serious and deteriorating.  It is quite obvious the Government, whatever they may <Col N="746" /> have attempted to do, have had no success whatever in controlling inflation. People are frightened to look at their papers or listen to the radio in the morning just because they are terrified of the next increase and at the same time this attempt to freeze wages, the cost of living going up and the decision by the Government, because there is no doubt that this foreshadowed the national wage freeze to which Senator Lenihan referred, I remember Deputy O'Leary supporting me and all of us in the Labour Party in this.  Deputy Colley was trying to bring in a wage freeze and we fought it.  On another occasion concerning the ESB we fought it again and all said we would go to jail rather than allow Mr. Lemass to do much the same thing to the ESB workers.</P>
    <P>However the truth coming through the whole of this position is that the Government are simply putting off the evil day, the likelihood of there being no national wage agreement, the likelihood of the inevitable free-for-all. Senator Kennedy's request is that at least this should not be implemented if there is to be a national wage agreement, that they should at least get what is given in the national wage agreement. In the absence of a national wage agreement then, quite obviously, they must have exactly the same rights as everybody else to get what they can.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government Minister is now a helpless prisoner, a captive within this Fine Gael Coalition.  He has gone so far it is very difficult to see how he can get out of it.  The recent figures show that there is a great evacuation from the labour movement and that it may be inevitable that he must carry on with this Government. and all the chaos instead of getting out and joining in the movement of which he was a member in 1969-70 and pointing out that there is no solution to the social and economic problems of a society within the context of monopoly capitalism: not these days.  There was a time when it could be done.  With the growing literacy of the people and communications of one kind or another it can no longer be done.  The various signs are to be seen&mdash;the maintenance workers for one, the recent by-election results <Col N="747" /> another, and the failure of the national wage agreement to be put across in Killarney in spite of the fact that some of the trade union leaders tried to sell the ideas to the workers.  There is a growing awareness among the ordinary people that they are not getting a fair deal.  Whatever chance they have of taking it from the traditional classical conservatives, Fine Gael and, in recent years I regret to say, Fianna Fáil, they are certainly not going to take it from the present Labour Minister and in particular the Minister for Labour.  The best thing that the Minister for Labour could do, in my view, in the national interest is to bring down this Government without delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent the Society of the Irish Motor Industry which employs 30,000 people and contributes a fifth of the total taxation of this country.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry deplores the prospect of the withdrawal of banking services particularly in view of the current difficult economic circumstances.  A stoppage will cause serious disruption in the motor industry and create unpleasant problems between the industry and its customers.  The society have no alternative but to recommend as general policy that their members should not accept non-negotiable cheques from their customers.  In any event, cash will be required for the payment of wages and for replacement of stocks.  The society are asking the Government to ensure that in the interest of maintaining sufficient cash, all payments by Government and semi-State bodies for supplies and services should be by way of cash or negotiable instruments.</P>
      <P>While not wishing to take sides in the dispute the society have decided to recommend, so as not to assist in any way in prolonging any stoppage, to their members not to offer temporary employment to striking bank officials but should any temporary additional assistance be required because of problems associated with the handling of cash to offer temporary employment to motor industry workers who had been affected by redundancy and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> There is one other point I should like to make.  We have heard a lot from various Senators today, and through the media, about a statement made by the Minister for Finance which it is said did not help in this strike.  We heard a lot of talk from Senator Browne about trade unions and about the rights of the workers, of bringing them from their knees. No one has adverted to the fact that while negotiations were taking place strike notice was served.  To my knowledge this is the first time in the history of a dispute that such action was taken.  I believe, as most people here believe, that this country does not want a bank strike.  The lesson has been learned from the previous bank strike.  Many people lost their businesses, through no fault of their own, through chain reaction of other people's mistakes.  Every effort should be made to let it be known to the public that the bank officials do not want this bank strike.  Unfortunately the executive of 40 who are now speaking for 10,000 people have no mandate for this strike because the mandate that was given to them seven years ago in the last bank strike has not been renewed.  That should be said loud and clear.  The people do not want a bank strike.  The bank officials themselves do not want a bank strike.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all agree that a bank strike at this juncture would have catastrophic results if it were to continue for any length of time.  Let us all hope that some way will be found to avoid this.</P>
      <P>Previous bank strikes took place at times when the economy was sound. Even then, as Senator Daly has pointed out, individuals suffered considerably but at least no lasting national damage was done.  A prolonged bank strike in the present situation of economic crises, mass unemployment and the general severe financial difficulties for small businesses would have appalling results.  We must hope, therefore, that reason will prevail and that there will be no strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It behoves everyone, therefore, to say nothing that will make a strike more likely.  One should refer particularly to the Minister for Finance in this <Col N="749" /> instance.  He is given to making speeches which, when made in this or the other House can be ignored as a normal manifestation of the rather explosive temperament of the Minister for Finance.  But, when he makes them in public about a delicate wage negotiation situation such as obtained in the banks, they can have very serious results.  If the Minister for Finance would only keep his mouth shut on occasions we might all get on better. It behoves everyone to say nothing which could in any way strengthen the possibility of a strike.  In particular it believes everyone and especially the Government not to do anything which could make a strike more likely.</P>
    <P>The greatest danger posed by this Bill is that it does nothing whatever to make a bank strike less likely but that it does a good deal to create an atmosphere in which such a strike can take place.  We all hope that at the last minute this weekend some kind of an agreement will be reached and we will be spared a bank strike.  If such an agreement eventuates it will not be because of this Bill but in spite of it.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest and a considerable amount of agreement to the speech made by Senator Fintan Kennedy.  He said that in previous cases he had supported Bills of this kind in relation to the banking system because in those cases the wages proposed to be paid by the banks to the bank officials were to be in excess of national pay agreements.  This, of course, is the point that we in Fianna Fáil have made here, in the other House and outside&mdash;that this is the great difference between this Bill and previous Bills.  One can agree with Senator Kennedy when he said that in supporting these previous Bills he did so with considerable misgivings as to whether such Bills were right under any circumstances.  But he felt as we did that in the national interest in such a case one had to support legislation of this kind.  It is clearly intolerable, where the workers have agreed to a national pay award whether they like it in their individual cases or not, that any group of workers should jump the gun and try to use their economic strength to get more <Col N="750" /> than everyone else has agreed to settle for.  This is particularly so in present circumstances where, because of the very severe economic crisis we face, the likelihood is that if there is a national pay award ultimately agreed, in the majority of cases workers will not be adequately compensated for increases in living costs.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fintan Kennedy pointed out, this Bill is on a quite different footing to previous ones.  There may or may not be a national wage agreement. At present the likelihood would appear to be that there will not. Senator Kennedy asked the Minister to give the assurance that if the national wage agreement is rejected on July 3rd he will not invoke this Bill.  This is precisely the point that Fianna Fáil have been making for the last few days in this and the other House.  We have an amendment down, in the name of Senator Lenihan, to section 3 which deletes the references to last year's agreements between the bank officials and the banks and gives the Minister power&mdash;which we are willing to do&mdash; to prohibit the payment by the banks to their employees of remuneration at rates exceeding the rates of remuneration provided for in the proposals for the national wage agreement, 1976, and the making or implementation of terms and conditions of employment at variance with that agreement.  We are doing precisely what Senator Fintan Kennedy asked the Minister to do.  The result of the Minister accepting our amendment would be that the assurance asked for by Senator Kennedy would be given by the Minister, that this Bill can only be invoked in the context of a national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy went on to say&mdash; and one can only consider him perfectly right&mdash;that, in the event of the national pay agreement being rejected and there being a free-for-all, this&mdash;much as one may regret it&mdash; has to be a free-for-all covering all sections and not simply some sections. It would be totally contrary to principle for the Minister to say&mdash; and he is giving himself power in this <Col N="751" /> Bill to say this&mdash;that building workers, maintenance workers and any other workers who may be in a particularly strong bargaining position can go ahead and get as much as they can get away with in a free-for-all but that a particular section, in this case the bank officials, are to be limited to some notional figure laid down by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What will the Minister do in the event of there being a rejection of the national pay agreement?  Under this Bill the Minister can impose a freeze unless he is satisfied that whatever wage proposals emerge from negotiations between the bank officials and the banks fit in with whatever will be his norm.  How will he fix that norm?  What is the rate of wage he will allow them have?  What are the conditions he will allow to be negotiated between the banks and the banks officials?  Indeed how can the bank officials and the banks negotiate at present when they do not know whether the Minister will stand over whatever agreement is come to?</P>
    <P>If the Minister lays down this norm for the bank officials will he go further and insist by some means of statutory wage control that other workers will follow the same norm, or will he allow everybody else to have a sort of free-for all and just control the wages of bank officials?  It is certainly the first time in this country, I suspect the first time in any country, that a Minister has given himself the power to say to one particular section of the working population that they may only get whatever wage increases he decides at a time when everybody else will apparently be allowed to go it on his own.</P>
    <P>The legislation is entirely discriminatory. It is basically that which causes Fianna Fáil to object so strongly to it.  Indeed, if the Minister, even at this stage, will agree to accept our amendment and therefore give the assurances asked for by Senator Kennedy, we would be delighted to give him all Stages of this Bill instantly without a vote.  The Bill would <Col N="752" /> then have some sense, some purpose and some degree of fairness.  At the moment it has none.</P>
    <P>We have the curious situation that the whole economic future of the country, as far as the next year or so is concerned, will be decided on 3rd July next when the trade unions will decide whether or not there will be a national pay award this year. The Government's reaction to this is to strain every nerve to get the Dáil into recess before that date; to ensure that there is no democratic consideration or debate of the situation that may result.  One wonders why.  As I mentioned earlier on, the Government are straining every nerve, to the extent of pushing through next week, eight Bills, a Statutory Order, a number of Estimates and an Adjournment Debate, all in three days next week for the sole purpose of getting Parliament out of the way before the ship blows up.  What is the purpose of this?</P>
    <P>There have been references to public feeling against banks and bank officials.  Undoubtedly, there is, to say the least of it, a lack of public regard for the way in which the bank officials have flexed their muscles on previous occasions.  There is, undoubtedly, a perhaps healthy public opinion against any section of workers who use present economic conditions as a means of aggrandising themselves and benefiting themselves at other people's expense.  The Government may hope, by means of this Bill, to incur some political kudos&mdash;I do not know whether they will succeed&mdash;even to the extent of using the Long Title of this Bill for the purpose of making propaganda&mdash;something I have never seen before&mdash;talking about an Act to provide, in the national interest, for the regulation for a limited period, and so on.  Words such as &ldquo;in the national interest&rdquo; are such as certainly I have never seen in a Long Title to a Bill.  It is a typical example of the way in which the Government use every opportunity for political purposes, for propaganda purposes; they even play politics with the extraordinarily delicate and dangerous situation which exists at present with regard to the banks; they even import <Col N="753" /> their political pamphlets into the Long Title of a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

      <P>As Senator Ryan says, apparently all other Bills are not in the national interest.  It is an interesting train of thought which one might well follow up on some other occasion.  The Government import this political aspect into everything.</P>
      <P>The dangerous thing about a Bill such as this is that while it may in the short run appeal to the public as a blow against bank officials, against people who misuse their position of strength, the real danger is that to which Senator Kennedy adverted, that it is perhaps the driving in of the wedge.  It is statutory regulation. No doubt the Minister will say again that this Bill is not a statutory wage regulation.  But it is.  What else is it? It is statutory wage regulation in a particular sector, limited to bank officials.  Every reason which impels the Minister to talk about statutory wage regulation, in relation to bank officials, can equally be applied to building workers, maintenance workers, to anybody else who in the context of a free-for-all tries to improve his position.  Does he intend to do this?  If he does not, then it is discriminatory.  If he does, then it is the kind of statutory regulation that certainly one would not expect a Labour Minister or, indeed, any Irish Minister to bring in under present circumstances.  We cannot support this Bill.  We would support it if the Minister would, even now, say he would accept this amendment. It he did that, we would certainly give him all stages of the Bill without delay.  Unless he is willing to accept our amendment the Bill remains discriminatory and, therefore, one we cannot support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hypocritical for me to say I enjoy seeing legislation affecting any workers' rate of take home pay introduced into the Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="754" /> Many resolutions passed at Congress down through the years have, in fact, urged members of Congress and affiliated bodies to make sure that, in the ultimate, they do not jockey themselves into a position where a third party has an opportunity of entering&mdash;the third party being the Government.  Unfortunately, the bank officials are not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and consequently it has not been possible to get this message across to them.</P>
      <P>It has, however, got across to the bulk of trade unionists affiliated to Congress.  The fact that we have had national wage agreements, almost on a continuous basis since 1970, and with some gaps before that, is an indication that the message got across to the people affiliated to Congress that the best way to go about your business is by negotiating up to the very, very last point, in such manner as not to afford the third party an opportunity of interfering.  It worries me a little to think that workers, such as the bank officials, would embark on a course of action presenting such an opportunity to Ministers of Government, whether Labour, Finance or anyone else.  That is not a condemnation of a Minister doing his job.  It is more a condemnation of the people because of the way they conduct their business, affording an opportunity for interfering to any Government, whether Labour, Fianna Fáil, Coalition or anything else. Workers are not behaving sensibly when they embark on a course of action which provides a third with an opportunity to interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable that in a class structured society such as ours, the popular catch cry of &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; will be applied and, in that context, it is to be expected that workers will use their greatest potential to get as much as they can out of a situation. At the same time, when they do that to some extent there is a contradiction because, by embarking on that course of action, they deny the opportunity to the lower paid worker who in a great many cases is not only waiting for a conclusion of negotiations on a national wage agreement, but many workers do not yet enjoy the benefits of two or <Col N="755" /> three past agreements.  Some phases of past agreements have not yet been paid to some workers.  Here we have an approach by officials which is assisting the people who can get at the workers, the traducers of trade unionism. Reactionaries and fascists inimical to trade unionism are afforded by the behaviour of the bank officials, both now and on the last occasion in not understanding this fundamental point, an opportunity they should not have.</P>
    <P>I have here a speech I made around 1960.  It was a lecture on the use of the strike weapon.  In that lecture I pointed out:</P>
    <P>In dealing with the question of negotiations from the trade union point of view the most important thing to bear in mind, something that is often forgotten, is that the main purpose for which trade unions are established is to negotiate and not to strike.  This may seem a bit peculiar when people seem to establish a reputation in the trade unions by their capacity to serve strike notice at every little opportunity and withdraw it as quickly as they serve it.</P>
    <P>This is the situation into which the bank strikers have now put themselves. They did not think this out. They did the same thing last year. They got into a slightly different but an equally awkward situation thereby affording the Government an opportunity to bring in legislation.  The real embarrassment now is that, finding yourself in a situation in which you have served strike notice, you are not now taking on the employer; you are taking on the State.</P>
    <P>As I said, not only do they expose themselves to those inimical to trade unions, and so on, but they also build up a certain amount of antagonism from the consumer of the service they provide.  They are not going about their business as other people are obliged to go about their business. In the economic circumstances obtaining today, it is necessary to bring home to the bank officials the fact that trade unionists have no quarrel with them in that we have no quarrel with them getting the same amount <Col N="756" /> as may be negotiated under the national wage agreement.  In fact, we will have no quarrel with them if things break down and there happens to be a free-for-all.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which they can deal with their business.  Senator Yeats made a point earlier on about how they could get the best value out of the service they give.  I am not quite sure how the Senator made the point and I hope I am not taking him out of context but there are such things as job evaluation systems and other means by which they could have their service evaluated.  I do not know whether bank officials have ever bothered about this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been somebody else who said that.  I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody said it.  There are ways in which they can go about their business and get the value of what they are doing.  My concern is that they are falling in line and using the popular catch-cry &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; and they are thereby building up this antagonism towards them by workers in general and, worse still, exposing themselves to Government by affording Government an opportunity of interfering.  I cannot blame the Minister, in the economic situation he finds himself in, for bringing this to their attention and bringing in legislation to bring this home to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade unions are not organised to strike.  They are organised to negotiate. I would like to bring that home to these bank officials.  We heard Senator Jack Daly's comments and if he is accurate that this is the way they go about their business, then that brings a great many things into question. The 1913 strike was not about wage increases.  It was not about seniority or holidays.  It was about the right to negotiate.  Therefore, when you are dealing with the question of trying to bring about a wage increase, particularly if that is going to put the other members of your own class into a difficult situation, you have to think seriously about how you approach a strike, to make sure that every avenue is explored before you actually embark <Col N="757" /> on the concept of serving strike notice.  It would appear that the strikers have not done this.</P>
    <P>I believe in sanctions myself.  When I wanted to apply a sanction I believed that having gone through the whole gamut and having explored every avenue if I then served notice, or if I were in a situation to take some form of industrial action, I had regard to two things.  One was that I knew the employer could apply a sanction but I also wanted to know what the end result would be because, in effect, I was then declaring war on my employer. In this particular case I think the situation is that the bank officials by their action have declared war on the rest of society and that is not saying anything in favour of the type of society we live in.  What I was really worried about is the way their action affects every other worker in the country.  The easiest thing in the world is to call a strike but the most difficult thing is to bring about a settlement of a strike.</P>
    <P>I think there is a lack of clarity between the use of the strike weapon and exactly what workers are organised for.  In most trade unions in their rule books I think you will find the objectives are to regulate the relations between employers and employees and employees and employees.  This not merely drives home the point that all the argument and all the fights have not been about the right to serve strike notice without exploring every avenue possible or in circumstances where you might invite Government intervention but rather that you would negotiate as hard and as fast as possible, fight every angle of the agreement and finally if you get that agreement abide by it. In this particular case I do not think the bank officials' behaviour has been of any assistance to their fellow-workers.</P>
    <P>I would say to them with their strength, with their know-how, with their knowledge and with the standard of education they enjoy, they are denying other workers in the country by not being affiliated to Congress.  By not joining in the general run of negotiations between the employers generally and lending their know-how, <Col N="758" /> assistance and the business acumen they have acquired through their job to their fellow-workers in certain situations, they are not helping their fellow-workers in any way and it is time they thought seriously about this.  To some extent they exercise a snob role in society but that is not a reason for bringing in legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to emphasise that I do not like any situation arising where any Government have to be brought in to introduce legislation. But if a body of people go about their business in a way that has not been properly thought out, and having had regard to the overall consequences that might arise and might affect other workers who are the consumers of their particular service, then I think the only thing to do is to show them that the time and the circumstances were not right for them to embark on the serving of strike notice and that some limited action has got to be taken against them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us must be very much concerned at present with the problem of inflation, which is affecting the cost of living, which is whitling away the standard of living, which is undermining all the essential services such as health services, education, welfare and which is vitally affecting the competitiveness of our industry, not only in exporting goods but more and more affecting the competitiveness against goods imported from abroad.</P>
      <P>This problem of inflation is a very real one.  It must be emphasised that it is a real problem, that it is not merely a theoretical concept, it is not merely something that economists talked about.  It is something that exists at present in a very real way in this country.  It affects everyone of us and, unfortunately, it is worse in this country than in any other European countries.  Furthermore, not only is it worse at the moment in this country but it is getting worse, absolutely and relatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that in approaching this Bill, we have got to look at it to see whether it has any effect or any relevance to this problem of inflation. <Col N="759" /> I think we must realise that this is no longer merely a serious problem; it is one which is heading towards disaster.  It will lead inevitably to more and more unemployment, which is already at a disastrously high level.  It is no exaggeration to say that unless something really serious is done to halt it, the economy will at best gradually decline and at worst it will simply collapse.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that we must look at the present Bill to ascertain if it is relevant to the problem of inflation.  We must ascertain whether this Bill is going to help solve that problem.  In looking at this very widespread problem, which affects every section of the community it is difficult to understand why this particular Bill should relate only to one small section of the community.  In so far as the bank officials have been singled out for this Bill, then it must be accepted and admitted that the Bill is a discriminatory one.  There are, after all, many other sections of the community, many other unions which have said quite plainly that they intend to look for and to obtain very large increases, increases just as high as the bank officials.  Nevertheless, the Minister and the Government do not appear to be taking any action; they do not indicate that they recognise there is a problem in these other spheres as well as in the sphere of the banks.</P>
    <P>It is now, I think, fairly clear from the voting that has gone on in a number of unions that there is no chance of a national wage agreement.  Perhaps I am wrong about that; perhaps there will be one.  But certainly the indications are very strongly pointing towards a defeat of the proposal for a national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>In that situation we will have a free-for-all which would be a disaster in its effects on inflation.  It might not be a disaster for everybody.  For some people, for some unions, in some industries, it may be that large increases would be given but, in many other spheres, the increases would not be given, and you would have an impossible situation in which in some industries, <Col N="760" /> some firms, some unions, there would be large increases and in others there would be little or no increase.  This would lead to serious discrimination and serious differences between one worker and another which, of course, in due course, would lead to further difficulties.</P>
    <P>So, we are up against a situation, or appear to be up against a situation, where if the national wage agreement is not accepted, there will be further inflation, a further effect on the standard of living, a further adverse effect on essential services and of course, a further serious effect on those employed, and an increase in unemployment.</P>
    <P>What we want to know here today is, what do the Government intend to do in such circumstances?  Do the Government really intend to adjourn the Dáil next week and not come back until next October in the light of the situation which is developing? Do the Government quite literally mean just to walk away from the problem and do nothing whatever about it, leaving chaos everywhere with the sole exception of the banks? That is what seems to be happening. That is what seems to be proposed by the Government at present.</P>
    <P>They know there is a serious possibility, a serious danger, that the national wage agreement will not be accepted.  They know that, in such circumstances, there will be a free-for-all. They know this must be a serious situation for the economy, for the country, for the welfare of the people.  Yet, their only contribution to the solution of that problem is to bring in this Bill.  It would be very helpful, indeed, if the Government would give some indication of what their real intentions are if certain circumstances develop.</P>
    <P>This Bill taken alone&mdash;and that is the way we are getting it at the moment&mdash;is objectionable and unacceptable because it is discriminatory, because it relates to one small section of employees only.  It is objectionable because it deals with only one area, one possible problem area. Most of all, it is objectoinable because one suspects this is merely a gesture <Col N="761" /> by the Government.  The Government are very adept at this kind of empty gesture.</P>
    <P>One suspects once the Government have passed this Bill they will adjourn the Dáil and if and when the national wage agreement fails and chaos develops, the Government will merely refer to the fact that when the Dáil and Seanad were sitting and a problem arose, they dealt with it but, because the Dáil and Seanad are no longer sitting, they are no longer able to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>They will be able to use that excuse for doing nothing about the problem which seems to be developing. They will be able to use that excuse for letting matters slide, as they have done with most other problems in relation to the national economy.  They will be able to wash their hands of a problem which will undoubtedly be a very difficult problem to handle because of the composition of the Government. One can readily understand they will have no desire to face up to it.</P>
    <P>We object to this Bill because it seems to be merely an empty gesture. It seems to be dealing with one small aspect of a very wide problem.  It will be used to show the apparent good faith of the Government, to show that when the Houses were sitting they took action and when the Dáil and Seanad are adjourned they will say: &ldquo;We really cannot do much for the present.&rdquo;  Will the Minister say if this is the only action they propose to take in the situation which appears to be developing?  Will the Minister say if the national wage agreement collapses what action the Government will take?  Will they recall the Dáil and Seanad?</P>
    <P>This situation is much too serious to be left in mid-air.  If we knew the intentions of the Government, if we had a commitment that in the situation which is developing other measures would be taken, if we had an indication of what kind of measures would be taken, if we had some idea of how the Government propose to tackle the problems which seem to be on the horizon, and the very near horizon, then of course we <Col N="762" /> would be able to look at this Bill in its proper context.  We would be able to decide in these circumstances, whether this Bill was part of a pattern and that there would be others to deal with other problems. We might be willing to give this Bill more serious consideration if we saw it in its proper context.  Because we suspect it is merely put forward in isolation, because we feel it is merely a gesture by the Government, because we feel the Government are going to run away from the real problems that are developing, we cannot take this Bill seriously. We cannot allow the Government to get away with this Bill if it is merely an empty gesture.</P>
    <P>It would be very helpful indeed&mdash; and I say this quite sincerely&mdash;if the Minister would give a firm indication of what his plans are for the future. Then the Bill could be taken seriously and it could be looked at in context. In these circumstances we could look at it again and see whether it had any real merits.  Because we cannot view it seriously we are opposing it.  We are putting forward certain amendments which would make some improvement in the situation, which would relate the Bill to other problems and to the national wage agreement, which would fit it into a pattern which should be in the minds of the Government, in the speech of the Minister and should be part of a widespread and comprehensive solution to the problem.  In the absence of that approach by the Government we have to oppose this Bill, and we are making a small contribution by putting forward an amendment which will not improve the Bill very much because of the fact that the Bill itself is not a very helpful one.  At least it will be an effort to relate the Bill to something, an effort to force the Government to put this Bill into context and let us know what are their intentions about the very serious problems that are looming on the horizon at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was listening anxiously to Senator Eoin Ryan and trying to ascertain what he was driving at or what he was going to advocate <Col N="763" /> when he was requiring the Government to say what their intentions are in certain circumstances.  I would have expected Senator Ryan to put his cards on the table and indicate whether or not he favoured, in the event of a free-for-all coming about, the introduction of legislation that has been threatened by way of a pay pause and so on.  We cannot have this both ways; if we are asking what is the intention of one side, we should also at the same time say what we would like to see.</P>
      <P>I was also intrigued to hear Senator Ryan talk about the voting that has gone on in other unions, and he has forecasted that the national wage agreement is going to be rejected. Frankly, I do not know where Senators got this information from, because my understanding of the situation is that there is secret balloting going on at the moment, and whilst different unions may have made recommendations for or against rejection of the national wage agreement or left the matter open, the matter is still open and it will remain for the people who are in membership of the trade union movement to decide whether to accept the proposals contained in the national wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the situation that, unfortunately, prevails in the banks.  As we know, the members of the banks officials' association have not been given the opportunity of deciding whether they will go on strike.  This is a very serious matter when we talk about the age of democracy in which we live.  I think it is impertinence on the part of anybody to take on himself to decide whether any number of people should go on strike.  It is a matter for the people concerned to make up their own minds, and this is where I find myself a bit worried about the predicament that prevails in the banks.  None of us likes harsh legislation, and I had occasion to talk about this matter when legislation of this kind was being introduced before.  I said I just could not understand why the bank officials' association could not come into the trade union family.  What is wrong with the trade union movement <Col N="764" /> that they have got to stay out of it?  It may be that they feel they are more close to the people who run the banks.  We know also that the bank manager is a very powerful person.</P>
    <P>The only thing I see really wrong with this suggested Bill is that it does not go far enough.  We should have availed of the opportunity to take care of the situation that continues to exist whereby the banks can hoard profits as much as they like and everybody else is required to toe the line.  Firms have gone into liquidation, and workers have lost their employment as well as management losing their shares and so forth, all because of the actions of the bank.  We will always be in this kind of mess until we take over the banks.  That is what I would like to see happening rather than the type of talk we find ourselves indulging in here now.  If the national wage agreement that has been referred to is rejected by the democratic process, through the medium of the ballot, as is the way it is being conducted, it is not the end of the world.  The world will not crash around us, but if we let the bank and the people who control them continue to operate the way they are operating, it will be the end of our economy.</P>
    <P>This is what we should be applying our minds to.  Apart from bank managers and other bank officials, there are other people working in the banks, members of my union who have to conform with national wage agreements in accordance with positions taken.  They can be porters or canteen workers.  Never at any time has there been a mad rush on the part of the people who control the banks to say: &ldquo;We want to give you more.&rdquo;  They do not want to share the cake with that type of person, and this is what really annoys me when I hear people saying the agreement is going to be rejected or is in the process of being rejected. We do not know, and it is wrong for us to try to forecast the secret ballot vote that is going on.</P>
    <P>Executives of unions like my union have recommended the rejection of the national wage agreement. That is it.  We will not take it on ourselves to tell people to go on <Col N="765" /> strike.  The members of the trade unions will decide themselves whether we go on strike.  If we could only get that sort of thing rectified, it would be a very good job of work done in the interests of the bank officials, because what is happening at the moment is that there is a wedge being driven between the bank officials and other trade unionists.  It is a hard thing for one in the trade union movement to explain to a group of workers that: &ldquo;You are party to the making of the agreement; you have got to conform with it&rdquo; when we witness other people who can go off on a tangent and get what they like.  This is often referred to as a trade union muscle.  The extraordinary thing about it is that there were several national wage agreements with the decision on which even the discontented ones, the dissatisfied ones, within the trade union family had to conform.  They have had to accept whatever was decided eventually at Congress level even though some of them could have a fair amount of muscle and without mentioning a particular class of worker they could easily hold the country up to ransom.  No, they did not do that. They conformed with the trade union arrangement.</P>
    <P>What is so special about this other set of people, who do not want to go along with that but who, at the same time, find themselves in this unfortunate predicament that they have no real say?  The most ironical part of this whole proceedings is that you find people being required or being represented as wanting to go on strike when, in fact, they have had no say in whether they should go on strike. I think that is the most abhorrent thing that you could ever experience. People who work in the trade union movement have no right to impose their will on the rank and file membership, and the same thing must go for the people who control the bank officials' association.  Far it be from me to advocate the introduction of severe legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to go back to a point that was made by Senator Ryan when he <Col N="766" /> was trying to draw the Minister into saying what his intentions are.  The Minister is on record as saying this, that there will be no legislation brought in by him or attempted to be brought in by him that will introduce a pay freeze.  There is your answer.  It was attempted in the life of the Fianna Fáil Government.  It brought us up to the eve of decision on this level when all the unions were required to report back on the terms of a national wage agreement.  There was then a threat of legislation, and it was passed through the Dáil and they shelved it.  We know what that means.  It is there to be taken off the shelf and introduced whenever it is seen fit.  The trade union movement very rightly at that time said: &ldquo;Withdraw your legislation or we will not have anything to do with the situation.&rdquo; The legislation was withdrawn, and there was an understanding reached.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to emphasise this, that if the proposals contained in the national wage agreement are not satisfactory in so far as the majority of workers are concerned it is not the end of the world.  We are trying to make up our minds about what should be done in matters of this kind.  Let us take our courage in our hands and stop the people who are hoarding money, and building up large profits while at the same time waiting like vultures to put firms into liquidation.  They are the people whom we should attack not the ordinary person who works in the bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is a phoney piece of legislation, presented here in this form to mislead people into believing that the Government are doing something about this dispute.  If the Minister was serious and had taken the serious attitude that he should have taken about this dispute he would have been here earlier rather than in Geneva, and this legislation could have been put before the Houses and debated properly rather than bringing it in in a hurried fashion and putting a guillotine motion through here so that people would have to restrict themselves and say a lot less than they would possibly want to say, because <Col N="767" /> the Government are anxious to stiffle this discussion or because the Minister was not here when negotiations were taking place between the bank officials, the banks and the Government.  This is a very serious matter.  I do not know what has happened today during the discussions that are taking place.  I know they are very serious discussions and the outcome will determine whether our economy will be made worse, although it is hard to make things worse than they are at present. But it could have a disastrous effect. Our attitude is that the three parties concerned in this dispute, the banks the employees and the Government, should take no action whatsoever that might bring about a closure of the banks, and that the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained until we know the outcome of the ballot on the national wage agreement, which I understand should be known about 5th or 6th July.</P>
      <P>The last speaker, Senator Mullen expressed some resentment that Senator Ryan was predicting that there would not be a national wage agreement. In fact, Senator Ryan pointed out things that could happen if there was no agreement on the national wage situation.  I was present when Senator Ryan made his contribution and that is, as I understand it, what he said. Senator Mullen also spoke about profits in banks and banks putting people into liquidation and various things that really have nothing to do with this Bill.</P>
      <P>If it happens that there is no agreement of the national wage situation we will then be in a position where there will be a free-for-all for everybody except the bank officials.  The Minister said today that the banks will be fined and so forth.  The big man in the ministerial chair makes all sorts of threats.  The Minister for Finance last week, interfered in something at the wrong time and the bank officials' negotiators pointed out that that was unwise on the Minister's part.  When can we expect any wisdom from the Minister for Finance, or from any other Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason for these wage increase claims and for industrial unrest? <Col N="768" /> It is because people just cannot live on what they have.  Taxation has been introduced to pay off huge debts, huge sums of money that were borrowed, and for the most part money that was wasted.  I am not aware of any stage at which people who have talent, were encouraged by that money, or of any words of encouragement from the Government.  Every country depends on the creators, the people of talent, who do things.  When they create a factory, or an industry, everybody benefits, and there are no free loaders.  Irish people do not want to be free loaders.  They all play a great part and the economy booms. What has this Government done for anybody with talent, except to say to him: &ldquo;The more you move the more we will tax you.  Not alone will you have all the increased worry and various things that crop up in normal day-to-day business but if you expand your business we will tax you all the more.&rdquo; In other words, they are killing initiative. There is no incentive to anybody to do anything.  As a result of various taxes that were introduced we now find that we have industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>The people in banks are no different than anybody else, they are normal boys and girls working throughout the country, trying to live and finding it impossible to live.  A lot of these young people working in the banks, are in a different position from other workers, in so far as that by the very nature of their work they are not working from their own homes.  When they are employed by banks they are sent to other towns, far away from their own town.  I have never known a case where any youngster was taken on in his own town.  This means that they go away, live in flats with others and find it impossible to live because of taxation, the price of foodstuffs, inflation, and so on.  Then you wonder about unrest.  You wonder why this is happening.  Instead of people putting their finger on what it is all about, you hear speeches about the profits banks are making.  I have no sympathy for banks.  Why do people not just put their finger on it and say that young people, old people or anybody who is working at present find it impossible to live?  That is why the Government <Col N="769" /> have made one blunder after another in relation to the national wage agreement and to the pay of bank officials. The Minister for Finance last week, and the Minister for Labour, by introducing this phoney piece of legislation, are trying to mislead people into thinking that they have done something constructive.</P>
    <P>Next week, I understand, the Dáil will go into recess, and the Seanad will go into recess shortly afterwards. If the national wage talks break down or if there is no agreement and there is a free-for-all, where do we find the Minister for Labour, or where do we find any of the Ministers to do something about it?  Will they just stand back, or will they arrange with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for another interview on television to say: &ldquo;Well, we did do something, we introduced legislation but the Houses are in recess and there is nothing we can do about it.&rdquo;  That is providing any of the Ministers are at home for the next six months, not just for the time of the recess.  They are in a very serious situation.  I noted that Senator Mullen quoted&mdash;I do not know how accurately&mdash;the Minister for Labour saying that he would never be party to any legislation involving a wage freeze.  There was a time when I believed that no Minister or member of the Labour Party would be party to any legislation relating to a wage freeze.  These days one can be forgiven for wondering what they might do when the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; tells them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary as the contents are known to all the parties involved in this dispute.  It is certainly not helping negotiations in any way: the big whip never helps any negotiations.  Disputes can be and always are settled by men of reason.  It is a bit late in the day for this type of thing.  Perhaps something could have been done about it last week or early this week if people could be found.  It is very hard to understand the attitude of the Minister for Finance and the manner in which he spoke to the House.  He referred to the Dáil and said that the Fianna Fáil members spoke too long on various Bills.  That was the reason <Col N="770" /> for delays.  He did not just make a simple comment that the Fianna Fáil members spoke for too long. What he was saying was: &ldquo;How dare they criticise?  How dare the Opposition put up any opposition to the Government of all the talents?&rdquo; That is the way it came over here this morning.  In all my life, I never heard such arrogance and we are getting used to displays of arrogance.</P>

      <P>I should like to have heard what the Minister had to say. It is always interesting though it may not be educational.  That is one of the reasons why I was disappointed at the arrogance of the Minister for Labour in walking out on the debate this morning.  A vote was to be taken.  The Minister present always waits until the vote is taken.  Then he turns in and the debate resumes.  We waited here for the Minister.  He showed contempt for the House.  He did not return.  We had to ask for an adjournment of the House.</P>

      <P>I was not here when the Minister apologised.  If he made an apology which was acceptable&mdash;I did not hear the words&mdash;that is all right.  I have made reference to it.  I am sure that if the Minister makes an apology it is accepted by everybody.</P>
      <P>Disputes are settled, as I said, by men of reason and not by outbursts. I refer to the Minister's speech where it says:</P>
      <P>It cannot be said too often that the reduction of the present unacceptably high unemployment figures requires that our industrial costs be kept as low as possible so that our economy can participate on the most advantageous terms possible in the export markets with our trading partners in the EEC. Although wage increases are not the sole cause of cost increases, they do form a significant proportion.</P>
      <P>Irish people have always taken a responsible attitude.  Why are they looking for wage increases?  Why are costs so high in industry?  I will give one reason.  In the last budget we had increased taxation on petrol and transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but I had an important point to make in that connection because we were dealing with the increased costs of production and why people are looking <Col N="772" /> for wage increases.  To back up the point I could only refer to the increased costs of goods due to the fact that transport costs had been increased as a result of the higher taxation on vehicles and the higher price of petrol.  That was all I wanted to say.  If the Chair feels I should not, I accept that.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I noticed this morning, spoke about repetition.  He rose on a point of order about it in the case of Senator Lenihan.  I did not notice any repetition in anything Senator Lenihan said. What he said was wise and well-said. The Minister must obviously have been annoyed at whatever Senator Lenihan was saying.  If ever any group of people were guilty of repetition it is this Government.  I will give one instance.  Whenever they are questioned or are trying to explain away anything they always refer to &ldquo;the world recession&rdquo;.  Everything is covered in that.  It is the great excuse of the Government of all the talents.</P>
      <P>Europeans must be wondering why whenever we have a Coalition we always have a world recession.  This must be very worrying to people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I can, indeed.  We do not seem to be doing anything about the recession we have here.  Other countries are suffering from it but they seem to be getting out of their difficulties.  We are not.  As a result of the recession, we have more taxation; we have more money to pay out and we have less wages.  That is why people are looking for more wages. If there is any increase for the bank officials, there is legislation to impose fines and penalties on the banks but if there is a free-for-all where is the equality of citizens under our Constitution? They will be left out in the cold.  They will be tied to a piece of legislation.  Does the Minister intend, at some stage, to bring in legislation to fine employers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> We are in a serious position at present and it would be disastrous if there was a bank closure.  It would make the economy worse than it is. We hope this will not happen but we feel that the Government have not done enough to prevent it.  Outbursts such as we have heard from the Minister for Finance, in the absence of the Minister for Labour whose Department have responsibility for the matter, have brought about a situation in which we are faced with <Col N="774" /> a bank closure.  I hope we will have a more responsible attitude from the Government in future.</P>
