      <P>In accepting a slightly modified version of Senator Robinson's Committee Stage amendment on the definition of polluting matter I mentioned my intention to make a further minor drafting amendment in the definition on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 broadens the definition further by including &ldquo;poisonous or noxious matter&rdquo; after &ldquo;any&rdquo; where it first occurs, page 2, line 32, and thus dispenses with the need for specific reference to such matter in sections 3, 12, 13, 14 and 16.  Amendments Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which delete the reference to poisonous and noxious matter, <Col N="778" /> are consequential on amendment No. 1.  I can assure the House that this is purely a drafting amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3 to delete lines 55 and 56 and in page 4 to delete lines 1 to 7 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister may by order, made with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service in so far as it relates to expenses for members of the Council, provide for such one or more of the following as he considers appropriate:</P>
      <P>(a)  the constitution of the Council,</P>
      <P>(b)  the period for which and the terms and conditions upon and subject to which the members of the Council are to hold office,</P>
      <P>(c)  the manner in which a member of the Council may resign from office and the manner and circumstances in which such a member may be removed from office,</P>
      <P>(d)  the payment of expenses to members of the Council,</P>
      <P>(e)  any matter which is ancillary or incidental to any of the foregoing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been tabled to avoid the particular problem which the Parliamentary Secretary found with the original amendment.  It proposes to require that the Minister shall by order, made with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service in so far as it relates to expenses for members of the Council, provide for such one or more of the following as he considers appropriate: the constitution of the Council, the period for which and the terms and conditions upon and subject to which the members of the Council are to hold office, the manner in which a member of the Council may resign from office and the manner and circumstances in which such a member may be removed from office, the payment of expenses to members of the Council, any matter which is ancillary or incidental to any of the foregoing.  The attempt is to ensure the independence and constitution <Col N="780" /> of the Advisory Council. As the section stands the composition of this Council, its terms of reference and its tenure are all much too much in the discretion of any particular Minister at any time.  He may appoint any number he likes for any terms he likes.  He may appoint a Chairman.  He may remove anybody from it.  A body so composed is not likely to give independent advice or to feel that it can give independent advice to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I removed the reference to the business of the Council because I think the Parliamentary Secretary made a valid point when he said that the Council should regulate its own business and its own procedure.  This amendment is in line with the Government proposal for the structure of the Wildlife Advisory Council.  It does convey a sense that the Advisory Council has a statutory basis that the regulations governing it in a procedural sense are brought in by an order and are visible, that the people who are on the Advisory Council have that security of tenure, know that they have been appointed in accordance with the order, know that the duration of their appointment is two or three years, or whatever it may be, and feel therefore that they can give independent and impartial advice based on their particular expertise.  The amendment has been retabled without the part of the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary rightly argued could be an interference with the independence of the Council.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree to this amendment.  I have already accepted on Committee Stage Senator Robinson's amendment providing for appointment of the Council by order.  I see no reason to provide for a further order to deal with the matters already covered by substantial provisions in the section, such as the number of persons to be appointed, the period of appointment, and the payment of expenses. Neither do I see any need to set out the manner in which a member may resign from office.  I appreciate that the amendment may be based <Col N="781" /> on a formula used in another enactment. We have in the Bill what we need for the Water Pollution Advisory Council and there is no great point of principle at stake which would warrant changing it. It must be remembered that we are only providing for an advisory body and that each member will be acting in a voluntary capacity.  By appointing a non-statutory body we have already shown our anxiety to make use of such a body and have it as representative as possible.  I do not consider that there is any need for the amendment or that it would have any different effect from what is proposed.  Senator Robinson's amendment is saying in another way what is said in the Bill and I do not see any great difference in it.  For that reason I would ask Senator Robinson to seriously consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been very willing to accept amendments and to introduce amendments on Report Stage in the light of suggestions made on Committee Stage.  Despite that, I do not feel that this is a drafting amendment, or not an amendment on principle, and one which I could withdraw in the light of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  This is an amendment in principle which would try to create a more independent structure for the Water Pollution Advisory Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As section 2 stands at present, the Water Pollution Advisory Council, when established, will have the size which the Minister decides, so it could be anything from three people to 40 people.  Each member will have the appointment for the length of time the Minister deems fit, for some people maybe ten years, for some people maybe six months and for others maybe only for two months. There is no qualification on that discretion. The Minister may remove a member without giving a reason.  He may appoint a chairman of the council <Col N="782" /> at any time and if that person is too independent-minded a chairman he may remove him and appoint somebody else as chairman.  That is not the type of body the Seanad should approve of as the best type of structure for an independent advisory body.  The precedent of the Wildlife Advisory Council is relevant.  There was good reason for the type of composition of the body which we choose when establishing the Wildlife Advisory Council.  I appreciate that the members of this advisory council would be voluntary and that there is provision for a formula for them to resign.  It is obviously not an elaborate resignation.  It would presumably be simply a letter of resignation to the Minister terminating the appointment, but it does mean that you have a body with a fixed number of people for a definite length of time.  That in itself could vary but it would be set out in the order.  The chairman would be appointed in a particular way, either by the Minister or by the members of the advisory council, or whatever the formula might be in the order.  People could look at the written order and see the composition of the advisory council.  It is a matter of principle because we are creating a consultative function for the advisory council and this has been written in.  That is very welcome, but we are not really creating an independent existence and an independent tenure for the Wildlife Advisory Council.  I regret this very much because I know that the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary is to have a good and useful advisory council and to have it used by the Minister.  In a parliamentary sense we are not availing to the full of the meaning of giving a body a statutory function and basis.</P>

    <Title>Superannuation and Pensions Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) (for the Minister for the Public Service) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>) <b>(for the Minister for the Public Service):</b> This Bill is essentially an enabling measure designed to simplify the administration of the pension terms of civil servants. It does not, of itself, change either the structure, or the level, of their superannuation terms.  At present, these terms are, in the main, contained in a long list of enactments stretching back to 1834 and any changes considered necessary from time to time must be effected by way of amending legislation.  Such an arrangement makes it difficult to comprehend the overall provisions of the code, especially for those who have no specialised knowledge in the field, and of course, the legislative requirements mean that a considerable time can elapse before covering authority for even minor changes can be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill will simplify these procedures.  It enables the pension terms for, or in respect of, civil servants to be prescribed in statutory schemes.  Certain other persons, listed in subsection (3) of section 2, to whom civil service terms apply, will also be covered by such schemes.  The aim, in due course, is to make a comprehensive scheme covering all the pension terms relating to established civil servants and then to repeal the relevant statutory provisions.  Initially, however, schemes will be made to provide the appropriate legislative cover for the civil service contributory and <i>ex-gratia</i> widows' and children's pensions schemes, payments under which, with the approval of the Dáil, commenced with effect from 23rd July, 1968 and 1st October, 1969, respectively.  Basically, <Col N="785" /> the setting out of pension terms in the form of a scheme is no more than the extension of a practice already applying as a general feature in the State-sponsored sector and applicable also in a large part of the remainder of the public sector, viz. Garda, defence forces and national and secondary teachers.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the Bill will, also, by virtue of section 3, subsection (1), enable statutory cover to be provided for a number of changes in superannuation which resulted from my acceptance, in 1974, of agreed recommendations made in the previous year by a working party on superannuation.  This is a temporary provision and will cease on the making of a comprehensive scheme under section 2 which will embody those and other pension provisions.  To cover all the details of civil service superannuation in a single document will be a considerable task, but it is one which is well worth undertaking with a view to rationalising and simplifying the code as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I recommend this measure to Seanad Éireann for early and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in favour of this Bill.  It is desirable that the multifarious schemes for pensions and superannuation in the public service should be dealt with in a simpler and more flexible way.  It certainly does not mean that these measures should have to be always dealt with by a Bill in the Oireachtas.  It seems desirable that the Minister should have this power to make schemes without having to come back each time to the Oireachtas.  I assume that schemes of this kind will be made by order which can be discussed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to welcome the Minister for Lands but I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not present.  I would hope that he would reconsider the question of those widows whose public-servant husbands died before 23rd July, 1968.  When these schemes were originally introduced, widows were not covered at all.  When it was decided, very late in the day, that widows of public servants would receive a pension, even a small one, <Col N="786" /> those whose husbands had died before the introduction of the scheme were not covered at all.  The present position is that these widows, of whom there were 2,177 at the end of 1972, get half of the pension that their husbands would have had.  The average pension that these widows received in 1972 was around £300.  Without the ravages of inflation since then, the amount would clearly be greater.  Nonetheless, these pensions are still small and amount to only a quarter of their late husbands' salaries.  These are called <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions.  &ldquo;<i>Ex-gratia</i>&rdquo; is a misnomer because in the case of widows whose husbands died after 23rd July, 1968, the State paid half of the pension.  The position now is that the State pays the same half that they would have paid in any event but the other half, which is paid for by contributions, does not exist.  These widows are living at a standard which is well below that which ought to be expected in the case of the public service or any section of the economy.</P>
    <P>Some of these widows are over 70 years of age and a large number are over 80 years of age.  They are a declining group inevitably and sadly. They have reiterated that they are perfectly willing to pay the full 40 year contributions at ½ per cent of their late husbands' salaries which were required to get the full pensions that other widows get.  One wonders why this arrangement has not been agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said that the poorer widows could not afford to pay this lump sum in contributions. I believe an arrangement to this end was made and the Minister refused to sanction the arrangement. An arrangement was made that the pension could be paid into the Bank of Ireland until such time as the total contributions had been paid, which would take a year and nine months, and then the bank would pay the increased pensions to the widows.  One wonders why this was not agreed to.</P>
    <P>The question has arisen as to who would pay for these increased pensions.  Actuaries decided that this would cost a 1¼ per cent contribution on all existing public servants in order to enable <Col N="787" /> these pre-1968 pensions to be paid in full.  The Civil Service Staff Associations refused to pay this amount.  It is regrettable that it was put to them in this way.  It might well have been explained that it was not to be a permanent 1¼ per cent additional superannuation, that for obvious reasons, it would be a declining factor, that after a certain number of years had elapsed there would be no pre-1968 widows left.  Therefore, to have put it in this way, asking to have a permanent impost on them of 1¼ per cent, was asking for a refusal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance says that the cost in capital terms of paying these pensions in full would be £3,250,000.  He talks about everyone claiming more concessions that the country cannot afford.  He says that the same people who claim these concessions complain when tax is increased and so on.  But this is a particular case where the Minister should accept that he has a responsibility. These are the widows of public servants who are under the immediate control of the Minister, both as Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service.  Any Minister for Finance or for the Public Service has a special responsibility to see that those who have served the State faithfully do not suffer unnecessary financial deprivation and, in particular, that their widows should have a reasonable standard of living.  The Minister cannot and should not evade his responsibility by talking in general terms of how everyone is claiming concessions and, at the same time, is unwilling to pay for them.</P>
    <P>One wonders why it would not be possible to divide up the cost.  Apparently the Minister has been considering either making the staff associations pay the full amount by a 1¼ per cent increase in their superannuation payments or making the State pay the full amount&mdash;another £3 million.  One wonders why nobody has considered dividing the cost&mdash;say about one-third each.  Let the State pay one-third of the cost, an extra £1 million, and let the civil service staff associations pay one-third, maybe 0.4 per <Col N="788" /> cent extra superannuation.  Perhaps if it was put to them in that way they would be willing to agree.  Let the widows concerned pay the contributions their husbands were unable to pay because the scheme did not exist at that time.  I am sure it would be practicable to introduce some kind of scheme which would be acceptable to all parties.</P>
    <P>One is entitled to mention that the husbands of pre-1968 widows, during their period of service as public servants, paid 3¾ per cent of their salaries for a pension which they never got because they died too soon. If they had lived there would be much higher pensions payable.  The post-1968 widows get four times what the pre-1968 widow gets.  There is a saving all along the line because people did not survive long enough to get their pensions or to get the benefit of the 3¾ per cent superannuation which they paid in order to qualify for their pensions.</P>
    <P>The State has a responsibility for its public servants.  The Minister should look at the matter again, not from the point of view simply of what the cost is&mdash;talking in terms of millions or 1¼ per cent or whatever&mdash;but in terms of how best an arrangement can be come to so that all the parties concerned, that is, the widows whose standard of living is insufficient, the existing public servants and the State itself, how they can all come together and agree on some scheme which will do rather more justice than is being done at the moment.  One last word: I should point out the obvious fact that the present so-called <i>ex gratia</i> scheme costs the State little or nothing because these very small pensions payable to the pre-1968 widows involve at the same time a consequent saving to the State in widows' and old-age pensions.  In other words, the actual net cost to the State of this ungenerous provision they have made is probably little or nothing.  I would urge the Minister to speak to the Minister for Finance about this and to suggest that he ought to try and see whether anything can be done for these unfortunate people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish merely to associate myself with the remarks that have been made so eloquently by Senator Yeats.  I consider that these people are entitled to justice.  Their husbands while alive gave excellent service in the Departments of State. We all know that people who work in the civil service under the Government pay into a pensions fund during their term of service.  In other words, most of these pension funds are deferred payments&mdash;payments that a person while working would more or less be entitled to get but of which the State holds back a certain amount so as to build up a gratuity and pensions fund later on.  When the breadwinner dies before reaching the stage of receiving a gratuity or pension, it is only right and fair that adequate provision should be made for the widow who loses a husband at the time when the family is very young and when she has to make great sacrifice, accept a much lower standard of living and try to cater to the best of her ability for her family.  In a case such as this the Minister should bring it again to the notice of the Minister for Finance that there seems to be an injustice here and do his very best to try and have it rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): I thank the Seanad for the manner in which it has accepted the principle of this Bill.  As I said in my opening remarks, it is purely an enabling Bill to enable the Minister to create pension schemes and to tidy up the present system of such pension schemes.  It will eventually consolidate all the pension schemes into one document or one instrument. That is a highly desirable object and one which is accepted by the House in principle.  Indeed the only point that has been made on the Bill by Senators Yeats and Dolan is in regard to the pre-1968 civil service widows.  This is a topic that has been brought up in both Houses from time to time.  It may not, with all respect, be highly relevant on the Bill but I suppose it was not surprising that it should be raised. The position in regard to widows and children of civil servants serving on the 23rd July, 1968, is that they are <Col N="790" /> provided with pensions on the basis of contributions being paid by those officers to cover the risk of their predeceasing their wives.  Those who had retired or died prior to that date were not covered and they have paid no contribution.  Accordingly, their widows could not benefit under the contributory scheme.  Therefore, a special scheme was provided on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis as from 1st October, 1969, for widows and children of those who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory scheme. This enables pensions of one-half of the rate payable under the contributory scheme to be awarded to such widows.  The 1975 annual rate of expenditure for the public service, including civil servants, in respect of widows <i>ex gratia</i> pensions was approximately £3 million so that double the rate would increase the figure to around £6 million.  This figure does not allow for the possibility of other claims for compensatory increases&mdash;for example, social welfare, widows' improved benefits or lower contributions for members of the contributory civil service scheme.  The question of existing members of the contributory scheme making higher contributions to meet the cost of improving the <i>ex gratia</i> pensions was taken up with the staff side representatives but no positive reaction was obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be mentioned that because of the annual pension increase for public service pensioners the average <i>ex gratia</i> pension went up as from 1st July, 1975, by at least 29 per cent.  A further increase of around 11 per cent is due with effect from 1st July, 1976. Since the scheme was introduced in 1969 the rates have risen on average by approximately 173 per cent.  I have listened, as Senator Yeats indicated that I would, to the case he made on behalf of the pre-1968 civil service widows.  While I will certainly bring this point and the case made by Senator Yeats and Senator Dolan to the attention of the Minister for the Public Service, the position in regard to finance is as I have stated.  The post-1968 are being paid widows' pensions and orphans' pensions out of funds <Col N="791" /> provided by their husbands or subscribed by their husbands.  While the pre-1968 widows were not parties to the contributory scheme, they are being paid pensions on a purely <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  These pensions are increased from time to time.  However, I do not know whether the Senators will be in order in raising this on the Committee Stage.  If they are, I would suggest that they do that while the Minister, who is more familiar with this particular topic than I am, is present.  I imagine that, even if the remaining Stages of the Bill are taken today, the Minister for the Public Service will be available to handle it and to answer the points raised by the Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, first, I should explain to the Minister that I have referred frequently in the past to the case of the widows in question.  Before I go any further I should raise the question of the relevance of this, which is being raised rather by surprise, because the memorandum with this Bill is quite clear on this.  It says, in relation to section 2, that:</P>
      <P>In the interval between the passing of this Bill and the introduction of a consolidated scheme, a statutory scheme will be made which will provide retrospective cover for both the <i>ex gratia</i> and the contributory widows' and children's scheme.  At present the authority for payments under the latter schemes is given by way of approval for the annual Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that we are giving the Minister powers to make a statutory scheme covering these <i>ex gratia</i> or pre-1968 widows.  Therefore I am abundantly relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I should be so allowed by the Chair I do not intend going over the matters I raised already because the Minister has heard these points before.  The only point I should like to make again is that I suggested to the Minister for Lands when he was here that he might put it to the Minister for Finance, who is now here, that instead of talking all the time in terms of the cost to the State of £3 million or the cost to the present civil servants of 1¼ per cent of their superannuation, the Minister could get all the parties together and agree on some system of sharing.  For example, the State could pay one third or about £1 million, the public servants could pay one-third or 0.4 per cent extra in contributions, which one strongly suspects they would be willing to agree to.  Their refusal to pay the 1¼ per cent was based presumably on the point as to why they should pay it all when the State did not take on any of it, but they would agree, perhaps, to pay one-third and the remainder or part of it could come from the widows themselves in paying the contributions that they have expressed themselves as willing to pay.</P>
      <P>If the Minister could accept the justice&mdash;and he probably does&mdash;in equity of the claim of these widows of public servants for whom we all have responsibility, and that theirs is a standard of living which is not one that we ought to accord to them some equitable scheme could be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular approach which I made to the public servants in general left open the possibility of declaration by them that they were disposed to pay part of the cost, but unfortunately there was not expressed a willingness to pay even part of the cost.  I hope I am as generous as the next&mdash;sometimes I am faulted for my over generosity&mdash;but the State is not some strange institution. What means the State has available to it results from the willingness or otherwise <Col N="793" /> of taxpayers to provide the money necessary to provide what we know as <i>ex-gratia</i> widows' pensions equal to those in receipt of contributory widows' pensions which will amount to £3,250,000 as and from the 1st of July next.  Several inequities would arise even if taxpayers were to volunteer to accept an addition to their tax bill to meet that.</P>
      <P>It would mean that the people who are at present paying towards their contributory pensions would have a sense of grievance that other people were receiving pensions equal to what they were receiving although no contribution had been made by them or by the next of kin towards such pensions. Therefore, we would generate a demand that contributions towards pension schemes be abolished altogether, which would mean a further severe imposition on the general body of taxpayers to provide such pensions.</P>
      <P>We cannot escape from the practical rules which must exist in this area and where issues of principle arise, as they do arise here, as to whether contributory pensioners should receive more than non-contributory pensions.  If we applied those principles we would have to accept a situation in which those who have not contributed towards their pensions must receive a smaller pension than those who have contributed or who are still contributing and are building up an entitlement by way of an insurance to a pension in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite significant increases have been given in these pensions in recent years, and as I have pointed out on numerous occasions the cost-of-living index includes many items which I am sure are not in the general pattern of consumption of many pensioners, including expensive spirits and other items which are subject to tax.  It can be said that quite substantial increases have been given when you consider that there have been increases in pensions in the public sector far beyond the cost-of-living index.  I am not at all unsympathetic, but one has to balance all the conflicting issues which arise in this area.  If there was a willingness on the part of certain civil servants to make a contribution it would of course ease the burden <Col N="794" /> which the general body of taxpayers would have to meet.  But so far, although we argued on lines similar to those adopted by Senator Yeats, and I would hope with equal effect, we have not yet been successful in persuading the people concerned that they should make a contribution towards the cost of an improvement in the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to the question of contributory and non-contributory widows' pensions, and he may well be right that those who were paying contributions might have a grievance if those who had not paid contributions were to get the same pensions. The widows concerned have on a number of occasions said that they are willing to pay the contributions that their husbands were unable to pay because the scheme did not exist at the time of their service, and one can also make the point that the husbands had in fact during their period in the public service paid 3¾ per cent superannuation which they never lived to get.  Even taking the Minister's own comparison of the contributory and non-contributory widows' pensions he is not suggesting, I take it, that the non-contributory pension is as little as half that of the contributory.  It is very much more than half, and the tendency in recent years has been increasingly to bring one up near the other.  I am not sure what the figure is, I would have thought that the non-contributory pension was at least 80 per cent of the contributory.  It is much more than 50 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to speak of the widows' pensions schemes in general under the Social Welfare Acts.  I understood him to make that comparison, that as under those Acts the non-contributory was <Col N="795" /> less than the contributory, it should apply in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of principle whether they are State schemes or otherwise, pensions which are not contributed towards should not be of a level similar to schemes which are contributory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>The general social welfare pensions payable, the non-contributory, are not as little as half the contributory.  They are, I think, around 80 per cent or maybe even more of the contributory, and therefore the Minister's own comparison falls down in this case, because you have the situation that the non-contributory widows' pensions, that is, the pre-1968 widows, are half those received by widows whose husbands were fortunate that they lived long enough to be able to contribute. If the Minister were to bring in a new scheme so that the pre-1968 widows would have the same relationship to the post-1968 widows as is in the general social welfare Acts between the non-contributory and contributory, they would probably accept that.  I think it would be generally considered to be fair enough.  The Minister perhaps has a point in saying that there would be objections.</P>
      <P>There would be selfish objections, but I can see that there would be objections on the part of those who, because their husbands had contributed, were getting the full pension if those whose husbands had not been able to contribute were receiving the same pension.  Certainly, if the Minister would bring the non-contributory up to 80 per cent, or whatever is the prevailing figure under the Social Welfare Acts, then I think at least some element of justice would be done and he might consider working towards this end and not to be thinking in terms of the £3 million for the doubling of the amount of the lesser figure.  Should he go to the civil service associations and ask them to agree to adding, perhaps, one-third of a penny&mdash;one-third of 1 per cent&mdash; to their superannuation to pay for this, it might well be that he would get agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to help these people.  The <i>via media</i> which Senator Yeats has suggested would obviously be of some assistance to the people concerned.  We have discussed a number of different arrangements with the body of serving civil servants.  So far there has not been a readiness to make a contribution, but we will pursue this matter further and perhaps there will be a readiness.  I must at all times make this proviso-that the State finances are not such as to enable the State to expand on many well-deserving schemes which on their own are very difficult to argue against but, cumulatively, yielding to pressure for improvement of various welfare schemes, build up an enormous load which the general body of taxpayers then has to pay. Every time there is movement in one area, pressure builds up for movement in the other and we have to direct State expenditures here towards productive investment which will generate further wealth and the means of creating further wealth.  While it can well be argued that one should not ask the less well-off in the community to make sacrifices while this process is undergone, we cannot escape from the realities of economic life.  The State's prior attention has to be given for a long time to come towards the productive investment area and the employment-generation area and not in areas of the conferring of benefit unless those who are to receive the benefit make their own contribution towards it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point that Senator Yeats made about the widows themselves contributing towards the cost, I would point out that those who would be in a position to contribute would be the better-off of the <i>ex-gratia</i> widows and those who would be in most need of an improvement would probably, because of their present circumstances, not be in a position to contribute towards the cost.  Secondly, it is wrong to say that there is a parallel between a contributory scheme which is related to potential, but has unknown risks, and a scheme of paying compensation for loss which is known already.  There is quite a difference, <Col N="797" /> and I am sure Senator Yeats would appreciate that.  The two of them are not quite comparable, as I am sure Senator Ryan, if he were here, would understand.  I want to assure Senator Yeats and through him, the persons primarily concerned that I am not unsympathetic. I should hope it would be possible to have some progress in this area but frankly I cannot at present see that it would be possible to do so in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>One must accept the Minister's point.  Like any Minister for Finance, he has all kinds of claims upon him for spending more money, money which he has not got. This is a particular case, in the sense that it is not a question of spending money on some general scheme for the community as a whole.  It is a case where he has a very special responsibility for the widows of public servants who through no fault of their own were not able to contribute to the scheme, though their husbands contributed 3¾ per cent per year during their working lives.  The Minister must have regard to the fact that there are these people many of them over 70 and others, 80 or more, who are living in very poor conditions.  He ought to try to do something to improve their conditions.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that it would be difficult for the poorer widows, the ones we wish to benefit, to pay these 40 years contributions.  I understand the widows concerned had come to an arrangement with the Bank of Ireland that, should the scheme come in, the bank would pay the contributions concerned and would take in the pension for such period&mdash;about a year and nine months &mdash;in order to pay them off with interest and, when that would be regularised, the increased pension would be paid to the widows.  I do not think the Minister would need to be worried about the inability of the poorer widows to pay these contributions. That matter could be settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this section the Minister proposes to create a statutory scheme in the interval between the passing of this Bill and the introduction of a <Col N="798" /> consolidated scheme which will provide retrospective cover for these <i>ex-gratia</i> widows.  Up to now the authorisation has been given each year in the Estimates.  So he has to make a statutory scheme and this seems to be an opportunity for him to think again about this and see whether he can make even some mild improvements in the course of making this statutory scheme.  I would urge him to do so, but I would also like to ask whether these statutory schemes will be made by order and, if so, will the order be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Title>Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill, 1976: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta to finance their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company was set up under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, and began operations in April, 1972.  Their function is to provide reconstruction finance for industrial concerns which may be in danger of having to close down or suspend activities because they are unable to raise necessary capital from the normal commercial sources.  They must, however, be basically sound and be capable of becoming viable.  It is, therefore, an <Col N="799" /> important link in the chain of State assistance for industry.  The governing legislation requires that industrial concerns fulfil a number of conditions in order to be eligible for assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  The employment content and the capital employed in them must be significant, the owners must have made a reasonable contribution to the initial capital, prospects of profitability on a permanent basis must be reasonable and there must be evidence that failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level.  In this context industrial activity has been interpreted in the broadest possible terms to include all economic activities that can reasonably be described as being of an industrial nature.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, therefore, for the board of Fóir to consider applications thoroughly and with full understanding of all the implications.  In a period of economic difficulty such as we have recently experienced the task of the company has been especially onerous. However, while continuing to operate within the statutory criteria, the company have shown sympathetic understanding of the difficulties which some firms have encountered and have been able to provide the assistance which enabled the firms to remain in operation. In this way Fóir Teoranta have been able to avert dangerous threats to industrial production and employment while also preserving part of industry's productive capacity.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, of course, that some applications for assistance must be rejected because they fail to meet the tests applied by the company.  Most of the rejections have taken place because the applicant firm was unable to show that, even with assistance from Fóir Teoranta, it had a reasonable prospect of ultimate success as required by the Act.  Before such cases are rejected, Fóir Teoranta investigate the firm's circumstances and normally consider whether the firm might survive in association with some other group.  It is ironic that while the firms which fail attract publicity, there is little attention paid to the achievements of the <Col N="800" /> company and the success attained as a result of Fóir intervention.</P>
    <P>The grant of assistance by Fóir Teoranta does not, of course, guarantee success for a firm.  The difficult conditions of the past two years have interfered with the recovery of some firms to which aid was given by the company and have even contributed to the failure of some such concerns.  As opposed to this, however, some of the firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta over the past years are making notable progress, and most of those assisted are meeting their obligations to Fóir.</P>
    <P>To date Fóir Teoranta has disbursed £15.0 million and has commitments for a further £1.5 million.  A measure of the company's activity is that in slightly over four years it has provided assistance to some 175 firms with a total job content of about 30,000 people.  The bulk of Fóir assistance has been by way of loan finance, but it has also availed of its powers to take an equity stake in firms and to guarantee loans raised from financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Apart from providing finance the company takes all possible steps to strengthen the position of any applicant firm which, despite its immediate problems, has reasonable prospects of succeeding in the longer term.  Such steps frequently include investigation of association with a stronger firm, changes in management and at board level, and the introduction of consultants to deal with particular functions within a firm.  Inadequate or defective management constitutes one of the basic causes of the difficulties leading up to an application for assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  Many of the firms find it difficult to attract and retain persons of proven managerial calibre.  For this reason Fóir Teoranta established their own management services unit, the members of which are specialists in the main areas of management and are available for assignment to firms where assistance at managerial level is urgently necessary.  This has proved a valuable service to certain firms, and it also has the merit of enabling Fóir personnel to gain firsthand knowledge of the operations of some of the firms with which it is associated.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are reaching the <Col N="801" /> limit of their borrowing powers, which was fixed at £17.5 million by the amending Act of 1973.  Amending legislation to increase its resources is therefore necessary to enable the Company to continue the valuable work it has been doing to date. Section 2 of the Bill before the House proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £35 million, an increase of £17.5 million on the present limit.  On the basis of disbursements since the establishment of the company, the extension proposed should suffice for another three to four years depending on demands for reconstruction finance.</P>
    <P>Up to now the company has been almost entirely financed by borrowing from the Exchequer as the returns on the Company's share and loan investments including those taken over from its predecessor, Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, have been comparatively small so far.  While the company's income from investments and the repayment of loans may be expected to grow, it will be far short of the amount which it is likely to have to advance in respect of new applications for assistance, nor will it meet the cost to the Exchequer of providing the funds in the first instance.  It is proposed, therefore&mdash;in section 3 of the Bill&mdash;to raise from £17.5 million to £35 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the Company.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta provide an orderly procedure for assisting Irish firms, giving worth while employment, which are unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.  The services of the company have been of particular value in coping with the effects of the recent world-wide economic recession.  The proposed legislation will make available to Fóir Teoranta an additional £17.5 million to carry on their functions.  Apart from increasing the limits on the finance available to the company, no further changes in the legislation are considered necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of Fóir Teoranta under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, is a good example of forward thinking in regard to a problem which has, of course, become enormously aggravated since then.  I refer to the question of supplying loan capital, taking up share capital in firms which are potentially viable and have a capacity for profitability but which because of management problems primarily and others&mdash;such as cash flow problems-are just not making it.  They do not accord with ordinary commercial banking or financing criteria and have found themselves&mdash;and are still finding themselves&mdash;unable to raise the necessary finance.  Fóir reorganise their management structures so as to make themselves competitive in accordance with the basic profitability and viability inherent in the actual firms operations.</P>
      <P>That, in sum, is what Fóir Teoranta is about&mdash;to ensure that such firms do not go to the wall when they are inherently engaged in a potentially profitable productive operation but for one reason or another are not making a go of it.  Fóir Teoranta can step in and, rather than let the firm drift into bankruptcy or receivership, by judicious financing and management control contrive to get the firm back on the rails into a profitable position.  That was the thinking behind the establishment of Fóir Teoranta in 1972.  Certainly that Act has been proved a far-seeing one having regard to experience since 1972.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said in his statement, to date Fóir Teoranta have disbursed £15 million since 1972, has commitments for a further £1.5 million and, over that four-year period, have provided assistance for some 175 firms with a total job content of about 30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain constructive points I should like to make.  Firstly, I welcome entirely the doubling of the financial limits from £17.5 million to £35 million, within which the organisation will give financial assistance. That goes without saying. There was one matter which arose in <Col N="803" /> the Dáil debate which slightly perturbed me and which I should like the Minister to answer.  I would have expected at this very difficult stage in our economic development that the facilities offered by Fóir Teoranta would be utilised to a far greater degree. There was some suggestion in the debate in the other House&mdash;it is not in the Minister's brief here&mdash;that there was a reduction in the demand for the facilities of Fóir Teoranta in the current year.  That would appear to me to be serious, if that were the case, because it would seem that in this period of recession there should be a growing demand for the sort of facilities that Fóir Teoranta offer.  If there is a reduction in the demand for such facilities it would appear that there is an ominous ring about it in that <i>entrepreneurs</i> firms are not going for Fóir Teoranta finance and management help.  If it is indicative of a throwing in of the towel, as it were, on the part of <i>entrepreneurs</i> and firms I would regard that as serious.  Provided firms and <i>entrepreneurs</i> have the drive at present, are willing to have a go, expand and rescue an operation, put it right and move on; if that sort of capacity, spirit or will, call it what you will, is there, I would have expected in the present climate a growing rather than a reducing demand for the services of an organisation like Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister referred to this but I should like him to comment on it again because it is a valid point.  If my interpretation of it is wrong the Minister may reiterate what he said in the Dáil or put another interpretation on it.  But on a surface reading that would appear to be one interpretation of the reduction in the demand for Fóir Teoranta services in the current year.  If that is an interpretation it is one the Minister should look at because it is all important at present. Fundamentally I believe in the future economic progress of our economy; I regard present difficulties as being either Government engendered or due to factors outside our control.  I certainly do not think there is anything fundamentally wrong with our <Col N="804" /> economy and, provided the right leadership is given, I believe it can recover and improve.</P>
    <P>One of the agencies that can give that leadership is that being discussed in this Bill today.  If there is one aspect of Fóir Teoranta's activities which should be accentuated to a greater degree it is that of the early warning. I appreciate that the Minister and the board of Fóir Teoranta have that in mind already.  But it is very important that Fóir Teoranta are not regarded as a lender of last resort or anything of that kind, that the attitude to them at every level should be positive rather than negative.  The notion of them merely being a lender of last resort should be discounted positively.</P>
    <P>For that reason I welcome what the Minister says about the establishment within the organisation of the management services unit.  I should like to hear more on that aspect from the Minister in his reply.  That is a very important aspect.  They should not be regarded merely as a lender, as it were, in times of difficulty; the positive aspect of making available specialist management, in terms of personnel and advice at an early stage, is very important.  I have had experience of one or two instances of this&mdash; and the Minister bears it out&mdash;that a large proportion of the problems are management problems.  If there is a management services unit of this kind built up and expanded I believe this is the right sort of progressive approach.</P>
    <P>Side by side with that there should be a public relations drive within industry itself&mdash;through the CII, the trade unions and within the IMI&mdash; emphasising the positive aspects of Fóir Teoranta; that while they are a lender when the commercial institutions cannot come forward with the necessary finance, they are more importantly an advisory body, a body to whom industry can go for advice at an early stage with the utmost expectation of confidentiality.  Therefore when a businessman or company director foresees problems arising what they should do at that stage is go to Fóir Teoranta.  Possibly pre-emptive action can be taken at that stage with <Col N="805" /> more limited finance than would be possible at a much later fire brigade stage.  Before the fire starts at all the necessary pre-emptive action can be taken by providing limited finance and positive specialist advice.  It is in that area the board can make a very positive contribution.  I am certain that is the Minister's view as well. Certainly I am glad that that positive aspect of the board's activities in the form of the build-up of a management services unit is being encouraged.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make: is it really necessary to have the Minister for Finance coming in at this stage for every loan in excess of £250,000?  Again £250,000 was, I think, fixed in the Act of 1972.  As we all know that has been reduced considerably in value since then.  If it is not fixed in the Act it has been in practice, at any rate, that ministerial approval is sought for any loan in excess of £250,000.  Is that really necessary?  Should a more flexible approach not be adopted?  In all the circumstances of the difficult economic situation we have had over the past three years, the board's record has been a good one.  Why the restriction of £250,000?  It seems somewhat niggling and takes from the flexible sort of approach needed on the part of a board of this kind that has to deal with immediate business decisions in regard to financing and advice.  The record of the board has been very good in all the circumstances and would certainly warrant the sort of confidence that the Minister might place in them by having a much higher limit rather than circumscribing them in the way of having a £250,000 limit on their financial lending operation without ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister would agree&mdash; it has been the practice&mdash;that in all these cases, apart from the management aspect, there should be board representation in the case of any substantial investment, that there should be Fóir Teoranta representation on the board of the company concerned. Obviously it is not just enough to make the decision to lend money. There must be the decision to provide <Col N="806" /> specialist management personnel and supervision.  This should be an ongoing operation in which the company's progress can be monitored with, if necessary, the proper interlocking or merging with other companies subsequently, where it can be done for the company's benefit and the overall benefit of the operation.  That should be done as well, the necessary advice given and pressure applied to ensure that that is done.  I am certain that the Minister will respond to that aspect in a positive manner.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say except that this whole area of reconstruction of finance is all important and fundamental at present.  It is allied to what I am talking about and can render a very real service.  Allied to a growing participation at management and board level on the part of this agency, such companies can produce fruitful only results.  We on this side of the House welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome this Bill, of course.  The Minister's opening address contains quite an amount of information.  While he gives general figures in regard to finance and assistance given by Fóir Teoranta in recent years, a further breakdown of such figures would have helped us delve deeper into the subject.  For instance, a breakdown of the number of companies who found themselves in difficulties and sought assistance in the first instance: what were these types of industries, whether they were in the textile, engineering or small industries field and the type of assistance given by Fóir Teoranta, whether financial or managerial?</P>
      <P>Perhaps this is not the most opportune time to have a reappraisal of the activities of Fóir Teoranta and how they should perhaps better operate in the future.  As the Minister said in his address, recovery is about to commence in regard to industry here. Perhaps at some future date we will be able to delve more deeply into how we can improve Fóir Teoranta's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of the involvement of Fóir Teoranta in the difficulties industries have run into has been that <Col N="807" /> very often these industries find themselves in the position of not having undertaken any degree of rationalisation of their product, management or operative strength.  Difficulties have arisen also from lack of adequate productivity and from, worst of all, inadequate management.  It is unfortunate that these difficulties have been aggravated by a number of factors. First of all, the public relations exercise carried out, or perhaps not carried out at all, by a large number of these industries in difficulty, has been inadequate, inopportune and handled very badly.</P>
    <P>In quite a number of instances no notice was given to Fóir Teoranta and, worst of all, no notice of pending difficulty given to the unions representing the employees.  At some time in the future we will have to look at the activities of Fóir Teoranta, because in such assistance being available to small and large industries I foresee the difficulty being one of assistance being taken for granted: that industries which run into difficulty will feel they have a right to State assistance.  In my experience this assumption has extended to the factory floor and the workers concerned, who feel that help will be given them.  There is in all of this the concept that the State will always look after lame ducks.  We must be very careful lest such an assumption gathers strength in the future.</P>
    <P>There are certain criteria which any agency such as Fóir Teoranta should have regard to in a rescue operation. It is not good enough that, just because an industry has got into difficulties and because a certain type of industry has always given employment, it should be taken for granted that that particular type of employment should continue.  After all, this State in a very short period of 50 years has seen the majority of its work force rapidly transferred from certain categories of work into others.  On the foundation of this State the great majority of our work force were in the agricultural and domestic service fields.  Where are those two employment fields as regards the percentage <Col N="808" /> of our work force at present?  Fóir Teoranta's overall objective should be not only to retain jobs but, if necessary, to channel people towards other jobs.  If this involves the worst happening, then bodies like AnCO and the National Manpower Service, by stepping in and retraining people for future vacancies in another field, would be performing the most important national task in overall industrial structure.  The worst situation that can happen is that we might continue to keep alive bad jobs instead of trying to turn them into good jobs.  There should have to be a limit to the amount of assistance given by Fóir Teoranta in any particular case.  There should also have to be a limit on the number of times an ailing industry can go to Fóir Teoranta for assistance.  If the present economic situation is not the most opportune time to reappraise the activities of Fóir Teoranta, the above points are ones which could be considered when such a reappraisal can be tackled.</P>
    <P>By and large Fóir Teoranta have done a tremendous amount of good work.  The real benefits lie in the fact that they are there to assist ailing industries. It is desirable that those ailing industries would give a little more attention to advising Fóir Teoranta in adequate time, and perhaps seeking assistance in fields which are not entirely associated with financial subvention.  The management activities of small industries are perhaps most important.  In this respect Fóir Teoranta have found it very difficult to recruit management for a small industry which has run into difficulties.  No young management executive is going to take the risk of landing himself in a small industry which has had a bad performance record to date and which is seen at that time to be depending on the State for survival.  Perhaps it would be better if Fóir Teoranta were to send in, as it were, trouble shooters into industries who would be able to go from one industry to another having served perhaps six, nine or 12 months implementing proper management procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> I welcome this Bill.  I have no doubt that Fóir Teoranta's good work will continue.  If, at any future time, we have to come back here seeking a further broadening of the ambit of Fóir Teoranta, it will be readily given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  It is one which provides a procedure for assisting Irish firms giving worth-while employment who are unable to obtain their financial requirements from commercial sources.  That is of tremendous importance.  The people who set up this body had great foresight.  In a country such as this, only now awakening as far as industries are concerned, it is important that Fóir Teoranta be in existence.  So far as I am aware, they have performed their duties very satisfactorily in the past.</P>
      <P>We are asked in the Bill to increase the amount from £17 million to £35 million.  Bearing in mind the increase in inflation and so on that has taken place in recent years this seems quite reasonable.  I too, would have liked to have seen a list of the firms assisted in this way, not for any personal reason but because it might have given us a better insight into what has been done.  In the north-eastern area experience has shown that there has been a great fall-off in industrial employment. We are all well aware of the fact that there are almost 120,000 people unemployed and that this situation is gradually worsening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consequently it is of great importance that bodies such as Fóir Teoranta have available to them the capital and expertise so that they, in turn, can advise in every way possible, thereby ensuring that if at all possible existing industries be kept going provided they are viable and eventually able to finance themselves.  This is of particular importance in view of the employment content and of the tremendous difficulties it would create for a Government and our people if each week we found that, instead of curing the unemployment situation, it was worsening, when we would be paying pay-related benefits, unemployment assistance and so on, necessary when a country finds itself in a situation <Col N="810" /> such as that whereas, were such people working, we would be gaining in income tax and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not know what liaison exists between Fóir Teoranta and firms at present, but I would like to see the IDA, regional development organisations, county development teams, Fóir Teoranta and the management of these factories getting together to administer the necessary treatment before it is too late so far as any firm is concerned.</P>
    <P>An industry situated on the fringe of County Cavan, based on gypsum products, closed down recently.  It was associated with the gypsum plant in Kingscourt.  It has been said to me that one of the reasons for the closure was because it was interfering with the parent factory.  If that is so and if gypsum is available in that area and, as alleged, is within 14 feet of the surface, and is a viable product, some attempt should be made to ensure that such an industry is kept going.</P>
    <P>In County Cavan some time ago we heard reports that gas was found in small quantities.  Those reports were correct but no notice was taken of that and yet we are exploring in the North Sea and off the Cork coast using the most modern machinery in order to tap these resources.  Firms should interest themselves in this.</P>
    <P>Recently, many people in the footwear industry lost their jobs because firms found themselves in difficulty.  I do not know what consultation took place between Fóir Teoranta and the management of these firms, but textile and footwear industries which find themselves in difficulty should be given the best assistance, financial and advisory, by Fóir Teoranta so as to ensure that these people remain employed. There is a lot of unemployment in that area.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have a difficult job to perform but never was such a board more important than at present.  They should do everything to ensure that the industries we have do not go out of production, if possible.  If the market is available and the machinery is there it is a tragedy to see factories <Col N="811" /> going out of production.  Expert advice should be made available and the IDA should be consulted at an early stage if a firm experiences difficulty. The State has a big say because many of these factories have been assisted by State grants.  The full amount of these grants should not be paid all at once because it is important that there should be some tie to ensure that the State would not lose money.  It is important that jobs be created and work found for the unemployed. Fóir Teoranta should be able to ask for any assistance the Oireachtas can give in order to remedy the disastrous situation we have at present with regard to the unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of Bill which the Seanad is not qualified to comment on or to examine in a useful way.  It is perhaps appropriate that we are discussing it in an almost empty House on a hot June afternoon. If it were an isolated case it would be excusable but we are getting more and more Bills of this sort introduced into the Houses of the Oireachtas asking for more money in direct aid or for more borrowing power to different State agencies, in this case to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is not in a position to evaluate the performance of Fóir Teoranta, has not been provided by the Minister with adequate information about the success&mdash;if one can talk about success without having terms on which to evaluate success&mdash; the details of the breakdown of the firms assisted, the type of assistance given, the type of problems which Fóir Teoranta have met with in giving this assistance&mdash;the sort of information which could be available in order to evaluate the actual work being done by this agency.  I do not think this House should be asked to evaluate the performance of Fóir Teoranta in isolation from the other related State agencies.  It is an absurd exercise to come before the Oireachtas in this way and seek approval of further borrowing powers, which are borrowing powers from the State, in isolation from the work and <Col N="812" /> role of other State agencies such as the IDA, the ICC and, in a training capacity, AnCO.</P>
    <P>In other words, we should have the benefit of an overall Parliamentary view on the work of these agencies. We cannot get this sort of view until the famous long-promised and, as yet, still unestablished Committee on State Sponsored Bodies is set up.  A motion has been lying on the Dáil Order Paper for a very considerable time, but this Committee has not yet been established.  Therefore, the Houses of the Oireachtas are not evaluating on an overall basis the performance of State agencies in this or other areas. Despite this lack of evaluation and this lack of information Senators make a gallant effort.  I compliment Senator Markey, and the other Senators who spoke, on their attempt to respond in a useful way to the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>In referring to the performance of Fóir Teoranta the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The grant of assistance by Fóir Teoranta does not, of course, guarantee success for a firm.  The difficult conditions of the past two years have interfered with the recovery of some firms to which aid was given by the company and even contributed to the failure of some such concerns.  As opposed to this, however, some of the firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta over the past years are making notable progress. Most of those assisted are meeting their obligations to Fóir.</P>
    <P>That is so vague as to be meaningless. It gives no real idea to the Seanad of the performance of Fóir Teoranta, of how it operates in relation to other agencies, of whether it would regard its performance as successful.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>To date Fóir Teoranta has dispersed £15 million and has commitments for a further £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan regards this as evidence of great success.  I do not know if that is evidence of success; I do not know how to evaluate it; I do not know how I am supposed to respond as a Senator to this information.  I do <Col N="813" /> not know how we can possibly be satisfied that we are fortifying the democratic process in the House this afternoon.  We need a proper overall committee-based structure to do this. We need to know in much more detail the criteria.  We need to set down the policy guidelines for these State agencies.  It needs an overall coherent approach.</P>
    <P>Not only does the Oireachtas itself need to adopt that sort of coherent co-ordinated approach but I submit that at Ministerial level there is a very strong need for a co-ordinated and cohesive approach.  I do not understand why it is the Minister for Finance who introduces a Bill in relation to Fóir Teoranta and is the Minister with responsibility there, and why, in relation to the IDA, it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce and why, in relation to AnCO, it is the Minister for Labour.  Surely, this must only aggravate the lack of coherence, a lack of co-ordination at Ministerial level?  It is time in face of the gravity of our economic situation, the critical unemployment, the difficulties for industry in Ireland, that we have some sort of economic Minister with responsibility for the related agencies in this field which are providing assistance to firms, which are providing attraction to industry coming to the country and which are providing training for employees in these firms.  Surely, instead of going on holidays for five-and-a-half months, we could apply ourselves to thinking about a rationalisation both at the Parliamentary level and at Ministerial level?</P>
    <P>The sort of problems this country faces at the moment only sharpen an awareness of the farcical exercise of bringing in a brief Bill looking for greater borrowing power for State agencies.  It is a farcical exercise because we do not have sufficient information on which to assess the reasons for increasing £17½ million to £35 million.  It is a farcical exercise because we have not defined the criteria to evaluate the performance of the particular agency that we are allowing greater borrowing powers to today.  It is farcical because we are not judging the State agency in the overall context <Col N="814" /> of the performance of other agencies in a related field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill not because of its successes or failures as indicated in the Minister's statement. The real basis on which I support the Bill is the fact that 175 firms have been helped with a 30,000 workforce, and this is a great influencing factor to me, particularly when dealing with a world-wide economic recession.  I would be the first to admit that this is a very pragmatic approach to welcoming any Bill but, nevertheless, in the type of society and times we are living in that is the only approach I can have to it.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Robinson's view about us not having sufficient information about the activities of Fóir Teoranta and a breakdown and so on so that we could examine it extensively. Since that is not available I am confined to dealing with this in a pragmatic way.  I would welcome an opportunity of seeing exactly how these State bodies function.</P>
      <P>Possibly when the Fianna Fáil Minister introduced the Fóir Teoranta Bill in 1972 the intention was very good but it looks like a glorified version of the Guinness Workers' Employment Fund where the Guinness workers paid one shilling per week to assist other people to keep jobs that were in danger of going out of existence. Speaking in ratio to the amounts of money, the Guinness Workers' Employment Fund did nearly as good a job if one takes it that the people were only contributing one shilling a week.  They were, in fact, sending people out to have a look at the small firms affected, were providing a service for them and examining their books.  There is a similarity there.  I do not know whether this type of body is the best to help us over our ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, while it may not be strictly relevant to this particular Bill, not much assistance is given in the private enterprise area to industrialists. I would be delighted if somebody would introduce me to somebody who by their own initiative without State help or assistance or the <Col N="815" /> many grants that come from the State would show me an Irish entrepreneur who by his own efforts, endeavours, ideas and imagination and without dependence on public money brought a substantial amount of employment to the country.  I welcome the Bill in a pragmatic fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWalsh" hpid="Miss Walsh Miss Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. While I find myself in agreement in part with some of what Senator Robinson has said, I also find that her view is rather pessimistic of the operation of Fóir Teoranta.  I would not be as incredulous of the value of this State agency as she is.  From my own knowledge in my constituency this year it has done magnificent work and the results can be seen today in the operation of firms which otherwise would have gone to the wall.</P>
      <P>The statement made by the Minister in introducing the Bill that it is inevitable that some applications for assistance must be rejected because they fail to meet the test applied by the company is interesting.  Some of the Senators who have spoken seem to lay most of the blame for failure of companies on mismanagement.  While in certain instances a deal of the blame can be attributed to bad management, it is not always the case, because some firms depend on world market trends.  In these days of economic recession and falling world prices it is not always the fault of management.  I would like to think that these tests which have been referred to will be applied more stringently by Fóir Teoranta with regard to forthcoming applications.  I would hate to see a situation where workers would become complacent, that all they have got to do is to cry wolf and in walks a State agency to rescue the operation.  I would like to think that everything possible will be done to keep a firm in existence, that all these tests will be applied and that Fóir Teoranta assistance will be a last resort.</P>
      <P>I agree that it must be applied for in time.  There is no point in closing the stable door after the horse has gone as some industries have done and then blamed Fóir Teoranta for not having rescued them in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I welcome the Bill.  It is money well spent.  Senator Harte referred to the employment situation.  If for no other reason than the fact that it maintains the workforce in factories suffering from the economic recession, it is well worth while.</P>
    <P>I agree, in part, with Senator Robinson when she says that closer liaison and more stringent tests should be applied to the State agencies in general and that we should have a report with regard to their operations. Many of the State agencies I disagree entirely with, but in this instance I wholeheartedly agree that Fóir Teoranta is well worth while.  I agree with the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my gratitude to all Members of the House, with one exception, for their contributions.  While I am pleased to have heard the other contributions I cannot say I am gratified with what was said.  I am sure the Senator has quickly identified herself.  I am referring to Senator Robinson, and I shall come in a moment to what she said.  Her criticism was not deserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual reports of Fóir Teoranta give detailed information about the firms assisted and the money advanced by them.  For instance, the most recent report, for the year ended 31st December last, contains in addition 36 supplementary notes which deal with the more significant advances which have been made and some of the more significant enterprises which have been involved. Short of reading out a similar list once again and giving such information once again to the Seanad I could not have given very much more information.  In the nature of things, a great deal of the affairs of the firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta should be treated confidentially.  It would be harmful to the best commercial interests of many of the concerns in question were the full weaknesses and possibilities for those firms to be identified in public.  I can entirely accept, however, the desirability of having an early establishment of the committee which I proposed should <Col N="817" /> be established to allow the Oireachtas to review commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is not the Government's fault, and particularly it is not the fault of the Minister for the Public Service whose responsibility it is to move the motion, that it has not been taken, but as soon as time is afforded in the other House for the motion I will move it.  I am ready, willing and anxious to move it and to see the formation of such a body because it would help understanding of what commercial concerns are doing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, time could have been found since last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and of the way in which they dovetail their work.  I was chastised on the last occasion I addressed the Seanad because I seemed to be implying criticism of the doings in another place and I am not putting on record my anxiety to see this motion moved and time being made available to move it.  There has been immense pressure on Parliamentary time, but I would hope that people revitalised by the pending recess will find time and a willingness to take the motion early on resumption so that the committee may be established.  I do not blame Senators, Members of the Dáil or the public generally, for not first reading the matter which they receive in annual reports from State companies. At best we tend to put them aside and, at the same time, accompanying them with a resolution of intention to read them but usually other pressures intervene between the resolution and its implementation.  In fact detailed information is given in the annual report, and Fóir Teoranta are always only too anxious to accommodate any Members of the Oireachtas who wish to discuss with them particular problems or the overall workings of Fóir Teoranta in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the other specific points raised throughout the debate.  The beginning of last year opened with a considerable growth in demand for the services of Fóir Teoranta.  This demand grew so fast and the amounts which were sought from Fóir Teoranta were <Col N="818" /> so considerable that half way during the year I doubled the proposed allocation of money for Fóir Teoranta for 1975.  We had allocated £4 million which was an increase from, if I recollect rightly, £2.5 million in 1974 to £4 million in 1975.  By June we saw a possible need to increase the figure to £8 million, which I did in the June budget of last year.  In fact, the additional £4 million was not required, only £0.8 million was used and the total for the year was only £4.8 million as against £8 million anticipated. What happened was that the impact of the recession throughout 1974 and 1975 identified the weak firms.  It was quite clear that a number of these were related to the construction industry and quite an amount of their problems were associated with over purchase at a time of very rapid rises in cost of materials.</P>
    <P>Other firms got into difficulties arising out of the global recession and the domestic recession too.  These weaknesses were identified and it is not unlikely that a lot of these firms would have got into trouble eventually anyway, but the speed with which they got into trouble and the coincidence was much greater because the recession came upon us all so rapidly and so dramatically.  Having been identified, help was given and they have restructured themselves. They are now in a much healthier position to face not merely the recession but also to take advantage of the possibilities of growth which are now there and which will grow in the years to come.</P>
    <P>It is not extraordinary that having collapsed in the first belt of the recession the weak ones are now fewer and that so many firms are not coming.  That is one aspect of it.  The other aspect is that many firms are working well under capacity at the present time because the demand is not there for the product.  Therefore, they have little need for additional capital to expand at a time when, even if they did expand, they would not be able to sell their product, but come an acceleration of growth and of market possibilities we anticipate there will again be further demand made upon <Col N="819" /> Fóir for assistance.  Our plea now, the one that we have voiced again and again and that Fóir repeatedly advances to all the financial institutions and commercial institutions, including the private banks, State agencies, the IDA, Córas Trachtála and so on, is that firms should not wait until they get into serious trouble before looking to Fóir for help.  Fóir Teoranta is not merely a fire brigade service; it is also a service to give people advice as to how to stop a fire breaking out in the first instance.  It is more anxious to give advance help to firms to avoid difficulties than to have to put in a lot of money and effort to try to prevent a collapse at the last minute.  If everybody understood the real purpose of and the most helpful way in which Fóir can help we would be advancing on the right lines.</P>
    <P>There are, in fact, monthly meetings of officials from the Departments concerned in the field of manufacturing industry, and Fóir Teoranta is concerned with manufacturing industry and not with other areas of business.  The monthly meetings take place between officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Credit Company and Fóir Teoranta.  Senator Robinson asked why the Minister for Finance is involved; he is involved because Fóir Teoranta was set up under the Ministry of Finance because it was closely associated with the Industrial Credit Company.  Indeed, it still calls upon the services of the Industrial Credit Company to provide it with the necessary management and assessment skills.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the development of Fóir, and the way in which I would see it as best being in a position to help &mdash;in preventing difficulties arising by giving adequate assistance, not merely financial but managerial, in good time &mdash;I have urged, and the Government have accepted, that responsibility should be transferred to the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the necessary steps in that direction will be taken shortly.  I am sorry that they <Col N="820" /> have not been completed long before now.  I have been anxious to rid the Department of Finance of a number of areas of activity which I consider could be better conducted by other Departments because they have the field workers experienced in the areas in question.  The Department of Finance should have overall economic and financial management and that is enough for any one ministry to be concerned with without also trying to provide the field services ranging from the National Stud to manufacturing industry rescue services.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the figure of £¼ million ceiling should be kept in relation to assistance which must receive Government approval.  It is not written into the Statute of 1972, but such a ceiling was originally provided in relation to assistance provided by the Industrial Development Authority.  The number of concerns which have received assistance of that sum is about ten or so. It is not many.  It is proper that where substantial amounts of public money are involved and substantial employment is involved the Government should be consulted.  Fóir have never complained that this was in any way a hindrance to their work and there has been no undue delay, as far as I am aware, by our predecessors or by ourselves in Government in processing any applications which involved assistance of more than £¼ million.  I should like to correct the figure of ten which I mentioned earlier, 15 is the total number of cases where assistance in excess of £¼ million or more has been given in a period of four years.  So 15 out of 175 indicates that there is not any tremendous burden of work thrown on to Government by this provision and it is no hindrance to the workings of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey struck the right note when he expressed his desire that Fóir would operate as a trouble shooter. This is the function of the managerial services unit.  It has been strengthened in the last year.  I would like to see it strengthened further because quite a number of the firms that have met with difficulties met with them not for financial reasons but because of managerial weaknesses.  Once young, dynamic <Col N="821" /> managers have straightened things out it has been possible for these firms, with that assistance and with their financial arrangements restructured, to stand on their feet.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening speech, it is a pity that so much attention has been given to the failures, which are very few when compared with the tremendous overall success.  A great deal of the success was not due to providing managerial services or to direct money from Fóir by way of shares, or equity, or loan assistance, but simply to giving guidance to the firms as to where they could get assistance from the private sector and from State agencies.  All these services have strengthened many firms and enabled them to face the problems of the present and the opportunities of the future.</P>
    <P>Any Members who are looking for immediate additional information should look at the annual reports.  If there are any questions arising out of their review of such reports which they would like me or Fóir themselves to answer, by all means let them put their questions.  We will welcome them and be only too happy to assist in giving replies.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey referred to the possibility of Fóir giving assistance towards training and retraining.  It is important that the State should give assistance in this area.  Even in the midst of very high unemployment, we have bottlenecks where a number of activities cannot be engaged in through lack of skilled people.  That is the greatest of all ironies and is something we wish to avoid.  The agency to provide training and retraining services is AnCO.  Fóir could advise an interested concern that they could get assistance from AnCO.</P>
    <P>Arising from the pace of life, many of them have not been aware of the multitude of services available and which could have been availed of in good time to prevent the collapse which ultimately came.  Fóir and the other State agencies, meeting together as frequently as they do, ensure that there is a better feeding-in of all the <Col N="822" /> services and that they are moved in the right direction.</P>
    <P>There is no need to have any change in the criteria of eligibility which are set out in the original Act. In the circumstances of 1972 those criteria were applied with greater rigidity than now.  I do not suggest changing the criteria because circumstances have changed.  What we should do is to consider how these criteria should be applied in changed circumstances.  When we have, as now, a much greater number unemployed, it is obviously desirable to help even small industries in an urban area, because any addition to the number of unemployed is something to be avoided at present.  In more normal times&mdash;and please God they are not too far away&mdash;when we can reduce the overall number of people unemployed, it would be appropriate that the application of the criteria should be changed again.</P>
    <P>The criteria involve not merely the ultimate viability of a firm but also that the loss of employment would be significant in the area in which the industry is placed.  A loss of 50 people in an area which is sparsely provided with industrial activities is more serious than the loss of employment in an urban area where there might be other opportunities for industrial employment.  At a time of considerable unemployment, as at present, we consider that any number of unemployed persons is undesirable.  If unemployment can be avoided at a reasonable price, then that price should be paid.  I want to emphasise that Fóir have not had to pay a high price for their success&mdash;and it is a record of success.</P>
    <P>Some people consider assistance from Fóir Teoranta as the kiss of death, like a bankruptcy or receivership. It is no such thing.  It was never intended to be such and people should not consider it in that way.  If people consider it in that way it could hamper the very work of Fóir Teoranta.  If traders and creditors were not prepared to trade normally with firms assisted by Fóir Teoranta, it would hamper the operations of <Col N="823" /> Fóir Teoranta, and I am sure nobody would wish that to be so.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the remarks of Senators Harte and Walsh and all the other Senators who added words of encouragement to Fóir Teoranta.  If Senator Robinson had had time to read the annual report I am sure that she too would be pleased with all the work Fóir have done and would see the need to increase the capital so that the work will continue.  Needless to say, the money will not be advanced unless and until a need is established and, if not, there is no loss arising to anybody by virtue of increasing the statutory authority to increase the advances if such should be necessary.  If it is not necessary it is all the better; if it is, we will be doing the right thing.</P>

    <Title>National Stud Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the share capital of the National Stud Company Limited.  The company were formed on the enactment of the National Stud Act, 1945, with a share capital of £250,000.  The share capital was increased to £500,000 in the National Stud Act, 1953, and to £2 million in the Act of 1969.  The company's shares are held by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company operate the National Study at Tully, County Kildare.  They have seven stallions which are available to breeders throughout Ireland for the service of approved mares. The fees charged range from £100 for the stallion &ldquo;Linacre&rdquo; bought in 1965 to £2,000 each for the more recent acquisitions, &ldquo;Sallust&rdquo; and &ldquo;African Sky&rdquo;.  All fees are charged <Col N="824" /> with &ldquo;no foal no fee&rdquo; and &ldquo;live foal&rdquo; concessions.  The company also have seven mares for breeding whose progeny are sold as yearlings.</P>
    <P>The entire stud farm comprises 850 acres.  In recent years the company are paying increasing attention to the management of the farm in order to increase their output of cattle and crops.  They now produce almost their entire fodder requirements and, given satisfactory agricultural prices, hope to show a substantial profit on the farm in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The stud has also become an important centre of education and research. A six-month training course in stud management is held at the stud each year for boys and girls in the age group 18-25.  The demand for places is exceedingly high and many students from abroad have taken these courses.  The company also conduct short refresher courses for stud farm employees, and seminars and &ldquo;open-days&rdquo; for horsebreeders.  The stud is also well known for its regular conducted tours for visitors from Ireland and abroad.  The company engage in research into stud management and disease control and co-operate with the Agricultural Institute and other bodies in various areas of equine research.</P>
    <P>They provided the site and buildings for the Racing Apprentice Centre of Education and help in the organisation of courses and the provision of lectures.  Finally, the company have responsibility for the Japanese Gardens which continues to attract large attendances.  The total number of visitors to the gardens in 1975 was 27,000.</P>
    <P>The company would like to contribute further to the development of the bloodstock industry, to improve their education and research facilities and to cater for the growing number of visitors.  With this in mind they have formulated a five-year development programme which envisages an increase in the number of stallions and mares at the stud, extra stabling, laboratory and research facilities, a museum of the Irish horse and possibly a health farm for horses.  Discussions <Col N="825" /> are being held with the company about the financial and other implications of the programme.</P>
    <P>As the company are approaching the statutory limit on their share capital, the Government have agreed to raise the figure to £5 million. Shares will as heretofore be taken up by the Minister for Finance.  The amount to be taken up from time to time will be related to the company's approved programmes and the general budgetary situation.  I would also hope that in the future the company will be able to build up a capital fund to enable them to replace bloodstock and other assets in part from their own resources.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill the Government are acknowledging the good work done by the company over the years and showing their confidence in the future of the bloodstock industry. We have every reason to feel proud of the National Stud.  I wish to thank the directors and staff for their work and wish them every success in their plans for the future.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains the usual definitions.</P>
    <P>Section 2 increases the share capital of the company to £5 million from the existing £2 million as fixed in the 1969 Act.  It has also been decided to increase the company's borrowing limits.</P>
    <P>Section 3 increases the maximum amount which may be borrowed by the company from £0.2 million to £0.5 million.  Borrowing is subject to ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the pay of the company's chief officer.  As part of general policy on remuneration in the public service, it is desired to avail of this legislation to bring the chief officer's pay under ministerial control. Similar provisions have been made in recent legislation affecting other State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the accounts to be kept by the company, the auditing of accounts and the submission of accounts and annual reports to the <Col N="826" /> Minister for presentation to each House of the Oireachtas.  There is no change of substance but a modern text replaces provisions which were included in the 1945 and 1953 Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is another modernising provision.  It has become standard practice to provide that, where a member of the board of a State-sponsored body is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann or nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas, he shall cease to be a member of the board.  Similarly, sitting Members of either House may not become members or employees of the board.  Employees of a State-sponsored body stand seconded from their employment from the date of nomination if nominated as Members of Seanad Éireann or nominated for election to either House.  There are no such provisions in the National Stud Acts. Section 6 corrects this omission.</P>
    <P>Section 7 arises from a decision of the Government to transfer direct responsibility for certain State-sponsored bodies from the Minister for Finance to other Ministers.  One of these bodies is the National Stud Company for which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will in future have primary responsibility. The National Stud farm is already vested in the Minister for Agriculture and he has a number of statutory functions in relation to the stud.  The principal change now effected is to give him the function of appointing the directors of the company, subject to consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 8 repeals the accounting provisions in the 1945 Act and repeals the 1953 and 1969 Acts in full.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I come from an area where bloodstock is famous, Tipperary, I regret to say that horse racing is something about which I know very little.  Apart from the fact that in Tipperary we have bred some outstanding horses, horses that have won all the big events, both on the flat and in steeplechasing, I am well aware of the great <Col N="827" /> employment which this industry is giving.  I venture to say that were it not for the number of workers employed in stud farms and racing stables, we would have very few agricultural workers in Tipperary.  That is one of my reasons for supporting this Bill, which provides for increasing the share capital of the National Stud.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that the reason for seeking this extra capital is that the National Stud wish to buy extra bloodstock.  This is something which we all welcome.  In one passage of his speech the Minister mentioned that the entire stud farm comprises 850 acres.  I was not aware that the stud farm was that big.  To us in Tipperary, 850 acres is a great amount of land.  It surprised me to hear the Minister say that they hoped to show a substantial profit on the farm in the years ahead.  That suggests that the stud farm has not made a profit in the past.  The Minister has often said that farmers are pretty well off.  If people with 850 acres are unable to make a profit, I do not know how he can expect small farmers in Kildare and elsewhere to show a profit.</P>
      <P>In reading the Dáil Official Report I notice that mention was made of a new road which Kildare County Council were supposed to build through the National Stud, and it was suggested that that should not happen. I would not like to see it happen, but at the same time I believe that stud farms should be classed the same as every other farm when it comes to road improvements.  If it is necessary for Kildare County Council to build a road&mdash;and I have no doubt it is, as the main road in the area is a very narrow road&mdash;and to take land from the National Stud to do so, I see nothing wrong about it, because they would do that with a dairy farmer or any other farmer.  Only a few years ago another stud farmer in county Kildare succeeded in preventing the ESB from putting poles across his land.  I would not like to see the racing people held that much above the ordinary farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that responsibility for the National Stud is to be transferred <Col N="828" /> from the Department of Finance to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I always felt that State bodies should be the responsibility of the relevant Minister, be it in regard to agriculture or industry.  I hope that, when responsibility for the National Stud is transferred to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will have the final say and will not have to go with cap in hand to the Minister for Finance for more money for some project to be carried out by the National Stud.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries should have money to meet the future needs of the National Stud.  Any stud farm of 850 acres charging high fees should eventually be able to pay its way and should not be asking the Government for money.</P>
    <P>The racing industry is an important industry as far as agriculture is concerned. As well as giving employment it is of interest to tourists.  As a member of the Council of Europe, I have been taken on tours in other countries. Most of the tours are to cathedrals and museums.  When visitors come here we have brought them instead to the National Stud, the Japanese Gardens and places of that kind.  They have all told us they were far more interested in them than what we saw.  I do not want to denigrate cathedrals or museums, but you can get tired looking at them.</P>
    <P>There are to be only five members on the board.  The view was expressed in the other House that the board should be increased to nine.  I believe it should.  I think that five for such a big establishment is very small.  I am not sure how many board members there are in the Sugar Company; there are more than five, anyway.  The Sugar Company deals with, you might say, only one thing&mdash;sugar beet.  A horse-breeding board has to deal with horse racing, horse breeding and everything like that.  Even at this stage the Minister should consider increasing the number on the board to at least seven.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn from the Dáil debates that it costs so much to keep mares at the National Stud.  It <Col N="829" /> appears that certain stud owners in this country were keeping mares for £5 and that that it was costing £25 in the National Stud.  I do not believe it is possible to keep a mare anywhere for £5, and I suppose even £25 is not all that high.  However, I think that for the sake of the small breeder the National Stud should keep the mare at the same rate as the small stud owner. If the small stud owner can keep the mare at a certain price, I see no reason why the National Stud should not do it.</P>
    <P>There is just one point in the section dealing with nominations for the Dáil or Seanad.  While I agree that a member of a board should not be a Member of either Houses of the Oireachtas, I still think the fact that you are nominated for such a position should not disqualify you from being a member of this board or of any other board.  As far as horse racing is concerned, the Irish Bloodstock Breeders' Association have a nomination to the Seanad.  I am sure that the Minister would be thinking of selecting someone from that body to be a member of the National Stud Board because that association embraces nearly every horse breeder in the country.</P>
    <P>Now the danger I see is that you have people in this country who are very interested in horse racing and they are also very interested in politics.  They might make a decision that they cannot be involved in both.  If that man or woman decides to remain on as a board member of the National Stud or of any other board, we might be losing their services as a politician.  On the other hand, you could apply it the other way: men in politics might not take an active part as a member of the board of the National Stud.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say about the Bill.  I hope that it will not be necessary for this Minister or any other Minister to come before us again asking for extra capital because, as has been pointed out, the stud farm should be able to pay its way in a very short time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for his remarks.  I had under contemplation <Col N="830" /> since the Dáil and even before then the possibility of increasing the size of the present board.  It is sometimes argued that small is beautiful.</P>
      <P>If that be so, one should not interfere. The present board are working very successfully.  The need to increase the board does not arise because of any special problems that have so far arisen.  However, I anticipate that the board's responsibilities may increase in the years ahead.  Therefore, if the Seanad is to be agreeable, even at this late stage, it is proposed to move an amendment on Committee Stage increasing the number from five to seven.</P>
      <P>I would not think that a board of nine would be justified.  While the board has serious responsibilities, they are not such as to require the detailed contributions that other concerns might require.  For instance, the need to have representational interest in the Sugar Company necessitates quite a large board.  I think the same would not apply to the National Stud, but perhaps we could reach a compromise that the figure of seven would be more than adequate to meet the responsibilities and opportunities facing the board in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I think the fees charged by the board are reasonably in line with fees generally in the country; there are many studs that charge a great deal more than £25 a week.  I do not know where the figure of £5 came from, but it does not relate to 1976.  If any person is providing accommodation at that price now they must be losing heavily on it.  The National Stud is not in fact a profit making agency.  It has never paid any dividends on the money advanced to it by the State. When you consider that the State insists on getting some dividends&mdash; often a lot less than commercial rates &mdash;from other concerns, including the concerns assisted by Fóir Teoranta, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the National Stud should also make some payment in respect of the costly capital which it receives from the State, but it is not doing it and has not done it to date.  I would hope the position can be remedied in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> Senator Ryan pointed to the farm not having made profit and asks me to translate that particular experience into general attitudes in relation to the profitability or otherwise of farming. Of course, it would be very wrong to argue from the particular to the general. I should like to congratulate the board, the general manager and the staff on the tremendous improvements that have been made in the running of the farm in recent years, which is not run for the sake of commercial profits as much as for the purpose of providing fodder for the horses that are stabled at the stud.  In recent times I have been emphasising the need to run it at a profit because it is wrong that such valuable and productive land should not be used to its full potential.  I am glad to say that, as a result of great dedication and effort on the part of management, there has been a significant improvement in this area, which is something I am sure the House commends.</P>
    <P>I trust this meets most of the points mentioned by Senator Ryan.  I would not disagree with most of what he said, but perhaps I would not have the same emphasis.  I can only hope that the Kildare County Council, the National Stud and all other interests will find a satisfactory solution in the not too distant future to the question of the provision of a new road across the Curragh of Kildare which I think is the most hazardous part of the main road from Dublin southwards.  Whatever about the need to cater for our bloodstock, there is a need to cater for human beings who have to travel that road.  The sooner a solution is found to that problem the better.  I am sure it will be possible to arrive at a solution which will not do serious harm to the horse-breeding industry.</P>

    <Title>Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) (Agreement) Bill, 1976: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to approve the acceptance by the State of the agreement establishing a financial support fund of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and to provide for the participation by the State in the fund.  The text of the agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to make two points.  First, this agreement has not yet come into force.  Indeed, given the majorities necessary to bring the agreement into force it is likely to be some time before the fund comes into operation.  Secondly, it is certainly not expected that Ireland will be seeking finance from the fund if and when it is set up.  Our purpose in supporting the agreement is to involve ourselves, with our OECD partners, in what we see as a useful international co-operative measure to boost confidence in the international system.  Of course, should <Col N="833" /> the agreement succeed in this objective all member countries will benefit.</P>
    <P>The idea of a financial support fund emerged in the context of the very large balance of payments deficits recorded by many industrial and developed countries following the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 and 1974. One of the main effects of these increases was to cause a sudden and unprecedented transfer of wealth from oil-importing to oil-exporting countries. Since the oil producers as a whole were in the short term unable to absorb imports of an equivalent value from the oil consumers, many of the oil-consuming countries, including Ireland, were faced with the problem of financing the corresponding deficits in their balance of payments.  In the event the recycling problem as it came to be known&mdash;the passing of funds from oil importers to exporters and back again either directly or by way of loans through the international money markets&mdash;did not create any major payments crisis.  Nevertheless doubts about the ability of individual countries and the international financial system in general to manage the massive flows of capital involved did contribute to the air of uncertainty current at that time.</P>
    <P>In this situation the agreement to establish the OECD Support Fund was seen as indicative of the industrial countries' intention to work together to meet the problems facing the world economy.  Thus, although the immediate need for a fund is now less, the carrying through of the original idea will serve to lessen the pressure on member countries to resort to unilateral measures to reduce deficits in their trading balances.</P>
    <P>International co-operative measures of this kind do not of course remove the necessity for prudent financial policies in each country.  What the fund is designed to do is to contribute the kind of stability to the general international financial atmosphere which allows each country to adopt the internal policies appropriate to its situation.</P>
    <P>Let me now briefly describe the main features of the fund.  Membership <Col N="834" /> of the fund is confined to OECD countries and all the member countries of the OECD, including Ireland, have signed the agreement setting up the fund.  The majority of OECD countries have taken the necessary measures to implement the agreement.  Most of these countries have in fact gone on to ratify the agreement.  The agreement will come into force when member countries with at least 90 per cent of the quotas making up the fund have ratified it. The agreement may also be brought into force for themselves by the unanimous decision of at least 15 member countries of the OECD with at least 60 per cent of the quotas who have ratified the agreement.</P>
    <P>The basic function of the fund as such is to lend money to member countries who cannot finance their balance of payments deficits from normal sources, that is, it will be a source of last resort.  Applicants for loans will be expected to have first drawn down all other reasonable sources of finance.</P>
    <P>The fund will be financed by member countries on the basis of quotas assigned to them.  A member country's quota reflects its relative economic weight.  The total of quotas, amounting to 20 billion Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund or £13 billion at current exchange rates, constitutes the fund.  Quotas determine a country's: maximum liability to lend to the fund; general level of access to the fund's resources; and voting rights.  Ireland's quota is SDR 120 million or about £80 million, that is, 0.6 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>In the event of the fund approving a loan to a member country, the fund will raise the money needed in two ways: either on the basis of the collective undertaking of all the member countries, or; from individual member countries directly.</P>
    <P>Should the fund seek direct financing the member approached has the option of making a direct advance to the fund or providing an individual undertaking on which the fund can <Col N="835" /> borrow the necessary amount.  It is envisaged that the fund will normally proceed on the basis of undertakings from the member countries. There are elaborate provisions in the agreement to ensure that the burden of providing finance for loans and risks on loans made by the fund will be shared by member countries in proportion to their appropriate quota level in the fund.</P>
    <P>Loans by the fund will be subject to stringent economic policy conditions and the approval of different voting majorities of member countries depending on the amount of the loan to be provided.  Voting is on the basis of quota strength but for most decisions a majority of the members as such is also required.</P>
    <P>The lending powers of the fund will continue in force for two years from the entry into force of the agreement. The agreement may, however, be amended and its lending life perhaps extended by a unanimous decision of the members subject to the completion of any further legislative processes which may be necessary should this occur.</P>
    <P>The fund will be run by a governing committee on which all the members will be represented.  There will also be an advisory board.  The secretariat will be provided by the OECD.  The fund will have the usual immunities and privileges of an international organisation.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in the Bill are similar to the arrangements which apply to the International Monetary Fund and the EEC medium-term assistance schemes.  In brief the Central Bank of Ireland will handle the State's financial transactions with the fund up to the winding up of the fund.  The administrative arrangements in this connection will be settled in discussions between the Central Bank and my Department. In view of the acceptance of final liability by the Government in section 6 of the Bill, any policy decisions will <Col N="836" /> of course be a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government, in consultation with the bank, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the terms used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 approves acceptance by the State of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 3 designates the Central Bank as the single monetary authority responsible for transactions between the State and the fund.  Under the terms of the agreement each member country is required to designate such an authority.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Central Bank shall on behalf of the State make any payments or provide any undertaking to the fund as and when it is necessary to make such payments or provide such undertakings.  The section also provides that moneys receivable by the State from the fund shall be paid to the bank on behalf of the State.  These provisions do not apply to transactions arising out of the liquidation of the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the Central Bank the necessary powers to issue notes or obligations or enter into commitments in connection with the exercise of its functions under section 4.  The section also provides for payments by the Central Bank in connection with the issue of such notes, obligations and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the liquidation of the fund.  The section provides in effect for the assumption by the State of its ultimate financial liability in respect of the fund's operations.  It is of course most unlikely that an OECD member country would default on an international obligation and indeed the fund's existence is generally seen as aimed at reducing the possibility of such an unlikely event occurring.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will enable the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank, to bring the Act into force at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that any administrative expenses incurred by the Minister shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  In general administrative expenses are expected to be of a minor nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Section 9 gives the Short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The immunities and privileges of the fund will be covered in the usual form of order under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts, 1967-76.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think it can be said that the OECD Financial Support Fund is a useful measure in which it would be in Ireland's interest to participate.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say merely that we on this side of the House welcome this legislation.  We would not like to be out of step with our colleagues in the EEC.  They have already considered this and considered it a necessary piece of legislation. From what the Minister has said in his speech it seems many of them have passed the necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>It was found necessary to have the legislation because many people were annoyed and felt that because of this so-called international crisis many countries had great difficulty in meeting their commitments and keeping the balance of payments.  As it is at present it seems to have transpired that this has not been fact and so far as I am aware this fund has not been set up at all.  However, seeing that it has been adopted in other countries it is only right that we should play our part in contributing towards the setting up of such a fund.  The amount expected is £80 million, but whether we will be ever asked to contribute that I do not know.  If we are asked to make a down payment will we have the necessary finances to do so?  I wonder in what state our credibility stands so far as the other member countries of the EEC are concerned? The last occasion on which we negotiated a loan abroad the EEC insisted that the other member States act as guarantors so as to ensure that the loan would be repaid.  That may also apply so far as this fund is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the country can benefit from its participation in this fund.  I do not think we have as yet got into any difficulties in paying for <Col N="838" /> oil.  Perhaps the fund was found necessary in the past but the EEC countries do not seem to be over-anxious at present in this regard.  However, we on this side of the House have no reason to object to what the Minister is doing. We are in full agreement with the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House on a Bill which has been received without controversy in the Dáil.  The Minister will excuse me, I am sure, if I advert to the fact that this Bill is an arrangement between Ministers for Finance within the OECD and it reflects a necessity for harmony in international arrangements for the shifting of finance.  One hopes that OECD Ministers will reflect an equal emphasis in the future on the necessity for a harmonisation on the right to life being possible.  I have an opinion on this matter.  When it comes to international negotiations complex financial harmonisation arrangements are often made whereas when it comes, for example, to the shifting in real resources, towards raising the level for nutrition in the poorer countries, progress is far slower and more lethargic.  We would want to be very careful about the language we use.  This Bill is not very important so far as we may not use it but the kind of problems it adverts to indicate a certain kind of emphasis and a certain kind of thinking which cause me some concern.  The Minister says in his introductory speech: that the idea of a financial support fund emerged in the context of the very large balance of payments deficits recorded by many industrial and developed countries following the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 and 1974. In my view it does not represent anything other than a very fine development to find that there has been a real transfer of resources between developed and industrial countries and the countries which, previously, were not developed and industrial.  I am not falling into the trap of imagining that the people who gained the major benefits from the quadrupling of oil prices were precisely the countries to which I have just referred.  I make the point, though, that this concern about the <Col N="839" /> shift in resources which led to payments difficulties hides a number of factors which are not simple, which are quite subtle and severe.  For example, one which the Minister's speech adverted to very cogently&mdash;the flow of capital which was brought about from the increased oil prices meant that the industrial developed countries, as they are referred to, were not producing what the other countries needed.  What occurred then was a confrontation between two different kinds of consumer structure and production structure.  It was a very good idea that many of the countries I referred to were not producing what could be paid for because much of what was being produced was in the wasteful luxury commodity category.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the same kind of co-operation taking place in the other Member countries which will be other than a mere fiscal or financial one. The unfortunate phrase which was used by the Minister, who is a man of considerable intellect&mdash;&ldquo;recycle of funds&rdquo;&mdash;would seem to suggest that some kind of indigestion had arisen simply because the oil-producing countries decided suddenly that the opportunities were there for making a lot more money.  We can do without these words.  Many opportunities will arise in the future in which the dependant countries, the countries of primary production, will inflict far greater hardships on us and will demand more.  It does not matter if we use new terminology to deal with it. It is probably useful in the short term that the major developed countries will find themselves in a shifting of financial resources situation and can manage to have strategies but this is not a long-term solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of there being an international fiscal harmony which would reflect an international economic harmony presupposes altogether a restructuring of the world economic order.  This would involve an order such as that being asked for by the representative of Tanzania.  In a recent distinguished contribution one of their most distinguished economists has asked for such a change.  The OECD's <Col N="840" /><i>Observer</i> in their last issue in relation to projections for the necessities for food as far as the year 1985 spoke, although it did not spell it out, if we could not sustain population among member states with existing resources for food production, nutrition, education and agriculture.  I look forward to enabling Bills coming in here which reflect a more determined commitment from the OECD on these matters.</P>
    <P>As one goes through the Bill one notes sections which cause some anxiety.  To say that new economic structures will require new economic order when fiscal harmony takes its place is a statement which in my sense of values is rather low.  Within fiscal harmony itself the Central Bank certainly occupies a low place in my opinion.  In this context sections 4 and 5 are the appropriate ones.  They provide that the Central Bank on behalf of the State shall make any payments or undertakings to the fund as and when it is necessary.  I realise that the reply which will be given to me here by the Minister is that the Central Bank will take an administrative act to implement a Government decision of the day.  I understand that that is the kind of interpretation one would fall back on.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage that the Central Bank has not in fact seen itself in such a subservient role.  Its history in the last two or three years has been called much into question as to the relationship between the administration and the Legislature. Apart altogether from the necessity for a new Central Bank Act&mdash;something to which I hope the Minister will address his attention soon&mdash;it is perfectly clear that on those many occasions when people who were in charge of administrative functions within the Central Bank took it upon themselves to make comments upon what was a legislative decision or on what was appropriate Cabinet policy they were not restrained by any conception of an administrative role.  I would just advise a little care as to where their powers are referred to in this Bill.  I agree with those people who have said the Bill is one which should not detain us long, future Bills are mentioned which might <Col N="841" /> express more meaningful restructuring of an international economic order. These would be very welcome and would be debated at much length when introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the reception of the Bill.  I want to emphasise once again that there is little likelihood that Ireland will have any occasion to avail of their rights under this Bill.  The right of the State to avail of the opportunities under the Bill would arise only if a State were refused access to moneys by all other agencies, national and international. That is why the fund was described originally as a safety net to stop from falling to the floor a State which was collapsing.  We are not in that position. We do not anticipate that we will be in that position.  We will make certain that we will never get into such a position because we will work hard enough and arrange our affairs in a manner which will avoid that happening.</P>
      <P>There is similarly little likelihood that Ireland would ever be called upon to advance the £80 million which is our quota under the provisions of the fund. That £80 million would only arise if the remainder of the OECD had got itself into such a mess that the OECD had to use up the whole fund of £13 billion and then be unable to repay it.  It is unthinkable as we know the present and potential developments of the world that that situation will ever arise, but of course it could.  Even if it did arise, in respect of £80 million or any other sum and the OECD were to require this country to fulfil its obligations under the Financial Support Fund we would have a choice either to advance the money directly if we happened to be in the lucky position of being able to enter into the money-lending business, or we could simply subscribe to a guarantee or an undertaking which would be necessary to enable the fund itself to borrow from elsewhere.  Therefore, the impact on us is likely to be minimal if it arises at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the countries of the OECD have moved into a very healthy situation now in respect of their balance of payments.  Of course it might not always be so because as recovery <Col N="842" /> accelerates it is probable that trading deficits will grow again.  The recession has concealed the fact that oil deficits for most OECD members are now very much greater than they were prior to 1973.  Last year, for instance, our deficit was only £15 million and had we not had the quadrupled oil bill to pay we would have been in the position of having a surplus on our trading account of the better part of £200 million which, of course, would have been an extraordinary position, one regarded by orthodox financiers as a wonderful position to be in.  But, of course, it is to be seen that we could achieve that position only at an unacceptable price of too high an unemployment rate and under-use of our capacity.  Consequently, while financially the year from a payments point of view looked healthy, it was economically most undesirable and we certainly do not have any wish to move into that position.</P>
    <P>Ireland's right to avail of the fund exceeds £80 million which is our quota. We get £80 million on the votes of two-thirds of the members of the fund. We get £160 million with the support of 90 per cent of the members and it could go even higher if our circumstances were so serious as to warrant this and the fund was prepared to accept the burden of our responsibility of repayment if we should default, but, as I say, all of this is very much in the realm of theory, but one could probably walk a tightrope with greater confidence if you know there is a safety net underneath.  Even that would probably prevent you from wobbling across the straight and narrow.</P>
    <P>I would accept what Senator Higgins said about the obligation of the OECD to the Third World.  The OECD comprises 22 of the wealthiest countries in the world and we have a moral obligation to provide assistance to them and the OECD countries individually and collectively are aware of this.  It can be said that awareness is not enough&mdash; that we have not yet matched awareness with sufficient contribution&mdash;but the Senator knows that as far as this Government are concerned we have significantly increased our own contribution from Ireland to the Third <Col N="843" /> World, even in times of economic and financial difficulty for ourselves.  We have wished to see this programme of help advanced.  But there is something more than a moral obligation involved here.  Should there be some who will act, not on the basis of a moral obligation but on the basis of self interest, the better-off countries of the world must see to it that the remainder of the world is in a better position to consume the products of the wealthier nations.  They will not be in that position unless there is quite a significant transfer of resources.</P>
    <P>In relation to the quadrupling of oil prices, it can be argued that the price now charged for such a vital source of energy is a fair price. What was unfortunate was that the quadrupling of prices happened in such a short period without ample opportunity being given for the adjustments which were necessary. Even the oil-producing countries themselves have lost out by reason of the speed with which the price of energy rose.  Of course it rose for political reasons and not for economic reasons originally.  It was only as a result of a political decision that economic lessons were learned by both the beneficiaries and those who have to pay.  In the operation of the Financial Support Fund the Central Bank will be, in the main, the agent for the Government.  But the structure of the fund requires that an agency be nominated by each country to operate the mechanics of the fund.  There is no institute in this country better equipped to do this than the Central Bank.  I would not feel justified in setting up a new organisation to operate the fund if it has to be put into operation in relation to Ireland because what we would have would be a new institute. We have probably created too many in this country.  We would have got a new one and it would have to remain idle until such time as the fund was put into operation by a demand being made upon it by some other country.</P>
    <P>There are frequent consultations between the Central Bank and the <Col N="844" /> Department of Finance on all matters affecting the economy and the finances of the country.  As is common knowledge, I have not always found myself in agreement with some of the views expressed by the Central Bank and <i>vice versa.</i>  That is not peculiar to this country; it is a fairly common experience.  The Central Bank's function is not always allied with that of the people who have political responsibility.  As long as we understand one another's separate areas of responsibility, then we can respect one another's point of view.  It would be undesirable to have a situation arise in which the integrity of our Central Bank and of our currency could be put into question because it was felt, either at home or abroad, that it was subject to too much political influence.  I am not for one moment suggesting that the Central Bank must not take account of the financial policy of the State. It must do it.  In fact it does do it. It adjusts its own procedures and policies to conform, as best it can to whatever is regarded by the political masters of this country as being the correct policies of this country, for the political masters are those who have a mandate from the people; that is our authority and it is to the people of Ireland that we have that responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate in this country to have a Central Bank which by tradition and in practice, observes the canons that ought to be observed by central banks.  They have done that without interfering unduly with the political responsibilities which, in a democracy, must lie with the elected representatives of the people and with the people who are nominated by those elected representatives as their government. I am certain that, should it be necessary to operate this fund, the Central Bank will reflect the wishes of the Government and, of course, of the OECD but it will be our agency to operate the fund and I cannot think of any one to operate it.  Any other institute would be unnecessary and costly.</P>
    <P>Therefore I commend the Bill to the House for acceptance.</P>
