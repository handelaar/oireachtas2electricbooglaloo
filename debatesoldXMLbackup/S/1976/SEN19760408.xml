    <Title>British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Limited (Acquisition) (Amendment) Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1965 the State acquired the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company Ltd., the principal object being to ensure effective Irish participation on the Irish Sea in the interests of trade and tourism.  The purchase price was £3,600,000.  The issued share capital of the company at that time was £1,600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assets of the company at the time of their takeover by the State consisted principally of three vessels, the old <i>Leinster, Munster</i> and <i>Innisfallen,</i> which carried passengers, goods and livestock and a limited number of cars, four cattle-general cargo vessels, the <i>Kilkenny, Meath, Dundalk</i> and <i>Glanmire,</i> and two general cargo vessels, the <i>Wicklow</i> and <i>Inniscarra.</i> These vessels were for the most part out-of-date and ill-adapted to meet the developing needs of sea transport.  In particular they could not cater for the revolutionary change from general <Col N="1846" /> cargo to containers, nor for the emerging trend towards the roll-on-roll-off movement of passenger cars and freight vehicles.</P>
    <P>The new board of the company in consequence found it necessary to embark on a thorough-going policy of modernisation, involving the acquisition of three new roll-on-roll-off passenger ferries, four container ships and a roll-on-roll-off cargo ship.  In addition it was necessary to invest in new specialised berths and terminals to cater for containers and ferries, as well as to acquire a stock of containers. The capital expenditure involved amounted to over £23 million. Very nearly 80 per cent of this investment was financed by loans or long-term leases or agreements.</P>
    <P>Following an investigation of the company in 1970 by consultants who reported that an undue proportion of the B &amp; I's capital resources was made up of loan capital, an extra £3 million share capital was taken up by the Minister for Finance under the British &amp; Irish Steam Packet Company (Acquisition) (Amendment) Act, 1971, bringing the issued share capital of the company to £4.6 million.</P>
    <P>Even after the raising of the issued share capital to £4.6 million, the capital structure of the company still reflected a substantial imbalance between share and loan capital.  As against a total capital expenditure of over £23 million, the equity content of £4.6 million represented only 20 per cent leaving a disproportionate share of 80 per cent made up of loans and similar forms of financing.</P>
    <P>This loan orientated capital structure is throwing an unduly heavy burden on the company by way of interest and principal payments. For example, the company achieved a net profit of £281,000 in 1974 after allowing for financial charges of £1,000,000 in that year, and will record a further surplus of £139,000 in their 1975 accounts after allowing for financial charges of £1,400,000 in that year.</P>
    <P>The need for further share capital at this juncture was established by reports from consultants engaged at the behest of the Minister for <Col N="1847" /> Finance, who have undertaken a review of the company's operations and of their prospects and financial outlook up to the end of the decade. The consultants made clear that, apart from share capital needed to restore the loan-equity balance, it was likely that a requirement would arise for substantial additional capital towards the cost of any further expansion of the scope of the company's activities, or of the replacement or renewal of the vessels of the fleet or of terminal facilities.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I have deemed it advisable to take the opportunity to provide scope in the present legislation for meeting possible future needs of the company as well as their present requirements and, accordingly, I am, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, seeking the agreement of the Oireachtas to empower the Minister for Finance to take up a further £15 million share capital in the company. In effect, the company's authorised share capital is being increased by this amount.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is needed to restore a reasonable loan-equity ratio, the B &amp; I Company will also require capital to help finance the acquisition of an additional car ferry vessel.  They have, in fact, in the past week, made a formal proposal to me to order another car ferry to be built at Verolme Cork Dockyard for delivery in 1978.  The matter is under active consideration at the moment in consultation with the Minister for Finance and I would hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.  The company propose to have two vessels on the Cork-Swansea route, complementing the two operating on the Dublin-Liverpool service.</P>
    <P>I believe that I should avail of this occasion to undertake a general review of the B &amp; I's activities, especially in the light of the investigations recently conducted by consultants.</P>
    <P>The company's operations come under two main heads, passenger traffic and goods traffic.  Passengers, both foot passengers and motorists, and cars are carried on two car-ferries, the <i>Munster</i> and the <i>Leinster,</i> operating <Col N="1848" /> between Dublin and Liverpool, and on a third, the <i>Innisfallen,</i> operating between Cork and Swansea.  These services are, of course, of vital importance to Irish tourism, offering as they do the most economic means of transport from our main market.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the company's car ferries in 1968 their carryings have increased spectacularly, for example: Passenger carryings have increased from 360,000 in 1968 to 576,000 in 1975; Car carryings have increased over the same period from 43,000 to 110,000, and the number of wheeled units moved has increased from 5,157 to 27,459.</P>
    <P>The company have maintained this growth pattern despite the effects of the Northern Ireland troubles on tourist traffic from Britain and the downturn in the Irish and British economies.  In the context of an overall expansion of the market, the company believe that the prospects for continued increase in the overall numbers of sea passengers are good.</P>
    <P>The second part of the company's operations is the carriage of cargo.  At the present time the B &amp; I operates a container service from Dublin to Liverpool, as well as a weekly service to Rotterdam and Le Havre.  Container services entail the use of custom-built container ships, together with elaborate terminal installations at ports.  In addition, the three car ferries provide all year round capacity for the carriage of roll-on-roll-off goods traffic.  About 12 months ago, the company undertook, jointly with the British firm of P and O, who provided the ship, a roll-on-roll-off cargo service between Dublin and Fleetwood.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I are the major carrier of freight on the Irish Sea, moving almost one million tons of freight a year between Ireland, Britain and Europe. They carry 30 per cent of all traffic on the Irish Sea and this includes exports for onward shipment to many parts of the world.  They offer a truly comprehensive service catering for every customer requirement.  The most significant development has been in the field of roll-on-roll-off freight, which is growing at the rate of 20 per cent per year.  This trend has been accelerated since Ireland's accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> It is significant to note in the context of the company's freight activities that their average price for moving goods has risen by only 22 per cent per ton since 1966 compared with a rise in the Consumer Price Index of 120 per cent over the same period. In actual money terms the average charge per ton of freight carried was £5.13 in 1966 and £6.27 at the end of 1975.  When it is considered that these figures ignore the fall in the value of money over the interval, it is very obvious that the real cost of shipping a ton of freight across the Irish Sea has fallen sharply over the period.</P>
    <P>Following the economic downturn resulting from the fuel crisis at the end of 1973, the company reorganised their services to match frequency and capacity more closely to current demands. At that time the company reduced their container operation into Liverpool from two ships to one ship and transferred traffic to the new joint service to Fleetwood which the company commenced in April, 1975, in conjunction with the P and O company. This had the added benefit of achieving a significant degree of rationalisation of freight services on the Irish Sea and at the same time allowed the company to provide capacity for increased roll-on-roll-off freight demands.</P>
    <P>Two special factors, one adverse and one helpful, may be noted.  There is a basic imbalance between the volume of goods conveyed from Britain to Ireland, and from Ireland to Britain.  The fact that there is more empty space on eastward-bound cargo ships than on westward means greater competition for traffic on the former &mdash;to the benefit no doubt of the Irish exporter, but at the expense of the carrier&mdash;while the imbalance of volume also militates against the most efficient use of vessels, containers, pallets and other facilities.</P>
    <P>The more favourable factor, from the viewpoint of the B &amp; I, is the growing trend towards roll-on-roll-off traffic at the expense of container traffic.  The advantages offered by roll-on-roll-off to the customer have led him to utilise this mode increasingly, despite the higher charges <Col N="1850" /> levied, which are more economic to the shipowner.  This development is consequently beneficial to both parties.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I were acquired by the Government with the intention that they should continue to be operated as a commercial enterprise and this objective has been adhered to.  The development programme undertaken by the board of directors involved the construction of new terminals at Dublin, Cork, Liverpool and Swansea; three new car ferries, the new <i>Munster</i> and <i>Leinster</i> operating Dublin-Liverpool, and the <i>Innisfallen,</i> operating Cork-Swansea; and five new freight ships, the container vessels <i>Wicklow, Kerry, Sligo</i> and <i>Kilkenny</i> and the roll-on-roll-off vessel <i>Dundalk,</i> were constructed.  Of these the <i>Wicklow</i> operates Dublin-Liverpool, and the <i>Kilkenny</i> Dublin-Le Havre-Rotterdam, the <i>Kerry</i> and the <i>Dundalk,</i> with Irish crews are on charter abroad, and the <i>Sligo</i> is no longer employed by the company.  New road transport fleets and a pool of 3,500 containers and trailers and extensive terminal equipment were required.  Staff had to be retrained and new business obtained. Today we see the fruits of this programme: present turnover of the company amounts to £19 million, two-thirds of which revenue is earned abroad; they employ 1,500 people, 1,200 in Ireland; their annual expenditure on goods and services in Ireland is £10 million; their expenditure at Verolme Cork Dockyard since 1969 has been £10 million; their expenditure at Liffey Dockyard since 1969 is £1.4 million.</P>
    <P>The company have had an excellent record in the field of personnel relations. They have developed the concept of works councils in their organisation and these now form a real part of their communicating and decision-making processes.  In 1975 all the employees of the company, in recognition of the difficulties likely to face the economy in 1976, agreed to defer any increase which might emerge out of any new national wage agreement for 12 months.  This would represent an interest-free loan to the company which would be repayable from future profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> In retrospect it would seem to me that, having regard to the extensive scheme of modernisation which the B &amp; I had to embark upon in the 1960s, the capital resources with which it was provided by the State at the outset were far from adequate, and the company has never really been able to compensate for this initial handicap.  If the company is to continue its progress a further allocation of capital is now urgently necessary.  The figure of £15 million provided for in this Bill will enable the company's loan/equity ratio to be restored to a reasonable balance and, at the same time, make provision for the financing of a further car ferry vessel.  I should make it clear that at this stage all that is being done is that the maximum authorised share capital which the Minister for Finance is empowered to subscribe is being increased by the figure of £15 million. It is the intention that the money will actually be made available in instalments from time to time in this and future years only according as it may be required to meet the immediate needs of the company.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In these times of economic difficulties and problems it is heartening to see, as elaborated here by the Minister, a success story under the aegis of the Minister in the form of the operations of B &amp; I since their acquisition by the State in 1965. It was a very important decision largely initiated by the late Seán Lemass as Taoiseach, one that at the time was regarded by many people as an unwarranted gamble.  It has certainly paid off in a very substantial way in one particular aspect to which the Minister has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thinking behind the State's acquisition of B &amp; I in 1965 was to ensure as far as our sea transportation was concerned that Ireland, as a State, would be in the business and that our rates would be competitive. There is no need for me to emphasise the importance of that for an island trading nation.  If the ailing B &amp; I&mdash;as it was in 1965&mdash;had not <Col N="1852" /> been taken over by the State our marine transportation to Britain and Europe would be almost entirely&mdash; apart from a few small private Irish coasters&mdash;in the hands of outside interests.  The main thinking behind the acquisition of the company in 1965 was to ensure that the Irish State would have a stake in shipping transportation and so ensure that rates would continue to be competitive. That has been the situation as far as cross-channel transportation is concerned.</P>
    <P>British Railways are continuing in the business and B &amp; I are in the business competing with them.  They co-operate where possible and I know there were very advanced proposals for sharing facilities at one stage which have not come to full fruition. However, as far as marketing and the rates which are offered to shippers are concerned there is a strong competitive trading situation which is of immense benefit to Irish exporters and importers and to the country as a whole in ensuring that shipping transportation costs are cut to the bone by reason of a healthy competition between two strong organisations. One organisation&mdash;the B &amp; I&mdash; is sustained by the State and the other is a British State organisation with whom we have very good relations and who are also providing an excellent service.  That is exactly as it should be and that was the thinking that prompted the initial move to acquire the ailing B &amp; I in 1965.  The Minister refers to this fact in his speech when he said:</P>
    <P>It is significant to note in the context of the company's freight activities that its average price for moving goods has risen by only 22 per cent per ton since 1966 compared with the rise in the consumer price index of 120 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>This is very significant.  The real cost of shipping across the Irish Sea could very easily have been a serious blow to our economy if it was allowed to escalate as it appeared to be escalating in the early 1960s.  Since the State, through B &amp; I, have gone into this business, the real cost of shipping a <Col N="1853" /> ton of freight across the Irish Sea, as the Minister has said, has fallen sharply over that period when you relate a paper increase of only 22 per cent per ton as compared with a rise in the consumer price index of 120 per cent.  It certainly is a fabulous reduction in real terms as far as Irish Sea trans-shipment is concerned.</P>
    <P>In actual money terms, to quote the Minister, the average charge per ton of freight carried was £5.13 in 1966 and £6.27 in 1975.</P>
    <P>In a ten-year period there is that very minimal rise in freight transportation across the Irish Sea on which we are so vitally dependent: it is the basic lifeline as far as our imports, exports and the economy are concerned. When one has regard to the sort of escalation we have had in the cost-of-living in recent years and the inflation to which we have been subjected, one can see the enormous importance of having this stake in freight trans-shipment across the Irish Sea.  The fact that it has been cut to the bone is due to the fact that we are in there competing against another very strong organisation supporting the British end, and the healthy competition has given rise to this very valuable cost competitiveness as far as freight transportation is concerned, thereby facilitating our importers and exporters.</P>
    <P>One significant development which was very welcome too, and I do not think it was anticipated at the rate it has developed, is the growth of roll-on-roll-off freight.  It is certainly significant that it is growing at the rate of 20 per cent per year.  Of course, the EEC entry has helped it.  I take it that in many cases the roll-on-roll-off freight across the Irish Sea is going to EEC countries.  That is certainly a spin-off benefit from our membership of the European Economic Community. Obviously the most effective way of transporting goods and taking goods back into Europe is on the roll-on-roll-off system.  The growth rate of 20 per cent per annum would appear to indicate that and the company are meeting that by switching facilities from container provision to roll-on-roll-off provision.</P>
    <P>All of this adds up to a picture <Col N="1854" /> of a company in a healthy situation where, apart from the basic essential service aspect and apart from the benefit to the economy as a whole, they are actually making a profit after taking account of loan charges.  As the Minister said, there is provision for loan charges also, so that with a net profit of £281,000 in 1974, after allowing for financial charges of £1 million in that year, there will be a profit in 1975 of £139,000 again after allowing for financial charges of £1,400,000.  This adds up to a healthy financial situation as well as providing a very competitive service which benefits the country. Therefore, there is no risk whatever &mdash;in fact, there is a positive gain as far as the economy is concerned&mdash;in the State taking an equity share, which is what is proposed here in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I moved the B &amp; I Bill of 1970 and, at that time because of almost a 100 per cent loan capital bond, it was decided to provide for a £3 million limit for the Minister for Finance to take up equity shares.  What the Minister is now proposing is that the Minister for Finance may take up share investment up to £15 million. That will be a flexible matter and the Minister for Finance, as requirements arise, will invest that amount of money.  It is an absolutely safe investment, an absolute basic requirement, because with a company of this kind showing this sort of success it would be very bad business to have them dependent on loan capital and to find their expansion and adaptation inhibited by reason of raising further loan capital which it could quite easily do.  There is an obvious inhibiting impediment from the point of view of the financial organisation of the company in regard to investment expenditure if they are going to be forced into a position of funding future expansion and development by further loan burdens, particularly when the record shows that as far as the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the State, is concerned, he is on an absolutely safe wicket in putting share capital on behalf of the community into an investment of this kind.  It is safe from the financial accountancy aspect and it is essential from the point of view of national security and national gain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> I would like to take up one or two points on which I feel very strongly. I was just reading what I said in reply to this debate in 1971 and I think I made a half commitment.  We had a report from Bord Fáilte on the matter which had been supported by B &amp; I. It is an old chestnut but it is one that is still valid, namely, the provision of duty free facilities as far as passengers on B &amp; I ships are concerned. We had that report to hand in 1971. I ran into difficulties, and I am sure the Minister has too, with the Department of Finance.  The revenue aspect was too strong as far as we were concerned at the time.  It would have got support from our Department but the revenue aspect held sway.  I wonder would the Minister enlighten us on whether he is pressuring this aspect? I feel he should.  We have it on our air services.  It would appear to me to be an obvious advantage, particularly in view of recent budgetary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have it on the air services between here and Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have. When you have it on a number of our airline services it would seem to be even more appropriate to have it on the shipping services where people are together for a longer period of time, where they are captive customers for a number of hours on the B &amp; I ships to and from Britain.  Particularly having regard to the budget disparities that have begun to arise since the British budget, it is evident now that our liquor prices are running way ahead of British levels.  Surely one attractive way would be to have duty free cigarettes and particularly duty free liquor when you have captive customers.  It would be an attraction in regard to getting further passenger traffic on B &amp; I vessels.  I know that Bord Fáilte are very keen on this being done.  I just wonder what success the Minister is having with the Minister for Finance on the matter.  I understand the difficulties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to refer to even though it is not strictly related to the Bill.  It concerns small coastal shipping firms and the <Col N="1856" /> up-dating of the merchant shipping regulations.  I would like to know if any advance has been made on that aspect.  I know there was a working party within the Department working on this with a view to updating these regulations which are there since the Merchant Shipping Act of 1893.  It puts our general coastal shippers at a considerable disadvantage when they have to observe regulations that are very dated <i>vis-à-vis</i> the requirements on coastal shippers in our EEC partner countries, particularly the Dutch. They have a real advantage here due to a very liberal policy pursued by the Dutch Government in regard to regulations on their coastal shipping.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  It is not strictly related to the Bill but it should be brought in here under an updating of the merchant shipping code.  It is related to the fundamental purpose of the Bill which is to provide competitive freight transportation across the Irish Sea and also directly to the EEC where we are running a regular container service under B &amp; I into Rotterdam.</P>
    <P>I would again like to welcome the measure and to say that it is good to see positive progress in this area.  I am glad the Minister referred to the almost model administration and management of B &amp; I.  They are one of the best State companies in this respect.  They have a very good management team, they have shown a tremendous sense of purpose since the formation of the company and this was evidenced by the voluntary pay pause which they took last year. I am glad the Minister referred to it again.  They set an example, where the employees of the company, in recognition of the difficulties likely to face the economy in 1976, agreed last year to defer for 12 months any increase which might emerge out of any new national wage agreement.  That, in effect, is an interest-free loan to the company which would be repayable out of future profits.  It is the sort of headline that needs to be emphasised, that the whole field of management-worker relations has proved itself over the years.  It shows what good management can do when <Col N="1857" /> this sort of development can take place with ease and without any pushing between management and staff.  It sets the type of headline that one would like to see followed in many other areas of State and State-sponsored services.  What I like in particular about it is that these are people who are not in any secure State employment because the B &amp; I are in a highly competitive business.  These people have not the security enjoyed by people in other State monopolies. There are certain State monopolies which have an absolute guarantee from a security point of view, both State Departments and State-sponsored monopolies like the ESB.  This is a State-sponsored organisation in the most competitive business area in the world, that is, freight transportation, particularly sea-freight transportation. There is a worker willingness, by reason of good management, which expressed itself in the positive way of postponing any pay requirements under the wage agreement in 1975. That is the sort of matter which should be highlighted.  That type of good news is not highlighted enough. The Minister has emphasised it and I hope the Press take note of it.  It is the type of headline which is badly required at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is obviously a necessary measure but, apart from that, it is a very sensible one.  It is wrong for any company, whether they are a State-owned company or a private enterprise, to have an imbalance between their loan capital and their equity capital.  Loan capital can be a dangerous means of financing any enterprise, particularly if the lenders are too strict in their terms of repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we should be alive to the fact that this method of re-financing the B &amp; I could be regarded as a hidden subsidy on a fairly substantial scale unless the equity capital is serviced by some normal interest payment or dividend payment on the amount of equity capital which will be substituted for the interest bearing loan capital which, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, cost £1 million in 1974 and <Col N="1858" /> £1.4 in 1975.  Obviously, unless the equity capital bears a reasonable dividend, the company will get a fairly hefty subsidy for their operation.  I do not object to that in principle, provided we give it with our eyes open. It is a good thing that the taxpayers' money should be used to subsidise a State undertaking in competition, in some cases, with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It was a proper move to take over the B &amp; I a few years ago.  Having accepted the responsibility of running the service, the State, with the assistance of the taxpayers, must ensure that they are properly equipped and properly run.  I was glad to note in the Minister's speech that there is an obligation on the company to run their affairs on strictly commercial lines.  I assume, referring to my earlier remarks, this means that the equity capital will bear a reasonable return to the State for its substantial investment.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the B &amp; I it should be said&mdash;this was touched on by Senator Lenihan&mdash;that they are in a very hot corner as regard shipping services. Irish-British cross-channel shipping is probably one of the most competitive areas in the world, if not the most competitive.  Several companies have fallen by the wayside due to the substantial losses incurred.  They went into the business at a time of very rapid and significant changes in cross-channel shipping, particularly of goods.  The first development was the ferry services and they have now been gradually replaced by roll-on-roll-off which is the sea transport of the future for short sea crossings.  It is obvious that between Britain and this country this offers an advantage of a short sea route and also between Britain and the Continent.  In the years to come, more goods coming into the country&mdash;and hopefully more goods going out to redress the appalling imbalance of trade between Britain and this country &mdash;will be carried by the roll-on-roll-off method.</P>
    <P>While we applaud this development and note that it is helping to keep down costs to the importer and exporter, and ultimately to the consumer, it must be realised that the lowering of costs between Britain and <Col N="1859" /> Ireland in this way is having a very serious adverse effect on shipping from the west and south-west coasts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The profitability of shipping from the west coast to the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent the Continent has now been seriously jeopardised due to these changes over recent years.  I am, and possibly other Senators are, only too familiar with this sad pattern in recent years.  In the port of Limerick which traded with the United Kingdom, there was a Limerick-Liverpool service for upwards of 100 years, now there is virtually only one somewhat erratic shipping service, mainly to the Continent taking in a south English port.  This might be inevitable in the harsh economic sense but it is a very serious development for western ports.</P>
    <P>It is also a serious matter if regional development particularly in the west and south-west of Ireland is taken seriously because, without a viable and regular shipping service out of a regional area, the possibilities of industrial development are lessened gravely.  For that reason I wanted to avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister if he would arrange for B &amp; I to examine the whole question of shipping from the west coast to the UK and the Continent.  It may necessitate some form of State subsidy but, if shipping from the east coast to Britain and the Continent is to be subsidised, a valid case could be made for giving some State assistance to shipping from west coast ports to the UK and the Continent.</P>
    <P>If something like that is not done in the immediate future the situation could arise&mdash;and is arising&mdash;where all raw materials going to the west and south-west of Ireland and exports from there will travel by rail or road, by CIE or haulier, to the east coast and be carried by vessels on this rapid sea transport system to Britain and the Continent.  This is a good economic policy from that point of view but it is disastrous from the point of view of shipping out of west and south-west coast ports.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has in hand at present an investigation into the <Col N="1860" /> whole question of our port development and its importance to the country in terms of imports and exports as an island nation.  I hope the whole question of shipping will be taken into account in the context of the review of the port industry.  No matter how efficient shipping between the east coast of Ireland and the west coast of England may become&mdash;these figures show it is highly efficient and low cost&mdash;it would be a sad day for those of us who live on the other side of the country if our ports gradually became inoperative.  That is a point which has concerned not only myself but other Senators over a number of years and the pattern is likely to evolve even further to the disadvantage of west coast ports.</P>
    <P>Some years ago&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Lenihan was Minister at the time&mdash;a committee was set up to examine the significance of transport costs on industrial development in the west.  To my knowledge that committee has never reported.  It may have reported to the Minister or to a Minister and his Department but certainly, as far as I know, the findings of this committee, if it ever has found, have not been made available to the public generally.  It would be interesting to know what was the result of this committee's investigations.  It would show a rather sorry tale as far as the west is concerned and its isolation economically from its markets and from where it draws its raw materials.</P>
    <P>I can remember many years ago there was a subsidy allowable on freight shipped into Limerick and Shannon ports which disappeared some time ago.  We are looking at this matter now from a national point of view because we are talking about a national shipping line.  We are not talking about private enterprise.  A national shipping line should be used as a vehicle for the development, not only of the east coast, but also the country as a whole with particular reference to the developing areas in the west and south-west.  You cannot develop without a viable shipping line, a regular shipping service.  That has been proved time and again.</P>
    <P>Another point which might sound a rather far-fetched idea at this stage <Col N="1861" /> but, we are talking generally about shipping, is that the possibility of a direct passenger and goods line between the west coast of Ireland and the east coast of America should be considered in the not-too-distant future. It may sound astonishing now to talk about shipping passengers and goods, say, from the Shannon Estuary to Boston and New York.  This was done less than 100 years ago.  It was a regular feature with tiny ships, most of them, unfortunately, carrying emigrants out of the western areas to the United States.  The same thing applies to Galway.  History has an extraordinary habit of repeating itself over the years.  It is not too far-fetched to visualise in the not-too-distant future a shipping line or lines from the west coast of Ireland.  Naturally I am interested in the Shannon Estuary in this regard.  It has all the necessary natural facilities to provide for ships of almost any size between that centre and the east coast of the United States.  It would be well worth looking into.  At the moment naturally all our eyes are turned to the east because of our membership of the EEC, but we should remember that we have long trading links with the western world and those trading links should, as far as possible, be encouraged and expanded.  We will always be glad of the American dollar for our goods in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more except to repeat my welcome for the Bill and to ask the Minister to have regard to those of us who live in the south-west and west of Ireland.  I believe I made a valid point on the question of having regular shipping services in these areas if they are to expand and develop and maintain and expand their population as we all want them to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers in saying it was an absolutely correct policy for the Government to purchase the B &amp; I Shipping Line and make it a totally owned Irish State company.  I have no doubt it was one of the many moves we have made where private enterprise was unable to supply a particular need and the State stepped in.  I am very pleased the Minister has been able to outline <Col N="1862" /> the successes the company have had over the years.  I also join in the tributes Senator Lenihan has paid to the company not only on their commercial undertakings but on their labour relations.  That is a headline, as Senator Lenihan has said, and I hope that they will continue their farsighted policy of consultation with the staff and agreement generally on their terms of employment.</P>
      <P>Since we are, in a sense, voting a very considerable sum to a shipping company&mdash;I am not opposed to that &mdash;we also ought to look at some of the consequences of this large subsidy. It is a subsidy in one sense and it is not in another.  It is difficult, with the figures the Minister has given us, to get an overall picture.  Clearly the picture is a good and healthy one.  It is one of our semi-State bodies which does not get great negative publicity in terms of fare rises and Government bail-outs, and so on, but at the same time, it is a body which could well benefit, and one hopes will benefit, from the scrutiny of the all-party committee which is to be set up to look into such bodies.  As I have said on many occasions, such a committee will have facts and figures at its disposal and will be able to get a better overall picture.</P>
      <P>One of the things I would like the Minister to tell us is what is the extent of the foreign borrowing the company are involved in at the moment. Could he give us an idea of the rates at which the loans have been made? I believe B &amp; I have extensive foreign borrowing at the moment.  I am not clear about the figures.  One only gets certain snippets of information from the Press but, like any other company who have borrowed abroad, they are suffering.  They have no funds.</P>

      <P>It was a drain and one of the problems was the decrease in the value of sterling.  I know that the company purchased a number of ships from continental builders.  Presumably <Col N="1863" /> there was some financial arrangement at that time.  I think it caused a considerable problem as it has caused to other bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that.  That is one of the problems any such body faces.  It is pleasant to have this information that there are no outstanding foreign loans and therefore the B &amp; I company are not suffering from the 22 or 25 per cent devaluation in sterling over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment on two aspects of the B &amp; I service, the passenger service first of all, and then some remarks about the freight services. Passenger services between Britain and Ireland are almost entirely supplied by the two companies, B &amp; I and British Rail.  I echo what Senator Lenihan said.  I said the same thing to him five years ago when he was Minister for Transport and Power urging him to obtain duty free facilities on these cross-channel vessels. When one steps into the <i>Munster</i> or the <i>Leinster</i> or the <i>Innisfallen</i> the first thing one is met with is a line of six one-armed bandits.  If they can put one-armed bandits on the ships and operate them, it is a good sign of the free enterprise world.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity we cannot provide duty free facilities.  The difference between the air crossing and the sea crossing is that the sea crossing is considerably longer.  One has a captive audience, a captive market, in some cases for eight hours and in some cases for ten hours.  Duty free facilities would be a considerable benefit and an added tourist attraction. We must not forget the very important part played by B &amp; I in promoting our tourist trade by providing the carriage of people to Ireland to spend money as tourists.  That is extremely important and it is important also that we maintain the level of services, that we increase their level and their quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that, as <Col N="1864" /> far as the consumer is concerned, all is not absolutely rosy on these ships.  The B &amp; I ships, in a <i>Which</i> survey carried out in 1970 which was concerned with the passenger shipping services between Ireland and Britain, came off the worst.  The reason was that the B &amp; I crossings are by far the longest&mdash;eight hours in some cases, ten hours in the Cork-Swansea case.  There is no problem when the service is by day, but a number of these services are overnight. There is a serious lack of berths in the ships and the <i>Which</i> survey found there was most passenger dissatisfaction with the B &amp; I services because of the lack of berths.</P>
    <P>The initial purchases of the modern roll-on-roll-off ships by B &amp; I were from a company that operated a daylight crossing service from the Baltic and the ships were very rarely used at night.  They were heavily used for overnight crossings in our case.  For example, the Swansea-Cork ship, <i>Innisfallen,</i> can carry a maximum number of 1,200 passengers and the number of single berths is 256.  There are also 16 double cabins.  The <i>Which</i> survey found that nearly half the passengers could not get the exact booking they wanted, and about one in five found they booked too late to get a berth.</P>
    <P>Clearly there is little that can be done with the ships originally purchased. The Minister and the company might bear this in mind when they are purchasing further ships and when they are&mdash;and I am very pleased to see it&mdash; approaching Verolme for the ship one hopes will augment the Cork-Swansea service or the next passenger vessel they buy, which hopefully will be built by Verolme.  They should bear this in mind and try and have the berth-passenger ratio a bit more favourable.</P>
    <P>I am a frequent traveller across the Irish Sea and I had the&mdash;I would not call it an exhilarating experience&mdash; experience of having to spend a night in what is euphemistically termed an aircraft type recliner seat.  I can tell you I woke up pretty &ldquo;shook&rdquo; in the morning.  For many people it is unsatisfactory. Of course, it is cheap.  I am not saying there should not be aircraft type recliner seats but what I am saying <Col N="1865" /> is that there are a large number of passengers who would pay for berths.  They cannot get them, and they have to take aircraft type recliner seats which are considerably cheaper, but not what they want.  I hope when future vessels are being designed to be used for overnight crossings, the needs of the passengers will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a conflict here because in the former vessels before the days of the roll-on-roll-off service a great deal more space was available for cabin facilities.  A whole deck, or perhaps one-and-a-half decks, now go towards providing space for cars and commercial vehicles.  At the same time, one feels something more could be done and a better ratio of total number of berths to the maximum number of passengers could be achieved in the ships which are to be purchased in the future.</P>
    <P>To turn briefly to the freight side of the B &amp; I operation, Senator Russell and Senator Lenihan pointed out that here we have the situation of a subsidised Government-owned shipping line being in direct competition with our private coastal shippers.  I recall in a corresponding debate on 23rd June, 1971, when Senator Lenihan was Minister for Transport and Power, I was in a position to compliment him on his magnificent save on the previous Sunday of a penalty in Croke Park in the game between the Munster Members of the Dáil and the Ulster Members of the Seanad.  He paid for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not try it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a few hard things to say about this aspect of the B &amp; I operation, not that I have anything against the B &amp; I operation, but because the position is that here is a heavily subsidised State service competing against three small private Irish-owned shipping companies. What I had to say was not directed against the B &amp; I company but towards the Minister and his Department because the shipping companies not only labour under the handicap of competing with British Rail and B &amp; I which are heavily subsidised <Col N="1866" /> State companies, but they operate under regulations which are so archaic as to be laughable.  I regret very much that the Minister has not been able to say at any time since 1971 when we made this complaint&mdash; Senator Russell and Senator Lenihan referred to it&mdash;that something has been done to ease the position of Irish-owned shipping companies.</P>
      <P>There are still three private coastal shipping companies in operation which are in direct competition with B &amp; I and British Rail, two based in Arklow and one based in Cork.  The Minister will correct me if the figures are wrong. The point is, they operate under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1893.  This is UK legislation and the UK coastal fleet operates under the same legislation. The UK coastal fleet never recovered after the war and it is virtually extinct, as is ours.  This is an island country and virtually all its foreign trade has to come in by sea.  Very little comes in by air in proportion.  All the carriage of heavy goods is by sea.  We have never got round to developing our own coastal shipping as we should have.  As an island nation we should have an affinity with the sea instead of always looking on it as a barrier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to record that the few shipping companies which struggle manfully to keep going should have to compete, not only with the subsidy which this State gives to B &amp; I and the British Government gives to British Rail, but with incredible regulations. One of these is that the operating cost is calculated on gross registered tonnage and the figure is 500 gross registered tons.  A large number of continental vessels are registered at 499.9 gross registered tons and they pay low charges to our port and docks authorities when they come in.  The situation was such that in 1971 three vessels had been purchased by Irish shippers from continental competitors.  They had all been registered at 499.9 gross registered tons and when they were purchased by Irish Shipping they had to be re-registered with the Marine Section of the Department of Transport and Power and they suddenly appeared in the registration books at 506 tons, 622 tons and 547 tons, which was their <Col N="1867" /> actual gross tonnage.  I am not trying to say that our coastal shippers should be dishonest.  What I am saying is that they are operating under legislation which is crazy when compared to the legislation under which their competitors, the Dutch, the Germans, the Scandinavians, operate.</P>
    <P>Our legislation for coastal shipping is based on geographical location.  We say: &ldquo;You are a home trader; therefore you must not operate outside a certain area.  You must confine your operations to a certain small area.&rdquo; The sort of situation that arises is that an Arklow ship taking cargo to Belfast &mdash;this happened recently&mdash;when offered a cargo for the Canary Islands cannot take it because the Canary Islands is outside this small, confined area.  But its Dutch competitor, with exactly the same tonnage, can to it without any problem.</P>
    <P>There is no geographical limit on continental vessels.  Danish and Dutch ships are not controlled geographically but on the size of the boats.  French ships are controlled by the power of the boats, which is an equivalent type of registration.  Our regulations are too inflexible.</P>
    <P>I checked with Senator Lenihan, to whom I made these complaints five years ago, and I asked him: &ldquo;Is it the position now that we are all under the same EEC regulations?&rdquo;  He replied that that was not the position. We are operating under the 1893 Merchant Shipping Act.  On a number of occasions I have received the most bitter criticisms of the fact that the Department of Transport and Power have done nothing about this.  In 1971 Senator Lenihan, then Minister for Transport and Power, said that a committee was being set up to do something to update the legislation for coastal shipping.  Five years later, has anything been done by the Department? Can the Minister tell us that within the next six months he is going to bring in regulations which will give our coastal shippers a fair crack of the whip in competition with Dutch and Danish shippers?  If he could I would be very happy, but he cannot, and my guess is that the Department of <Col N="1868" /> Transport and Power have been sitting on this and nothing has happened. It is a sad situation and I want to raise this in a rather bitter tone because this is the tone in which it is being raised with me by our Irish coastal shipping firms.  If something is not done for them they will go out of business before very long.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the load line certificate.  There is the problem of the extension fee for master's certificate which in 1962 was £2; in 1968 it was £16.10.0.  If all these fees are going up and if coastal shippers have to pay the increased fees, then it is only reasonable that they should expect to get an increased service from the Department of Transport and Power and that that service should be in the form of updating the regulations. While that is not done their complaints are justified and I want to make them as loud and as clear as I can. One of the shippers said to me, &ldquo;The Department of Transport and Power regulations make our ships so safe that we can hardly go to sea.&rdquo;  That situation still obtains five years later.  It is a sad situation and I want to raise it with the Minister to make the point absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>It was calculated in 1951&mdash;perhaps the Minister has a more recent figure &mdash;that £2½ million annually left the country in freight and marine insurance charges on trade with Britain. It must be five or six times that amount now.  We must remember that whenever an Irish importer or exporter uses Irish Shipping he is increasing his country's prosperity; when he imports or exports by means of foreign-owned ships he is doing the reverse.  There is, on the one hand, an invisible subsidy staying in the country and, on the other hand, going out of the country. There is an invisible transfer whenever we use our Irish shippers.  What we should be seeking to do is to provide for them the best possible conditions under which to operate and thus ensure that they are not hamstrung <i>vis-á-vis</i> their continental competitors by unfair regulations.</P>
    <P>This problem is going to increase in magnitude because of developments in the oil and off-shore gas business.  That <Col N="1869" /> is clearly going to provide an impetus for coastal shippers.  There will be a lot of transfers.  Perhaps some of these big companies will have their own vessels, but there certainly will be extra work for our small shipping companies. This is work that could very well make the difference between survival or going under for some of these shipping companies, and the sooner we have this legislation updated the better.</P>
    <P>I remember five years ago hearing that small coastal vessels were not allowed go to sea without a registered cook.  I do not know whether that still applies.  The people who told me about this said that as far as the Dutch, the Danish, the Germans and the Scandinavians were concerned, every member of their crew could be a registered cook or they might have no registered cook at all but it certainly did not prevent them going to sea.  I plead very strongly for greater flexibility in the regulations regarding coastal shippers.  They would be happy to accept the situation in which they are competing with heavily-subsidised State companies for their freight traffic if they felt that the regulations which bound them did not discriminate against them in favour of the continental shippers.  I hope that the Minister will be able to say that something will be done about it straight away.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly, wrote a very telling article a month or so ago, complaining that on so many occasions we unthinkingly followed the British pattern in so many parts of our life.  We have this in legislation for a good historical reason, but there is no reason why we should continue to accept this legislation without challenging it and without examining its relevance to our present situation. We might say, and it is a sort of blanket argument that is used whenever somebody makes an appeal like this: &ldquo;Oh, we cannot do anything because we are now in the EEC and there will soon be EEC regulations which will bind us all.&rdquo;  That is absolute nonsense.  If we take that attitude when we start bargaining with the relevant EEC Committee we will be in a weak position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> We should look to putting ourselves in a strong position while we have this independence which is essential, and then look to making our bargains with the EEC Committee.  We should make the most liberal possible shipping regulations and shipping laws immediately, and then, two years later, go into the EEC Committee which will be considering coastal shipping legislation and say: &ldquo;We are in this position and we do not want to backtrack from it,&rdquo; instead of saying: &ldquo;We are in a position in which our laws are so outmoded&mdash;they are based on British legislation from 1893 &mdash;that any liberalisation will do us.&rdquo; We would be in a much stronger position if we do something.</P>
    <P>I have harped on this point because I believe it is very important.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us something about the deliberations of the committee of his Department which have been looking into this problem since 1971, and that he will be able to say that some rapid progress will be made.</P>
    <P>The gripe the shippers have is justified and genuine.  I do not want this rather gloomy, disparaging note to reflect on the B &amp; I Company, which I think have done an excellent job, I hope my criticisms will be accepted in a constructive way.  That is the way they are being offered.</P>
    <P>When the B &amp; I Company are looking for ships on long-term charter they might well approach our coastal shippers because what a coastal shipper needs is a long-term charter agreement.  This would involve in some cases the actual building of a vessel which, one hopes, would be built in Ireland and the purchasing of a vessel, perhaps on loan terms, by an Irish company.  If B &amp; I are chartering a vessel it is obviously better because they are a company who are taking a long view and are able to get a long-term picture of their needs.  If they know they will need to charter a vessel in 1979 then why not strike up an agreement with one of our extern coastal shippers and say: &ldquo;If you have a vessel available in 1979 we will charter it from you.&rdquo; It will be an Irish vessel, registered in Ireland with an Irish crew, so the benefits <Col N="1871" /> of this commercial arrangement will stay in this country and will not go outside such as happened when our shipping companies have had to charter vessels before.</P>
    <P>This is another way in which the State company could help the private shipper by involving the Irish companies in long-term charters.  The B &amp; I attitude should be to try to support these companies and work together with them in generating further trade.  It is a very competitive but expanding market and one that is not likely to collapse overnight.  It is one in which one can be reasonably sure of the volume of trade.  It is good to see it expanding and I am sure it will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be gained by the various groups involved&mdash;the State companies and the private companies &mdash;working together.  I hope that what I have said will be taken in the spirit in which it is made.  I feel we must look at our private shippers again. I commend the operations of B &amp; I and their success.  I hope that the success of this company will not in any sense contribute to the extermination of the private firms working manfully away in this important area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerrigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  It shows faith in the B &amp; I company. While the main purpose of the Bill is to restore loan equity balance, it is also there towards additional capital costs for the future.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>We have to realise that, with the present B &amp; I roll-on-roll-off system, it is unfortunate that some passenger space has to be sacrificed.  I welcome the additional vessel which will be put to use on the Cork-Swansea route.  I also welcome the prospect of a ship being built in the Verolme Cork Dockyard.  This company are entitled to be congratulated on their success. As the Minister pointed out in his introductory speech, the costs per ton have dropped.  It is necessary that such an efficient service should be available for tourism and cargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> The company are to be congratulated on their industrial relations. They have given a headline to other semi-State bodies as well as to private companies.  They set up a good decision-making process, and this is very necessary.  That arrangement between the workers, the unions and the management has helped keep the company on a sound footing.  That can be achieved in any industry if proper provisions are made.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be taken in conjunction with the Harbours Bill.  I welcome the improvement in regard to share capital and so on.  I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on his initiative and I congratulate B &amp; I on their efforts to improve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for the welcome they have given the Bill today.  I always feel reasonably happy coming into the Seanad.  I know Senator Lenihan appreciates the difficulties which the Minister for Transport and Power has in riding the tide with semi-State bodies.  He had no such advantage when he was Minister.  There was nobody there who appreciated his difficulties and he probably got a rougher ride than I get.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is quite simple.  Massive investment in new equipment&mdash;both movable equipment and on-shore facilities&mdash;had to be provided by a company whose capital was far too low for the purpose.  That necessitated going into the capital market for loans at a very high rate of interest.  As Senator West pointed out, one loan in a continental currency hardening against sterling provided very great difficulties for the company.  However, that drain on their finances is now closed; and that loan has been reconverted into sterling and is not affected by depreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this company were purchased it was absolutely the right thing to do, even though the type of equipment and facilities purchased at the time were out of date and inadequate.  No effort had been made to foresee what would be necessary at the end of that <Col N="1873" /> decade and through this decade in relation to importers and exporters from this country.  The State bought the B &amp; I with this equipment in 1965 and set to run it.  An imaginative board and dynamic and hard-working personnel have absolutely changed it from a shipping line many years out of date into an enterprise of which we can all be proud of, which is continually looking ahead to see what the market demands will be and catering for them.</P>
    <P>The intense competition on the Irish Sea between British Rail and B &amp; I has had a beneficial effect on our economy because, as I pointed out in my opening speech, it has kept freight rates at, perhaps, an artificially low level from the shippers' point of view.  That is to the benefit of the whole economy: both exporters and importers get the benefit of these lower rates which, as two speakers said, have increased by only 22 per cent in ten years as against the CPI increase of 120 per cent in that time. If the B &amp; I were in freight only they could not have continued with these rates which would have brought the company into a very serious position long before now.  But because of the expansion into the car ferry service and, of course, the container freight roll-on-roll-off service, profitability has been helped very much.</P>
    <P>Accession to the European Communities and the use of the United Kingdom as a land bridge between here and the Continent has helped them very much also.  As I already pointed out, the change in the method of moving freight from unit loading containers to roll-on-roll-off has all been to the benefit of the company in that time.  If this trend continues the company should be, because of the high level of passenger handling and the extra ship which they will have in 1978 operating between this country and the United Kingdom, in a much more dominant position on the routes between here and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As Senator Lenihan said, there is great room for friendship and co-operation with British Rail in this regard. I would hope that B &amp; I would <Col N="1874" /> continue the close co-operation they have with them in everything but price.  The competition should stay and should still be keen in the cost of shipping, but in the use of facilities and the correct blending of their runs &mdash;so that they do not directly compete with one another at the same time and on the same day&mdash;they can jointly provide a continuous flow of vessels across the Irish Sea, to the benefit of the importers and exporters and the tourist industry in this country. If the Government of the day had not purchased the B &amp; I I would not like to think what the cost of movement across the Irish Sea would now be or, indeed, the quality of the service which would be available.  That action was of great benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Senators Russell, Lenihan, West and Kerrigan referred to the duty-free position.  I can tell Senator Lenihan that, as far as the line-up of forces within the Government service is concerned, the position has not changed since he was Minister.  There has been constant disagreement between the Revenue Commissioners and the people who advocate duty-free in regard to the probable cost to the country.  The Minister for Finance at my suggestion, having met B &amp; I, Bord Fáilte and Aer Lingus has set up a committee comprised of representatives of those companies and of the Revenue Commissioners in order to get the facts and to make sure that they are all in agreement on what the benefits and what the drain would be for the economy.  They will report to him, I hope, very shortly and he will then make a decision on the basis of that report.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell spoke of the necessity to service the capital now being invested in B &amp; I.  Of course, I hope that that would be the position.  However, I would not lay it down as a condition this year or next year, or even maybe the following year, that this should be so because they have to catch up on the position of imbalance that has obtained for a number of years.  But I would certainly feel that the mandate given to B &amp; I when they were taken over <Col N="1875" /> by the State should still hold and they should operate commercially in the full sense without the damage to the small shipowners Senator West talks about and without coming back to the Irish taxpayer looking to be subsidised.</P>
    <P>The concept of semi-State companies in this country is some 50 years old now.  There has been, perhaps necessarily, tension between what the Oireachtas would wish them to do and what their role should be in the market-place.  We all the time have them on bits of elastic-one Government or Minister drew them in, brought them more under control, and perhaps interfered with their progress; another Minister gave them a completely free rein, allowed them to operate commercially and tolerated the egg which he might sometimes find in his face.  My approach to them is pragmatic in as much as I agree that they should operate commercially, that they are there for the benefit of the people.  My relationship with each one of them changes according to the company involved.  They have been of great benefit to the country.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible to define the very necessary restrictions that have to operate in the civil service in regard to the formation of companies of this nature. They operate in fields where private enterprise could not afford the capital. Indeed if some private companies were foolish enough to buy some of the things these companies have to buy, they could not afford to keep running them and they would be closed down long ago.  There are many things that private enterprise does very much better and which the State should never touch; but there are very obvious things like the generation of electricity, the running of railways, the flying of airlines and so on where only the State can do it.  We should be thankful to all these companies because, from the time the very first one was set up, the ESB, the country <Col N="1876" /> could not have progressed at the rate it did without them and without the underpinning they gave to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Senator West and Senator Lenihan spoke about the 1893 Act under which most Irish shipping operates.  I am glad to tell Senator West that while I could not promise him the amending legislation within six months because that would be August or September, I will try to have it in this year.  There has been a lot of work done on it and many of the points that he raised were raised also by the Irish shipowners when they came to see me ten or 12 months ago. I asked them at the time if they would provide me with one or two members to go on the committee to get their point of view over to the Department.  I am sorry to say that they have not done that.  I would very much like them to have some say in it because they are the practical people operating in the field.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I would be very glad to have them on it.  This is a very specialised area and these are virtually the only people with the experience of operating small coasters.  I would adopt the attitude to them that I sense behind Senator West's words, that an island country like this could have a large number of small, profitable shipping companies, not just trading around the coast, but tramping all over the world, which another Irish company has so successfully done outside this country, that is, Irish Shipping.  I would hope that some people would see the rewards to them in investment in small ships as the Dutch, the Danes and the Norwegians have done and from which they have made a very profitable living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell referred to the subsidy for the west coast and said there had been one there but that it had been withdrawn for some reason.  I understand what happened was that there had been a conference which gave preferential rates up to the sixties, and when this conference broke down the preferential rates disappeared. <Col N="1877" /> It was not a question of a withdrawal of the subsidy, but the breaking down of the conference at the time.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Kerrigan's welcome for the building of the ship in the Verholme Cork Dockyard.  This will be, not a substitution vessel, but an additional vessel which shows the company are expanding.  It will mean that two ships will now run on the longest run operated by a car ferry by B &amp; I, that is the Cork-Swansea run.  To get the benefits of the tourist season B &amp; I will want delivery of that in 1978.  If the dockyard, for any reason, are not able to deliver that until June, July or August, B &amp; I would not be interested in taking it until the following year because it would be a drain on their finances over the winter of 1978.</P>
    <P>Senator West asked that we have a different passenger bunk ratio on the <i>Innisfallen</i>.  I believe it was not for the reason he stated that the vessel was purchased from people who operated mostly day sailings as against night sailings.  The best assessment that B &amp; I could make from market research in the last 12 months as to what the balance should be&mdash;obviously that is a balance over a span of time and in any one sailing it will not work out absolutely correctly&mdash;was a ratio of 1,500 passengers to 400 berths.</P>

    <Col N="1879" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy) Michael Pat Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The purpose of this short Bill is to remedy a technical defect in our Foyle Fisheries legislation as found in a recent High Court judgment related to convictions obtained against two fishermen in the District Court in Newtowncunningham, County Donegal in respect of fishery offences committed within the area of jurisdiction of the Foyle Fisheries Commission&mdash;some in County Donegal and some in County Derry.  The offences in question were in breach of regulations made by the commission in 1966 with the approval of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in Dublin and the Ministry of Agriculture in Belfast.</P>
      <P>The Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952, under which the commission were established, states that for the purposes of the Act &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Agriculture and &ldquo;the Ministry&rdquo; means the Ministry of Commerce for Northern Ireland.  On 1st April, 1963, the functions in relation to Foyle matters were transferred from the Ministry of Commerce in Belfast to the Ministry of Agriculture under the Ministries (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland) 1963.  The High Court ruled, however, that this order did not render the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture sufficient to validate the regulations under consideration, namely the Foyle Area (Control of Netting) Regulations, 1966 and stated that an Act of the Oireachtas would be necessary to effect a statutory transfer of the power of approval of commission regulations from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture.  Accordingly, the High Court ruled that the regulations of 1966 were not validly made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to give statutory recognition to the transfer of functions in relation to Foyle matters from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture and to any subsequent changes that might arise on the Northern Ireland side in this regard.  This will enable the commission to carry out their functions in regard to the management, conservation <Col N="1880" /> and protection of the Foyle fisheries.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that in order to ensure the proper administration of the Foyle Fisheries Commission in regard to conservation and preservation of stocks this legislation had to be introduced.  If the decision was allowed without this change it would render impossible the proper prosecution of the commission's activities.  For that reason there can be no opposition to the Bill.  I am sure that is the view of all Senators.  It is absolutely necessary to ensure the proper administration and management of the fisheries.  The introduction of this legislation will ensure that the transfers of functions which have already been effected by the Northern Ireland authorities from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture will be recognised by our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Lenihan.  I understand the problem which is that the Ministry of Commerce in Northern Ireland was the ministry which was referred to in the original Acts.  Then, regulations made by the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern Ireland were not regarded as valid in law.  This became a problem when people were charged with offences against regulations made by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell the House what the alleged offences were.  Presumably, they involved some form of poaching with some net or other engine.  This is of more importance than appears on the surface because the Foyle Fisheries Commission are one of the very few bodies who are jointly under the North-South Administrations.  It is important because it sets a headline, and one is loath to make any trenchant criticism of the operation of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Foyle Fisheries Commission are, in that sense, responsible both to this Parliament and to the Administration in <Col N="1881" /> Northern Ireland.  They face the extremely severe problem experienced by fisheries throughout the country in their administration.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these problems at length in previous debates.  If we are in the position which the Parliamentary Secretary has outlined, that it is not possible to prosecute offenders against the regulations in our courts because of a loophole in the legislation, then we obviously have to close that loophole at once.</P>
    <P>I should like to set on record the point that not only should these prosecutions receive due importance but that the main problem the fisheries face is the dreadful decrease in the number of salmon spawning in the Foyle area.  The rivers which make up the Foyle fisheries system are well known as some of the great salmon rivers, not just of Ireland or the British Isles but of the world.  Anybody who has had any interest in salmon fishing will be aware of this fact.  To drive home my point, I have the report of the Foyle Fisheries Commission which is the latest report 1972-73.  These reports are laid before the Oireachtas.  The figures for the slump in the number of salmon spawning in the area are drastic, so it is essential to tighten up the legislation connected with it.  I want to give some of the figures in regard to salmon spawning: 1964 13,000; 1965 22,000; 1966 22,600; 1967 15,000; 1968 7,000; 1969 3,800; 1970 5,300; 1971 4,300; 1972 2,100 and 1973 1,500.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that it seems to be part of a general phenomenon. One of the reasons for this decline is the tremendous increase in drift netting and draft netting.  I believe the Foyle Fisheries Commission are not severe enough and their regulations are far too liberal.  Unless something is done very soon, that figure of 1,500 spawning will be less than 1,000 having been 22,000 in 1964 and 1965.  It is a dreadful situation.  I regret that having made many appeals in this House very little seems to have been done.  In this case, something jointly would need to be worked out with the Northern Ireland Administration.  We seem to face a situation in the Foyle area where all netting of salmon will <Col N="1882" /> have to be closed down if it is to be restored to its former glory.  That is the only solution I can see.  I should like to know if there is any way of putting this into effect before the spawning salmon in the Foyle Fisheries area dwindle to a mere handful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Lenihan and Senator West for their contributions and to point out, as indicated in my opening brief, that this legislation is designed&mdash;as Senator West stated&mdash;to close a loophole which unfortunately existed in the legislation for the past 13 years.</P>
      <P>The offences which brought this to light&mdash;and which were referred to by Senator West&mdash;were having possession of unlawful nets, having possession of salmon illegally caught.  The cases were brought before the local court and, on appeal, it was discovered that the law did not meet the requirements of the High Court; hence the change. Along with the change from the Ministry of Commerce to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, we foresee a possibility of other changes taking place, namely, to some United Kingdom authority.  We have accordingly legislated for any future changes that may arise.  It is quite unlikely that a Bill of this kind will again have to be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I agree fully with the sentiments expressed by Senator West so far as the conservancy of salmon in the Foyle Fisheries area is concerned.  This is an exceptionally large area.  I understand that the total catchment is in the region of 1,400 square miles.  The commission are taking all necessary measures to ensure that adequate conservation measures are imposed and, as well as that to try to preclude or wipe out, if at all possible, illegal fishing.  Our representative now will be the current chairman this year and the point mentioned by Senator West will be taken into account by the commission.</P>
      <P>I am grateful that the House has seen fit to acknowledge, that this loophole needs closing and that this flaw needs to be removed.  I thank the House for its co-operation.</P>

      <P>Could I ask a question of the Parliamentary Secretary arising out of his speech and the 1972-73 Foyle Fisheries Report?  I am very glad he has been able to tell the House that something is being done about the very serious situation, but I note that in the report for 1972-73 two experts, Dr. Elson and Mr. Tuomi, from the Fisheries Research Board of the Department of the Environment in Canada, were doing a report of the Foyle fisheries area and that they were due to present that report in 1974 covering the problems I have raised.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would say if this report has reached him.  It says in the 1972-73 annual report that the commission understand the report to be submitted by Dr. Elson and Mr. Tuomi would be presented in 1974.  Has this report reached the Parliamentary Secretary <i>via</i> the commission and, if so, have the recommendations been acted upon?</P>

      <P>On reconsideration it is considered preferable to provide for the fixing of the amount by the registrar.  It is more appropriate that the amount fixed by the registrar can relate to the current value of money in the years ahead.  In addition, the paragraph as drafted only related to security for costs of investigation.  It is appropriate that security be obtained equally in the case of the holding of a meeting.

We have seen how they become irrelevant in a very short period particularly with the depreciating value of money.  Apart from that, it is far better to have legislation of this kind dealing with any sort of money payment dealt with on a flexible and reasonable basis.  That is the way the Minister's amendment meets it.  We can leave it to the registrar. He will be a person of authority and, hopefully, he will have the proper expertise available as staff to him. He is the person to do it without being hamstrung by a fixed sum that may become outdated very rapidly.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) (a) deals with the giving of notice by the registrar of his intention to issue a direction to a society to suspend the acceptance of funds or the making of payments not authorised by him.  It provides that where he considers that the giving of notice would not be prejudicial to the members or creditors or to the orderly and proper regulation of building society business he may give not less than 14 days notice. Where notice is given, the registrar is required under subsection (4) to consider any representations received. Subsection (3) (b) as drafted prohibited the registrar from giving notice where in his opinion the society had become, or were likely to become, unable to meet their obligations to creditors.</P>
      <P>On reconsideration, it is thought preferable to allow the registrar to use his discretion as to whether all the interests concerned are best served by giving, or by not giving, notice.  Section 49 (1) of the British Act of 1962 makes it mandatory on the registrar to give notice.  As circumstances can arise where a society are running into serious trouble, the delay caused by the need to consider representations after giving notice could have serious repercussions and the registrar will be in the best position to make an assessment of the situation.</P>

      <P>Section 33 as it stands is based on section 21 (3) and (6) of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  The Central Bank Act contains wider powers in subsections (4), (5) and (7) of that section and it was thought desirable to provide similar powers in the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to include these powers in section 33.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the amendment empowers the registrar to apply to the High Court for an order confirming a direction given by the registrar under section 31 or 32&mdash;a direction to suspend the acceptance of funds or the issue of advertisements&mdash;or for an order confirming and extending the period of operation of a direction under section 31.  The court is empowered to grant such an order. This is similar to section 21 (4) of the Central Bank Act but it is more extensive in that it applies to a direction to suspend advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) of the amendment empowers to the court to make such other order as appears to it to be necessary, in addition to or instead of an order under subsection (2).  This <Col N="1888" /> is similar to section 21 (5) of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Subsection (4) of the amendment provides that when an order is made by the High Court confirming and extending a direction given by the registrar under section 31, the society shall be deemed for the purposes of section 95 to be unable to pay their debts.  Under section 95 a society unable to pay their debts may be wound up.</P>
    <P>It is visualised that in a case where subsection (4) would apply, the registrar would petition the court to have the society wound up.  This would be the culmination of the action taken by the registrar under section 29, where he investigated the affairs of a society, or under section 31 where he issued a direction to suspend the acceptance of funds.</P>

      <P>Two quite separate powers are conferred by the section on the registrar.  The power in subsection (1) relates to the serving of a notice on a society or on a person who has in his power, possession or procurement any books, and so on relating to the business of the society.  This <Col N="1889" /> power is conferred on the registrar in connection with the exercise of his powers under sections 31 and 32 that is, in connection with the intention to issue a direction regarding the suspension of the acceptance of funds or the issue of advertisements.</P>
      <P>Documents sought under subsection (1) could include documents other than those which are the property of the society.  Under subsection (3) (a), however, the registrar or a person authorised by him is empowered to enter premises and to inspect and take copies of or extracts from the books and records of a society.  This power is conferred on the registrar for the performance of his functions under the Act.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (b), which is a corollary to subsection (3) (a), requires that a person who has in his power, possession or procurement of books, and so on shall produce them to the registrar. The documents which the person is required to produce must be those referred to in subsection (3) (a), that is, &ldquo;books and records of a society&rdquo;. The amendment is to give effect to this. It follows the lines of section 17 (3) of the Central Bank Act, 1971.</P>

The purpose of the amendment is to require the registrar to specify the considerations by reference to which he considered it necessary to issue the direction.  The amendment has been put forward to meet representations made by the Irish Building Societies <Col N="1890" /> Association.  The requirement is regarded as reasonable.</P>
      <P>Under sections 31 and 32 where the registrar issues a direction to suspend the acceptance of funds or the issue of advertisements, he is required to indicate the considerations by reference to which he considered it necessary to do so.

      <P>In subsection (2), line 21, to delete &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is one of a number of amendments which, in my view, are consistent with the Minister's own amendment No. 48 to section 38 where he is bringing the registrar into the section to fix limits in respect of investments after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank.  Our amendments which seek to make the registrar more independent in the exercise of his functions are on all fours with the Minister's amendment No. 48, with which I agree.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 36, I do not see how the Bill would be in any way prejudiced by deleting &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo;. We are seeking to establish the registrar as a person of authority and independence.  Surely he can, without the consent of the Minister for Finance, fix the fees to be paid for the inspection of documents and so on?  That is minor administration which will fall within the ambit of a responsible registrar and I doubt if he needs to be circumscribed by having to obtain the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with Senator Lenihan.  Yesterday he was recommending that the powers of our registrar should correspond to <Col N="1891" /> the powers of the UK registrar.  This amendment would run counter to that. The subsection empowers the registrar, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to fix fees to be paid for the inspection of documents and so on, and provides that any fees received by him shall be paid to the Exchequer. The amendment would allow the registrar, acting on his own initiative, to fix fees.  It seems reasonable and prudent to provide that the consent of the Minister for Finance be obtained in a matter such as this.  In the British Act of 1962, section 123 (1) (b) provides that the chief registrar, with the consent of the Treasury, may make regulations with regard to fees to be paid for the inspection of documents.  In this case we are following the lines of the British legislation.</P>

      <P>Representations were made by the societies seeking to transfer to the registrar the powers in the section conferred on the Minister for Finance.  It is considered appropriate that the Minister for Finance should exercise the powers conferred by the section.  In the Central Bank Act, 1971, the Central Bank exercises the powers to require licensed banks to maintain ratios.  As the Minister for Finance is the person who would have authority <Col N="1892" /> to confer trustee status on the deposits with building societies based on criteria laid down by him, including matters relating to reserve and liquidity ratios, it is considered that the Minister for Finance should be empowered to act under the section.  As drafted, the section provides that the Minister for Finance shall consult the Minister and the Central Bank.  The inclusion of the registrar, as a person to be consulted before the issue of a requisition, is partly to meet the objection of the societies.  A further reason is that the registrar will be in constant touch with the societies, will receive detailed returns from the societies and will be in a position to know whether societies can comply with any requisition to be issued.  Amendment No. 46 is consequential on this amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete the requirement that a society must maintain a specified ratio between its assets and its liabilities.  The section, as drafted, requires a society to maintain a specified ratio or a ratio not exceeding or not less than a specified ratio between its assets and its liabilities.  The provision is on the lines of section 23 (1) of the Central Bank Act, 1971.</P>
      <P>The societies made representations to the Department of Finance on this matter and satisfied that Department that it would not be practical for societies to have to maintain a specified ratio between assets and liabilities. Although banks have a great deal more flexibility in the matter of investing their funds, they are unable to keep a specified ratio except at one time in a period of a month or longer. In all the circumstances it is considered that the requirement at (b) and (c) will be adequate.</P>

      <P>With relation to the amendment made by the Minister and the power given in this section, the Minister seems to be rather inconsistent in giving the registrar power in this section as it now stands which he refused to give in some earlier sections&mdash;for instance, in section 10, where it seemed to be a less important power to give to the registrar.  I am glad the Minister has made certain concessions in this section but while it is good that he has done so, it seems rather inconsistent with his refusal to give similar power, and even less important power, to the registrar in some of the earlier sections, particularly in section 10.</P>

In redrafting subsection (1) the wording in section 23 of the 1874 Act and in section 71 of the British Act has been used&mdash;&ldquo;conditioned for giving a just and true account of all moneys ...&rdquo; has been substituted for &ldquo;securing the society against loss caused by fraud or embezzlement&rdquo;.

      <P>&ldquo;(a) by sending to every person entitled to attend the meeting a notice in such form as the Registrar may direct, or</P>

      <P>This is a minor amendment rearranging (a) and (b) as drafted.  It is thought desirable to require the Registrar's consent in a case where notice of a meeting is to be given by Press advertisement.  It is expected that this would be a matter of form in most cases.  However, a case could arise where the Registrar might wish, because of the conduct of previous meetings, the financial situation of the society or, say, the retirement of an auditor, that all members be notified.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that persons entitled to attend a meeting of a society comply with two requirements: (1) that they held investment shares to which voting rights attached at the end of the previous financial year; and (2) that at the date of the meeting they still continued to hold those shares.  If the amendment was not included a borrower who held investment shares at the end of the previous financial year and disposed of them before the meeting could claim to be entitled to attend a meeting as he would technically be still a member in his capacity as a borrower.</P>

      <P>Section 1, as amended, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 65:</P>
      <P>Before section 53 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;53.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (2), the persons entitled to vote at a meeting of a society shall be all members who, at the end of the last financial year before the date of the meeting, held shares to which voting rights attached which were issued by the society under section 22 (1) to a value of not less than £10 and at the date of the meeting continued to hold such shares.</P>
      <P>(2) A person under the age of twenty-one years shall not be entitled to vote at a meeting.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The section, as amended, differs in some respects from the section as drafted: (a) it includes the requirement, as in section 52, that the member still held investment shares at the date of the meeting, (b) subsections (2) and (3) of the original section are being deleted and (c) shareholding reduced from £25 to £10.  The section, as amended, will clarify the right of members to vote.  All members who held investment shares to which voting rights attached to a value of not less than £10 will be entitled to vote at meetings.  The shares must have been held at the end of the previous financial year and must still be held at the date of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> It will be noted that reference is made to the shares issued under section 22 (1).  This is in order to differentiate between investment shares and advance shares which might be issued to a borrower.  A borrower is not entitled to vote unless he is also the holder of investment shares.  Reference also is made to shares to which a voting rights attached.  This is in line with section 22 (7) to meet the case of the Irish Civil Service Building Society. Savings shares in that society do not carry voting rights.  Section 10 (1) (r) provides that the rules shall specify the voting rights of members.  In subsections (2) and (3) of the section as drafted, it was proposed to specify precisely the voting rights, on a show of hands or on a poll on a special resolution, one vote, and on a poll on a resolution other than a special resolution, the number of votes set out on the table.</P>
    <P>Representations have been received from one society that the investment shares in that society carry a vote for each share held.  If that society were to bring their voting structure into line with the requirements of the section as drafted, it would cause a serious problem for the society.  The group have invested a substantial sum in the society and would wish to retain control. Similarly, under section 18, the Bill requires a substantial investment on the part of founders of new societies.  It is logical that if they wish to do so, the founders of new societies should be in a special position at least for the five year period during which they are required to maintain their funds in the society.  The deletion of subsections (2) and (3) will mean that the rules will be relied upon to set out the voting rights.</P>

      <P>I agree broadly with the amendment and what I am going to say now is probably more valid on the section.  I refer to the question of 21 years.  I notice a legal problem in the definition of &ldquo;minor&rdquo;.  There is a lot of confusion.  It is a grey area since we gave voting rights to people of 18 years in elections.  Similarly, in certain aspects of law.  21 years is still regarded as absolute <i>vis-á-vis</i> the definition of minor.  In other areas it is 18 years.  Perhaps the Minister should <Col N="1902" /> take a bold step here&mdash;I am waving a banner now for a cause&mdash;and be consistent in regard to giving responsibilities to young people and have 18 years written in here instead of 21 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already taken a bold step with regard to the 18-year-olds. In fact, I understand the position is that, if the Department of Justice bring in a law which reduces the age of majority to 18 years, or whatever it may be, it automatically replaces the 21 years wherever it may occur in any legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it? &ldquo;Minor&rdquo; is a sort of grey definition which is undefined at the moment.  If the definition of &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in whatever legislation the Department of Justice bring out is deemed to be 18 years, automatically every reference in every Act of the Oireachtas to &ldquo;minor&rdquo; will automatically mean 18 years.  When the Minister puts in 21 years specifically here, there may be a difficulty at some future date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Senator's problem but the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; is imprecise and we are not supposed to use an imprecise word in legislation.  In fact, I am advised by the legal people that if the age of majority is reduced to a specific age, it will automatically follow that where 21 occurs it will be replaced.</P>

Once we made a decision to extend voting rights to <Col N="1903" /> our national Parliament, to our local authority councils, to 18-year-olds, that gives enfranchisement and responsibility to people of 18 years and the whole area of legal obligations and responsibilities in the legal area, in the company law area, and in the building societies' area, right across the board it should be at 18 years.

The purpose of the amendment is to keep the section in line with the provisions of the Companies Act.

It is irrelevant from the legal interpretation point of view.  It is a hangover from old legislation going back to common law periods.  It should disappear from all legislation. It does not add anything.  You either fail or you do not fail to take reasonable <Col N="1906" /> steps and &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; adds nothing to it.</P>

In other spheres it is impossible at times to give corresponding particulars and to try to do so would only be misleading rather than helpful.

      <P>Government amendment No. 90:</P>
      <P>Before section 73 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;73.&mdash;(1) Every society shall keep a register of the names and addresses of its members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> (2)  The register shall be kept at the chief office of the society or, with the consent in writing of the registrar, at one or more offices of the society other than its chief office.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every society having more than 50 members shall, unless the register is in such a form as to constitute an index, keep an index of the names of the members of the society and shall, within 14 days after the date on which any alteration is made in the register of members, make any necessary alteration in the index, and the index shall at all times be kept at the same place as the register of members.</P>
    <P>(4)  (a) A member of a society may, for the purpose of communicating with other members on a subject relating to its affairs, request the secretary to transmit to those other members such information as he requires and where the secretary, having regard to the interests of members as a whole and to any other relevant circumstances, is satisfied that the application is made in good faith, he shall comply with the request.</P>
    <P>(b)  Where the secretary of a society complies with a request under paragraph (a) the applicant shall be liable for any costs incurred by the society in complying with the request and the society may require the applicant to give security for payment of costs.</P>
    <P>(5)  In the event of the refusal of a society to comply with a request under subsection (4), the secretary of the society shall notify the member who made the request of the grounds for such refusal and the member may refer the refusal to the Registrar.</P>
    <P>(6)  A decision on a request under subsection (4) shall be notified to the member who made the request within a period of one month after the day on which the request is received by the society.</P>
    <P>(7)  Where an applicant makes a reference to the Registrar under <Col N="1912" /> subsection (5), the Registrar may, having heard any representations made by the society, direct the society to comply with the request subject to such limitations or conditions (including conditions relating to the nature of the information to be given, and to arrangements for payment of costs) as the Registrar may think fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to delete the section as drafted by deletion of lines 35 to 54 in page 43 and lines 1 to 33 in page 44 and to substitute the new section.</P>
      <P>The amendment arises out of very strong representations made by the Building Societies Association in regard to the difficulties which the section as originally drafted would create.  It was agreed that there was no necessity for the registers of names and addresses of members to show the date on which each person was entered on the register and the date on which he ceased to be a member. The strongest objections related to the proposed requirement that a member of a society be enabled to obtain names and addresses from the register for the purpose of communicating with other members of the society on a subject relating to its affairs.  The case was made, and the argument is accepted, that no matter how justifiable a case could be made to obtain lists of names and addresses of members, there could be no guarantee that the lists would not be used for other purposes subsequently.  The societies' representatives considered that the intrusion on the confidentiality of their operations with their members which the section as drafted would enable would be extremely harmful to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances a new section is proposed which will require the societies to keep a register of the names and addresses of their members at the chief office, or at other offices with the consent of the registrar, and require them to keep it in the form of an index if they have more than 50 members.  In so far as it is necessary to provide so that members should be able to communicate with other members on <Col N="1913" /> matters relating to their membership, it is proposed that any member may request the secretary of a society to issue the communication which he provides to the members and, if the secretary is satisfied that the application is made in good faith, he shall comply with the request.</P>
    <P>Where the secretary complies with the request it is proposed that the applicant should be liable for the costs incurred.  In the event of a refusal to comply with such a request, the secretary will be required to give the member the grounds for such refusal and the member may refer the matter to the registrar.  Provision is then made so that the registrar may, having heard the representations, direct the society to comply subject to such limits or conditions as he thinks fit.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to limit the scope of the subsection to a director of a society who is also an auctioneer.  As drafted, the subsection could have very wide implications resulting in the loss of professional fees to an auctioneer who was, for instance, a society's surveyor or where a branch manager was an auctioneer and under the rules of the society also an officer of the society. While a surveyor or branch manager might be able to influence the making of a loan, he would not be in a position actually to authorise the loan.  A different situation would arise in the case of a director who would be a person authorising the making of a loan.  The amendment strikes a more reasonable balance in controlling this matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;77.&mdash;(1) Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase, he may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministerial amendment No. 96 modifies slightly subsection (1) <Col N="1917" /> as drafted.  The effect of Senator Yeats' three amendments would be to confer on the register, subject to the consent of the Central Bank, power to make regulations regarding the amounts and purposes of loans. Senator Yeats does not provide for any involvement or consultation with either the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance, the two Ministers most directly concerned with housing matters.  The Minister for Local Government has overall responsibility for the housing programme and has expert advice available on housing matters.  The Minister for Finance has responsibility for the provision of finance for all State services including the funding of the capital programme for housing.  To exclude both Ministers from the section would be most unrealistic.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, no criteria are proposed by reference to which the controls might be exercised.  In his proposal to delete subsection (3) he would create problems in the framing of the regulations.  Throughout the Bill, the principle of framing provisions tailored to meet the needs of different types of societies has been enshrined and it would be inappropriate to delete the subsection in this instance.  The purpose of the ministerial amendment is to modify subsection (1) of the section as drafted.  It will be noticed that the amendment would provide for consultation with the registrar before making regulations under the section. The revised subsection would not include a reference to the needs of the national housing programme or to the conditions subject to which such loans may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Building Society Association made representations to the effect that any controls under the section should be exercised by the registrar. In the course of lengthy discussions on the matter, the societies did not disagree about the possible need for the controls over the amounts and purposes of loans.  Their principal worry was that the section, as drafted, would enable the control of interest rates and that the decision might be based upon political considerations to the detriment of economic and financial ones, <Col N="1918" /> or even that decisions would be delayed for political convenience.</P>
    <P>It can be argued confidently that in certain circumstances there is a need to control this vital sector of building society business.  For example, at a time when there is a shortfall in the inflow of funds in relation to the demand for loans, it would be desirable to ensure that an undue proportion of the funds available to societies was not devoted to non-housing purposes or to the purpose of expensive houses.  It is agreed that, in the main, the societies have been very conscious of their social responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is intended to last for a long time.  It would be unwise not to take the powers now sought and thus provide for changed circumstances in the future.  The provision of finance for housing, whether in the public or the private sector, is one of the most important functions of Government.  Any regulation made under the section would have regard to the overall position of housing which, in turn, has an important impact on employment.  It is clear, therefore, that the exercise of controls over the amounts and purposes of loans could most properly be exercised by the Minister who is responsible for the organisation of the housing programme.  It is also appropriate that the consent of the Minister for Finance should be sought.  He is the Minister primarily concerned with the provision of finance for housing and all other services.</P>
    <P>Consultation with the registrar is envisaged in the amendment.  This should provide useful information and advice on which to make regulations since the registrar who, it is envisaged, will be in constant touch with societies will be able to identify the pattern of lending by the societies or any changes in that pattern.  He will also be in a position to advise whether the making of regulations would have any effect on other aspects of building society business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section represents the nub of our disagreement in principle with the Minister.  The Minister is well aware of the issues <Col N="1919" /> involved.  It is a question of how to go about it.  The building societies have been expanding and drawing in funds in a particularly expert way. They are particularly equipped to attract small investments.  We want to ensure that is accelerated in the overall interests of the economy.  That is the objective.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that, for policy reasons, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government should have their finger in this pie. That is what is proposed here under section 77 and only moderately improved by the Minister's amendment which brings in the registrar for consultation with the Minister for Finance.  As the section stands, the registrar is not even mentioned.  The Government are getting their priorities all wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection provides that whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of proper and orderly regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme, he may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, make these regulations. This gives to the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance enormous bureaucratic control. With all due respect to the two Ministers concerned, and witnessing in other areas the question of the direction of our economic affairs, we are witnessing a total run down of the economy at present.  That is a fact.  We are in very serious financial straits.  Here is a sector of the economy, the building societies, who are apparently able to attract money and who, on the Minister's statement in his opening speech in which he paid just tribute to them, are the repository of upwards of £300 million. We want to see that accelerated and improved.  They appear to have an expertise in attracting funds and in the proper distribution of funds to aid a private house-building programme, apart from the other investments to which they contribute to the national <Col N="1920" /> economy.  Here are people in a proven area of the economic and social activity who have proved their worth and now we are going to impose on them the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government who have failed totally in the management of our economy at present.</P>
    <P>I will leave aside the other point I have just mentioned and come to the fact that, apart from the politics of whoever is Minister for Finance and whoever is Minister for Local Government, we are now seeking to have imposed on a highly successful area of investment and financial business controls in regard to the amounts and the purpose of loans and the conditions subject to which loans will be made, and this control is to be held by the administration residing in the Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>With all respect to these people&mdash; they are administrators&mdash;what expertise have they in this business of banking, financing, house loans, investment incentives, liquidities, ratios of exchange and liquidity, reserves and so on?  What experience resides in either of these two Departments of State sufficient to engage in the sort of control that is envisaged under this section? This is the nub of it.  The serious matter is that the Minister will have to agree that that experience does not exist.  The Minister may quote to me that this is a policy area.  That is a fine, global description, a policy area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am talking about the amounts, purposes and conditions of loans.  I am referring to section 77, subsection (1) and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having <Col N="1921" /> regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme, he may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies and the conditions subject to which such loans may be made.</P>
    <P>Section 77 (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may provide for all or any one or more of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the maximum amount of a loan that a society may make;</P>
    <P>(b)  the purposes for which loans may or may not be made by a society; and</P>
    <P>(c)  the maximum amount that a society may lend to a body corporate and the total amount of such loans.</P>
    <P>That sort of bureaucratic control envisaged under section 77 will deter investment in building societies.  The very existence of section 77, even with the improvement the Minister suggests, will act as a deterrent to this sort of investment and the required flow of funds into building societies. It must be taken in conjunction with section 76.  I am on the right section with regard to this aspect, and our amendment pinpoints what I say.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment to section 77 merely brings in the registrar, whom I would regard as the central office in the policing and monitoring of building societies.  I envisage the registrar being established as an independent institution.  The office has been established in Britain where it has functioned well since 1962 and where under that system the registrar fundamentally is regarded as the institution that has the sole supervisory function on both the policing and the financial monitoring sides <i>vis-á-vis</i> building societies.  Building societies relate to him and to him alone and that is the way it functions. Now, for policy reasons, under section 77 and also under section 76 and right through the Bill, on this area of managing the financial, investment <Col N="1922" /> and distribution policies of building societies, the Minister is seeking to bring in the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government. He has promised in regard to section 76 that he is considering an amendment for Report Stage.  I suggest that his proposed amendment to section 77, which we are now discussing, is inadequate in this respect if we are to retain the confidence of the investing public in building societies.  Their confidence will be deterred enormously if they see a situation where building societies are, in effect, a section of the Departments of Local Government and Finance.</P>
    <P>If the respective Departments concerned could attract such funds why not set them up to attract such funds?  They are not in a position to do it.  They do not have the expertise. They would be the first to admit themselves that they do not have the expertise.  Departments of State are set up to be administrators in regard to legislation passed by this House and in regard to the administrative functions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Government of the day.  That is what an administration is for.  That is what the Department of Finance are for in the financial field of State administration.  The Department of Local Government have their functions in regard to local government administration of the State.  They are not bankers, building societies, or insurance companies. They are not operators in the field of money; they know nothing, or very little, about it.</P>
    <P>This is a field of expertise able to attract funds that are not thrown into the banking net, not thrown into the insurance company net, and able to attract funds of the order of £300 million, and hopefully more, which are to be distributed in accordance with the needs and requirements of the private house-building industry. Does the Minister think that his Department or the Department of Finance can perform this function any better, and can so presume to perform the function that under section 77 the respective Ministers may make regulations relating to the purposes, amounts and conditions of such <Col N="1923" /> loans?  I do not think they can do it. I am very serious about this.  There is an issue of principle here.  I do not think they are equipped to do it.</P>
    <P>The sensible thing to do would be to equip the central office, as it were, relating to building societies under an independently appointed registrar, equip that registrar and that office with all the necessary expertise and capacity, with people of banking and building society experience, people of financial expertise who have knowledge to advise, to monitor and to make the appropriate regulations in regard to a building society.  It can be done by our amendments that have been taken here with the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is a very minor improvement on the situation. It just brings in the registrar in a consultative capacity and the Minister for Finance must consult with him. The Minister could consult him until the cows come home and need not take the advice arising out of the consultation. If the Minister wants to put the heavy hand of administration into the policy areas of the building societies, then he is running into the very serious danger of deterring investment in the building societies.</P>
    <P>What we suggest in the two amendments put down by Senator Yeats is to delete altogether subsection (1), which embodies this over-regulation and over-supervision on the part of the two respective Ministers and their Departments. Senator Yeats proposes that should be deleted.  He also proposes in amendment No. 98 that what should be substituted in subsection (2) is &ldquo;the registrar subject to the consent of the Central Bank&rdquo;.  I have agreed to withdraw &ldquo;the Central Bank&rdquo;.  I am agreeable to having &ldquo;the Minister Finance&rdquo; in there or &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;the Central Bank&rdquo; as long as it is the registrar, with the concurrence or consent of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance, who makes the regulations in this matter.  The policy area is the responsibility of the boards of these building societies that are set up, as the Minister <Col N="1924" /> provides for under the Bill, under various voting and other procedures. This is what the policies are about. Otherwise why are boards there?  Why have building society boards?  Why go through voting procedures to elect representatives of shareholders on the boards of building societies unless they are going to be responsible for policy matters?</P>
    <P>What the Minister proposes is that he and the Minister for Finance should, in effect, be the equivalent of, and indeed, superseding the respective boards of the building societies.  I always understood that boards of companies or of building societies or appointed by properly constituted voting methods were there to look after the policies of the respective companies or building societies.  That is what boards are for.</P>
    <P>What the Minister, in effect, is saying&mdash;and I am quoting him on this&mdash;is that he feels that he and the Minister for Finance should be responsible for the policy-making approach on the part of building societies.  That is very near a complete State takeover of building societies, if the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance feel that the policy matters in relation to building societies are their responsibility.  I can see a very serious situation if the word gets abroad at all that the people who are running the policy of building societies are the Ministers for Finance and Local Government.  It would be a very serious situation with regard to funds drying up.  The Minister should bear very seriously on this point.  The Government are in sufficient trouble at the moment.</P>

      <P>If this is the sort of thing that is involved then I have no apology for saying that it is going to cause a drying-up of the flow of funds into building societies.  The whole essence of building societies is that they are composed of widespread shareholders who are in a position to attract small investments.  They have a democratic system of voting and of electing boards of their societies. They have a facility and a capacity and an expertise in attracting small funds into these building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building societies are now funded in excess of £300 million at present, making a very positive contribution to the economy.  I do not see building societies acting as units of the Departments of Local Government and <Col N="1926" /> Finance under policy objectives of the respective Ministers, particularly under a discredited Government as at present, in the handling of financial matters.  I do not see much building societies continuing to attract funds of the order that they have attracted in recent years and we hope they will attract in the years ahead.  That is all I am saying.  It is a point of view and an opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government should take himself and the Minister for Finance out of section 76 and particularly out of section 77.  Instead, he should write into the legislation that the registrar be properly established as an institution with a proper office and proper expertise to supervise and monitor building societies.&rdquo; He should leave the policy direction to the boards of building societies, provided that, in accordance with overall building society criteria in regard to their funds and overall policing in regard to their structure and establishment, that aspect of policing and monitoring their administration, their investment and lending practice is done under an independent authority&mdash;say the registrar of friendly societies or some new animal of that kind equipped to do that job.  The day-to-day policy direction in regard to collection and lending of funds should be left to the boards of the building societies, properly appointed in accordance with this statute.  The Ministers for Finance and Local Government should take their hands out of it.  If they insist on keeping their hands in it is going to be very serious and deleterious as far as the flow of funds to the building societies is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a factual statement of opinion which I am entitled to express and I say it on very secure and solid advice. There is no need for the Minister to develop any hot air about it.  They are the facts that are concerning people who are very interested in investment and development, and particularly interested in the private house-building sector that is on its knees at the moment and requires a lift through accelerating an inflow of funds.  The Minister should seriously <Col N="1927" /> take into account the single aspect whether he and the Minister for Finance are better equipped to act as policymakers for the building societies than the boards of building societies properly appointed and elected under this statute, subject to the overall policing and monitoring of an independent registrar who has available to him the expertise necessary to ensure that building societies operate in accordance with the law and proper lending practices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister, I would like to take another tack on that section and section 76.  Already the Minister has proposed a great deal of amendments to the Bill, and he has yielded to persuasion with regard to the importance and the salience of the role of registrar.  My approach to this section would be to suggest that, in a way, it stands out at this moment in spirit a little bit from the amended sections earlier on&mdash;sections 37, 38 and so on.  The Minister has shown himself amenable to persuasion and to giving the position of registrar a far larger role than in the Bill originally considered.</P>
      <P>I was going to speak on section 76 but the Minister said he would be bringing in an amendment.  It seems that section 76 has the disadvantage that it almost substitutes itself for the Bill itself.  In other words, it hands over plenipotentiary powers, so to speak, to the Minister and to the Department of Finance.  I do not know how radical the Minister's amendment will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>But even seriously considering makng an amendment could result in not making an amendment at all.  I am glad to have that timely warning, because I may put down an amendment myself, in case of a lacuna, when we come to Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is the Minister's intention to put the building societies into the hands of the Departments of Finance and Local Government, else there have been unnecessary and superfluous feints in his amendments so far.  Something better might be considered if one were to think about section 77.  Instead of saying &ldquo;whenever the Minister considers it expedient&rdquo; would it not be better to say &ldquo;whenever the registrar considers it expedient in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building societies that he may, subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo;, do this, that or the other?  In earlier sections and in amendments he has given the initiative to the registrar and he seems to have been sensitive to the suggestion that the registrar should have a large role in the matter. I suggest that perhaps that kind of formulation might help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lenihan on one or two points.  This Bill is to be here for all time.  It is not simply a Bill to be at the service of the present Minister, whose intentions on these matters are above reproach.  It may fall into the hands of other Ministers in the future.  He has said it will be a long time before this happens and his confidence is to be admired, if not wondered at.  It seems to me if we have a Government even like the present one, with a strong ideological split already evincing itself, the uses to which that Bill could be put could differ greatly.  If Senator Halligan, for instance, was calling the shots, interference with building societies and the direction of their policies, would be rather different from a situation where Deputy John Kelly was calling the shots.  In other words, the instrument is one which will be there for all time.  Its use would depend on the ideology of the Minister in power and his idea of what a free enterprise <Col N="1929" /> society is about.  Have we a free enterprise society or have we a socialistic society?  We are vacillating between one and the other, and these two ideologies are being tossed from one side of the Coalition to the other at present.  Not being a member of any party, I would be interested in having a Bill which would be proof against the vacillations of ideology as between the three major parties.  I trust totally the Minister with this Bill in his hands, but others could come in his place.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan says that the building societies have done a very reassuring thing.  Through television advertisements the people have been encouraged to invest their money in building societies.  These advertisements must be bearing fruit.  The small man, the ordinary citizen, has a sense of cosy comfort about investments in these societies.  It would be dangerous if such investors were frightened off.  As much power as is reconcilable with democracy should be given to the registrar. He would not be the tool of the building societies.  He would be an independent agent who would mediate between the Government and the building societies and he would have the advantage of being outside the area of politics and therefore of ideologies.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in section 77 and when he comes to consider, with whatever outcome, an amendment to section 76 he would, instead of the present form, say something to the effect that &ldquo;wherever the registrar considers it expedient that, subject to the consent of the Minister, he may issue directions in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.&rdquo;  In the small, intimate area of the working of the society the registrar should have the initiative but always, in a democracy, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. In Britain, they use the phrase &ldquo;subject to the consent of the Treasury&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was rather annoyed by an opinion expressed by Senator Lenihan.  Let it be said, to the Minister's credit, that it seldom happens that he gets annoyed.  I cannot understand why he got annoyed <Col N="1930" /> because it is our duty here to point out dangers we may see and they can be considered by the Minister.  Senator Lenihan said that the investing public and the members of the societies will be suspicious of the motives behind ministerial control.  They will either view it as a means of making building societies an arm of Government policy or feel that the societies' managements are unable to carry on their operations without Government supervision. There is a danger in either case that confidence will be severely shaken, and the result could be counter-productive. The inflow of funds to the societies could be jeopardised and it is our duty to point out these dangers.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill.  I am not sure if the Minister had consultations with representatives of the building societies' association on these sections.  The Minister will agree that the building societies have done more to create a happy society than any other agency in the country.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker referred to advertising on radio and television by building societies.  There are other agencies also looking for money but the difference is that, even though they offer attractive rates, the money may well be used for investment outside the country and to create business elsewhere.  At least the building societies' money is used here to create homes for people.  They deserve great praise for their efforts and the initiative they have shown towards helping people to purchase their homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take all our points into consideration.  I cannot understand why he resented Senator Lenihan's opinion.  If he gives it due thought, he may well reconsider his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I did not resent the Senator's opinions.  I said I would consider any suggestions made.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they be suspicious?  In effect, what is being asked now is to regularise what has been in operation by arrangement since 12th May, 1973.  It is not, as has been suggested, a question of telling the building societies how to run their own business.  Section 77 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase and the financial needs of the national housing programme, he may...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the only matters.  If there are any other regulations they will have to go before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Since 12th May, 1973, an arrangement has existed between the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the building societies which covers this point which is included in this section.  They are working very well, and instead of frightening away the investor what has happened is that the inflow of funds in 1972-73, immediately before I took over, was £34 million for the year and last year it was £74 million. Does that show people getting afraid because the Government are laying down regulations and saying they must spend the money they get for the purpose of building houses?  We also gave a subsidy for a lean period in order to encourage the building societies, and the Minister for Finance had to explain what the subsidy would be and how it would be regulated.  The result has been that the inflow has increased from £34 million to £74 million in 1975.  The amount of money which has been paid out in loans rose from £43 million in 1972-73 to £65 million in 1975 and, according to the building societies themselves, will be about £85 million this year.  This does not show <Col N="1932" /> a lack of confidence under the regulations which we are putting in a formal way into the Bill.  Perhaps I should have explained this a little earlier but I was under the impression that everybody understood it.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether they want a guarantee, trustee status will give them a much greater guarantee than they have at present.  Building societies will continue to grow. Senator Lenihan said there was no expertise in the Department of Finance or in the Department of Local Government.  This is entirely wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No expertise in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Expertise in this area is in both Departments and, in the main, they are people who came with the change of Government and who had worked under the previous Government and many of them have been many years there.  Civil servants in both the Department of Finance and Local Government are excellent people who have got an expertise which is in no other society that I know.  I do not think the building societies could claim that they have the type of expertise which is needed in those cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan introduced a few things which I hoped would not be introduced in this House, as we had been discussing matters reasonably. But since he has referred to the crux in the house building industry I repeat that, with the assistance of the building societies, we built twice as many houses as the Government of which he was a Minister over the last three years of his office.  We should not try to make political points in matters like this because they will only backfire. I introduced so many amendments to this Bill that it appeared as if it would have a long and difficult passage through this House, but I did most of them after my officials and the officials of the Department of Finance had discussions with the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not agreed to everything the building societies wanted.  I would be <Col N="1933" /> a very poor Minister if I did.  It is not my function to regulate the Bill for the purpose of facilitating the building societies, because they are only one side of it.  They have done an excellent job here.  We have given them&mdash; and they would be the first to admit it &mdash;excellent support and encouragement to carry on the business.  We found it necessary to make an arrangement in 1973 to have the business carried out in a certain way, because it was known&mdash;and there is no point in covering it up&mdash;that certain building societies, some of which no longer exist as building societies, invested the money they received for the purpose of building houses as a building society other than in building houses.  We said this was wrong.  We made a regulation which the building societies accepted.  We made the regulation about interest rates and so on.  These have worked very well.  If there is any major change suggested it would have to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is no question of a major change being made nor is there any suggestion of interference in the day-to-day business of the building societies.  This is a section to which I am not prepared to accept an amendment.  This received more consideration than any other part of the Bill because we wished to ensure that there would be no cause for complaint.  To refer back, if I may, to section 76, to which Senator Martin referred, that does require an amendment. My idea is that when we get the Bill through this House and have it passed through the Dáil, it will be an excellent Bill.  It will be legislation of which both Houses will be proud.  I would prefer if we kept the discussion on the basis of what is best for the country, and leave the narrow sectional interest to one side.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It is misleading in the sense that it seems to go out of its way to suggest that this section will not allow the Minister to interfere in an unwarranted way in policy matters. It goes out of its way to say &ldquo;whenever the Minister considers it expedient in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building society business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase&rdquo;. It is hardly necessary to say all of that.  We all expect the Bill to be about that kind of thing.  Furthermore, section 76 deals with the regulations relating to the management of building societies and it says:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, make such regulations relating to the management of societies as he considers it necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing their proper and efficient management...</P>
      <P>It seems to be hardly necessary to say this at all in section 77.  It certainly seems unnecessary to repeat what has been more or less said in the previous section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  The very fact that this section has been amended and the words &ldquo;the financial needs of the national housing programme&rdquo; deleted in a sense concedes the point that, as originally drafted, this section was giving the Minister power to interfere in a way which would really be a radical departure from the power which the Minister had in the past, interfering in the ordinary business of the building society by allowing the Minister, for political reasons,&mdash;I do not mean that in any narrow sense&mdash;to dictate to the building societies how they should run their societies because the Minister in a particular situation wanted the national housing programme to proceed in a certain direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which has been put down by the Minister recognises that he was possibly going too far in that direction.  It would be quite wrong for the societies to find themselves <Col N="1935" /> having to change their policy, having to do things they did not want to do, because of the political whim of the Minister of the day and because the Minister of the day had a particular idea about what the national housing programme should be, what form it should take, what direction it should go in.  Therefore I am glad, at least, the Minister has taken out these particular words because quite clearly the whole building society sphere was in danger of being disrupted by whatever the Minister of the day considered should be done for the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>Even as it stands, it allows political interference, interference in the ordinary running of the building societies as a result of what a Minister thinks.  Ministers have enthusiasms and various indiosyncrasies, some of them very desirable ones and some of them not so desirable.  The important thing is that the building societies should not be too susceptible to the whims and enthusiasms and so on of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>What is important here is that the views of the Minister should not be capable of interfering too easily with the policy of the building societies.  I know that if the Government or the various Ministers involved in this sphere want the building societies to do something and if they want it hard enough, they are certainly in the long run going to persuade the building societies to do what they want or at least to make some concession; but the Minister should not be able to do it too easily.  The merit of the kind of amendment that we, on this side of the House, put down&mdash;although admittedly it had to be changed slightly &mdash;is that the regulations would have to be made by the registrar, that the registrar would have the initiative in these regulations.  Certainly in the long run the Minister would have to be consulted and the Minister, from a statutory point of view, would, in the end, have to consent and make the regulations.  But the initiative should be left quite firmly in the hands of the registrar so as to inhibit at least to some extent the Minister and to discourage <Col N="1936" /> him or slow him down in implementing his whims to the detriment of the building societies.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain from reading this section as originally drafted, in particular, and even as it remains here that there is a deliberate effort to try to play down the fact that this section gives rather far-reaching and dangerous power to the Minister to interfere with the ordinary running of a building society, not in the sense of being a supervisory authority to prevent the building societies from doing things which would be dangerous or not in the interests of their members or good management but in the sense of interfering with the policy of a building society.  For that reason, this section should be amended. Perhaps our amendment has its shortcomings and perhaps we can devise a better one for the next Stage, but there should be some amendment on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that what is proposed in this amendment is merely to implement a state of affairs that has existed since 1973.  Of course, the state of affairs there, as I understand it, was merely a temporary agreement but to put that into a Bill which may last for a long time when enacted, as previous building society Acts have done, is a quite different thing from having an <i>ad hoc</i> agreement between the Minister and the societies for the last few years.  This section goes too far and it should be amended.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be outraged at our suggestion that this would have a discouraging effect on investment in the building societies.  There is no doubt at all that if the Act, in its final form, is an Act which gives too much power to the Minister to interfere in policy and with the ordinary working of the building societies, it is certainly bound to have some discouraging effect on investment in building societies.  The way to avoid any discouragement of that kind, the way to avoid any suggestion that the building societies are going to be interfered with by the Minister, the way to stop people making that kind of statement and suggestion that we have made over here, is for the Minister <Col N="1937" /> to amend this section so that it cannot be said and that it would not be true if it was said.</P>

      <P>Senator Hanafin knows quite a number of the members of the Building Societies Association who have views on these things and they made those views known.  I think what Senator Hanafin wants to know is if the Building Societies Association agree with the amendments, the section as put in here.  Of course, they did not.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section.  The Minister's attitude might be quite different if he had discussed it with them.  Like the Minister, we all want to have a good Bill.  That is very important, but some of us are convinced that, in order to retain the confidence of the investors, it is essential that the society should be and be seen to be independent of ministerial control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what the objection is.  All regulations must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If there is anything wrong with them, such as has been suggested, they can be annulled.  The key words of the section are the orderly and proper regulation of building society business, and if regulations are considered capricious or arbitrary, they can and will, I am sure, be challenged on this ground.  The basic point at issue is whether the regulations are to be made by a Minister answerable to both Houses and to the public or by a functionary who is not so answerable. It is the first time I have come across politicians who are anxious to ensure that they will not be able to question certain things that have been done.  This is exactly what you are saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the registrar has the authority to make the regulations nobody here or in the other House will have any right to challenge them.  If the Minister makes them both Houses have that right to challenge them. Therefore, I think there has been some kind of a double think on this and I would suggest that perhaps it might be considered again by the people who want it amended.</P>

      <P>This is no reflection on the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Local Government or the officials of both Departments.  But what we are concerned about is what motivates people to invest.  Why does an institution such as a building society grow over 100 years in its various forms and structures, particularly in the United Kingdom and now here? What does it have that attracts money? This applies to all banking, but it applies in particular to building societies that have been able to attract small funds and small shareholders and attract a flow of funds that other financial institutions have not been able to attract.  That system has grown over the years into a very successful integral part of the whole money-raising and money lending sphere in our society and in Britain, rather peculiar to the two islands, and performs a very positive function in regard to private house building.  That depends on a certain relationship, a certain image, depends on a certain facit that people have in building societies.  Now for the first time, we are writing into law a situation where the Ministers and their administrations can, under sections 76 and 77, direct the societies in regard to the management of their funds, both in regard to the raising of them and their distribution.</P>
      <P>I am not disputing the <i>bona fides</i> of the representative Ministers or their respective administrations.  The only question I am asking is, will this new structure deter or facilitate the flow of funds to building societies?  There is a very real danger that it will do serious damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important point and what the Minister has been operating over the past two years is an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement with the building societies.  That is a different matter.  That is not a matter that motivates or concerns the investors.  As far as investors are concerned the <Col N="1940" /> building societies are in charge of their affairs.  The boards whom the shareholders appoint are in charge of the affairs of building societies; they may make <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements with whoever is Minister for Local Government at the time; that is part of an internal arrangement.  That is not written into law.  What is suggested to be done here by the Minister is to write into law that he and the Minister for Finance can, in effect, direct the policy arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We must put them before the Houses of the Oireachtas and they must be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  If the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government in a Government commanding majority support in the Oireachtas decide on putting certain regulations through with regard to governing and directing building societies, those regulations will stick once the Government have a majority.  That is our system.  It is only window-dressing to talk otherwise.  This Government, if they want to, so long as they wish to stay there, can push through whatever regulations they want.  Another Government can do the same thing.  The reality of the matter is that we are writing into legislation a new situation concerning societies that built up an enormous reservoir of goodwill in attracting funds over the years and have shown a capacity to distribute those funds, particularly in the private house building area, that no other agency has been able to emulate.  They have managed to corner a certain line of attracting funds, in particular from small investors, and they have been able to translate that investment into investment on their part in the private house building industry.  They have done that very successfully.</P>
      <P>The very serious question I am making is whether that relationship that exists between building societies and their organisation and their investors is going to be seriously upset by the intrusion for the first time in legislative form of the Ministers for Finance and Local Government in regard to the policy directions of those societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am all for the various policing and <Col N="1941" /> monitoring requirements written into the Bill.  I am aware of the abuses that exist in regard to building societies.  I support the Minister in 90 per cent of this Bill and I said this on Second Stage.  I support him fully in regard to the policing and monitoring powers. But what I would like to see is those powers handed over to a reputable, independent institution such as a registrar of friendly societies, strengthened, provided with a staff, given independence and operating with the consent of the Minister for Finance in dealing with the building societies.  It has worked this way in Britain for the past 14 years.  It has worked very well in a country that has more experience of the sophisticated operation of building societies than any other country in the world.</P>

      <P>This is the burden of our amendments.  The Minister in his amendment puts the Minister for Finance in the central position, after consultation with the registrar.  The British Act puts it in reverse&mdash;the registrar, with the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has the authority.  What the Minister here is saying is that if the Minister for Local Government considers it expedient, &ldquo;he may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Registrar...&rdquo;  That does not put the registrar in the central policing and monitoring position. Consultation means nothing.  It is a form of window-dressing, not very successful.  Consultation would want to be very successful on many fronts.</P>

      <P>For the sake of Ireland <Col N="1942" /> I hope it does.  At any rate we will leave that point, it is a rather contentious area.  The Minister's amendment puts the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance in the central position.  The only requirement is &ldquo;after consultation with the registrar&rdquo;.  The British Statute, I will have it on Report Stage, specifically puts the registrar in the central position; with the consent of the Treasury, he may make appropriate regulations.</P>
      <P>What Fianna Fáil suggest in the two amendments put down by Senator Yeats&mdash;I will put down a more specific amendment on Report Stage because I am withdrawing the reference to the Central Bank which the Minister has incorporated in his amendment&mdash;is to delete the subsection relating to the Minister for Local Government and Finance, deleting their relationship to making regulations in regard to building societies and instead writing in the &ldquo;Registrar, subject to the consent of the Central Bank&rdquo;.  I would agree with &ldquo;the Registrar subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; which is the equivalent of the British section which says: &ldquo;the Registrar subject to the consent of the Treasury may make regulations to...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An amendment will be put down on Report Stage that one can remove the names of the Minister for Local Government and Finance from section 77 and instead insert a simple, regulatory section writing in the Registrar of Friendly Societies and empowering him to make the necessary regulations with the consent of the Minister for Finance. It is no more and no less.  That amendment, allied to what we propose in amendment No. 104 guaranteeing the status and independence of the registrar, is the right way to solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that there is plenty of expertise in the civil service to deal with this but this expertise must be attached to an independent body in which the investing public in the building societies, can have confidence. If it means transferring staff from the Minister's Department or from the Department of Finance, then they <Col N="1943" /> should be transferred to a new adminitrative apparatus under the Registrar of Friendly Societies, an independent registrar with the proper staff and officials and with a central clearing house of information in regard to building societies, as it operates in Great Britain. That would take the whole operation, as Senator Eoin Ryan pointed out, away from the political arena.</P>
    <P>It will not be possible to attract funds into building societies if there is any whiff of day-to-day political interference. In law there is the old saying that not alone must justice be done but it must be seen to be done.  If we do not have an independent registrar with his own staff, away from the day-to-day political interference of the Ministers for Finance or Local Government and their civil servants who must go along with whatever the Minister of the day may propose, it will be a deterrent to investors.</P>

      <P>The Minister has <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements over the past few years with building societies.  That is not a matter of statute which enables the two Ministers concerned and their officials to impose political policy decisions on to the board of building societies by law.  That is what this section means.  I know the regulations will be tabled before each House of the Oireachtas, backed by a majority Government making policy decisions. The end product of that is complete totalitarian control of the building societies.  There is a whole area where lack of confidence and a complete stoppage of funds is a real prospect in that type of environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the essence of the point we are making.  The essence of the point we are making is that writing in the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance into this policy-supervising position by way of regulation under this and the previous section will give the impression to investors that this is a State-controlled operation, subject to the whims, dictates and the policy changes of political Ministers of the day, however appointed.</P>
      <P>That is not good for investment. Banks, insurance companies and anybody in the quasi-banking area, as building societies are, will tell you that money is a highly sensitive matter, that money goes for investment into certain institutions for particular reasons, perhaps of confidentiality and trust, which are not part of a Government apparatus.  If any unit of a Department of State set out to try and attract funds they would not be able to get them.  That is a fact of life.  The Minister could not set up a building society in a corner of the Custom House in the Department of Local Government and expect it to attract the sort of funds attracted by a building society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting speculation.  Perhaps we are seeing some of the real reasons behind this. If the Minister has the arrogance to think that he can set up units of Departments of State which will attract the same sort of funds as building societies attract he is making a very big mistake.  I do not think the Minister is serious about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator is serious.  I believe Senator <Col N="1945" /> Lenihan has not read the section.  I do not know why he is saying these things.  He does not seem to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not bluster&mdash;it is an old tactic of his. What is suggested here is that the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance are being brought into this section and the previous section to ensure that the Registrar of Friendly Societies will not have any function in regard to policies.  He will only be consulted; the boards of the building societies will be told what to do in regard to raising their funds, distributing them, and the policy decisions both in regard to fund-raising, distribution and investment generally will be taken not by the boards of the building societies&mdash;properly elected under the Bill&mdash;but by the respective Ministers. That is what the Bill, and the two sections in particular, is about.</P>
      <P>That is not the way to attract funds. The Minister and building societies in general will get into serious trouble if this attitude persists.  If the Bill becomes law, without the Minister making a very constructive effort to meet some of the amendments put down, we will retreat into a State-controlled situation where serious harm could be done to increasing the flow of funds to the building societies.  The Minister could go along with the suggestion embodied in our amendment and make provision for an independent registrar with his own staff, away from the political administration, in a position to supervise in a monitoring and policing sense the activities of building societies and leave the policy decision to people who know what it is about in regard to raising moneys and investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am touched by the Senator's anxiety to get things away from politics now.  The suggestions which he has made might have been all right some years ago but, in fact, I do not think that Senator Lenihan really understands what the section is about.</P>

      <P>The Senator is talking about not putting any tight rein on <Col N="1946" /> the building societies and allowing them a lot more freedom to do their own thing and he believes in that.  Yet, there is an amendment down, amendment No. 100, which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A society may make loans only on residential property.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He is proposing that this be written into the Bill.  It is not a regulation. They are to be told that they must do this.  The only reason they must do it is because Senator Lenihan thinks it is right but if it is put forward by the Government it does not appear to be the right thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>By regulation.  Senator Lenihan wants to write it into the Bill so that they must be told to do this. The section means that under certain stated circumstances the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance may consult with the registrar who will be an independent man.  Senator Lenihan need have no doubt about that.  He will be an independent person, with an independent office.</P>

      <P>We have not set up any body yet but we will give them proper staff.  The Senator may be assured of that.  The decision will be on the matters which are referred to then. Regulations will be made which will be <i>ad hoc</i>.  They will not be permanent. They will not be written into the legislation and they must go before the Houses of the Oireachtas. There must be something which we can stand over publicly.  Nothing will be done behind backs.  They must be brought out in the open and we will stand over them publicly.  I cannot see what the objections are because by doing it that way if any Member of the Oireachtas is dissatisfied he can ask the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Finance to explain why certain things are done. Members are entitled to look for information, whereas if the registrar does it he need not give such information. <Col N="1947" /> As a matter of fact, it will not be necessary for him to give this information.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin referred to the discussions which I, my Department and the Department of Finance had with the building society institutions.  They expressed views on various aspects of the Bill, and where it was possible to incorporate them this has been done. It was made clear that as far as we were concerned we did not consider we could alter this except in the way in which my amendment suggests it should be altered, and no other way.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if the people on the opposite benches feel that they must oppose what I am suggesting but as far as I am concerned I am not prepared to amend this any further.  I feel that as it is it is the correct way that it should be done.  It is giving the control to the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is giving the right to Members to query decisions made under this section and I feel that is the way it should be.  I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment as suggested.</P>

      <P>I accept a good deal of what the Minister is saying in the sense that I accept that the regulations can, of course, only be made by a Minister.  I accept that it is right that the regulations that are made should be brought before both Houses so that they can be looked at.  The point we have been making is really around the word &ldquo;initiative&rdquo;, that the regulations which should be made should be made on the initiative of the registrar.  By all means the Minister can then disagree with them if he likes and eventually if he approves of them he can make them.  What we want to avoid is the Minister being able to ride roughshod over the registrar and everybody else so as to implement a particular enthusiasm that he has about the housing programme.  This can be done at the moment.  Perhaps there might be some way of getting around it by giving the initiative to the registrar to make the regulations. Then I think we will have a balance between Government policy and what the building societies think is the best <Col N="1948" /> thing for them.  I agree it is a difficult thing to draft but we will make an effort to draft it for the next Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A society may make loans only on residential property.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned yesterday that when he came into office loans were made on property other than residential property and he was very proud of that fact.  There is a lot to be said for that point of view.  This amendment was put down with a view to hearing the pros and cons of whether this should be written into the Bill.  By and large, that should be the policy.  On the other hand, there are arguments that there should be some latitude in this regard.  The amendment has been put down to allow the House to hear the arguments for and against writing this into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that when the amount of money available from the building societies for home loans did not meet the demand it was felt essential that all available money should be used for home loans only but if this amendment is accepted a situation would arise where they could not invest such surplus funds. As of now there appears to be surplus funds in the building societies. That being so, I think the amendment should not be pursued.  I can appreciate the situation but as far as we are concerned, and I am quite sure as far as the Opposition are concerned, the building societies' money is for the purpose of assisting people to build or buy houses.  That is as it should be.  If there is a surplus they should be entitled to use that surplus in such a way that it will raise further moneys for them rather than <Col N="1949" /> lose money, which could be the result if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>As drafted, the Bill provides for directors' liability for losses in one instance only, namely, losses which occurred on second mortgages.  The matter has now been reconsidered.  It is thought appropriate to provide in the general penalty section, section 92, for directors' liability for losses on any loans issued in contravention of the Act.  This is dealt with in amendment No. 107.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to make separate provision for the discharge of a mortgage of registered lands.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 104:</P>
      <P>Before section 85, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Registrar shall be appointed by the Government and shall not be removed from office except on a motion passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(2) The Registrar shall be provided with staff to enable him to carry out the duties and responsibilities conferred upon him by this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a matter to which I have adverted already in discussion of other amendments and sections.  The Minister can see what we have in mind.  It is really to set up a registrar with authority who will have proper staff, expertise and so on, who will be appointed by the Government, and we suggest that he shall not be removed except on a motion passed by a two-thirds majority, although that may be too much.  In subsection (2) of the amendment it is provided that he should be provided with the proper staff to carry out the duties and responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1951" /> The whole thinking behind that is to have a registrar who will be in a central effective position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the building societies and who will carry an office that will keep him reasonably independent of political or departmental pressures.  Charged with this responsibility, he should be enabled to function effectively with building societies.  As the Minister rightly said earlier, we are not just talking in this Bill on behalf of building societies. The registrar should also exercise and discharge his functions in an independent capacity in the interests of the public at large and ensure that the legislation we are passing here is properly administered, that proper sanctions are imposed on building societies, that the proper procedures are adopted, and that the organisation of building societies is properly controlled and monitored by an independent office not subject to the day in, day out, administrative political pressures that would arise in respect of a registrar and his office that would be merely functioning as a sub-office of a Government Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be that the registrar of building societies would be appointed by the Government and only removable from office by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The amendment, therefore, envisages the registrar of building societies being an official on a par with the Judiciary or the Comptroller and Auditor General. If all the powers the Senator's amendment proposes were accepted the powers and status of the registrar might require that the method of his appointment and dismissal be reconsidered but since they are not this is a different situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear whether the amendment envisages that he would be a person other than the registrar of friendly societies although subsection (1) of the amendment would not appear to prevent the Government, if the amendment were adopted, from appointing the registrar of friendly societies to be the <Col N="1952" /> registrar for the purpose of the Act.</P>
    <P>The proposal in section 85, that the registrar of friendly societies be the registrar of building societies, was decided on by the Government. In this connection, the Department of Industry and Commerce are at present preparing amending legislation regarding the registrar of friendly societies.  It is hoped to introduce a Bill in the near future. That Department are also updating legislation on industrial and provident societies.  This is the point Senator Lenihan was making when he was talking about a proper office with proper staffing.  The necessary provisions are being made to have this done.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are fully alive to the need for a more active role for the registrar and for the appointment of a full-time officer adequately qualified for the job with adequate back-up facilities.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the amendment were withdrawn because I do not think the person concerned would be on a par with the Judiciary. I feel that if he is a registrar of friendly societies, as the Government have decided, he would be able to carry on his job properly and independently.  He will have adequate back-up facilities without which it would be impossible to carry on the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as I have the assurance from the Minister that the registrar's position, status and office is being updated in new legislation being proposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I will go along with that.  As I said on earlier sections, I would like to see him having far more powers than the Minister is willing to give him under this legislation. If the office is updated, properly staffed and backed-up, that is half the battle.  I will withdraw the amendment: I put it down to highlight the matter.  I think it is important that we have a meaningful and active registrar with a meaningful and active office if his functions under this legislation are going to mean anything.  I take it the Minister goes along with <Col N="1953" /> that and the Minister for Industry and Commerce as well.</P>

      <P>An unregistered company may be wound up under Part X of the Companies Act, 1963.  A building society may be regarded as an unregistered company for the purposes of the Companies Act.  It is proposed in subsection (1) to apply Part VII of the Companies Act, 1963, to the winding-up of a building society.  It is not necessary to have powers under Part X for this purpose. The powers in Part X are more limited than those in Part VI.  The reference in the amendment to &ldquo;anything in that or any other Act&rdquo; is to eliminate any doubt in relation to section 350 of the Companies Act, 1963.  That section provided for winding up as a company under the Companies Consolidation Act, 1908, of any enactment repealed by that Act.  A building society could be wound up as a company by the Companies Winding Up Act, 1890, an Act repealed by the 1908 Act.</P>

The intention is that it would be open to the Minister to set up such a committee, that it would consist of representatives of the Departments of Local Government, Finance, the Registrar of Building Societies, the Central Bank and the Building Societies Association and such other bodies that he might from time to time consider necessary and appropriate.  The purpose of the committee would be to consider matters of importance in the building society movement in all its aspects and to make such recommendations <Col N="1956" /> as they considered appropriate.</P>

      <P>(c)  no fee, emolument or other remuneration is paid to any officer of the society (other than an auditor) from the funds of the society,</P>
      <P>(d)  the society had been incorporated on or before the 5th day of December, 1965, and had begun to carry on business on or before that date,</P>
      <P>(e)  the society has not, since the 5th day of December, 1965, advertised for or otherwise solicited deposits or subscriptions for shares other than from persons in trade, occupation or employment in the business undertaking referred to in paragraph (a), and.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to provide exemption from sections 20, 37 and 38 for one society, the Guinness Permanent Building Society, which has a system of operation unique in the building society movement in this country.  It has been in operation since 1901.  Its membership is confined to employees of the Guinness Company and its pensioners.  Its committee of management is a voluntary one, representative of all grades in the employment of the company and receives no fees.</P>
      <P>Apart from occasionally placing notices on notice boards within the brewery premises, it does not solicit funds from members of the public. Loans are issued to members for the purchase of their own houses and there is a long waiting list.  The mortgage interest rate is lower than that charged by the principal societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the fact that a number of the older mortgages are on a fixed interest basis the margins on which the society operates are very narrow. The Guinness company have subsidised its operations over the years. The society has no reserves and all its cash is invested with the Guinness company pending transfer into mortgages. <Col N="1959" /> Its total assets are now about £1 million.  The requirements of section 20&mdash;deposit with the Central Bank&mdash;would cause difficulties for the society and result in a slowing up in the issue of mortgages. Section 37, the ratios, would also cause a problem because of its lack of reserves and equally, section 38 (3) could not be met.</P>
    <P>The society serves a useful purpose and it would be desirbale that it be allowed to continue to operate.  One of the main objects of the Bill is to protect the public at large investing with a society by providing a number of safeguards as to minimum start up capital, disclosure of management personnel, financial standing, and so on. The same detailed requirements need not apply in the case of an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; society where the standing and identity of members and management are known.  Because of this <Col N="1960" /> unique situation and because of the continuing relationship existing with the Guinness company the members of the society have benefited substantially in comparison with members of other societies.  The exemption has been drafted tightly in order to ensure that other societies cannot claim exemption.</P>
