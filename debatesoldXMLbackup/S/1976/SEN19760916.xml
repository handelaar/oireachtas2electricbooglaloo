      <P>The relevant section of amendment No. 2 is the one involving the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;or is in possession of information&rdquo;. The arguments put forward for its deletion are impressive enough to really carry the point, that it is the kind of phrase that could catch within its ambit the innocent onlooker.  Taken in conjunction with the other provisions of the Bill, such an innocent bystander could be detained for seven days.  The point I want to stress with regard to this&mdash;it is one that was raised very strenuously by the Leader of the House yesterday, who kept insisting that this should only be seen in isolation as a phrase in itself&mdash; is that that phrase in itself would be quite harmless.  There would be no point, and I imagine there would be no intention on the part of anybody on this side of the House, either of the Fianna Fáil group or the Independent <Col N="480" /> Senators, in objecting to it at all if it did not come in tandem with so many other draconian measures within the Bill.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Leader of the House yesterday gave a rather emotive speech imputing to those of us, and particularly to myself, towards the end of the speech&mdash;I do not think he really meant to do it&mdash;that objection to this and other aspects of the Bill has sprung from some kind of sympathy with men of violence.  My position is unique.  I voted for the emergency powers&mdash;I did that in goodwill&mdash;and I voted on this Bill.  In other words, I voted for the state of emergency and I voted with the Government on this Bill up to Second Stage, and it was only at that Stage that I could find out whether these reasonable amendments were being accepted or not&mdash;the amendment involving, for instance, whether or not the man or woman held would be allowed legal advice, whether the Judges' Rules would apply, whether the relatives of such a person would be informed, whether the person would be held <i>in communicado</i> or not and whether the Bill would have to come before the two Houses of Parliament at the end of 12 months.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote something I said earlier, because of the reproaches I received yesterday from the Leader of the House in these affairs.  Having spelled these out in my speech on the motion for a declaration of national emergency, I went on to say on 1st September, 1976, that these are precise and important aspects of it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this clear.  If these conditions were fulfilled, I think that I would tend to vote for it.  I would vote for it for the following reasons: that there is a state of emergency, that there is a new and particularly gruesome and calculated attack against the people, as distinct from the institutions of Ireland, and against the institutions too.  I do think that the moment has come for the final thrust against the men of violence and that a measure which would only last for 12 months, with the built-in restraints and provisions that I have mentioned, <Col N="481" /> would not be too much of an affront to our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind on the matter at this stage and I look forward to hearing the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>In other words, I was waiting to be persuaded.  It seemed to me that the Government were more or less on the right tack but that a number of modifications of the Bill were necessary.</P>
    <P>I followed the Government, in good faith, up to this point but as these have been systematically rejected in the Dáil, as a guillotine has been brought down on the debate in the Dáil and as the Minister stands firm against all of these, especially this question of the possession of information, I see no alternative but to vote against the Bill for these reasons.  I find myself otherwise in favour of the spirit of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>): We had a fairly full debate on this yesterday evening. I pointed out then, and I want to point out again for Senator Martin's benefit, that the Bill changes nothing except the right to detain a person for seven days instead of two days. All the other rights of the individual in custody are preserved, remain intact and have not been interfered with in any way good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued yesterday with Senator Robinson, among others, on this amendment.  I believe I convinced Senator Robinson that my argument was logical, that one has to take this part of the entire section together.  It says that a member of the Garda if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person has committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act, or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information relating to the commission or intended commission of an offence, may stop, search and so on.  Here we have the person who has committed is committing or is about to commi <Col N="482" /> or is in possession of a document or thing or of information in relation to the commission or the intended commission of an offence.  In any ordinary language that is one train of events&mdash; the person who is committing, who has committed, who is about to commit, who is carrying a bomb or other thing in relation to it, or who is in possession of information.  There is no intention there to get after any innocent person. In the words of Senator E. Ryan &mdash;if my argument is wrong and if his argument is accepted&mdash;in relation to the possibility of detaining an innocent person, that it may never happen.  He went on further to say that it probably would never happen. I go further still and say that under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, it has not happened in the last 37 years.  That should be sufficient for any reasonable person.</P>
    <P>I do not want to raise the temperature in this House, but I cannot help remarking that Senator Martin protested too loudly and too often that he supports this Bill in principle, that he supported the resolution to establish the emergency, that he voted for the Second Stage of this Bill, but now he is proceeding, as far as I can see, and has so declared his intention to vote against every section of this Bill and to support every amendment to fillet it.  The Senator said he assumed the Minister would accept this, that and the other.  I suppose it is not appropriate to refer to the other House, but the Senator voted recently for the Second Stage of this Bill after he knew the attitude of the Minister for Justice to the Bill.  I think the Senator protests too much and I suspect where his heart really is in regard to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">

      <P>Would the Minister care to specify where my heart is supposed to be?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): I develop my thoughts in relation to this as I see the Senator's reaction to the debate.  The people have to be either for or against this legislation. There is no use trying to ride two horses; there is no use trying to blow hot and cold; there is no use in trying <Col N="483" /> to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.  That is all I want to say about that.</P>
      <P>I put it to Members of this House that the provision in this Bill is no more than a re-enactment of the provisions of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which has given no trouble over the last 37 years.  Senator E. Ryan said it may not give trouble and it probably will not give trouble.  I say the best possible test is that it has not given trouble in 37 years and I ask the House to reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3), page 3, line 8, after &ldquo;station&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;; and in lines 8 and 9 to delete &ldquo;, or other convenient place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact in the evolution of law that one of the most significant advances that has been made was that the law was made certain.  That prompted me to put down this amendment.  I want to be certain about this section.  I believe it is very much in the interests of democracy that the law is made certain.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the remarks made by the Minister I want to say that I am not attempting to fillet the Bill.  It is reasonable at all times in a democracy to entertain the expressions of opposition and not jump to conclusions and feel that a person is trying to ride two horses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section would suit the situation well enough if the words I am asking to be deleted are taken from it. Because there has always been a fear about the possibility of people being kept <i>incommunicado</i> I believe if one is going to be detained for 48 hours it should be possible to find a Garda station or a prison to hold that person or persons.  I do not believe there is any safer place.  I have been at a loss to ascertain what is meant by a substitution for a Garda station or a prison.  That type of inquiry must be answered.  We are not challenging the fact that a person is to be arrested, <Col N="484" /> held in custody, brought to prison to be held in custody or brought to a Garda station, but I would like to have the purpose of the phrase &ldquo;other convenient place&rdquo; explained.  It is not as if we have a big country.  Even taking into consideration the length of our Border, I believe we should be able to find a Garda station to hold a prisoner if he is going to be detained for 48 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The object of Senator Mullen's amendment is to delete from the section the phrase &ldquo;or other convenient place&rdquo;. He makes the case that it should be possible to find a Garda station suitable for the detention of a person if he is to be detained for 48 hours or for seven days.  That will normally, even invariably, be the position.</P>
      <P>The Senator may know that the practice of detaining people even for short periods in small Garda stations no longer prevails&mdash;I am speaking only from local knowledge when I say that.  There are few Garda stations in counties suitably equipped for the detention of prisoners overnight or longer periods.  It is not visualised that it will be necessary very often to detain people in places other than in Garda barracks or in a prison, but there may be an unique situation.  It has happened since these troubles began that Garda barracks where prisoners were detained have been attacked by people wishing either to embarrass the Garda or to release the prisoners.  On those occasions, it has been necessary to get the prisoners out quickly.  There is nothing more sinister in the provision than to deal with such a situation.  If those words were deleted it would be more difficult to deal with prisoners in these special or peculiar situations.  That is all that is in the inclusion of the word; there is nothing more sinister in it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment in the name of Senator Mullen and I am not convinced by the explanation given by the Minister.  I do not doubt that the situation which the Minister envisages might arise but I do not think is causes the sort of difficulties about which <Col N="485" /> he is talking.  If there were difficulties about detaining people in a Garda station, they can be moved to another place of lawful custody&mdash;another Garda station or a prison.  The words &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; are not legal words at all; they have no legal connotation. We are authorising the Garda to hold somebody anywhere for a period of up to seven days. I do not think the need, which has been identified for this legislation, which is the need to keep a person out of circulation, goes far enough to allow us to authorise the person to be kept out of circulation anywhere.</P>
      <P>When speaking on the motion declaring a state of emergency, and on the Second Reading of this Bill I emphasised the necessity to distinguish between the investigatory role of the Garda and the custodian role of the prison authorities.  I acknowledge that the Garda in discharging their investigatory functions have a minimal custodial role at the moment; that should be minimal.  If a person is to be kept out of circulation&mdash;which is what is wanted here&mdash; I would prefer he would be kept out of circulation in prison with the safeguards of prison regulations and so on.  It is particularly important since we do not have independent investigation machinery.  We are authorising a person to be kept out of circulation for up to seven days in a convenient place, anywhere.  That is not desirable. It is the function of this House to ensure minimum safeguards and one of the minimum safeguards is to ensure that when a person is being kept for a further period out of circulation he should be kept in a known and identified place with the appropriate safeguards.  Perhaps in certain circumstances this must be in a Garda station rather than a prison but it should not be as vague, general and as uncontrollable as a convenient place, for up to seven days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price we pay for allowing a term like &ldquo;a convenient place&rdquo; to be part of the legislation is the price of the apprehensions people will have about where the Garda may be keeping somebody for up to seven days. It is the battle for the minds of the <Col N="486" /> people and for the loyalty and trust of citizens.  If they believe that a person can be held anywhere&mdash;&ldquo;a convenient place&rdquo;&mdash;for up to seven days, and that the person need not be required to be in a Garda station or a prison, this is undermining the respect, allegiance, loyalty and trust of citizens for the Garda.  It is making the role of the Garda more difficult. It is making their relationship with the community more difficult.  It is too high a price to pay.  It would be better not to have the words &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the extremely urgent and emergency situation which the Minister outlined there is no legal problem. If a Garda station were under some sort of attack and people in that Garda station had to be shifted elsewhere there is no technicality by which they would have to go free. In those circumstances, they could be taken to another Garda station or another prison and if there was some delay in that it does not mean that they would have to be freed from the custody of the Garda.  The Garda would be exercising their powers in a reasonable way and they would be able to do that.  The Minister has not justified the need for this phrase and it is one which would quite seriously undermine one of the very important safeguards both of the citizen and of the preservation of law and order in this country which is the relationship between the Garda and the community. That is very important.  There are two levels at which this might happen.  It must be recognised that it is always possible that there would be real abuse of the power to keep somebody out of circulation in a convenient place for up to seven days and we must bear that in mind.  I am not casting any particular aspersions on the Garda.  There is also an apprehension about it.  There can be rumour about it.  The &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; can be a propaganda point with which to undermine the role of the Garda in the job they have to do and the allegiance of citizens to the Garda.  On balance, I feel that we would have to pay too high a price for having a non-legal phrase like &ldquo;a convenient place&rdquo; which can be anywhere. <Col N="487" /> I would support the amendment put forward by Senator Mullen. It would be a better section without those words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is one of the points which I raised in an earlier speech where I suggested that this convenient place might seem, to the untutored eye and might even read for it an unknown place.  I stress that point in view of the words which the Minister has recently addressed towards me, and which I found quite extraordinary. The Minister accused me of riding two horses, of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds and he made a dark and rather sinister hint as to where, perhaps, my heart was. I do not know what the Minister means by that.  I requested an explanation which was refused.  The Minister said he would develop that remark in the light of what I had to say about some of these amendments.  It is the first time that a note of personal abuse has entered into this debate.  I certainly did not ascribe any sinister motives to anybody.  I accused the Government of intransigence and that is all.  I certainly did not cast any aspersion on the Minister.  These are clear aspersions on my integrity and they are based on a quite extraordinary and improper assumption. The Minister said that I was well aware of the attitude of the Minister for Justice from what the Minister said in the Dáil.  The implication is that what is said in the Dáil predetermines what is said in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There was no way in which I could have known what the attitude of the Minister or the Government would be until we came to Committee Stage of the Bill.  There was no way I could know what their attitude towards these amendments would be.  I was absolutely impeccable and punctilious with regard to parliamentary procedure in relation to this.  I went with the Government as far as I possibly could but at the very beginning I laid down the conditions that if these were yielded to I would vote for the Bill. If they were not, I said I would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But in the light of that to be <Col N="488" /> accused of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, of riding two horses at the same time and of, somehow, being equivocal because I do not take what the Minister says in the Lower House to predetermine what is decided in this House, is a slur on my integrity and is really unworthy of the Minister and unworthy of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave Senator Martin and the Minister to work out their personal problems.  So far as I am concerned I will concentrate on the amendment before the House.  Although Senator Mary Robinson does not look a bit like the fat boy in Pickwick, she does tend to make people's flesh creep as to what is intended in this legislation.  I will say a few things about the section which would be affected by this proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson cannot honestly stand over the proposition that these were non-legal words.  All words may have to be used for the first time and then be construed according to their ordinary meaning.  As everyone in these islands know, the courts are traditionally hostile to the Executive, hostile to the Oireachtas, jealous of the powers which the Oireachtas want to give the Executive and seek to interpret them anxiously and with concern for the effect on citizens.  In fact, the words complained about in the amendment have at least not been used for the first time and therefore have the legal stature of language which has been on the Statute Book for 37 years.  I should have thought, therefore, that they are capable of being construed in a manner favourable to any person arrested pursuant to the section.  There has been a tendency in the debate here and in the other House, and in the Press generally &mdash;perhaps that is not a bad thing because we must not forget the whole objective in this type of legislation and in the Offences Against the State Act is ultimately to preserve the liberties and to strengthen a force which will preserve liberties&mdash;to over-emphasise the nature of arrest and taking into custody as being a deprivation of <Col N="489" /> liberty which is clearly involved only in the limited fashion in which it is involved&mdash;a trend I understand many people are unhappy about by virtue of the existence of the proposals at all.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;custody&rdquo; implies safety, implies the obligation, and will be so construed in my view, on the custodian to take care of the person arrested.  The courts will see, not merely by virtue of the preservation of the rights of the arrested person to take action for assault or any other type of rights in excess of those taken from him by this section but to take action against anybody responsible for false imprisonment, a defective procedure or for his being put in an inconvenient place, that these rights are protected.  I mean putting him in a furnace, or on a toaster, putting him in a position where he cannot give voluntary answers which truly represent a voluntary response to the questioning which alone the authorities are entitled to make on him, would not be to put him &ldquo;in a convenient place&rdquo;.  I do not think the Legislature was blind in 1940 in contemplating the possibility that in a particular area at a particular time, because of hostilities raging in the province which is one of our Four lost Green Fields, there might not be in existence a police station or a prison convenient for the purposes of carrying out the searching required to be done.</P>
    <P>I would say that the convenience here will be convenience for the proper operation of the section, for the convenience too of the safety element in the custody of the arrested person.  I would like to emphasise my view that not merely would the Judges' Rules be applied to any evidence sought to be brought against persons accused as a result of this questioning for any offences under the Offences Against the State Act, but I think the principles which I read on to the record of the House the last day&mdash;it might be no harm to read them again because I am genuinely interested to know whether other Senators take the view I do&mdash; are at least indicative of the principles the courts will apply in this.  I know they are not in any way binding.  They <Col N="490" /> are not even binding on the judges of the King's Bench who enunciated them.  Remember, these are adminitrative directions to police officers who are conducting the business of enforcing justice as to the way they have to conduct it if they are to bring successful prosecutions, if the evidence is not going to be thrown out by the judges as worthless.</P>
    <P>The object of these rules and the exercise of discretions are set out.  I think this affects another amendment. These rules do not affect the principles (a) that citizens have a duty to help a police officer to discover and apprehend offenders; (b) that police officers, otherwise than by arrest, cannot compel any person against his will to come to or remain in a police station; (c) that every person in any stage of an investigation should be able to create a case and to consult privately with a solicitor.  That is the statement of the view of judges in a free country.  There may be other elements not to the liking of everyone but it is at least a free country. Nobody will say that it is not a free country in that liberal sense and certainly in this matter it is freer than most other continental countries in its respect for accused persons.  God knows what would happen to them in France, for example.</P>
    <P>Every person at any stage of an investigation should be able to communicate himself privately with a solicitor.  These judges are no fools. They are engaged in the business of administering justice which is a matter of having regard not merely for the person accused but all those persons who may be affected by the offences he is suspected of having committed or being about to commit. They go on: &ldquo;This is so even if he is in custody provided that in such a case no unreasonable delay or hindrance is caused to the process of investigation or the administration of justice by doing so&rdquo;.  That is what the King's judges told the police officers was their duty at that time and how they would regard the evidence adduced in a situation where that principle was disregarded.</P>
    <P>The rules also state (d) but when a police officer who was making inquiries <Col N="491" /> of any person about an offence has enough evidence to prefer a charge against that person to the offence, he should without delay cause that person to be charged or informed that he may be prosecuted for the offence; (e) that it is a fundamental condition of the admissibility in evidence against any person, equally of any oral answer given by that person to a question put by a police officer, and of any statement made by that person, that it shall have been voluntary in the sense that it has not been obtained from him by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or held out by a person in authority or by oppression.  The type of thing which in another case is given as an example of evidence disregarded on the general question of whether or not promises had to relate to whether he would get off on this particular offence.  If he discloses, for example, that his wife is seriously ill and if he tells the truth he can get out to see her, or that she will not be accused, or all the family involved in it will be free&mdash;that is such a promise which, if established as having been made by the person in authority to the accused, would mean the evidence could not be admitted.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan, Senator Ryan and Senator Robinson, in the order in which I see them looking in that direction, may tell me I am wrong in this, but I do not think I am wrong in saying that it is not even a discretion in the case of a judge.  I think the position is that he does not even have a discretion to admit evidence if it can be shown it was not voluntarily given. That is the only point at which these rules have been held in our courts to be obligatory in that sense.  In all the other aspects of our rules it is a matter for the discretion of the judge as to whether or not he admits the evidence.</P>
    <P>In this situation extending this period from 48 hours' detention to 48 hours plus five days, it would, I think, be unreasonable and unwise of the Oireachtas to take away the phrase &ldquo;or other convenient place&rdquo;.  We have confidence that it has not been abused in the past.  We know that circumstances might arise where it would <Col N="492" /> have to be used in the future.  There might be a long journey to make and the questioning might have to start in the van in which the accused person was being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the justification may be in regard to the other powers in this section for extending the powers from two days to seven days, it seems to be ludicrous to extend the time that a person can be kept in a convenient place from two days to seven days.  It is, of course, understandable that, in certain rather difficult situations, a guard might not be able to bring the arrested person to a Garda station or a prison for, perhaps, 24 hours.  It is barely conceivable that he would not be able to get there within 48 hours.  But it is quite absurd to suggest that he should be allowed not to bring him to either a Garda station or a prison for seven days.  That is what is now provided in this Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wanted to adopt the wording of the 1939 Act, did not want to change the power given in that Act, certainly it should have been made clear that he can keep a person at a convenient place for up to 48 hours but no longer than that.  Nobody could really argue that there is any justification, or any situation in which 48 hours would not be sufficient to allow a &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; to be used.  As Senator Robinson said, the phrase is much too vague and imprecise.  What does &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; mean and, more important, &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; to whom, &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; for what?  The trouble about it is that a person can be kept somewhere, other than a prison or a Garda station, for up to seven days and if there is any question about it all the authorities have to do is prove that it was convenient to somebody, or convenient in some way.  Provided it can be shown that it was convenient in some way then the period of detention in a place other than a prison or a Garda station cannot be questioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked on a number of occasions on this Bill to be realistic, not be analysing words and phrases too carefully, being too analytic about it, to be realistic and assume that it will be operated in a reasonable and <Col N="493" /> intelligent way.  Of course, if the Minister wants us to be realistic he should adopt this amendment.  Everybody knows that if a guard has difficulty in getting an arrested person to a Garda station or a prison, if there is a delay in doing so but if he does his best to get him there within a reasonable time nobody is going to question that; no court, nobody is going to question the fact that there were physical difficulties in getting the arrested person to a Garda station or prison for a matter of hours, even a matter of a day if a reasonable case is made.</P>
    <P>There are numerous Acts, dealing with criminal law, with arrest and custody.  I think it is correct to say that in none of them, except in the 1939 Act, is there a provision that a &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; can be used.  In all of them it is assumed that the garda will bring the person to, and place him in custody in, a Garda station or prison as soon as possible. Provided he does it as soon as possible then there can be no question of his <i>bona fides</i> and it cannot be questioned in law.  Therefore, why introduce this rather vague business about a &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo;?  The more one analyses it the more one realises it can be abused.  There are certainly people who are going to read a sinister meaning into it.  Even though there may be no such sinister intention, nevertheless it can be read into it and in fact it can be used in a way which would be an abuse of the ordinary process of law.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case for accepting this amendment.  The only possible justification for its insertion and I am sure the only reason it was put in was that it happened to be in the 1939 Act and was just stuck into this.  After all, if we are only going to review emergency powers every 30 years or so&mdash;and there is a strong case for doing it much more frequently&mdash;then let us make some improvement in them when we have the opportunity to do so and not accept a phrase like this merely because it was in an Act passed 30 years ago.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator <Col N="494" /> Robinson's interpretation that a &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; is any other place decided by the Garda, whether it be on land or offshore in the jurisdiction. Senator Eoin Ryan's definition of &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; amuses me because we must assume that such a place is not &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; for anybody in custody, whatever about their relatives or friends or the gardaí holding them. Therefore, &ldquo;convenient&rdquo; is not very important to the person in custody.</P>
      <P>If it is found necessary to hold people in custody in any other place than a Garda station or prison perhaps we could have ministerial assurance that they would have the same rights of communication with their legal advisers or their relatives.  For instance, if somebody was held originally in a Garda station but because it was under attack he was, for his safe custody, moved to another place, his relatives, friends or legal advisers should be so advised of his removal to another safe place.  It is only when the words &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; take on an air of mystery, or that their whereabouts would be unknown to anybody else, that the Opposition have this dread when they speak on such a matter.  If it is generally known that we are worried about it and if an assurance is given by the Minister that such a &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; is known to others, and not just a place of mystery, then I would be satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): As has been conceded by Senators, this provision has been taken from the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and has been the law of the land since then.  It has not given any trouble. When the Opposition were in power, they did not see fit, in the sixties or early seventies, to amend the 1939 Act; they were satisfied with it.  The 1939 Offences Against the State Act was enacted to deal with an unusual state of affairs where regard for Garda stations, prisons and the institutions of State in general, had lessened. Respect for these institutions was not as high as it should be.  This Bill has been introduced, regrettably, to deal with an unusual situation where certain people, organised and unorganised, do not accept the authority of the Oireachtas and the Government <Col N="495" /> and have decided that they are entitled to speak and act on behalf of the people.</P>
      <P>I am not being unreasonable when I say that the position is much worse now than it was when the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, was introduced. These people, organised and unorganised, are more reckless, have more sophisticated means and weapons at their disposal and are prepared to use them to put into operation what they consider to be their rights.  We have had people released from prison by helicopter.  We have had prisons attacked by bombs from within and without.  We have had Garda stations attacked and one was kept under sustained attack for 12 hours.  Another Garda station was attacked while prisoners were being kept there and there have been other less serious attacks on Garda stations in other parts of the country.  There is nothing more sinister in this than to provide a provision for housing a detained person in circumstances where the ordinary Garda station or prison are not reasonably accessible or available.</P>
      <P>When we discuss this Bill we all talk in terms of being detained for seven days.  The authority is being given to detain for seven days but when we say seven days we mean up to seven days.  It might be an hour and I freely and candidly admit that it might be seven days but it is not going to be seven days all the time.  This measure is under annual review by way of motion which any Deputy or Senator may put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris has raised the point that a convenient place would only become sinister if it became a place of mystery where somebody was secreted away without the knowledge of anybody else.  The Minister will be here later in the day.  Speaking from my point of view, I am satisfied that if a person is detained under this measure and kept in one place where his legal and medical advisers have been in touch with him, which is his constitutional right, and if that person is removed in an emergency to some other place which is not a Garda station or prison, it would be unreasonable <Col N="496" /> if the people who have custody of him do not communicate with his relatives or legal and medical advisers.  I will leave it to the Minister for Justice to speak for himself but that is my opinion.  I could not see it happening that somebody would be taken away suddenly from a Garda station where his legal adviser, father, mother, brother, sister and doctor had been in touch with him, to some place else which is unknown and that the Government would get away with that.  The intention of this measure is to defend democracy and not destroy it.  That is what we are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said because before that he referred to people who do not see fit to recognise the law or the trappings of this House.  I have said that we are not pleading on behalf of that type of person.  We are concerned about the rights of people. Even taking into consideration the people who do not recognise our law, we do not expect them always to adopt this course.  We expect that some day, let us hope soon, everybody will be reconciled and that there will be no need for this type of terrorism as it has been described.  Senator Roddy Connolly made a good contribution in that regard when he talked about what lead up to the formation of the State and the use of violence in bringing about the formation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier the Minister referred to the rare occasion on which this would happen, the utilisation of a convenient place.  The convenient place has not been stipulated but from the debate it seems that it will be identified in that the prisoner's next-of-kin will be communicated with and told that he or she is in this convenient place. I still cannot understand why we utilise, apart from the 48 hours, a further five days to hold a prisoner in a convenient place in a small country such as ours.  If a prisoner deserves to be held in custody, there is no safer place than a prison or a Garda station.  The Minister has also indicated that some of the Garda stations are not sufficiently equipped.  It would be much better to equip the Garda stations properly than to start selecting convenient places and have people <Col N="497" /> speculate about the utilisation of convenient places.</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to what I heard about the utilisation of a convenient place in Dublin adjacent to this House. It was the famous Oriel House.  That was a convenient place; it was not a police station or a prison.  Many people were brought to it and very sinister things happened there.  I would be more than anxious to ascertain what a convenient place would be.  In his opening remarks Senator Ferris referred to &ldquo;offshore&rdquo;.  Are we going to have a prison ship offshore?  Surely a convenient place would not be a hospital unless the prisoner is ill. Surely he would not be brought into an hotel?  We would not take over an hotel because that would involve great risk.  Surely we would not commandeer a private house and put him in it? Rather than have convenient places, it might be better to equip the local Garda stations better than they are.</P>
    <P>The point arises about the regulations which will attach to that convenient place.  Will they be prison regulations or Garda regulations? What will happen in a case of that kind?  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the convenience of being able to bring somebody, no matter where he is caught, to a Garda station or a prison.  It is not very formidable. I have not known of any difficulty in bringing prisoners from Portlaoise for trial in the Special Criminal Court. We have not had to keep prisoners in Mountjoy, which is a more convenient place, pending their trial in the Special Criminal Court.  I am very anxious to clear this matter with a view to not allowing people to read into the phrase &ldquo;other convenient place&rdquo; something that is not intended.  If Garda stations are equipped properly there would not be any rare occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one brief intervention in the interest of democracy.  I do not differ one iota from the intervention made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  He is right in saying that the Judges' Rules protect, that a statement after four or five days of the seven days' detention will be looked upon by the courts with real suspicion.  Our courts will protect as far as they can.  I totally accept that <Col N="498" /> line of reasoning but the risk of this particular phrase, for the interests of democracy, is that we have not got the control and complaints mechanism that would be seen to remove the very real apprehensions that have been expressed here about putting on our Statute Book legislation which allows somebody to be detained for up to seven days in a convenient place.  It would help if the independent complaints machinery could be brought in at the earliest possible time.  It would help also if the right to consult a lawyer and a doctor can be identified. I think the debate has been helpful in focussing on this point and in clarifying to some extent what I regard as an unresolved area.</P>
      <P>I would put it to Senator Alexis FitzGerald that it is not just a question of a voluntary statement at the end of a period of detention.  It is the necessity to have proper accountability and scrutiny and control of what happens during that period.  This is a democracy and we need to have control over the forces of law and order in our democracy when we give them powers like this.  I am not happy that we have got scrutiny and control over the exercise of these powers as they are framed.  The words &ldquo;in a convenient place&rdquo; are too broad.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan is probably right when he says that it was the formula taken out of the 1939 Act and that it is most inappropriate to a section which allows a person to be detained in custody for seven days.</P>
      <P>I do not regard as very weighty assurances given by the Minister for Justice or anybody else about the manner in which this section will be applied. As the Minister is well aware, we are talking about legislation on our book, about successive Governments, successive Administrations, and about the Garda for years to come.  Therefore, assurances cannot prevent us from having serious apprehensions about the words &ldquo;a convenient place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine it is too late for the Minister to accept this amendment. He will hardly recall the Dáil in order to put the amendment to it but he should give precise assurances of the way in which independent complaints <Col N="499" /> machinery will be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity.  It has been referred to obliquely but I would like to see firm assurances of the way in which this will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great reluctance that I say anything on this. There are one or two brief points which occur to me.  I am convinced that the greatest respect for the law takes place when the law itself is quite certain.  This respect for the law comes from the public and from the Garda and from prison personnel.  What this House needs as a legislative assembly is an assurance concerning the quality of legislative instruments.  It is quite another thing altogether to say that the person after something has happened to him may have recourse to law.  It is very much an <i>ipso facto</i> kind of construction.  You are suggesting that although the law is flexible and may even contain potential dangers there is this recourse at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>Law that is so lax, that creates the possibility of abuse or creates uncertainty is in itself a bad service to the public who might have respect for law and to the agents who are involved in the practice of law itself. It also holds itself open much later to arbitary interpretation.  There is immense force in the argument that an assurance of the occupant of the day does not carry anything like the same weight as an explicit provision itself.  For example, even if &ldquo;convenient place&rdquo; had been given sufficient conditions so as to make certain what precisely was taking place in that place, what precise conditions might apply, it would be viewed with far less fear by many people who are concerned that the law be exact.  In the event of inexactitude I can only come to the conclusion that we are risking the relationship between the public and the law makers and law enforcers in so far as we are casting a shadow about something in respect of which there should be no shadow whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point some time ago that the public attitude towards all of this legislation might be quite <Col N="500" /> different if there had been a public commitment to making all of the procedures of apprehension, arrest, investigation, even for ordinary crimes, far more explicit than they are at present. The attitude of the public towards all of this would be more reasonable and less apprehensive.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to follow what Senator Higgins has said in relation to this and in relation to my own comment yesterday about a complaints commission.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;bear no relation to the general administration of law enforcement agencies.  I would not want it to be taken that because we are extending the period from two to seven days and only because of that, that this complaints commission is necessary.</P>
      <P>I represent a Dublin constituency and on occasions have had representations from people who alleged that they were abused physically while being apprehended by gardaí.  When I questioned them as to why they would not make a complaint about it they replied that they would not be believed, that it would be their word against the gardaí concerned.  Anybody who represents a Dublin constituency can testify to the accuracy of that statement.  We must be concerned that the honour and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána remain as they have been in the past.  With my limited degree of expertise and knowledge, I offer the opinion that we are heading into a decade of real substantial violence brought about by conditions of deprivation and poverty. The police force will, willy-nilly, come under considerable provocation in order to ensure that we have physical civil liberties in our cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because of that kind of process, which is independent of this legislation that, in order to put the Garda Síochána above suspicion, we need some form of complaints commission. I would suggest to the Minister for <Col N="501" /> Lands, whom I must compliment for his handling of the debate so far and for the sympathetic way in which he has dealt with the queries put to him by the House, that he would report to the Cabinet the concern of the House that such a commission be set up as soon as possible.  This House would give every support to legislation setting up that commission.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when he is replying to state explicitly, for the records of the House, why an extra five days are being sought by the Government. It has not been explained satisfactorily so far to the public that the extra five days sought by the Garda Síochána are to prevent intimidation of witnesses and the creation of alibis. I respectfully suggest to the Fianna Fáil Opposition that when they established the Special Criminal Court they recognised that intimidation existed and that the process of trial by jury was severely hampered because of that intimidation.  It is in recognition of the existence of intimidation that this Government and the law enforcement agency acting on our behalf, in their wisdom and discretion&mdash;we must give them some degree of judgment in this matter&mdash;sought this extra power.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Before Senator Quinn rose, I indicated to the House that the Minister for Justice will be along shortly and will take the remainder of the Committee Stage of this Bill, and the other Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by Senator Robinson and followed up by Senators Quinn, Higgins and Mullen, in regard to complaints investigation procedure, I am glad it is conceded that it would be most inappropriate to tie up any such procedure with this Bill.  To do so would be an indication of particular bad faith in the object of bringing in this Bill and a vote of no confidence in the members of the Garda Síochána who will be charged with its operation. The Garda Síochána have been with us since the foundation of the State. I have spent more than 30 years as a professional man, practising to a large extent in country District Courts, and I have had no cause to <Col N="502" /> find fault with the Garda Síochána in the execution of their duty.</P>
    <P>I know that a debate is going on about the establishment of a complaints procedure, but not in the context of the legislation with which we are dealing at present.  Senator Robinson put that on the official record yesterday.  I am sure that debate will continue.  It would be more appropriate to continue it when the Minister for Justice is present.  I am not washing my hands of the debate but when this amendment has been concluded the Minister for Justice will be present.  Some of the other points made by Senators would be more appropriately dealt with on amendments which the House will deal with later.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to exclude from the section the right to detain a person &ldquo;in a convenient place&rdquo;, other than a Garda station or a prison.  It is a third choice.  I put it to the House that it is only if and when the Garda station or the prison is not available due to exceptional circumstances that resort will be had to the other convenient place.  In reply to Senator Ferris, I gave as my considered opinion that if a person is removed from one of these places to an unknown destination, the destination will no longer be unknown, because it would be reasonable to assume that his legal adviser or his relatives would be informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to comment on the Minister's point about the police and citizens but I take his point that there will be another opportunity to discuss the matter.  He is unable to accept the amendment that the words &ldquo;or other convenient place&rdquo; be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Robinson that it is unlikely the Minister will accept this amendment and recall the Dáil.  However, would he recognise the importance of doing something positive about the suggestion to remove the words &ldquo;or other convenient place&rdquo;?  In drafting this legislation we must not give people the opportunity of saying there is something nefarious going on.  I would <Col N="503" /> expect the Minister, when the Dáil resumes, to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is becoming clear to the Minister that those of us who oppose this measure are doing so because we want to discharge our functions to the ordinary citizens, to try to protect their rights.  Anybody who watches the activities in the courts knows that innocent people appear before the courts and are discharged after their innocence has been proved.  Therefore the assumption that a person who comes into custody is one who should be treated in any way less justly than somebody walking on the streets outside the prison, Garda station or other convenient place, must be anathema to all of us.  Equally, even if a person is proved guilty eventually, he still has rights and that, as I said earlier, is what distinguishes us from the people called thugs&mdash;I call them misguided youngsters.  This distinguishes us from them because our standards are different. Everybody must have certain rights.  It is because they do not recognise this fundamental human right which people have that people take their lives and do other dreadful things such as burning down property. In other ways they express their protest at a society they do not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important that we try to retain as much as we can of the essential fabric of the democratic rights of our society even under great pressure&mdash;this is the test of justice in any society.  Anybody can behave in a humane way when he is not under pressure or any kind of stress.  The real test of the seriousness of our sense of understanding, humanity, compassion, is when we are under pressure and when we are frightened and in some sense fearful of what these people are doing and what they can do.  We must at all times not only be superior to them in our standards and values but appear to be superior to them in our standards and values even in our treatment of the guilty ones.  This applies even more so in relation to the ordinary citizen who is brought in by mistake <i>bona fide</i> by the Garda who think they have somebody <Col N="504" /> who is guilty and who afterwards, of course, is found to be not guilty and that makes all the difference. This is the point Senator Martin and I have been trying to establish. This is a completely new situation.  It is the fact of the deprivation of the right of appeal to the court plus the seven days, plus the additional penalties, the tripartite provisions, the variety of penalties and disabilities which are now being imposed in this new legislation.  Again in relation to the appeal and the supervision, this seems to me a very reasonable request.</P>

      <P>I was going to reply to the two suggestions made in my hearing here, one by Senator Quinn and the other by the Minister in relation to some form of supervision for the Garda, and the point raised by Senator Robinson and, I understand, Senator Quinn.  The first point in relation to a supervisory body of some kind is something we accept is widely accepted by our community in all aspects of our lives.  There should be no question about it at all and least of all from the Garda themselves because they can be misrepresented by people who say: &ldquo;These people are judge and jury in their own case. What do you expect from them?&rdquo; This, of course, is one of the criticisms made of my own profession, the medical profession, that we tend to go off into a star chamber type of investigation procedure; we issue our findings about the individual; and they may be just or unjust.  It seems to me&mdash;and at times I have referred to this fact&mdash;that I do not think we should have the right to be judge and jury in our own cases and that we leave ourselves open to the charge that we establish certain rules and procedures which should not apply to any special group within society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Cooney, says the innocent man has nothing to fear <Col N="505" /> from this legislation.  This is his case the whole time.  The innocent Garda have nothing to fear from an inquiry or investigating committee.  It would have the advantage of being a judicial, objective inquiry into what has been done and, therefore, would have all the more validity when it came to issuing its findings.  The public could not say: &ldquo;This, of course, is what you would expect from them.  They will whitewash their own people.&rdquo; As, for instance, in the case of doctors it is very hard for anybody to go to court and criticise them or attack them.  Equally, the public is not impressed by that.  Therefore, in the interest of the Garda it would be better that they should accept some kind of independent investigating body.</P>
    <P>Ordinary citizens have to accept this process.  The judicial process is apart from us.  I know there are occasions when it is not.  The broad theory is that none of us, no matter what party we belong to, and no matter who we are in what party&mdash;indeed, the Minister made this clear a number of times last night when he said: &ldquo;I cannot influence the Director of Public Prosecutions&rdquo;&mdash;has any right to interfere with the Judiciary in any way. Neither has any of us any right to interfere with the judicial process, and that is as it should be.  We accept that. That is why the judges are put above all of us, and outside all political parties. Of course that is the theory but, in fact, we generally accept that, once they are appointed, on the whole they operate with independence and fairness and justice.  We accept it for ourselves, the ordinary citizens.  Why cannot we have the same principle introduced in relation to the Garda?</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Quinn about the need for the seven days' provision, I share his view. I have not been convinced about the seven days.  I have talked about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed Senator Quinn to make reference to it but, in fact, amendment No. 6 deals specifically with the five days and 24 hours.  It would be better from the point of the debate if we dealt with it under amendment No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a <Col N="506" /> very passing reference to it in reply to him about the way that was dealt with.  The point he raised about intimidation has already been dealt with by saying that with the removal of the jury system in relation to the Special Courts it could not be used. The intimidation could go on, no matter how long you keep the individual concerned in prison because his supporters outside can still intimidate if they want to.  The process which removed intimidation in so far as we can humanly remove intimidation was, of course, the setting up of courts without juries.  Therefore, that could not be accepted as a reason for the extension to the five or seven days' process.</P>
      <P>After they made wrong decisions in the North&mdash;Faulkner's wrong decisions in relation to internment&mdash; such antagonism developed between the people and the police, and the people and the Army, that most people will accept it is now verging on anarchy and chaos up there.  In those circumstances terrible things can be done under the stress and pressure of the new situation brought about by wrong policy decisions.  This is what we fear now.  Wrong policy decisions may bring about a situation where the terrible things that I referred to last night&mdash;and they were terrible things&mdash;may happen.  Torture can take place and nobody knows about it except the individual who is tortured and the people who did the torturing.  We could get to a situation of chaos within our society where these terrible things would be practised and, even worse still, would come to be accepted, as they have been accepted in the North by many of the people who were in charge there and, as I said, by much of the British Press.  I imagine that would have been unthinkable about ten years ago, but it has become a reality in the past few months.  My submission is that this is a possibility within our society and I am trying to protect our people, our citizens, from that eventuality.</P>

    <P>In submitting this amendment I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the Six Counties it is the Secretary for Northern Affairs who makes an order for an arrest and in England it is the Home Secretary.  This amendment is simple and reasonable. It is very important that we not only establish but protect the principle of accountability.  It is a well-known fact that a district justice is responsible to <Col N="508" /> the Minister and a district justice is obligated to have strict regard for the code of law and, indeed, previous decisions in law.  Similarly, a Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas and also to the public.</P>
    <P>The decision being taken by a police officer is a different matter because he can be found to be exercising his own discretion.  In saying this I am not attacking the police.  Indeed, I contend that this is an unfair burden to put on the shoulders of the police.  I am more than anxious to ensure that we do not alienate the people from the police; it is very important that we do not.  In order to avoid being misunderstood I find it necessary to point out that I have always had the welfare of the Garda in mind.  When they were in trouble many years ago&mdash;I am not boasting about this&mdash;I had no hesitation, as the only TD in Dublin to stand up for what I considered the rectification of a justified grievance which they had.  That being so I am more than anxious that they are not being required to do something that is more proper to people with more experience. That is why I am advocating that we should utilise the district justices for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Our amendment No. 5 seeks to have the Minister for Justice act as the sanctioning party in regard to the extension from 48 hours to seven days.  Senator Mullen, Senator Ryan and myself are trying to get at the same thing.  We feel that this is better kept at the level of accountability to the Oireachtas which is through the Minister for Justice. While agreeing with Senator Mullen in principle I do not think it would be desirable to bring the courts into this type of decision-making at invertigative detention level.  It is a serious Executive function and should be safeguarded to the fullest extent by writing in the Minister for Justice as the sanctioning party.  The Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas and therefore there is this degree of democratic control which I feel is important with regard to a matter of this kind.  I take it that this will only be used in exceptional circumstances, and I take it the Minister for Lands and <Col N="509" /> the Minister for Justice would agree with that.</P>
      <P>I would like to get clarification on this.  I would hope that when this Bill becomes law, as it inevitably will, that it would be used only in the most exceptional circumstances.  I take it that in the normal case the existing pattern would obtain and that it would not become a matter of routine for the Garda to keep people <i>incommunicado</i> for seven days on foot of the arrest provisions under subsection (1). I should like to get a reassurance on that because this is exceptional legislation. It is not a mere technicality, as was stated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs when addressing American businessmen in Killarney and seeking to reassure them.  I take it the Minister for Justice would disagree with that interpretation of the legislation. The legislation is stated to be an Emergency Powers Bill and it abrogates the Constitution as far as the detention and arrest provisions in the Bill are concerned.  That is the purpose of the Title of the Bill: to derogate from the Constitution for which there is provision under Article 28.</P>
      <P>It is a serious matter to extend what has always been regarded by the courts as a reasonable period of detention, 48 hours.  That has never been tested but I am certain it would be regarded by the courts as reasonable. Indeed, we suggest, in a further amendment, that an additional 24 hours might be incorporated.  That might be regarded as reasonable.  I take it that the whole purpose of the Bill is that the Government know that the courts would not regard seven days as being reasonable.  They would regard that as being unreasonable, unconstitutional and an infringement of the guarantees set out in Article 40 of the Constitution, the guarantees in regard to personal rights.</P>
      <P>There is an acknowledgment that this is a serious matter in the Minister's own section, section 3, where there is a distinction drawn in the drafting of the subsection.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach just made the point when I was coming to the point.  We must be of the same empathy in regard to getting to a point.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 2 in the Minister's drafting does acknowledge the distinction between 48 hours and the extra five days.  In the initial part of the subsection it is stated that whenever a person is arrested and kept in custody for a period of 48 hours from the time of arrest it can be done under the ordinary course of police administration. The Minister acknowledges that a serious step is being taken in extending that from 48 hours to seven days by adding in conclusion to the subsection:</P>
      <P>...if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent so directs, be kept in such custody for a further period not exceeding five days.</P>
      <P>There is a distinction drawn in the section by the Minister.  He and his advisers recognise that there is a very real distinction between 48 hours and seven days.  They also recognise that where as the 48 hours' detention can take place in the course of the ordinary administration of justice, a higher deciding authority must come in for the extra five days.  The Minister suggests that the chief superintendent is an adequate higher deciding authority.  I do not think he is an adequate higher deciding authority in a serious matter of this kind which should be used only in exceptional circumstances.  I would like an assurance from the Minister on that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan, Senator Mullen and I are seeking to incorporate in our two amendments a higher authority, separate from the police force, who would authorise this very serious and, I hope, exceptional emergency measure of keeping a person <i>incommunicado</i> for a further five days, in addition to what has been held heretofore to be a reasonable period of 48 hours.  We do not think the chief superintendent, being part of the Garda Síochána machinery, is a sufficiently independent <Col N="511" /> authority to authorise this exceptional and serious extra period of detention.  In my view&mdash;and in Senator Ryan's view&mdash;the person who should have that exceptional and serious power is the person appointed by this Parliament to act in the interests of this country, who, with his advisers who are independent of the police force, can assess the situation as presented to him by the police authorities, can exercise his political judgment and can come to a decision in the matter for which he is responsible to this Parliament&mdash;the Minister for Justice.  I can see no administrative difficulties in doing this.</P>
    <P>The British authorities do not seem to have any difficulty in having their Home Secretary perform precisely this function in the Six Counties.  I do not see why the Minister for Justice cannot similarly assume that function in the Republic.  Indeed, the British Home Secretary is probably more heavily burdened in this sense than our Minister would be, particularly working on the assumption that this will only be used exceptionally and will not be a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>This is a relatively small country. Communications are easy.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Justice if there is any administrative problem in his assuming this power and making this particular order.  To use the Minister's own case as presented by the Minister for Lands on the Second Stage, if there is a serious case for keeping people in detention while investigations are proceeding&mdash;I take it that it would be an exceptional case as all the cases mentioned in support of this measure have been exceptional cases&mdash;I can see no reason why the apparatus of the Department of Justice cannot be brought into immediate action by the Garda.  A telephone call or a report taken by hand does it.</P>
    <P>The Minister's advisers will advise him; he will exercise his political judgment in the knowledge of his responsibility to Parliament; and he can authorise this detention for the extra five days if the case is of sufficient importance.  That machinery is there. There has always been a very efficient <Col N="512" /> administration in our Department of Justice.  The Minister's advisers will know exactly what I mean.  They have always maintained close liaison with the Garda authorities, who report regularly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that there is no administrative problem whatsoever in regard to his making the required emergency decision, if necessary, to detain for the extra period of five days.  I should like to be reassured about that.  In principle, it is very important that the Minister for Justice, responsible to Parliament, makes that decision and that it is not part of routine police machinery.  If it is a serious decision&mdash;and it is acknowledged to be a serious decision because the Minister in his own drafting draws the distinction between two days and seven days by saying that for the extra five days the chief superintendent must decide&mdash;I feel very sincerely and seriously that the Minister should take this power on himself.  I should like this to be treated on a rational basis.</P>
    <P>In the heat of parliamentary debate inevitably we have had some comments that go beyond the <i>rationale</i> which is part and parcel of parliamentary exchanges.  This is a very serious matter.  Having spent some time in the Department of Justice, I see no administrative reason why this is not possible.</P>
    <P>I see a very important reason, in principle, why the Minister for Justice should take the matter of the extra five days on himself and, with his advisers, come to a mature and responsible decision.  It should not be buried in police administration.  It is a decision which may, unfortunately, develop into a routine type decision because the chief superintendent can do it.  It can become a too casual and cavalier decision. This is the danger in any administration.  It is not a reflection on the Garda Síochána.  It is not just a casual or cavalier decision; it is a very important decision which, I feel, should be taken by the person responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas, the person charged with the responsibility on behalf of the people&mdash;the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Lenihan and other Senators that serious arguments and points will be answered in a similar manner by me.  He need not have any worries in that regard.  I will not unilaterally change the temperature of the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan answered briefly Senator Mullen's amendment&mdash;and I will expand it later&mdash;that this power should be given to a district justice. This would be altogether unsuitable because, as Senator Lenihan said, this would involve the Judiciary in an area of Executive Government.  Our Constitution enshrines the basic constitutional principle of the separation of powers of the State into three, the Legislative, the Executive and the Judicial.  It is very important for the continuance of the democratic rule that the separation would be at all times maintained.</P>
      <P>If we were to ask a district justice to exercise what would be an Executive act, in essence a non-judicial act, we would be blurring that distinction to the detriment and independence of the judicial power of the State.  That would be undesirable.  The function of a judge under our Constitution&mdash;this is so well settled it hardly needs to be said&mdash;is to deprive a person of his liberty in accordance with certain procedures involving a trial of issues before him.  In this matter there would be no trial of issues in the accepted sense.  It would be an Executive action and would be completely incompatible with the nature of a judge's function.  For that reason, it would be an undesirable principle to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the Minister for Justice rather than the chief superintendent being the party to make the order, I do not propose to argue that there would be administrative difficulties or to stand on that argument alone.  There are stronger arguments for refusing the amendment.  It would not be administratively easy, because there is only one Minister, and there could be instances where it might lead to delay or difficulties, but I would not advance that as a conclusive argument. As Senator Lenihan said, it is <Col N="514" /> not intended that this power will become the norm.  It will only be exercised in exceptional cases depending on the exigencies of the situation from time to time.  That feature would diminish any administrative difficulties that might arise.  I am not putting forward that as an argument.</P>
    <P>The main argument I would use against accepting this amendment, is that it would be introducing a political person into a situation where a subject is being deprived of his freedom. Senator Lenihan used a telling phrase in support of what I am saying, when he said that this power could be discharged by the Minister in the normal way.  The phrase used was &ldquo;in the exercise of his political judgment&rdquo;.  We should never allow any political person in the exercise of his judgment to be the one to deprive a citizen of his liberty.  This would be opening a door to admit a very dangerous procedure and to admit a very wrong principle into our code of conduct in this whole area.  That argument, is insuperable and is an argument which cannot be controverted when we are considering whether this amendment should be accepted or not.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for the decision to be in the hands of a political person. None of us can know who will occupy any post.  None of us can know what circumstances will pertain in this State and I am not&mdash;I made this clear in the argument in the other House&mdash;pointing the finger at any of my predecessors and saying that the power might be used in an unscrupulous fashion, but none of us knows what tomorrow will bring and the principle is so fraught with danger that to give a political person this function, having regard to all the pressures that might come and the temptations that might be placed in the way of a political person, would be wrong in principle.  I feel very strongly about this indeed.  I take the point about accountability.  If in order to achieve accountability the power had to be given to a political person, then we might even begin to look at that principle and see would we be justified in breaching it here.</P>
    <P>The argument for accountability <Col N="515" /> does not justify any breach of that principle, because there will still be accountability to the Oireachtas, through the Minister for Justice of the day, for the activities of the Garda Síochána.  It is well settled that the Minister for Justice is answerable in Parliament by way of parliamentary question in the other House, or in this House in accordance with its rules and procedures, for Garda actions and Garda policy generally. If accountability is sought in this amendment, I submit to the House that accountability is already provided for, in the way that I have mentioned, and there would be as much accountability by leaving the section stand, as accepting this amendment. Any arguments that there might be about the degree of accountability are not valid in my opinion, and are not sufficiently strong to disturb the other argument which I am making that it is extremely wrong in principle to give to a political person the power to lock up a citizen for any length of time. This power must be left in the hands of the police.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the general level of conscientiousness of our police in the discharge of their duty.  After all, in 1972 we gave what I think is an even wider power to a chief superintendent and one that I objected to at that time.  It is still a power that is a very wide power and I can honestly assure the House that I am satisfied that that power has been exercised in a most conscientious and indeed, some might say even in a restricted way, and I advance this as a pragmatic reason for trusting the general standards of probity that the Garda observe discharging their duty.  We have that safeguard then, the safeguard of accountability through the Minister for Justice, for Garda activities. The fears that are expressed are met by that argument and they certainly do not remove the supreme argument that it is wrong in principle to introduce a political decision in a matter such as this.  Senator Lenihan made my case for me when he said &ldquo;the exercise of his political judgment&rdquo;. This would be altogether wrong because there would always be <Col N="516" /> a danger that that is what the criterion would be&mdash;political judgment rather than reasons of security or police reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot follow and I do not agree with the Minister when he makes this point about political judgment.  The Minister has made a very serious political judgment in introducing this Bill.  The Minister has decided that the ordinary law is not sufficient to deal with the situation existing in this country and that a Bill must be brought in which is not in accordance with the Constitution and consequently has to be brought in in this special way.  The whole situation that we are talking about is a situation which has been created by the political judgment of the Minister and the Government. Having created a situation which is certainly one involving political judgment the Minister should retain responsibility for what is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The kind of situation that is envisaged in this Bill will always be a political situation.  It will always be a form of crime which can be described as political and certainly having created the situation, the Minister should retain control.  He should be satisfied and be in a position to be satisfied that the powers being used in this Bill will be used in the context which was intended and envisaged when the major political decision was made.  It would be most unfortunate if the Minister did not retain control of the situation and if the security forces, the Garda, were tending to use the powers contained in this Bill in a way which was not proper, which was not envisaged when this decision was made.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the Minister should realise that he has created a situation as a result of a political judgment and he should keep control of that situation and ensure that the powers contained in this Bill would only be used in the context of what was on the mind of the Minister and in the mind of the Government if this Bill was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument used by the Minister is completely invalid.  We are not <Col N="517" /> dealing with the ordinary law.  Of course it would be wrong for the Minister, in the administration of the ordinary law of the land, to interfere in a political way with the activities of the Garda except in some very special circumstances.  This is quite different.  This is a matter involving political judgment.  It was created by a political judgment and the Minister should retain it in his power to make sure that it is administered in the way which was envisaged by the Government when they made this judgment. The more the Minister discussed this, the more the Minister expressed his view about it, the more I am convinced that this amendment should be accepted and that the Minister should maintain control of a situation created by him.  Of course, we are very often in the situation here that it is difficult to accept amendments.  But we have to take the situation as we find it, and I certainly feel that this amendment should be accepted and we really have to press the amendment which will oblige the Minister to accept the consequences of and maintain control of a situation created by him and created as a result of a political judgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the two amendments before the House I would strongly support the amendment put forward by Senator Brian Lenihan and Senator Eoin Ryan that the judgment should be by a politically accountable person.  That is not to say that I do not think there are very considerable merits in the arguments put forward by the Minister.  There is a balance to be maintained.  He is right in saying it is preferable to have the decision relating to an individual <Col N="518" /> not in the hands of a political figure. That would be an impossible situation. There are difficulties inherent in that. There is much to be said for independence. There is much to be said for the creation of the office of DPP.  I supported that strongly.  It was a very good step.</P>
      <P>The situation here is a very difficult one.  This is a Bill which goes beyond the normal constitutional provisions for the protection of the citizen.  We have created a state of emergency and this is an Emergency Powers Bill which allows a person to be held for a further five days after he has been held for 48 hours by the Garda.  That is exceptional.  I would strongly hope that the Minister and those Senators who say that it will be a power that will be rarely used are right; but I also think that it is a power where there has to be a high degree of accountability.  It is related to the scope of the section itself.</P>
      <P>I made this point on Second Reading and I hope to make it again on the section.  The section itself allows the Garda to exercise this power in relation to offences under the Offences Against the State Act or scheduled offences.  At some length in this House we debated the fact that included in the scheduled offences are offences under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and that a person who does not have the protection of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and who pickets premises is, I think, capable of being prosecuted for being in contravention of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and the powers of arrest and detention for seven days apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was assured by the Minister for Lands this would not be the intention of the scope of this Bill and I said to him that actual administrative policy on general prosecutions would be in the hands of the DPP and not in the hands of the Minister.  This is relevant to our consideration of the accountability for the detention of a person for an extra five days because, if circumstances change somewhat and if there is a severe economic crisis and recession here and there are some pickets <Col N="519" /> outside Government Departments by public employees, then you might have a situation where the Garda in the legitimate exercise of the powers that are here would use the power to detain somebody for seven days for contravention of section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act.  Politically, that might be highly undesirable as far as the Minister is concerned and as far as the Government are concerned. I certainly hope it would be. But the mechanism would be independent of the Government, in the Minister's own words.  They would have set in motion something that apparently they do not want to be in a position to control, be accountable for or stop. This is the difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the question of accountability that is the substantial question before the House.  I see merit in the points the Minister was making but, on balance, because of the nature of the power and because of the scope of this section, I would prefer that the decision to detain a person for a further five days, and therefore the way in which the section will be used, will be a decision by an accountable figure.  I say this because I think that our traditions in this regard are very much inherited from the common law system, from the British system, and they had a Director of Public Prosecutions for a considerably longer time. Ours is a recent institution.  They are very concerned about the sort of values that the Minister was outlining and yet it is a politically accountable figure, either the Home Secretary or the Minister for Northern Ireland Affairs, who is the person who takes the decision under their legislation.  It is because of the necessity for a degree of political accountability that they have chosen that method and I would prefer to see the Minister for Justice being the person who directs that a person be detained for a further five days and who is accountable for that decision so that it can be raised immediately and in a political way if there is any question of abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> I am reinforced in this view by the fact that we do not have an independent complaints machinery.  The Minister was not here this morning when we had a useful discussion on the fact that this independent complaints machinery should not be narrowed to emergency legislation, or terrorist offences, or this type of offence that we needed for the respectability of our enforcement of the criminal code in general and that the arguments are stronger if placed in that context.  But we do not have any machinery in which the individual can complain against what he regards as an unreasonable exercise of that power by the Garda Síochána, machinery which is independent of the Garda Síochána themselves.  I think that is another weakening factor, though it is not a determining one here.  The determining one is the necessity for political accountability and the necessity for a political control over the scope of the legislation because the scope of this section can be enlarged at any time by the scheduling of further offences.</P>
    <P>I would hope, when speaking on the section, to try to persuade the Minister of the very strong grounds for descheduling section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, because there is now another section, the section in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, on interference with the courts of justice which did not exist in November, 1972, when section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of the Property Act, 1875, was scheduled.  There is now a different way of meeting that problem.  It is possible, I believe, to remove from the list of scheduled offences section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  That would remove one of the very substantial difficulties of the scope of this section but it would not remove the fact that at any time other scheduled offences can be added.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views about the undesirability of bringing the courts into this procedure, for the reasons given by the Minister and also because I would imagine it would <Col N="521" /> be difficult for a chief superintendent to be as frank in open court about the reasons for doing what he intends to do than it would be were he to be in contact with somebody such as the Minister.  Therefore, I would support the proposal of Senator Lenihan and Senator E. Ryan that the Minister should accept the responsibility of making this decision.</P>
      <P>I go back to the point I raised so consistently, that is, the very serious nature of the proposal to extend from two to seven days the period of detention and the inevitable enormous stress on the people who will be involved in this whole question of trying to control these illegal organisations who are, of course, the Garda.  As many of us have said, we should try to protect them as far as we possibly can against the terrible alienation which has occurred against the RUC in the North and against people like prison warders and so on who have found themselves implementing what are politically very unpopular decisions, who themselves are innocent people but who are being subjected to pressures which become unbearable.</P>
      <P>These pressures are essentially imposed by us in the way we handle the situation and the kind of laws we bring in in order to handle a situation. For example, even the way in which we operate our prisons with punitive rather than reformative attitudes. These rebound on the unfortunate warders.  This kind of legislation can lead the Garda into positions in which they have to take up effectively punitive, aggressive positions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the people they are trying to get information from.  Most people&mdash;possibly it has something to do with our history&mdash;are rather frightened of the police anyway. The prospect of being in custody in a Garda station or in a prison and the prospect of extension to seven days is particularly frightening anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gardaí were very understandably upset, as were all of us, by the dreadful deaths of their colleagues, Garda Reynolds and Garda Fallon.  Under the pressure of that kind of situation to try to find the people who killed their colleagues it must be particularly difficult for a member of the force if faced <Col N="522" /> with the possibility, not a very strong possibility, that he has the man who did it.  Because he has these pressures of being watched by all his other colleagues in regard to making the wrong decision in releasing this person he will tend to err on the side of keeping the person the longer rather than the shorter period.  I feel that this kind of burden should not be put on members of the Garda, that they should be able to have recourse to somebody outside the force so that they can share this very grave responsibility of extending the period of keeping the person in prison.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious from what we heard last night that this is the last time we are going to have a serious debate on this subject.  Secondly, it is quite obvious that this is going to be a very long emergency, going on for many, many years.  We are putting through the House legislation which is going to be on the statute book a long time as has been said on many occasions.  The Minister has also said that we are going to go through a period of great economic stress in which there will be pressures other than those with which we are now dealing, pressures arising from defects in the economy, serious trade disputes and worker unrest.  This type of legislation, particularly in regard to the points made on the scheduled offences not covered by the Trades Dispute Act extends the scope of what we are doing so very much that it is particularly important that the Minister should shoulder the responsibility rather than hand it over to somebody else.</P>
    <P>From the political point of view I suppose, in a way, it is realistic of the Minister to say that we can do terrible things to one another in this country; we have done terrible things to one another since the State was formed.  To some extent, there must be a certain validity in the case the Minister made.  I had hoped we had moved through that awful period to a time when the possibility of any of us getting into a position of the kind of authority which the Minister holds at the present time, or any Member of Government, was remote.  Possibly the Minister is correct.  Possibly I am <Col N="523" /> a little too trusting in that regard.  It is rather a frightening reflection for the Minister to make.  Most of us know that most Ministers in most Government Departments must make decisions in relation to situations such as making appointments to State boards and so on though they are obviously not as important as what we are discussing now.  We also accept the political responsibility of appointing the Judiciary.  That is a particularly important one.  We do not hand that over.  When talking about the Judiciary, I often used to raise this in the other House with the late Deputy Seán Lemass and other people and suggested that it should be passed to an Appointments Commission, the Civil Service Commission or some such body but the politicians have always reserved the responsibility of making a political decision in this very important area of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The other terrifying power we do reserve to ourselves&mdash;which I greatly resented during my time as a Member of the Cabinet and wished I did not have that power&mdash;was the final right to take the political decision whether to have a person hanged or not.  We do not leave this with the police or even with the Judiciary or the President; we keep this power to ourselves.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's argument has a certain amount of validity in it, I can recall the discomfort there was when, I think, the Minister for Justice could commute sentences for drunken driving and so on.  Forgive me for introducing such a trivial subject on such a serious occasion.  We are all glad that he divested himself of that power.  At the same time, this is such a serious power that he should accept direct accountability, rather than, perhaps, an unwise decision by a chief superintendent which he may have to come in here and defend.  He must take the decision himself, be seen to be taking the decision himself and, in that way, be directly accountable for having taken it himself.  We all know that the average one of us would defend, to the best of his ability, somebody else's decision, particularly one of our subordinates, in a situation of this kind <Col N="524" /> and we would all accept that that would be the likely thing to happen. Where we were faced with a man who had taken the wrong decision, we would not be forgiving in relation to him.  We would insist on him justifying the decision he took.  I would support the amendment suggesting that the Minister should consider taking over responsibility himself for this decision.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940, in relation to internment.  It may seem strange to refer to it but it is directly relevant here.  The power to direct that a person be held in custody for a further period, up to a maximum of seven days, is like but is still substantially different from internment.  It is not indefinite and is not for a long period; it is for a shorter and specific period.  It is worth remembering that in the 1940 Act the decision to detain and intern for an indefinite period is a political decision of the Minister.  Section 4 of that Act provides:</P>
      <P>Whenever a Minister of State is of opinion that any particular person is engaged in activities which, in his opinion, are prejudicial to the preservation of public peace and order or to the security of the State, such Minister may by warrant under his hand and sealed with his official seal order the arrest and detention of such person under this section.</P>
      <P>That is an amendment because the original wording in the 1939 Act &ldquo;that the Minister is satisfied&rdquo; was construed by the courts as being an exercise of judicial function by the Minister and the wording was changed to &ldquo;the Minister being of opinion&rdquo; so that the Minister could exercise that particular function for which he would then be accountable.  This is directly relevant to the section and to the exercise of a function in the section. I would like the Minister to take it into consideration when he is replying.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might deal with that point first.  There is a certain irony in Senator Robinson advancing the powers to intern as <Col N="525" /> being a justification for what is proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a justification. It is relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it is advanced in support so, strictly speaking, there has to be a justification as being relevant to the argument.  We have to distinguish the nature of internment. Internment was a blanket lock-up of an indiscriminate number of people for an indefinite period.  It would be very much a political action and would be recognised as such.  It would be a most exceptional procedure. Happily it has not been necessary now and I hope the situation will continue the same so that it will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>It is clearly distinguishable from the power that is being sought now&mdash; which is in the realm of police procedures. What is being sought is in the area of police investigations, which is altogether a different matter from the Government of the day deciding that the rule of law has so broken down that it cannot be maintained through the ordinary legal processes and that internment has to be introduced.  In that situation it is nakedly political.  It is right that that particular act should be done by a political person.  In this area of the Emergency Powers Bill we are dealing with the detention of persons for police reasons.  The proper persons to make the decision is the policeman concerned not below the rank of chief superintendent.</P>
      <P>I am reinforced in my argument by the general acceptance by Senators of the validity of it, that it is a bad principle to give to a political person the right to deprive a citizen of his liberty. I do not take it that there is any difference in the degree of accountability that would be available following the exercise by a chief superintendent as opposed to the exercise by a Minister. In practice there would not be, because the venue for accountability would be the same place, namely, the Parliament; the manner of accounting would be precisely the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider how much accountability <Col N="526" /> there would be if it were the Minister as opposed to the Garda; let us consider how much accountability can be given in individual cases irrespective of whether the Minister or a chief superintendent signs the order.  I could foresee a situation where it would not be possible or proper to give to Parliament the reasons for which an order was made, irrespective of who made the order.  The matter might be of the greatest confidentiality with very serious security implications. Apart from that aspect, there could be reasons relating to the character of the person being detained.  What is happening here is that the person is being detained on reasonable suspicion and it would not be proper or in the interests of the citizen that the grounds for that reason of suspicion should be debated publicly in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The question of accountability cannot ever go into the <i>minutiae</i> of a particular case.  Accountability means to ensure, <i>via</i> Parliament, that there is no abuse of the powers as a matter of policy and that the general operation of the section is what would be reviewed, in respect of which there would be an accountability to Parliament. That degree of accountability, which is the only accountability that can take place, can be achieved irrespective of whether a chief superintendent or the Minister for Justice makes the order. Once there is in essence no difference in accountability, we are then faced with the argument whether it is desirable as a matter of principle that it be a political person who would do it, or that it would be the chief superintendent who would do it.  I stand firm in my argument. It is common case between us all that it would be an undesirable principle to admit this idea of a political person signing an order having somebody locked up.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne said that keeping the power in the hands of the chief superintendent could be detrimental to the standing of the Garda.  He was apprehensive that it could lead to the alienation that occurred in Northern Ireland between the RUC and a section of the population.  That is not comparing like with like.  The reason for that alienation was not the nature <Col N="527" /> of the law that had been implanted but the partial way in which it was implanted.  It is recognised that for a long time the police force was identified with a particular section of the commuity.  I do not say that is still the position; I think it is not, and certainly strenuous and <i>bona fide</i> efforts have been made to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that our police force is not identified with any section of the community.  No class, creed or political grouping can claim that the police force has any particular leaning or favouritism towards them.  Our police force is seen to be an impartial, independent police force and has always so comported itself.  So long as that continues to be the case&mdash;there is nothing in this measure which would make any change there and we can confidently expect that it will continue to be the case&mdash;I do not see any danger of the police becoming alienated from the population by virtue of giving this power to the chief superindendent. I do not think it opens the slightest chink in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne said that governments make the political decisions.  Of course they do.  The appointment of judges, one could say, is a political matter and the procedure is one that could be criticised.  I do not want to go into the area of trying to decide what the alternative would be because that would lead us to great difficulty, particuarly in a society where the legal world is small.  Will they pick themselves?  Will the candidate be one of the people making the choice? There are insuperable practical difficulties. The standards of rectitude and impartiality of our Judiciary are impeccable and nobody has ever criticised them on that score.  Consequently, the method of picking cannot be that bad.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne said I should not cavil at taking powers to lock up a person for seven days when the Cabinet can have the power of taking life.  There is a serious distinction to be made here.  The Cabinet do not take the life of a person sentenced to <Col N="528" /> capital punishment but they can commute the sentence imposed by the courts.  The courts make the decision as to whether capital punishment should be imposed.  It is then a political matter whether the sentence is carried out.  The Cabinet's function in that matter is a negative rather than a positive one but in this amendment it is sought to give the Minister for Justice a positive function.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson pointed to the precedents of procedures in the UK. It is somewhat ironic to point to precedents in that jurisdiction in this general area.  The fact that the practice exists in that jurisdiction is their business.  In regulating our business we should take account of what I think is a bad principle&mdash; giving to a political person the power to lock somebody up.</P>
    <P>The question of a complaints procedure is not strictly relevant to the debate on this amendment as it has been raised.  Such procedure is under consideration.  It has not been ruled out and it will be kept under review. I will monitor the situation carefully from time to time, having regard to the comments made and to who made them.  I must have regard to all these factors.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson suggested that, if there was such a tribunal, complaints about unreasonable behaviour by gardaí&mdash;unreasonable in the context of this section&mdash;could be made to it.  I could not foresee that such a tribunal would be a proper forum at which to discuss that sort of activity by the Garda.  I understood that it would tend more to deal with allegations of improper treatment of persons in custody.  These are the allegations which are made from time to time.  If there is unreasonable behaviour by the Garda on foot of the powers in this section the proper place to curb this misbehaviour would be in the courts.  I submit that the courts would still have power to intervene if the activities carried out under this section were not lawful and not strictly in accordance with the section.  That is where the citizen will find redress and more effective redress rather than in an administrative <Col N="529" /> tribunal.  We come back to the question of whether it is a good principle to give to a political person the power to make this order.</P>

      <P>No.  It is a rather anomalous legal position that has arisen.  There are many anomalies in <Col N="530" /> the law which in theory pose threats to citizens but which have never come to pass.  I am satisfied that this is such an anomaly.  I can understand that people may be worried by it and I am prepared to give an undertaking to examine it as quickly as possible to try and clear it up.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, it is common case that the argument I have made is acceptable: that it is wrong in principle to admit a political person into the area of depriving a subject of his liberty.  We are all agreed on that.  It then comes back to the question of accountability.  I submit, having regard to what I have said, that the measure and extent of accountability is identical, whether it is the chief superintendent or a Minister for Justice who makes the order.  Once that is the case, and it has to be the case having regard to what I have said, the other argument I made must take precedence over all other considerations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly&mdash;I have made my main argument in introducing the amendment&mdash;there is a basic disagreement in principle here but there is not much point in talking too long about it.  This is fundamentally a matter for the exercise of political judgment.  The British, in their wisdom over the years, have always had the Home Secretary accountable in this area of the deprivation of fundamental human rights or in any case of detention beyond the ordinary law of the land.  There is a very good reason for this.  The Government have recognised it as being a very serious matter.  Our fundamental human and personal rights are written into Article 40 of the Constitution, the fundamental rights which always existed as common law in Britain.  The Government have recognised the seriousness of this situation by making a political decision to introduce this Bill and to abrogate the Constitution for the purpose of detention measures enshrined in the Bill. They have done this for their own reasons, which I will not discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important political step. The reason the British have always insisted on the Home Secretary being responsible in this area is that, if it is <Col N="531" /> reduced to being a mere routine police administration matter, there is a very grave danger of an infringement of human rights.  The British have decided that there should be a higher or separate authority&mdash;that is, the Home Office with its political head&mdash;to review any such situation and exercise a political judgment.  This is not narrow politics but politics of a different order. They exercise a mature political judgment on foot of advice from the Minister's own Department&mdash;the Home Office in Britain&mdash;as to whether or not the liberty of the individual is to be deprived in the manner set out in the Bill for a further five days.  This is a matter where the Constitution is under suspension as far as this decision is concerned, where the Minister has a duty, in the absence of a Constitution, to make that important political decision <i>vis-à-vis</i> the liberty and freedom of the individual.  That should not be reduced to a police procedure method, however honourable and fair these procedures can and try to be.</P>
    <P>As the section now stands, the chief superintendent can do it.  It will inevitably tend to become a routine administration matter.  This is a matter which is very serious and, as the Minister is aware, very exceptional where this extra five days' detention comes into play.  The Minister agrees with me that there is no internal administration problem as far as the availability of these advisers to be immediately contacted by the Garda are concerned, or his availability to sanction such a decision of extension, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very important matter of political principle involved. The Minister might disagree on that. There has been very good reason why the British have insisted during the centuries on ultimate political control in the area of human rights, the most fundamental human right being a person's liberty.  We are talking about a matter which is the cornerstone of the British system, the <i>habeas corpus</i> procedure, the cornerstone of our Constitution under Article 40.  That cornerstone is being taken away.  At this stage I am not questioning the Government's reasons for doing that. <Col N="532" /> That is another matter.  But, rightly or wrongly, the Government have made a political decision here effectively to take away the protection of Article 40 as far as a person detained for the extra five days in accordance with this section is concerned.</P>
    <P>I can see a basic disagreement in principle.  The Minister thinks that this is part of police procedure one that should be left to the procedure of the police.  I agree with the Minister that in regard to ordinary crime that is obviously right.  It is not a matter in which the Minister for Justice here, or the Home Secretary in Britain, or a similar type Minister in a civilised state, should intervene.  The police pursue crime in strict accordance with their procedures&mdash;that is their business &mdash;and it would be totally wrong for the Minister for Justice to intervene in any way.</P>
    <P>But the Minister for Justice should intervene on a most vital political matter, where a person's liberty is being taken from him or her and where the apparatus of the State is being used to do that for a period that is longer than up to now, which it quite clearly is.  That is why the Bill is before us.  In that situation it is a fundamental political matter for the political head of the executive apparatus responsible for doing that to a person.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), line 12, to delete &ldquo;five days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;24 hours&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> The purpose of this amendment is, I am sure, quite evident to the Seanad because it is basic to the whole debate on the Bill.  Fundamentally, our view is that without good reason declared, which we have not had declared heretofore by the Government, existing security arrangements and the existing detention legislation operating under the Offences Against the State Act, providing for 48 hours' detention, are adequate to cope with any offences against the State, which we deplore, but which we feel the Government can cope with, provided their security arrangements are adequate and provided&mdash;with which we agree&mdash;increased penalties are written into legislation as are written into the other Bill which will be before us shortly, that is, the Criminal Law Bill.</P>
    <P>It is germane to our whole opposition that detention without trial, and without recourse to the Constitution, for five days is introduced on top of what has been there over a number of years, and has been regarded as reasonable detention, and would be so regarded by the courts to be sufficient for the Government to deal with the problems arising out of any endangerment to the State.  However, instead of merely suggesting the deletion of the part of the section which provides for the extension to five days, in an effort to be constructive, and if there is a degree of urgency about the matter, we suggest in this amendment that we substitute &ldquo;24 hours&rdquo; for &ldquo;five days&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Quite bluntly and straightforwardly, even though the Minister for Foreign Affairs described the matter as a mere technicality to the American businessmen in Killarney on Monday evening, this is not a mere technicality.  This has been expressed here quite forcibly by a number of Senators who are concerned about the fundamental human rights involved in this matter.  This is not a technicality.  This is a matter of very serious importance.  If a period of 48 hours, in the belief of the security authorities, is not sufficient for detention, we suggest that we should give extra authority, certainly, but we do it very sparingly in the interest of civil rights and human <Col N="534" /> liberties.  The Oireachtas should be very sparing in any such extension.</P>
    <P>We dispute the whole motivation behind the introduction of this Bill. We largely support the other Bill. While opposing it in principle, we feel that if the Minister and the Government have a case for extending the 48 hours' provision, which has been there since 1939 and which would be supported by the courts as reasonable detention, they should make that case. To jump from that to seven days' detention, without trial, or recourse to the courts, or charges being made, is a very big jump if one has got the conscientious approach one should have in regard to the balance to be preserved, in regard to human rights as between the Legislature, the Executive, the police, and the ordinary members of the public.</P>
    <P>We have a very real duty here to be guarded and careful about any extension of this right of detention.  The period of 48 hours was written into the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  This virtually means that there is a suspension of liberty for 48 hours under that Act.  That is about the limit one should go in this area.  Too cavalier and casual an attitude has been adopted in regard to this matter by some Members of the Seanad and, indeed, by some Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but not the Minister for Justice, or the Minister for Lands who was here handling the Bill on his behalf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;both of whom agreed at all stages that this was a situation in which detention of this kind would only be invoked by way of direction of the chief superintendent in exceptional cases of real emergency.  The matter would be exclusive to particularly urgent and serious situations which would be deemed by the chief superintendent to be such.  I appreciate that and, for that very reason, I felt on the previous amendment that this extension should not be a matter for the chief <Col N="535" /> superintendent but for the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Similarly, on this amendment I feel very strongly that, particularly when we will have an opportunity in 12 months' time to review the situation if we so wish when the order comes before us.  The Oireachtas should be very sparing in any extension of 48 hours' detention without charge, trial, or court discretion to look into the matter.  We should be very chary and careful and circumspect and sparing in our attitude because of the seriousness of what is involved.  We should not in an easy or casual manner despatch a citizen of this State into detention without his rights for seven days.</P>
      <P>This again is relevant to a subsequent amendment.  We should be very sparing and chary about any extension in that respect.  I feel that we should make a start now in this legislation by extending the 48 hours by a further 24 hours.  Then let us make our assessment in a free and open democratic manner by way of debate in Dáil and Seanad in 12 months' time, let us see whether the objectives that the security authorities may be seeking legitimately to achieve have been achieved by extending the time by 24 hours to three days and decide at that stage whether we retain the three days or look for another 24 hours.</P>
      <P>In this legislation, following the abrogation of the Constitution in regard to this detention provision, we jump from the situation that has obtained since 1939 of 48 hours' detention to seven days' detention, just like that.  To deprive the individual undergoing that detention of recourse to his constitutional rights raises a very serious matter that cannot be dismissed as a technicality.  It was described as such by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister and the Government as a whole must have realised that it is not a technicality to suspend the Constitution in the title of the Bill and to revoke Article 28 as it has been revoked. I am sure there is a realisation by the responsible Minister that it is much more than a technicality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very serious matter and if it <Col N="536" /> is a very serious matter involving individual and personal rights then I suggest to the Minister that the amendment in my name and Senator Eoin Ryan's name to substitute 24 hours instead of five days represents a responsible sort of advance into the area of infringement of human rights that the Legislature might consider to be reasonable, having regard to its functions weighing in the balance between the exigencies of the security situation and also the importance of preserving a basic personal freedom.  That is why, in a constructive effort, Senator Ryan and myself decided that, even though in principle we are opposed to the extension altogether, and having regard to the situation in the Dáil where that stance by our party was rejected by the Minister, if there are exigencies in the security situation they might be met by some response involving a reasonable extension of 48 hours by a further 24 hours and to have three days' instead of two days' detention.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, under the Bill we could review this matter as responsible legislators in 12 months' time and decide whether or not the three days had been reasonably operated and reasonably met the situation which obviously the Minister and the Government must be concerned about.  If it has it can remain; if it has not, the Minister can come forward with a further suggestion and we here in the Oireachtas can consider whether an extra period of time is required.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with something very precious, very important.  We are dealing with the deprivation of personal liberty and we should, in any derogation from our stance, move slowly with caution, concern, care and consideration. It is far too serious a matter to be treated in a crude executive fashion.  It is a fundamental matter, fundamental to the whole principle of democratic society.  Being so fundamental, Senator Ryan and I feel that <i>festine lente,</i> hasten slowly, should be very much the order of the day by a responsible Government.  We suggest that 48 hours having subsisted now for 37 years, an extra 24 hours at this stage might be a sufficient advance, pending a review of the <Col N="537" /> whole matter in 12 months' time.  To jump from a situation of 48 hours to seven days&mdash;involving the deprivation of constitutional rights and personal liberty&mdash;is far too great a leap, having regard to the situation that exists and the respect that is held by Irish people generally for human rights and the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>We are a people, thanks be to God, who object to any form of coercion. For hundreds of years we have had coercive legislation in this country.  It is built into the Irish psyche, the Irish psychology, and it is not going to be eradicated from it by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is written into our psychology that we view with great suspicion any intrusion of this kind into individual freedom.  We have 48 hours and if the Minister considers that its not sufficient we on this side of the House are willing to give him another 24 hours.  Next year we are willing to have a look at it and if the case for increasing the period is made give him another 24 hours.  We object entirely to him being given this drastic extension of the power of detention without charge, without trial and without recourse to the courts and the Constitution.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, when proposing this measure to the Oireachtas the Government had to be advised on the details and we did not just draw the period of seven days out of a hat, so to speak.  The period of seven days was proposed following the closest consultation with the police and the appropriate people to advise on the details of this measure.  In coming to the conclusion that this is the appropriate measure to propose.  we had the benefit of that advice and we were given details in the course of that advice of actual Garda experiences which confirmed us in the view which we are now putting to the Oireachtas that this power is necessary and the Garda do require it.  We were given chapter and verse of instances where, if the power had been available, serious crime would have been prevented. Serious crimes would have been detected in the sense that the culprits would have been made amenable <Col N="538" /> to justice and the proceeds of certainly at least one serious robbery would have been recovered.</P>
      <P>I have given these reasons in this House before and on a number of occasions in the other House and it is wrong for Senator Lenihan to say the Government have asked for this power without giving any reasons.  There has to be a certain amount of subjective opinion in what is the appropriate period for detention and one has to be guided by what one considers reasonable. On the case made to the Government and the case that we are making to the Oireachtas seven days appears to be a reasonable figure.  If the period were ten days, somebody would criticise it; if it were five days, somebody would criticise it.  Seven days appears to us to be a reasonable figure.  Seven days from the point of view of the person in detention could be long&mdash;I concede that&mdash;but having regard to the purposes for which the power is asked seven days is not an unreasonable length of time to enable Garda investigations to take place and to ensure that there is no impediment placed in the way of those investigations, that witnesses are not interfered with, false alibis constructed and that there is no collusion to defeat the ends of justice.</P>
      <P>It is not a power that we decided lightly to seek.  It is a power that we seek with full acknowledgment of its essential gravity but we are satisfied with the case that was made to us. Senators will understand that the details that are given to us are of their very nature highly confidential, touching the realm of security and cannot be revealed.  There has to be a certain amount of trust given and taken in these areas and it is on that basis that we have essentially to come before the Oireachtas.  But the figure of seven days, I am satisfied, is the appropriate period in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>To get back to a concept used by the Minister earlier, this is a matter of political judgment.  We on this side of the House must accept at this stage that we are not going to succeed in preventing any extension of the 48 hours.  We recognise that there is going to be some <Col N="539" /> extension.  But this is an effort to explore whether, if the power is necessary at all, it is really necessary to extend it to seven days.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson used a very picturesque and very relevant description when she said that we should be like misers, that when we were talking about anything that would infringe on civil liberties, on the liberty of the individual, we should give only what we felt was absolutely necessary and we should be miserly in what we give.  This is an effort to be miserly.  Is it really necessary to extend the time that a person can be detained to seven days?  The argument is that the police want to keep the person concerned in custody while they make enquiries, they do not want their enquiries to be interfered with; they do not want any of the evidence to be destroyed and so on. There is a case to be made.  Clearly I do not accept in all the circumstances that it is necessary to bring in this Bill or to have a national emergency but that is an arguable case.</P>
      <P>Having conceded that, just how much is necessary?  It is not a question of how many days extra are necessary, it is how many hours extra are necessary, because we should examine critically the extent, measuring it in hours not in days.  We put down an amendment to say 24 hours; perhaps that is not quite enough.  If the Minister were to compromise and say: &ldquo;Well I certainly could not settle for 24 but I would settle for 48&rdquo;, we would certainly be inclined to accept that, or at least we would be inclined to say that this is being met in a responsible way, that this is not just a question of thinking of a number and saying that seven days is a nice convenient measure of time. This would convince us that all aspects of the picture were being examined, that the necessities of the security forces on the one hand were being considered, but on the other hand what is necessary, what is essential from the point of view of any infringement of civil liberties and human rights is also being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas one can appreciate that there is an argument for extending <Col N="540" /> the time, it is very, very difficult indeed to accept that seven days is really necessary.  What kind of investigations, enquiries and so on would take the Garda seven days?  They are very efficient and a very highly organised body and they have everything on their side in the sense of making enquiries.  Perhaps 48 hours is not quite enough but three days should be; if not three days at the very outset perhaps four days.  Seven days seems to me to be just thinking of a number and going far beyond what is really necessary and justified.</P>
    <P>The Minister in making this decision and in arriving at seven days has been almost wholly influenced by what the Garda thought was necessary and has not been influenced, certainly not to any appreciable degree, about the extent to which this was infringing on the liberty of the individual, and infringing on what was reasonable in all the circumstances, having regard to the fact that we are dealing with something that is very important.  We are dealing with a serious infringement of civil liberties, the liberty of the individual, so serious that it has been necessary to set aside the Constitution in this regard in order to pass this Bill.  We should be looking at this under a microscope.  We should be saying: &ldquo;Is another 24 hours enough or another 25 hours?&rdquo;  It should not be just approached on the basis of: &ldquo;Oh, say seven days, it sounds a nice round figure.&rdquo;  The purpose of this amendment is to enable the House to look at this in a reasonable and critical way and say that if the argument of the Minister and of the Government that there has to be an extension is accepted let us look at that extension and say that we will give what is really necessary but not one hour more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment because together with the deprivation of the right of appeal to the courts, which is very serious deprivation of a civil right, this one, the removal of the right of the individual to his personal liberty, is probably, after the right to life itself, the most fundamental of all liberties in a free <Col N="541" /> society.  Taking it away from the individual in this way is arbitrary.  The Minister, being the final arbitrating authority has refused to give the safeguard of his own authority as to whether the freedom should be taken away.  To give this authority to a police officer seems to me to justify the use of the word &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a deprivation of freedom and many of us are clearly uncertain as to what is the purpose of the extension of seven days.  The Minister has been secretive about it.  He says that he has information which he cannot give us but which has convinced him that certain crimes would have been prevented if the seven days had existed and that certain moneys would have been recovered.  There is the device which was used in this House many years ago of the private session of Parliament, indeed used in Britain during the last war on a number of occasions, in which information of this kind was entrusted to the public representatives who respected the trust placed in them by the various authorities at the time.</P>
      <P>Obviously it would be very much more reassuring to us if we could have the arguments which persuaded the Minister.  Certainly in his old role as the liberal democrat in which we knew him in his days in Opposition, I certainly would have been prepared to trust him with a decision of this enormity in its implications.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately circumstances seem to have compelled him to take on the reverse role to that, which appears to me to be authoritarian and dictatorial. He must justify that to his own conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the evidence we have had so far, simply the advice which the Minister has received has compelled him to do this.  Taken together with the other things like the blowing up of the courthouse, the breakout of Portlaoise jail and the killing of the British Ambassador, these are simply a manifestation of an urban guerrilla situation which many countries have had continually since the last war and have dealt with in many ways, short of the suspension of this very important Article of the <Col N="542" /> Constitution on individual rights, section 40.</P>
    <P>The position here is that we do not know what will happen to a person within that seven days.  Could the Minister say that all the Garda want is that the person will be held <i>incommunicado,</i> that he has no access to his colleagues or fellow conspirators outside? Is it simply that, his name and address and little else but that?  Is the seven days intended to be a process of interrogation and is that going to be permissible?  Then there are the other points raised by practically everybody, access to legal and medical advice and to relatives.  Could we get assurances on all these points?  It would certainly make the situation quite different.  If we could have the information the Minister has it would be very valuable, and then if we could have the other information as to precisely what they want to do.  If they simply want to keep the person in isolation so that he cannot affect witnesses, I do not think that is a very sound argument.  The removal of the jury system and the establishment of the special courts answer that pretty well, and his colleagues are outside and intimidation can obviously go on.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of the extension of the seven days.  Is it for the purposes of interrogation?  If so, what limitations are to be placed on that, if any?  It is no good our saying afterwards, like the Stormont Government people: &ldquo;We are sorry it has all happened in our jails and that the British Army and the RUC behaved in the way they did.&rdquo;  It is our job, above all else, to see that our laws are so clearly stated that the complete meaning is visible to everybody and that there cannot be any doubt or equivocation or room for individuals to interpret them in their own way. In this kind of serious situation there can be room for no doubt whatever. We are taking rights away from an individual, and it could be any individual walking the streets at the present time, completely ignorant of anything to do with any subversive organisation.</P>
    <P>I recall reading that one of the people who were submitted to torture <Col N="543" /> is completely innocent to this day.  We are setting aside the whole judicial process of the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court in relation to taking away the existing freedom of an individual, a most elaborate judicial system which was built up over the years.  As a measure of our respect, each member of all the parties added to it and improved it. Each party lent to it the dignity of their acceptance of its impartiality.  It did not matter if Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour appointed the Judiciary; it was assumed they were independent.  All that is being set aside abruptly, peremptorily, and we are taking an individual citizen and imprisoning him for seven days without trial and, as far as I can see, without redress.  If he goes through this process of imprisonment, he leaves this prison at the end of a week an innocent man.  By the decision of a chief superintendent who has absolutely no judicial functions whatever he has been sentenced to seven days in jail, having committed no crime whatever. A completely innocent man is taken in off the streets and locked up in jail and possibly subjected to the most frightening interrogation.  I am leaving aside the possibilities of abusive interrogation, just simple interrogation in a place where day is turned into night, no windows, continuous, interrupted, the usual techniques of the pleasant man and the brutal man and so on.  Is this type of interrogation going to be permitted or is it simply the process of taking a man and, in order to see that he cannot communicate with his colleagues, keeping him <i>incommunicado</i> in a prison or Garda station or this famous &ldquo;other convenient place,&rdquo; simply for the mechanical purposes of isolating him from the community? Could the Minister please clarify some of those points?</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities in dealing with subversive or illegal organisations are dealing with, in the main, underground movements.  Naturally in that sense it is not easy to get to the root of the activities in question. I am of the opinion that there would be a large number of innocent people brought in, interrogated and separated <Col N="544" /> from their wives and families, for a period of seven days.  In dealing with such organisations it is quite possible that many innocent people could be brought in for that period of time.  The amendment in the names of Senators Lenihan and E. Ryan is one that should be accepted.  It is possible that at least 50 per cent of the people interrogated would be innocent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with an amendment which seeks to limit the period of detention to an extra day instead of an extra five days.  Senator Browne raised a number of matters which would be more relevant to the next amendment dealing with the question of access and that general area.  In so far as he raised matters relating to this amendment I will endeavour to deal with them.  It is not a question of innocent people suddenly finding a policeman tapping on their shoulder and saying: &ldquo;Come along with me.&rdquo;  The section quite clearly states that technically a person is innocent until he has been convicted of a crime.  The suggestion that people who have never come under the eye of the law or who have never been involved in anything subversive or illegal are likely to come within the Bill is an exaggeration.  The requirements are quite stringent in section 2. The arresting garda must suspect with reasonable cause certain specific things in relation to the Offences Against the State Act, scheduled offences and the other matters set out in the section. The guard must have reasonable cause for suspecting specific things.  To arrest a citizen on a whim or on the off chance that it might lead to something else would be quite improper and would be an unlawful arrest.  It would not get the protection which the Emergency resolution gives to this Bill.  It is important to keep our sense of proportion in that connection.</P>
      <P>Whether a person would be detained for the full seven days would depend on the particular situation.  It is important to remember that the section provides for a period not exceeding seven days.  The person might be released after five hours, 24 hours, three days.  It will depend on the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="545" /> A suggestion was made that, when this person has been brought to a police station or other convenient place, he will be subjected to all sorts of improper treatment such as interrogation without end, deprivation of light and so on.  That assumption is quite unfair to the tradition and practice of our police force.  It is a wrong analogy to argue that because it occurred in another jurisdiction we are in danger of it happening here.  It does not follow because our safeguards are much stronger.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly when people are brought in the Garda will be pleased to receive any information that may be forthcoming from these people. That could be one reason for bringing them in.  There may be documents to be found on them.  They will search them and if they find documents there will be questions to be asked about such documents.  The person brought in will be entirely within his rights in refusing to say a word.  The gardaí will be entitled to ask questions.  If they do not get answers, they will stop asking pointless questions.  Another reason for the detention of a person might be that the person would be suspected, with sound cause, by the gardaí of having been involved in a particular conspiracy which is under investigation. His activities in that connection when he was at large might be seen to have been impeding that investigation. Perhaps he might be destroying evidence, as the Senator said or colluding with witnesses to provide false alibis.  There could be numerous ways in which the detention of a person could assist the Garda.</P>
    <P>The length of detention, subject to the maximum of seven days, will depend on the particular situation.  It is assumed that every detention hereafter will be for seven days.  That is an unjustified assumption.  The maximum period is seven days.  There is no reason whatever for the gardaí to detain a person one second longer than is necessary.  I am satisfied that the maximum period of seven days is reasonable for the purposes required by the Garda.  I have no doubt that the general public are satisfied and that there is no apprehension that the practices <Col N="546" /> and procedures of our Garda will not be civilised and in accordance with proper standards.  There is nothing in their tradition or history up to now to justify even an assumption to the contrary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister although I do not agree with him in his determination to get the powers that he wants under this section. What I cannot understand is his refusal to make the slightest concession to the concern which so many people inside and outside this House have in regard to the powers sought.  If the Minister had been willing at earlier stages in this Bill to make some concession to the concern expressed on various points, then this section might have been more acceptable.  The seven days might have been acceptable if there were enough precautions written into the Bill to deal with those who were subject to the powers.  The Minister was not prepared to accept that there was a danger of an innocent witness being made the subject of this power, to detain someone for seven days.  Up to now he has not been willing to accept the precautions that were proposed in regard to people who were detained, in regard to notification of relations and so on, and now in regard to whether something slightly less than seven days would be acceptable. He sees one side of the coin perfectly.  He does not seem to think there is another side.  As no concession whatsoever seems to be coming from the Minister about any of the concerns there are about this Bill, we have no alternative but to press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to make it as clear as I could that I was postulating a position where an individual was arrested by a garda who felt that he had reasonable grounds for the arrest.  In the event, at the end of seven days if these reasonable grounds which he believed to be reasonable were shown to be unfounded this citizen has no redress for the fact that he has been imprisoned for seven days.  I am not blaming the garda for making a mistake.  I am saying he made a mistake and an innocent <Col N="547" /> citizen has been deprived of his liberty for that seven days by this process.  That seems to be a particularly serious implication of this.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it seems to be established that it is possible and permissible for interrogation to go on in the context of a member of the Garda assuming that the person was guilty, otherwise he would not have been brought in; he would have had reasonable cause, presumably, to think the person was guilty but he could be mistaken. However, he would be interrogating an individual on the assumption he was guilty and withholding information. If a member of the Garda who was interrogating somebody, say, in connection with the assassination of the British Ambassador felt that the person had information which he was not disclosing and he had seven days in which to carry out this interrogation, I submit we are assuming a level of tolerance and patience on the part of members of the Garda which I could not claim if I found myself in the position of that garda.  If I was certain the person was guilty I could not be trusted to ask questions for seven days and not get angry if he did not confirm my suspicion, putting it at its mildest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that the majority of the gardaí are the remarkably controlled people the Minister assumes them to be, could we not, at the same time, allow that some of them&mdash;a minority of them, which is the case I have made all along&mdash;have not got this measure of self-control?  One of this minority could be put in charge of a situation where there is an innocent person whom the garda genuinely believes is guilty and he is given seven days in which to question that person. The garda does not need to lay a hand on that individual, it depends on the individual's personality how easily he is frightened.  Some of us are more easily frightened than others, some of us could take a good beating for a long time and not collapse.  Other people could be frightened simply by being put into jail for 24 hours, never mind seven days.  To that situation one must add the possibility of some <Col N="548" /> of these other terrible methods of interrogation being used which we learned about from the recent Strasbourg situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there are safeguards against this kind of thing happening.  I am talking about the minimum of this, that is, simply questioning a person for, say, six, 12 or 24 hours a day, intermittently, with people coming in in relays.  Is there a minimum number of hours, a maximum number of hours or an average number of hours laid down?  What are the safeguards which can be observed to prevent a totally innocent person being subjected to the dreadful possibilities of being taken in, <i>bona fide</i>, by a garda who genuinely believes the person is guilty but, in fact, the person is completely innocent?  What are the safeguards which the Minister can rely on in those situations?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to refer the Deputy to the section. After 48 hours the consent of a chief superintendent is necessary.  At that stage, the intervention of a senior officer is provided for.  There must be reasonable assumption and a chief superintendent must be satisfied it would be justifiable for him to intervene. That is a safeguard in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hypothesis posed by Senator Browne is so unreal that it answers itself.  He says that it would be terribly wrong to have an innocent person subjected to questioning for seven days and I agree it would be a most unfortunate result, if at the end of seven days the garda's suspicions&mdash;we assume they were <i>bona fide</i>&mdash;turned out to be unfounded.  I cannot see that if Senator Browne fears intensive interrogation for seven days that the lack of foundation for these suspicions would not become apparent much earlier.  Nobody would suggest that once that position would become clear that the guards would, pointlessly, keep somebody arrested on a <i>bona fide</i> suspicion which subsequently turned out to be unfounded.  This is something which would be established early on. No doubt, somebody in that category would be co-operating with the gardaí from the moment he arrived in the <Col N="549" /> police station and would disclose his hand to the fullest extent.  He would remove the suspicion which caused him to be arrested in the first instance.  I consider it so unlikely as to be an unreal argument, to suggest that such a person would have to spend seven days, pointlessly, in custody.  It is something the gardaí would establish very early on in the case of such a person because total co-operation must be assumed to be forthcoming from a totally innocent person.  If that co-operation was forthcoming, the person's <i>bona fides</i> could be quickly established and the intervention with his liberty brought to an end.</P>
    <P>There is a risk of any subject, in any situation, being deprived of his liberty for reasons which subsequently turn out to be unfounded.  We can have cases of people remanded in custody by the courts and the charges subsequently being dismissed.  They <Col N="550" /> were brought on a reasonable suspicion which subsequently turned out to be unfounded.  Therefore, it would not be a unique experience for a citizen to be deprived of his liberty under this section on grounds which subsequently turn out to be groundless. We hope this would be extremely rare but the remedy essentially would be in the hands of the innocent citizen to quickly and completely establish his <i>bona fides</i>.  It would hardly be suggested that the gardaí should take him in and refuse to talk to him and keep him for seven days not giving him an opportunity to clear himself.  That could be one consequence of the implied criticism that to question a person in detention would be wrong.  If the person wants to reply he may do so; if he wants to stay silent he may do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) A person in custody under subsection (3) of this section shall be entitled to have access to and consult a solicitor of his choosing at least once a day and to a registered medical practitioner at least <Col N="551" /> once every 48 hours.  In the case of a minor in custody under subsection (3), the Gardaí shall permit reasonable access to his parents or guardians.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with access to a prisoner.  I have convinced myself that I am quite an innocent in this matter because I have &ldquo;self-detailed&rdquo; myself for quite some time now to take care of this amendment and otherwise to fulfil a commitment.  I feel a certain amount of frustration because I wonder if there is any point in pursuing the commitment.  Earlier Senator Robinson said that there is no likelihood of the Dáil being recalled to deal with matters arising from this legislation.  That highlights the futility of pursuing matters other than to place on the record the intention of what is being prescribed. Maybe that is not a bad thing, but I believe that sometime soon a look should be taken at this situation.  I can understand the restriction the Minister finds himself under in even being amenable to or conforming with what he said earlier about being prepared to accept reasonable amendments. I hold that my amendment can be safely described as reasonable, but the Dáil would not be recalled for that.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the purpose of the exercise.  At the same time, I would hope that the entreatments in the discussion of this amendment will have an effect on the minds not only of the Minister, but on the other members of the Cabinet who brought in this legislation.  In this amendment I am seeking to obtain no more than what is in international conventions dealing with persons in detention, that is, access to a legal representative and a doctor.  Of course, there is the other point in my amendment concerning a minor.</P>
    <P>This situation can or may have become confused.  I am not quite clear about the necessity for pursuance because I understand from my brief reading of the newspapers that some concession has been indicated in this regard in the other House.  If this is co.  it is very good.</P>
    <P>Earlier we heard the Minister for <Col N="552" /> Lands expressing what he described as the rights of a prisoner or, if you like, the rights of a person arrested. Bearing in mind the system which is in existence and knowing that the Minister has no power to issue instructions to the Director of Public Prosecutions I still believe that it would be very worthwhile for the Minister to spell out a prisoner's entitlements under this type of legislation, his right of access to a legal representative, a doctor and a relative.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the point which I have made in my amendment about the situation affecting a minor.  There are quite a number of people described as minors involving themselves in the difficulties which beset this 32 counties of Ireland.  I could envisage a situation where a minor, in this part of Ireland, could be arrested and taken away.  The parents arising from a natural anxiety to know where the boy or girl is, may go to the Garda saying they want to report their boy or girl as a missing person.  You do not have to dwell on this too much to realise the dilemma that would exist there, the concern and the eventual embarrassment if it turns out to be something else.  All this is concerned with access to a prisoner.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is safe to take into consideration what Father Denis Faul said one Sunday a few weeks ago when he talked about the results of our Government's representation to the Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg regarding the mishandling of people in the Six Counties.  He made the point that the technique was something like this: a person can be arrested and ill-treated on the first day and by the time he is released there are no marks on him, therefore, it is not sufficient for the Minister or anybody else to say that there is access to the court for redress.  Maltreatment has to be proved.  Bearing in mind that our successive Governments found it necessary to pursue the case about the ill-treatment of prisoners in the Six Counties, we should not fall into a trap where we can be described as being two-faced in this regard.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>A clear indication should be given <Col N="553" /> as to a person's entitlements when under arrest.  He should also have access to a solicitor, a doctor and a relative.  I have already said that what has happened in the other House may have taken care of what I am submitting, but I have not to hand what was eventually decided upon and consequently I am pursuing my amendment.</P>

      <P>I strongly support what Senator Mullen has said on this amendment.  I will develop a point which was stressed by Senator Mullen, that is the position concering the position of a minor.  There is no greater heartbreak for an average parent in Ireland than when he knows that his child is in the grip of a misleading ideology which involves the expression of violence in a most misguided way. Of course, that parent should question himself as to what criticisms he has made of the institutions which have inculcated and which have sustained such an attitude.</P>
      <P>When teenagers are missing from their homes there is a great deal of fear and uncertainty as to where they might be.  It is possible now that such a person may disappear for a period of up to seven days.  What kind of feelings will arise in a home where such a person is missing?  It might arise in the mind of the parent that the person may be involved in the commission of an act of violence in any part of this island, or may be involved in any kind of gathering.  This is adding to the uncertainty, the fear and the terror in the minds of parents.  Therefore, that category of person is extremely vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might also happen that a minor, by association with other minors, might become suspect.  In that event a crucial point in the sociology of law arises.  It is a point which I have made very often in this House without very great success.  The point is that conviction before the court is not in itself the full totality of stigmatisation.  If it is know that somebody was missing for seven days, as it might be known if the parents reported the person as missing, and later it was established that the person had been held in a prison or convenient place, the very <Col N="554" /> fact that one had been detained is, in itself, a stigmatisation socially.  It is the setting apart of a young person.</P>
    <P>In discussing other amendments people such as Senators Mullen, Browne and Robinson have asked for these procedures of access to solicitors, doctors and relatives to be made explicit.  We keep returning to two or three different things.  It is said that the normal sources of access will apply.  If the normal sources of access are so unproblematic why can they not be explicitly stated once and for all? Again, it has been said that by making them explicit one is somehow or other casting a slur on members of the force. That is dishonest.  What we are asking for is that legal procedure and procedures for defence of the rights of the individual should be made explicit in such a way that the people who are involved in security and the people who are the subjects of it are absolutely certain as to the law.  Certainty in law is established in legislation. Where, as a principle of jurisprudence, certainty can be written into the law, is not well substituted for by intention, or by the suggestion that later on your rights can be established.</P>
    <P>Either of these two latter strategies are not adequate substitutes for regular explicit procedures and if the law is being extended in this way&mdash; as it undoubtedly will be&mdash;it was never more important that an explicit code of what is possible to a person so detained be written into the law. I know that when Senator Mullen is asking for this amendment he is speaking for the vast majority of trade unionists in this country.  I, as a trade unionist, want this code.  We want such a code not only for this legislation&mdash;we are very careful here &mdash;but we want it for legislation for all aspects of detention and investigation in general.  Even though this debate might be becoming tedious for some now, it would be a generous response if the Minister gives us an indication that such a code is forthcoming for law in general and not only for this law.</P>

      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan and I have tabled amendment No. 9 which is dealt with in principle by <Col N="555" /> the amendment which has been moved by Senator Michael Mullen and supported by Senator Higgins.  As far as we are concerned, like the two previous Senators, we feel very strongly that this matter of principle should be fully aired and debated here.  As far as the law is concerned, on the Minister's own admission when replying to the debate here on the emergency motion on Wednesday, 1st September, at columns 203 and 204 of the Official Report, he said quite specifically &ldquo;that the law was in a vague state&rdquo;.  Later I will be quoting <i>in extenso</i> about this.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that the law should be &ldquo;in a vague state&rdquo; on a matter as fundamental as this and, as far as our party are concerned, we fully support the point of view expressed by Senator Mullen and Senator Higgins.  For that reason, in order to ensure clarity of debate, we will withdraw amendment No. 9 and fully support amendments Nos. 7 and 8.</P>
      <P>We have argued at length about the whole principle of the introduction of this legislation and the declaration of a state of national emergency and I do not propose to go over that argument again.  I strongly support, and we will argue this point out at some length, the argument that matters contained in these amendments are fundamental in regard to an individual's right, so fundamental that they should be made part of the basic law of the State, not just in regard to this legislation but in regard to any legislation. Senator Robinson has already referred to this aspect and said it might be more appropriate to other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister does not feel inclined to accede to the amendments on this legislation, I would ask that guarantees be given that the sort of rights envisaged in these amendments be written into our permanent law because, although we have disagreed with the Minister on a fundamental purpose of the Bill, the extension of detention and the abrogation of the Constitution so as to extend detention from two days to seven days, the Minister may possibly have a point in <Col N="556" /> doing that.  We disagree with him.  We think that the Government have committed a gross misjudgment in introducing this measure at all but the Minister may, according to his lights, think that it is necessary for some reason that he and the Government have conjured up to extend detention <i>incommunicado</i> from two days to seven days.  What we want to ensure by these amendments is that, while such detention is taking place it should not be <i>incommunicado</i> and that, while such detention, or any detention, in this civilised State is taking place, there should be availability to a medical adviser of the detainee's choice, a legal adviser of detainee's choice or a relative.  In the case of a minor, and this has been referred to by Senator Mullen, access to parent or guardian should be written in.</P>
    <P>There is no point in suggesting, as the Minister has suggested, that the ordinary law of the land obtain in regard to these rights.  It may seem extraordinary, but there is no specific law on this aspect.  If constitutional rights are suspended and there is no specific law it means that as far as anybody in detention is concerned&mdash; this may not be the intention&mdash;without any legal instrument and without the protection of the Constitution he has no rights in regard to access of relative, solicitor or medical practitioner. These are the facts.</P>
    <P>I am a believer in the plain meaning of the section and, if there is statutory provision giving such rights, I challenge the Minister to produce that provision.  There is no such provision. In the Constitution there is a general right under Article 40 and there is, of course, a right under the Convention on Human Rights, to which we are a subscribing party under Article 6, but we are going to derogate from the Convention on Human Rights shortly, as the Government have stated, and the Constitution as far as this Bill is concerned is suspended and there is no existing law, whatever the practice may be, specifying that a detained person has the rights being sought in our amendments and in Senator Mullen's amendment. If the Minister declines to write <Col N="557" /> these into the law we will have a Private Members' Bill here seeking to have them incorporated into general law.  This is a matter that needs to be rectified because these powers of detention are being taken by the Government.  The vagueness is clearly shown in the reference to which I referred earlier.  At column 203 of the Official Report of Wednesday 1st September, Senator Robinson said:</P>
    <P>Could the Minister clarify whether the person held for the seven days would have his legal adviser present on being questioned by the Garda?</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooney: Whatever rights he has now to have his legal adviser present, he will have under the new Bill.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Robinson: The Minister is aware that there is an unresolved point about the right to a legal adviser?</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooney: If it is an unresolved point this Bill does not purport to resolve it.  Whatever the law is at the moment will continue to be the law.</P>
    <P>Mr. Yeats: Does the Minister not know what the law is?  The Minister must know what the position is.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply here is very relevant:</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooney: There can be occasions when the law is not resolved and when the legal position cannot be explicitly defined.  There are certain legal situations which stem from the common law which is a mixture of judicial precedent and custom.  Over the years as these customs grow, judicial decisions are given in succession, putting glosses on earlier positions.  The contemporary situation changes.  The circumstances in which an earlier decision was given by the court changed with the passage of time and the legal decision which was relevant to a particular period might not have precisely the same relevance to another period.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I say the <Col N="558" /> legal position is unresolved and the law may be and often is uncertain. Now they are the Minister for Justice's own words.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Robinson: Would the Minister be prepared to ensure that legal advisers could be present when there was a questioning of a person during&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: There will be ample opportunity to explore this at a later date, and perhaps it might be left to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is the later date we have here now.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cooney: We can have a Committee Stage debate on the Emergency Powers Bill when we come to it.  What I am dealing with are the broad principles of some of broad criticisms made of the powers proposed to be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>What is very relevant to a constructive debate here is what the Minister then stated, and I quote him again:</P>
    <P>It is in that context that I say the legal position is unresolved and that the law may be and often is uncertain.</P>
    <P>That is just not good enough in the context of a situation where we are extending the period of detention from 48 hours to seven days.  We are suspending the Constitution in regard to the operation of that detention.  The Minister says there may or may not be the right of admissibility on the part of a legal adviser.  The law is uncertain, is unresolved.  It is not good enough that the law should be unresolved and uncertain in this area.  As the Minister rightly stated there&mdash;he is being very frank and honest, I will say that much for him&mdash;it is all a matter of a judicial interpretation of rights.  But that judicial interpretation of rights in so far as this Bill is concerned is suspended because the Constitution does not operate.  The Constitution does not operate and there is no specific statute to cover the situation.</P>
    <P>Having said that, is it not a very rational stance on the part of the Oireachtas, particularly on the part of the Seanad here today, to suggest in <Col N="559" /> the amendments before the House that this position be rectified?  If we rectify it in the manner suggested in Senator Mullen's two amendments, Nos. 7 and 8&mdash;the first one guarantees access to a solicitor of the detainee's choosing and access to a registered medical practitioner&mdash;in the case of the solicitor at least once a day; in the case of a registered medical practitioner at least once every 48 hours; and, in the case of a minor, whom we had not included in our amendment, to permit access to parents.  Amendment No. 8 is to ensure that the Garda should inform within an hour of arrest the next-of-kin of the person being detained.</P>
    <P>It is high time this type of basic guarantee was written into legislation. Heretofore, it may not have been fundamental, in that the limitation of 48 hours obtained.  But in a situation where we are going to have detention of the order of seven days, the period is relative.  People may say there is no difference in principle between 24 hours or seven days.  Of course there is a difference.  There is a difference in practicality between being held <i>incommunicado</i> for 24 hours, or 48 hours and being held <i>incommunicado</i> for seven days.  The very fact that the extension of detention is being sought highlights and accentuates the urgency of these amendments.</P>
    <P>If there is to be any attempt by the Government to show some degree of humanity and concern in this matter, I suggest that it be in the area of these amendments.  If for some legal technical or drafting reason the Minister may not think it appropriate to incorporate amendments of this kind in this legislation I would say, as a very minimum concession to the basic aspirations which I am certain all right-thinking people would feel in this matter, the Minister should give a guarantee to this House that the principle of these amendments will be incorporated fairly soon in some other appropriate legislation.  That, at least, or an assurance at minimum of that, would be required now that we have highlighted this matter, on the Minister's own admission, a serious matter about which, he says, the legal position is unresolved and the law is uncertain. <Col N="560" /> It may have been a position which was glossed over in the past because of the 48-hour limitation on detention but it is one that can no longer be glossed over, in view of the serious nature of a seven day's detention and the further serious aspect of a rearresting procedure following on the seven days', to provide for a continuing type of seven days' detention. We will have more about that on another amendment.</P>
    <P>But, in this type of new situation, surely the guarantees sought in these amendments should be written into this legislation.  It is not a measure that would require a lot of drafting. We are quite clear about what we require.  The Minister will say, I am sure, that it has, as a matter of practice, been done anyway.  Surely we can get that assurance from the Minister, that if he cannot incorporate it into this Bill&mdash;which I press very strongly that he do&mdash;he will, with his advisers as a matter of urgency, prepare legislation in the form of a very simple Bill to come before the Oireachtas in the next few months, guaranteeing these very basic rights.</P>

      <P>I should like to support these amendments in the name of Senator Michael Mullen.  I am glad that Senators Lenihan and Ryan have withdrawn their amendment, which covered the same ground, in favour of Senator Mullen's amendments.  It is important, in view of the powers given in this legislation, as a matter of legislative policy, to write in the right of access to a solicitor and to a medical practitioner.  This is not to suggest that the medical practitioner must visit each day.  But there is a right that can be exercised by the person detained on suspicion that they may be involved in or may have information about the commission or future commission of a scheduled offence, or an offence under the Offences Against the State Act.  I do not want to dwell at length on the argument, or any arguments that have been put, both on the emergency motion and on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I would like, if I might, to try to resolve a little this unresolved point about the right to a legal adviser.  One <Col N="561" /> thing about debating legislation of this sort, it does encourage one to do some homework.  I would welcome some response from the Minister on this point.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, the latest case on the question of right to legal representation is a case on which judgment was given by the Supreme Court on July 22nd, 1976, the case of the State (Healy and Foran) <i>v</i>.  the Governors of St. Patrick's Institution.  District Justice Eileen Kennedy, District Justice Thomas O'Reilly and Others.  It involved two juveniles and their right to legal aid before the courts.  The majority view of the judges, in that case&mdash;and I have not read the judgment of the majority; I have read only the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny who supported the quashing of the orders of the District Justice, because there was no legal aid to these two juveniles&mdash;appears to have been that there is a right to legal representation in such cases, like juveniles, before the courts.  The judgment I have is that of Mr. Justice Kenny who argues, on a different line, that there is not a fair trial in those circumstances if the juvenile has not been told of his right to legal aid and has not had representation. I should like to quote from part of the judgment, on page 7, where it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 38.s.1 of the Constitution provides: &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo;.  This is to be compared with Article 40.s.4(1) which reads: &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The use of the words &ldquo;in due course&rdquo; are an echo of provisions in the Constitution of the United States of America which, through Coke's interpretation, come from Magna Carta.  They emphasise that a trial in strict accordance with law may not be a fair one and when the Court is satisfied that this is the position, the proceedings should be quashed by <i>certiorari</i>.  It would be foolish to attempt to lay down what constitutes a fair trial because its requisites change from generation to generation.  Thus, for hundreds of <Col N="562" /> years a prisoner charged with felony was not allowed the assistance of counsel and our judicial ancestors thought that, despite this, he was getting a fair trial.  In every case the question must be whether what is complained of was a procedural irregularity or a defect which had the result that the accused did not get a fair trial judged by the standards at the time when the case is heard.  If the High Court comes to the conclusion that the trial was not fair, it should grant <i>certiorari</i>.  The cases in which this State side order may be granted cannot and should not be limited by reference to any formula or final statement of principle.  The strength of this great remedy is its flexibility.</P>
    <P>That is a very important articulation of the criteria of a fair trial and a very significant judgment and I am glad to have the opportunity of putting it on the record of this House, that is, some resolving of right to legal representation in a trial on a charge, and the viewpoint of either right to legal representation or what constitutes a fair trial.  It is a very important case and I am sure it will be commented on in due course when it is published in the law reports.</P>
    <P>We are not actually talking about representation with a view to trial but about the rights of a person detained on suspicion for a maximum of seven days.  Obviously, that point could not have come before the courts&mdash;maybe it could under the 48 hours, I am subject to correction on this&mdash;but to my knowledge there has not been a case of that sort to resolve the rights of the suspected person of access to a legal adviser.  If we wait for resolution by the courts, we wait a considerable time; we wait until an action has been brought by a person in circumstances and there has been a hearing before the High Court and a judgment given on it.</P>
    <P>What I support is the other way of ensuring the right, that is, by active, positive legislative policy.  The arguments have been put, the case has been made and I would ask the Minister realistically to ensure that at the first opportunity the right of access <Col N="563" /> to a legal adviser, medical practitioner and the knowledge of next of kin of the whereabouts of a person detained be contained in legislation.  There is a reason for putting it into this Bill because we are talking about the rights of a suspected person detained for seven days.  We are not talking about the right to legal representation with a view to going for trial but about the right of a person if he is being questioned.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we can be clear as to what is meant by the word &ldquo;question&rdquo; in section 2 of this Bill.  The fact that it is inserted in the Bill, does it mean question which goes beyond the questioning allowed by the Judges' Rules?  It is not the same as questioning under section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, where a person could be required to answer the questions or else incur the penalties of failure or refusal to answer them.  It is now clarified that section 52 is suspended for so long as section 30 is suspended.  What is meant by &ldquo;question&rdquo; in these circumstances and how much questioning can there be over the seven days?  Is it not totally desirable as a matter of legislative policy to write in a right to access to a legal adviser to a suspected person detained in those circumstances?  Is that one of the basic guarantees of our system?  I do not see what is the reason for refusing that right.</P>
    <P>I am certain that whatever about the right to legal representation with a view to going to court on a serious charge, the question of a right to a legal adviser by somebody suspected, detained and kept out of circulation for a period of seven days is not resolved. There may be the latent possibility of mounting a case on it, but it is certainly not a matter of law at the moment and it should be a matter of legislative policy.  Therefore, I would like to support the amendments in the name of Senator Mullen.</P>
    <P>As Senator Lenihan has said, we are up against the reality that the Dáil has risen until the 20th October, that it is most unlikely to be recalled and we have to accept that the <Col N="564" /> powers of this House are limited by that practical reality.  I join with the other Senators in saying that if the Minister is not prepared, for that reason, to accept this amendment he should ensure that legislation is brought in at the earliest opportunity to express this concern as a matter of legislative policy and not leave it as an unresolved point which some individual sometime is going to have to resolve in order for all the people who may be detained under the section to have the rights which they should have of access to their lawyer and, if necessary, to a medical practitioner and knowledge to the next of kin.</P>

      <P>Very well, I accept that.  If the relative is not made aware of the whereabouts of the prisoner, I hold that is equivalent to kidnapping.  The State sets out to condemn and treat kidnappers in the proper way.  Nobody has a right to kidnap, whether it be an individual, a group or the State.  There should be no indication of kidnapping here.  This is why I plead that when a person is arrested the relatives should be told. There should be no difficulty about this.  I agree that kidnapping is very abhorrent but we should not practice what abhorrent people do.  We are living in a democracy and we should operate like one.  We should at least acquaint the relatives of the person who has been arrested, not kidnapped. Otherwise it means we kidnap them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is a pity that the Minister does not appear to appreciate how disturbed people are by this extension from two to seven days and its implications. The Minister gave a rather sardonic reply when I asked if it was intended that there should be interrogation.  He said that you do not expect the gardaí to sit and say nothing to him for seven days.  The Minister then went on to leave me in no doubt whatever of the two purposes of the extension to seven days of custody.  They are, first, the isolation of the individual from his comrades and, secondly, the purpose of interrogation.  It is on that point I am particularly worried.  I asked the Minister about that; he replied that there were safeguards but did not say what they were beyond the reference to the chief superintendent on the second day.  That means that the man on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh day would have no safeguards if the gardaí wrongly assumed that he was guilty and kept questioning him until the time expired and they had to release him.  Therefore, as far as I can see, there are no safeguards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for this reason I believe that the individual in custody should be given access to his legal adviser and, if he wishes, to his medical adviser, if he is ill, perhaps, a diabetic or a cardiac case or an emotionally troubled sort of individual.  This is the right of any individual who is innocent of any crime.  Nothing has been proven about this man.  He may be guilty but I am concerned about the person who is completely innocent and who may have an illness and should have the right that he would have if he was outside the walls of the prison or the Garda station, to see his doctor if he felt he needed him and, above all, the right to have access to his legal advisers.  The ignorance of the ordinary individual about his legal rights is notorious.  What should he do?  What should he say?  What must he say?  What may he not say?  In what situation is he incriminating his family?  What he does after he has had legal advice is his own business but he must have a right to that legal <Col N="566" /> advice in the situation in which he finds himself.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to legal advice, the right to see his medical adviser, the right to a visit from his relatives adds to the enormity of the deprivation of liberty already forced on him by the extension from two to seven days' custody.  To have these rights are real safeguards.  The chief superintendent may make a judgment about the activities of his subordinates but this still leaves one without any safeguards thereafter unless one has access to one's legal adviser and to one's relatives.</P>
    <P>I am postulating the case of an innocent citizen for the time being as I do not have a general view about guilt and criminality.  There are many individuals who are proven innocent even after the Garda take them in for questioning and genuinely believe them guilty.  I am talking about the innocent person who finds himself in custody, totally ignorant of his rights, not knowing what he might say or what he should say or not say, and in that way is deprived of what must be a fundamental right.</P>
    <P>Most of us have read the difficulties which counsel have had in recent months in getting access to those who have retained them.  It appears as if there are anomalies, that there is confusion in the minds of the police and the prison authorities, for allowing legal advisers to have access to prisoners.  That was bad enough when the period of detention was two days but we now have the situation where the seven days' detention could become an eternity to an individual isolated in a hostile environment, where he is assumed to be guilty of a crime of which he is innocent but of which the Garda genuinely believe he is guilty. One does not have to have much imagination to understand the positive terror of an individual helpless in this kind of situation, knowing that he is innocent and that he may say something which innocently incriminates him.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that we should have to put down an amendment about the minors.  It is a horrific proposal that any youngster should be <Col N="567" /> taken in and isolated from his relatives and kept <i>incommunicado</i> for a minute longer than is absolutely necessary. Speaking as a father and understanding the agony of a mother or a father in this sort of situation, it seems to me extraordinary that it is not written into our legal system that the Garda must immediately contact the nearest available relative in order that the young person may have access to that relative and in that way to mitigate to some extent the horror of a young person who finds himself in prison.</P>
    <P>This is a final forlorn plea to the Minister to try to introduce into this dreadful legislation, this dreadful proposal of extending to seven days the incarceration of an innocent individual, the humanitarian request that he have access to his legal advisers.  As a person who has worried all the time about what would happen to a person in this situation and who has been concerned about the dangers of interrogation, even question-and-answer interrogation in which there is no malice, I am aware that the effect that this could have emotionally on any innocent individual for a period of seven days is incalculable.  Therefore I join with other Senators in asking the Minister to give us an undertaking that at the first opportunity he will see that this assurance is given and put on the Statute Books.  I shall quote the provisions of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. This is from a resolution adopted in 1955 by the First United Congress on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders.  It is Rule 91 of section (c) which deals with the Rights of Prisoners under Arrest or awaiting trial.  I quote:</P>
    <P>An untried prisoner shall be allowed to be visited and treated by his own doctor or dentist if there is reasonable ground for his application and he is able to pay any expenses incurred.</P>
    <P>Rule 92 states:</P>
    <P>An untried prisoner shall be allowed to inform immediately his family of his detention and shall be given all reasonable facilities for communicating with his family and <Col N="568" /> friends, and for receiving visits from them, subject only to such restrictions and supervision as are necessary in the interests of the administration of justice and of the security and good order of the institution.</P>
    <P>The other power is that he should have right of access to his legal advisers. These are prison rules which were generally accepted as long ago as 25 years.  It is about time that we followed suit.</P>

      <P>When Senator Mullen moved the amendment he drew my attention to the fact that I am on record as saying that I would consider any amendment that was reasonable. I made that statement and I stand over it.  An amendment, to be reasonable, must comply with some criteria acceptable to me, the person proposing the legislation.  What Senator Mullen or I consider reasonable might be two different things.  To be acceptable an amendment must provide for something which is not there by law, that is, not just to add words for the sake of adding them or declaring something which is already part of our legal code.  It must improve the legislation going through the House.</P>

    <P>The first point I wish to make with regard to this group of amendments is that we must consider if they are necessary.  Secondly, we must ask if they contain something which should warn us that the position which has obtained up to now has been unsatisfactory, defective or detrimental in any way to the citizen's rights or his position.  I have no doubt that the rights sought to be achieved in these amendments are part of the personal rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Senator Lenihan quoted what I said on Second Stage as indicating there was some vagueness about the existence of these rights&mdash;that the dimension of the rights and the extent of their applicability and the cases in which they would apply, had not been defined.  In answer to Senator Yeats, who castigated me for not knowing the law, I explained how a situation could arise where the law might not be available to be known.  I want to clear that point.  What is beyond <Col N="569" /> doubt is that our Constitution, Article 40.3.1º states:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I am advised that a person's right as a citizen is a right to legal advice.  There is also a right to bodily integrity.  That would contain a right to medical advice, when bodily integrity had been infringed.  Consequently, I see no need to write into this statute something that is already part of our law.  It is quite clearly part of our law, a constitutional right.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that we should attempt to define these rights in statutory form.  That would be going backwards because the strength of the rights contained in the Constitution lies in the flexibility of their definition allowed to a court in interpreting them in a particular case in which a court's decision may be sought.  Mr. Justice Kenny, in referring to the entitlement to seek <i>certiorari</i> said&mdash;this would be the type of order which would be sought in order to establish these rights:</P>
    <P>The cases in which this State-side order may be granted cannot and should not be limited by reference to any formula or final statement of principle.  The strength of this State remedy is its flexibility.</P>
    <P>We would undo that strength of that great remedy if we attempted to define in a statutory form what is guaranteed by the Constitution.  The strength and protection for citizens lies in its flexibility.  Any citizen who is aggrieved is entitled to seek redress in the courts and to have his rights determined in accordance with his particular situation in the light of his Constitutional rights as determined by the courts.  That is what the courts are for and nobody can complain of that procedure.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we were to attempt to devise a statutory formula to set out these rights it would be found that there is no such thing as unqualified rights.  The individual <Col N="570" /> citizen has rights, the State has rights, the people have rights in relation to individual members of the community, and legislation must try to hold the balance between these two sets of rights.</P>
    <P>It could be an extremely pointless exercise to attempt to define rights which could not possibly cover every conceivable situation that might arise. In attempting to do so, one might limit the flexibility which the present position has.  The strength of this great remedy&mdash;the remedy to seek one's rights&mdash;is its flexibility.  Those were Mr. Justice Kenny's words. That is the strength of the present position&mdash;that the rights are part of the body of personal rights guaranteed by our Constitution.  At any time, if there is an infringement of those rights or if a citizen feels he is not being granted his fundamental rights to the extent he thinks he should, or that they are being qualified in a way which he thinks is unjustified and beyond the reasonable qualification&mdash;there is no such thing as an absolute or unqualified right&mdash; his remedy is to go to the courts. That is what the courts are for and the person's right to do that is not taken away by this statute or by the fact that it is passed pursuant to the emergency resolution.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that what Senators are seeking&mdash;it was also sought in the Lower House&mdash;is already available.  I have stated this categorically and I repeat it in this House.  It is available by virtue of the provisions of our Constitution.  The exact dimension of those rights has not been defined and it is proper that they should remain undefined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P>It would take about three years to define them.  A person cannot seek <i>certiorari</i> without a court order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree completely with Senator Robinson in this regard. There have been instances where persons have sought remedies where they were denied their constitutional rights, as alleged, and they got remedy the next day.  They even got it the same afternoon.  The reports of <Col N="571" /> the courts are littered with such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong.  They cannot under this Bill, under Article 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had this already.  The immunity given by Article 28 is that it saves the Bill from constitutional challenge.  What would be at issue here would be whether there is a constitutional right to legal advice, that would be an entirely separate matter and could be the subject of constitutional challenge.  That right is not excluded by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The position is that in the law as it stands at present, the Constitution gives these rights.  Of that I am well satisfied. What is being asked now is that these rights should be defined.  I argue that so far as a citizen is concerned he is in a superior position by not having these rights defined, because the flexibility to which Mr. Justice Kenny referred would be missing.  The position at present is superior to that which this amendment seeks to achieve.  The rights of a citizen in regard to these matters is no less and no more than it was before this measure was introduced.  I am satisfied that those rights exist under our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point about which there has been much speculation is that suddenly these rights will be impeded. I must dispute that.  Since 1939, we have had legislation on our Statute Book which provides for detention of up to 48 hours.  I am not aware of any case where these rights were not made available to persons who sought them. It is inconceivable that, if there had been such a denial of rights during that time, no litigation would have resulted.  It is a fair deduction to make that the rights were made available and that will continue to be the position. Should they be refused to a person, or should a person be impeded in the extent to which he has an access to his rights, then he has his remedy before the courts under our Constitution. The courts can determine, in accordance with the circumstances of that particular case, what the person's <Col N="572" /> rights are, and whether he has been given them in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied, and I am so advised, that the legal position is quite clear under our Constitution. Under the Constitution, the rights which these amendments seek to write in are part of our existing law.  I personally think that is a better way to have this position than, as I say, to attempt to define them.  For that reason, I am not prepared to give the guarantee to initiate the drafting of legislation to try to define these rights. This would be a preliminary matter for consideration to which I will give thought.  Would it be better to define them, or is it better to leave them as they are in our Constitution guaranteed and inviolate and the courts there to enforce them?  Is that position preferable to attempting their definition in statutory form?  As of now, I am not satisfied that it would be an improvement to attempt to define them.</P>
    <P>That is certainly a preliminary question that I would have to resolve first. That would take a considerable amount of study.  As I say, my mind at the moment is leaning to the opinion that it is better to rely on our Constitution as it stands, and on our courts to interpret the Constitution for us.  I want to assure this House, as I assured the other House, that I am advised quite categorically that the rights which these amendments seek to introduce in this legislation already exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ignoring the advice the Minister has got but we should face reality about this matter. We talk about people's rights but an insufficient number of people realise their rights.  A very small number of people understand their rights and entitlements under various Acts.  There is nothing wrong in a democracy, especially under an open Government, in spelling out a person's rights.  That is very important.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say one has recourse to law.  This is after the event.  It takes money to go to law.  It would save the State money, and also the appellant.  if a person's rights were <Col N="573" /> spelled out.  What is wrong with telling people their rights in what is described as a democracy?</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister dealt with some of the points I was concerned about.  He adverted to the right to legal advice and the right to medical advice.  It may have been an omission on his part&mdash;I am reasonably satisfied when the Minister's response is put on record because it whets your appetite a little to say the least of it&mdash;but he did not make any mention of the point I have been making about access to a relative.  I said next of kin. He said relative.  He did not make any remark about the point I made with regard to minors being apprehended and their parents thinking they had been kidnapped or were missing. There is the question of the State not indulging in kidnapping as compared with a person or a body indulging in kidnapping.  These are matters I would like to have dealt with here.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the fact that it is too late to do anything about this.  Amendments are futile now because common sense tells me&mdash;I take the point very ably expressed by my colleague Senator Robinson&mdash;the Minister will not recall the Dáil.  He could make a declaration of his good intention to do something in connection with these salient matters. Otherwise the function of this House is meaningless and participation in a debate of this kind is meaningless.  I do not see anything wrong in spelling out the fact that a person has a legal right to consult with a solicitor or doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also an entitlement on the part of the State that apprehends the person to make it known to the relative where that person is, especially if a person is a minor.  The person may not be a minor.  He could be the father of a family who did not tell his wife or anybody else that he was involved in anything.  He keeps it to himself, and suddenly he is not at home.  The wife and other members of the family are left wondering where he is and she can get no information about him.  It is incumbent on the State to get in touch with that woman instantly and tell her where <Col N="574" /> her husband is.  Very often when that happens the woman can give a good scolding to the man concerned and bring him into line.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the points I am making.  He cannot do anything about the Bill now.  I believe this.  There is no question of amendments being accepted.  This is the occasion to spell it out and declare our good intentions on the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to believe the Minister is serious when he says we should rely on the Constitution. The Constitution, generally speaking, merely states principles. With regard to what we are talking about Article 40.4 says:</P>
      <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberties save in accordance with law.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3 says:</P>
      <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
      <P>The Constitution merely states principles, but it envisages laws being made to enact and define these rights. If we were to rely on Article 40, and the bald statements made in it, it is true that the Supreme Court might eventually interpret it in such a way as to uphold the right of a person who complained he was not allowed to see a legal adviser, or was not allowed to inform his family within seven days, but it would take a long time and a great deal of arguing and cost for a person to get a decision of that kind from the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said quite clearly and properly&mdash;and we all know it is correct&mdash;that the law in relation to this matter is not clear, that there is no clearly defined right of a person who is in custody.  What is not correct is to say that this could not be done, that there is no practical method of defining his rights.  Of course, there are methods of defining his rights.  Of course, it is possible to introduce amendments of the kind which are before us today.  Perhaps they would not define all his rights, perhaps they <Col N="575" /> would not be impeccable and entirely comprehensive but they would at least define two rights&mdash;the right to see a legal or medical adviser and the right to inform his family of his whereabouts.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with making a start, at least, in defining rights in the situation we are discussing?  It has been suggested that this is not the Bill under which to do it.  The Minister, when pressed, did not give any indication that because this is not the right place to do it he is going to do it somewhere else.  If we are not going to do it somewhere else, let us do it here.  Let us make a start.  If the law is entirely uncertain in regard to these particular rights, let us try to define them to some extent at least.  It is difficult to understand the reluctance of the Minister in this regard.  The Minister has now got his Bill, the Second Stage has been passed, the question of the seven days has been passed, he has all his rights and powers and everything he wants.  So far as the security force is concerned they have what they want, they can do the job they want to do and they are perfectly satisfied with the Bill as it now stands.  There is no question, at this stage, of saying that what is asked will in any way impede the efforts of the security forces in doing their job.</P>
    <P>We are now moving into a different area altogether.  We are moving into an area where the rights of those who are held in custody should be considered. Some of them may, in fact, be people who have committed some kind of a crime, but at the stage about which we are speaking they are innocent people because no crime has been proved against them.  As we have already complained, some of them may not even be accused of a crime. They may be people whom a garda merely has reason to believe may have some information.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult, indeed, to understand the intransigent attitude of the Minister with regard to something which is clearly, under the Constitution and from every point of view, the right of a citizen.  The only reason <Col N="576" /> the Minister advances against agreeing to this amendment is that it is not really necessary and that the citizen has fundamental rights under the Constitution, fundamental rights which are certainly not defined at the moment, fundamental rights for which there is no legal enactment at the moment and rights on which it would take weeks, months and possibly years to get a decision from the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for not accepting this amendment?  There can no longer be any suggestion, as has been suggested earlier on, that amendments put before the House would, in some way, impede the security forces.  This is not going to impede them.  This is not going to prevent them from doing their job.  This is not going to interfere with their powers in any way.  What we are talking about is the right of the citizen and, as far as we are concerned, he is a citizen who, at the stage at which this is concerned, is still innocent and may be somebody whom it is not even suggested has committed any crime.  So it is difficult to understand the reluctance of the Minister to do something which he admits is necessary in the sense that the law is not clear.</P>
    <P>There is some validity in the argument that this is not the right Bill or that it is difficult to amend the Bill at this stage but, of course, if the Minister had shown himself as sharing our concern and agreeing to the necessity of some definition of the law in this respect, if he had given some undertaking that this would be done in some other enactment or in some other way and if he showed that he really understood and appreciated our concern and would do his best to meet that concern, then the situation would be different.  But he does not even seem to appreciate or make any concession to the apprehension which many people in this House and many people outside the House feel in regard to the situation in which people will find themselves under the powers of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan highlighted my arguments perfectly when he said: &ldquo;Let us even begin at this <Col N="577" /> stage to define these rights to some extent&rdquo;.  Of course, implicit in that, if one starts defining these rights, by definition one must start delimiting them, setting bounds to them.  That is an inferior position to the position given by our Constitution where these personal rights are given and our courts then define them afterwards. Senator Robinson may laugh but I am telling her that the advice I have is that these are personal rights given by the Constitution and if we were to attempt to define them we would automatically start to limit them in accordance with the bounds of our definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I really must address myself to this question of the delimitation of rights by definition.  I find it a very curious thesis and I propose to deal with it very simply and shortly.  In dealing with that the notion of flexibility&mdash;as used by the Minister earlier&mdash;should be questioned also.  How, in the name of goodness, could the systematic listing of basic procedures be regarded as circumscribing rights in general?  Let me say what supports my contention. For example, suppose the Minister gave a promise here that he was going to establish regular procedure for the confrontation between those who might hold a person and a person accused.  Should those definite procedures be inadequate or be less than the full expression of rights, the individual could go past them and invoke a fuller expression of his rights or the person in charge of the questioning could go farther than this list or set of definite procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been set up by the Minister in his reaction to the Kenny decision is that a state of total vagueness allows for flexibility and that this state of total vagueness is better than any explicit definition of procedures at the point of encounter between the accused person and the accuser.  I might say that, as a non-lawyer, reacting to the quotation of the opinion here and the construction put on it by two different people, I think that Mr. Justice Kenny hardly expected his use of the word &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; to be regarded as synonymous with vagueness or, even worse, his use <Col N="578" /> of the term &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; to be regarded as synonymous with confusion or non-expression.</P>
    <P>I think that what he meant was that a narrow or constricted expression of the rights of the individual in a code might not be the full expression of the individual's rights, but this is not to make the case that the Minister has made at all.  You could have a definite code of procedure laid down which would not be the fullness of the individual's rights but would be guidelined as to the procedures that were appropriate in the encounter between the accused person and the person making an accusation.  Having disposed of that the value of this lesser established set of procedures would be as follows.</P>
    <P>You might say it would lead to some confusion in so far as it could be regarded as the fullness of rights.  Perhaps it would but it would at least establish this.  It would be the ground rules of the behaviour appropriate between the people apprehended and the people who were making the accusation and as such it would set an atmosphere which would inform that kind of encounter.  More importantly, it would answer the tremendous public concern at present that there be some definite established context in which people deal with each other in this situation.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the third point. Having disposed of the idea that, for example, the flexibility is not affected one whit by the establishment of a code, the Minister's advice is unfortunate in that way.  Let me say that as a practising sociologist in this country I have not been able to recommend any of my post-graduate students to do an analysis of social class relations within the commission of crime because of the quality of statistics available over the years since the foundation of this State.  However, I do know that there is an opinion, which would be held by every practising criminologist in this island, that there is a class bias by nature represented in crime statistics.</P>
    <P>I wonder how popular in people's minds is the notion that the Consituation <Col N="579" /> is always there.  We all know, if anyone examines the cases that have been stated which invoked the Constitution, that it is invoked rarely and by a minority of individuals within a minority within the population.  To suggest that it is an adequate substitute at the end of the day for those who want guarantees about justice is a completely notional and abstract suggestion without a whit of proof and with every piece of evidence going against it.  My advice to the Minister is that it is from the practice of the law, from what takes place in the execution and processing of the law that one must decide whether a piece of law is adequate or not.  It is at that that the public will look.  Many people in this House have said that the public are in favour of this and the public are in favour of that.  There is an overwhelming feeling among the people at present that law and justice are extremely important and not only are they important but they must be seen to be accurate and explicit.</P>
    <P>Therefore there are three points essentially.  First of all this notion of flexibility in the Kenny case has been distorted; secondly the notion of constitutional resource at the end of the day is not a full democratic one and is more notional than abstract; and I have explicitly asserted that to demand a set of procedures, at some future date perhaps, is not in any way to limit the full flexibility which the Constitution allows.  To assert otherwise is simply to say: &ldquo;We believe everything vague because somehow or another this individual is very seriously done by.  He can come back to the Constitution.&rdquo;  It is poor, poor comfort to the average citizen.  It is a very primitive notion of jurisprudence and goes very much against the certainty of law where it is practised in most modern democracies.  It is unfortunate that the advice given to the Minister confuses such words as flexibility and vagueness and confusion, and does not assist him in trying to engage the great public opinion which is asking for certitude in the process of law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as a lawyer, am very glad to hear the social and practical aspects of the law as it impinges on people, ordinary citizens of the community, as expounded by both Senators Mullen and Higgins because law basically must be a reflection, as far as practicable, of what is needed by the citizens of the community. Law must be the expression of their social aspirations and requirements and needs.  I go along not with the type of argument made by the Minister but with a longer legal tradition that existed long before Constitutions were ever heard of, and that is that Parliament writes in the law specifically and passes that law.  A famous judge, the late Chief Justice Lavery, always looked for the plain meaning of the section in any law, and that is an aspect of jurisprudence that appeals to me far more than talking about broad principles in a Constitution.</P>
      <P>Of course it is necessary in our modern times to have a Constitution as a basic document setting out guidelines, but it is nothing like as important as the explicit writing of the guarantees under those guidelines into ordinary legislation that can be understood by ordinary people and interpreted by the courts as meaning the plain language in which it is set out. Indeed, there is no point in talking about constitutional rights to the citizen who cannot afford to avail of them.  It was once said in a famous court decision, that the law was available to everyone like the Ritz Hotel was available to everyone.</P>
      <P>Everyone cannot go to the length of taking a constitutional action and processing the matter the full way to decide whether or not this or that section is repugnant to the Constitution.  What a Government should be doing is taking its guidelines from the Constitution and from court decisions, in particular Supreme Court decisions, and translating those guidelines into hard English in the form of legislation in hard language that can be explicit, understood and appreciated, whereby people or their legal advisers could go to a section in a piece of legislation and say: &ldquo;Your rights are there&rdquo;, and proceed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> The Minister is, of course, half right in that there is a certain line of judicial decisions that would indicate that people do have rights of access to the court in certain circumstances.  In the case of The State (Quinn) <i>v.</i> Ryan and Others, 1965 Irish Reports, the Irish police were acting on foot of a British warrant and trying to bundle a person across into the British Jurisdiction under section 29 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1861, and Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh held that that operation under that section was repugnant to the Constitution because it deprived a person of access to the courts as set out under Article 40.3.1.º That is okay.  The effect of that decision was that the Chief Justice said, <i>obiter dicta</i> that every person had his right of access to court and could not be deprived of that right by the police bundling a person from one jurisdiction to another.  He held that that section of that Act was repugnant to the Constitution.  That was 11 years ago and that decision was on foot of that Article.  Now what the Minister is suggesting is that somebody else who is being deprived of legal access under the detention procedure in this Bill can go ahead and take again his or her constitutional action.</P>
    <P>Whether the constitutional action can succeed is very doubtful by reason of the withdrawal from the Constitution that is implicit and written into this legislation.  It is not right that a person should have to proceed under a very grievous disability as to his or her success by reason of this withdrawal from the Constitution.  The Constitution is there and judicial decisions are there in my view as guidelines to the Legislature and the onus lies fairly and squarely on the Government of the day to introduce specific and precise legislation that sets out the rights which are there in a broad way under the Constitution.  There is no point in telling the citizen he has a constitutional right to take his case to the Supreme Court when, apart from the expense involved, his chances of success are seriously reduced by reason of this detention <Col N="582" /> legislation related to the abrogation of the Constitution.  That is the reality of the matter.  What we are seeking is to write in here under these amendments, or something similar if the Minister's draftsmen can come up with something better, basic rights&mdash; in ordinary language, the right of access to a medical practitioner, the right of access to a legal adviser, the right of notification to next of kin, the right in the case of a minor of notification to parents or guardians.</P>
    <P>That can be done, as is suggested under these amendments, at least once a day, at least every 48 hours, at least within one hour in the case of a minor, but the time is only a detail, but that basic right should be written in, and I cannot think of any reason why that should be regarded as something abstruse.  The Minister comes up with the weakest of all arguments: &ldquo;The Constitution is there, like the Ritz Hotel, open to everyone.  You can all go and take your rights under the Constitution.&rdquo;  But in order to do that you have to proceed to the courts and take legal action with the inevitable delay before a decision is reached and the prospect of a very doubtful outcome by reason of this legislation.</P>
    <P>That is not the way a responsible Executive should be facing up to its problems.  I suggest here&mdash;and I agree fully with what Senator Browne was saying earlier on&mdash;that it has not yet percolated into the Minister's consciousness the enormity of the decision to extend detention from 48 hours to seven days.  This is a very substantial deprivation of human rights, a substantial extension of the existing situation. I think the courts would always have held 48 hours a reasonable period of detention and that that is the very limit they would hold to be reasonable. Indeed, that was written into the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, with great trepidation by the Minister of the time and introduced reluctantly and expressed to be so in its passage through the Dáil and the Seanad.  The view held at the time was that the Government of the day were stretching the situation very much in writing in a 48 hour period of detention into the Offences Against the State Act.  We are <Col N="583" /> increasing that by five more days on the say so of a chief superintendent who will be operating under Garda procedures under the Garda security umbrella.</P>
    <P>We are not protecting the citizen who may be involved in that type of detention.  We can protect him by writing in the specific guarantees involved in these amendments.  I appreciate the difficulties of writing it into this legislation at this stage, but I do suggest that the Minister take this up as a matter of urgency.  I do not see why he needs to have any massive examination within his Department about this matter.  It is a very precise matter. Maybe I am being too simplistic about it, but it appears to me to be very precise.</P>
    <P>There are four categories of situations involved in the two amendments &mdash;access to the medical practitioner and the legal adviser, the notification of a relative and, in the case of a minor, access to parents or guardians.  This is not an abstruse series of suggestions incorporated in these two amendments. They are very precise and if written into a Bill would be appreciated by people, and this comes back to the sociological point involved in what both Senators Mullen and Higgins were saying, that this is something that people can understand.  This is not just Article 40.3.1º which reads:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>That is excellent.  But that is not practical and meaningful as far as the citizen and his legal adviser are concerned. What does that mean as far as the parent of a minor or the relative of a detained person is concerned who goes into his or her solicitor and says: &ldquo;my son&mdash;my brother or sister&mdash;has been held by the gardaí. We know where they are, we cannot get in to them.  Can you make contact with them?&rdquo;  The solicitor has no section on which he can base his right and the Minister himself has stated in the House here that the position is unresolved, and he states here now that <Col N="584" /> under the broad guideline of the Constitution there is a right existing.  But if the solicitor concerned to whom that person goes can say: &ldquo;Yes, section 1 of section 2 or section 3 of the basic access rights Bill in regard to detainees or prisoners or people in custody provides for that right.  Go and exercise that right&rdquo;.  He could exercise that right and automatically he would get it.  That is the sort of right that is meaningful as far as the citizen is concerned.  It is the duty of the Government of the day to ensure that constitutional guidelines and Supreme Court decisions of the kind that I have mentioned that touch on these issues are provided for.</P>
    <P>That is what the Judiciary and, in particular, the Supreme Court are there for and that is what a Constitution is there for, to ensure that explicit laws are enacted implementing the guidelines.  It is absolutely futile to talk about constitutional rights to the ordinary citizen of this land.  It is only in a very exceptional case that he will proceed with the matter and only in a very exceptional case that eventually a decision will be determined favourable to him.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister saying, as his colleague was saying this morning and yesterday: &ldquo;There was detention under the Offences Against the State Act.  There has been a long tradition of this access being allowed, although it is not explicit in the legal sense&rdquo;.  There is no point in talking in that airy fairy manner.  It must be got into the Minister's mind that there is a big difference between 48 hours and seven days, and while it was detention of 48 hours at the outside, mostly it was only a case of a 24 hour detention.  The matter did not arise because 48 hours was a reasonable period and people did not start to get excited about getting themselves out of detention within 48 hours.  It is an entirely different ball game when they are in for a week.  Furthermore there is a very serious danger, because the Minister cannot control every case, of rearrest after seven days.  In this type of situation the Minister should take <Col N="585" /> serious cognisance of the amendments which are offered.  If people are detained for this long period they will want to know precisely what their rights are, and their relatives, legal and medical advisers will want to know precisely what their rights are.  They should be spelled out in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this Bill concerns people whose actions are not regarded by the Minister as being political.  The Minister is on record as saying that this is so.  We should not get mixed up in our jerseys.  We are dealing with what the Minister would describe as everybody breaking the law.  People breaking the law are required to conform with what the law spells out.  At the same time, it is reasonable to advocate that the people responsible for administering the law should spell out a person's entitlement under that law.  When this Bill has been enacted it is quite conceivable that innocent persons may be caught up in it and they will have to prove their innocence.  Such people should know their entitlements and rights; it is imperative that they should.  It has already been said that an insufficient number of our people know their entitlements in anything.  This legislation is concerned with keeping people in custody.  That being so, the person concerned is entitled to know his rights.  He is entitled to know about access to a solicitor, doctor and relatives.  So far I have not heard the Minister making any reference to the situation of a minor.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to elaborate on the situation affecting minors.  Every day in the newspapers there are reports of minors participating in all types of violence in the Six Counties.  Quite a number of minors have been arrested in this part of the country for the same types of offences.  If the Minister is reluctant to spell out rights, could he indicate when there will be an opportunity given for the spelling out of rights?  I am anxious to ensure that a person does not have to spend a lot of money to establish his rights.  Thousands of people do not know their rights under any law, even in regard to social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State should always appear to <Col N="586" /> be leaning over backwards to ensure that people exercise their rights and not appear as if they were depriving people of their rights.  In that way we will demonstrate to the people intent on disregarding the State that they are not going to get away with it and, at the same time that there is a reasonable way in which they can be dealt with.  Indeed, when they have time to reflect they will possibly recognise that they are living in a democracy.  I would ask the Minister even for the purposes of the record, to indicate that time will be taken now for a person to know their entitlements.  I know the Minister does not consider those who are interested in civil rights to be subversives or fellow travellers, as one of his colleagues said.  Does it remain the duty of a body like the Irish Council of Civil Liberties to formulate a document setting out the rights of people under this type of legislation and then send it to the Department of Justice and say: &ldquo;What do you think of that?  Is it all right?  Will we get the stamp on it?&rdquo;  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly, will use his influence, as vice-president of the other civil rights organisation which now and then comes to light and which objects to this type of legislation, to influence them.  I want to ensure that people understand their rights.  I am not trying to hide or protect people who are evading the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>By now the Minister may have appreciated that his intervention and the argument he made does not stand up to analysis. He spoke about there being greater security for the citizen in a situation where the citizen has personal rights under the Constitution and that it it undesirable to put these rights into legislation and that it would be &ldquo;going backward&rdquo; to do that.  It is the sort of point one can make at the end of a hard week's sitting in both Houses listening to arguments put.  I do not wish to score points and hound the Minister on it.  Nevertheless, I am concerned because there is a very important <Col N="587" /> principle at stake.  I should like to support the other Senators who have spoken and to identify that principle.  The Minister seems to rely on part of the judgment in Mr. Justice Kenny's case which I have already put on the record.  I should like to unravel that question of flexibility and then refer to the main point.</P>
      <P>The part which the Minister referred to in Mr. Justice Kenny's judgment was:</P>
      <P>If the High Court comes to the conclusion that the trial was not fair, it should grant <i>certiorari</i>.  The Cases in which this State-side order may be granted cannot and should not be limited by reference to any formula or final statement of principle. The strength of this great remedy is its flexibility.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Kenny was saying that the courts will grant <i>certiorari</i> if there is not a fair trial.  He did not in his judgment to lay down specifically where there is not a fair trial.  It should be open to the citizen to say: &ldquo;I did not get a fair trial&rdquo;, either because there was a breach of statute law, like the law of evidence relating to the criminal law, or codes of practice or lack of legal representation, which was the point at issue in this case.  That is the meaning of the flexibility.  It is a flexibility of the grounds of a fair trial on which you can apply for and get an order of <i>certiorari</i> quashing the order of the district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality of this case is that the order of the district justice was given in January, 1975, and the Supreme Court gave judgment on it in July, 1976.  That is quite good as Senators Ryan and Lenihan would agree, to get a Supreme Court judgment in that time.  That is the sort of time lag that is a factor in it if a person has to assert his personal rights.  Would the Minister not think that Mrs. McGee, who brought a constitutional action to assert her right to import contraceptives for her private use, would prefer to have that legal right to import contraceptives in legislation rather than to have to go through the agony, lack of privacy, perseverance and trauma of mounting a full-scale <Col N="588" /> constitutional action in the High Court and Supreme Court to assert her personal rights under the Constitution? I have heard esoteric points of law and have been accused of making them myself but that really takes the biscuit.</P>
    <P>How do the Garda know the sophisticated personal rights of the citizen, those latent rights, and how are they to be expected to observe them?  The point has been put by Senators Mullen and M.D. Higgins that we are talking about <i>ex post facto</i> mounting of constitutional cases or legal actions to assert rights infringed. That is a most inadequate way of approaching the problem before us. I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan's interpretation of Article 40.3 about personal rights.  The Oireachtas and the State must vindicate the personal rights of the citizens.  The best way to vindicate them is to put them into legislation where appropriate.  It is for this reason that I am somewhat dismayed by the Minister's general comment that he does not intend to examine this question of the right of a person detained for seven days to see a legal adviser, or a medical practitioner. But this right should be guaranteed across the board&mdash;a right of access for anybody held in custody. The Supreme Court thus only identified a right to legal representation in serious cases coming before a court. That is not at all the subject matter we are talking about when we are talking about section 2 of the Emergency Powers Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reflect on the response to his contribution this afternoon and the dismay it would cause if he is not going to examine and bring in legislation to give a precise right to a legal adviser when somebody is held in custody and can be questioned by the gardaí, and, particularly, when the person can be held in custody for a maximum of seven days.  This is a very important point and I am saddened and surprised at the Minister's approach to the subject.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how he sees the rights of a person under the section at the moment. When a person is arrested under section 2 of the Bill does he have a right not <Col N="589" /> to answer questions until his legal adviser is present in the Garda station, prison or other convenient place?</P>

      <P>I support the other Senators who have so ably and eloquently supported the amendments.  I am concerned that people can be detained for seven days.  I am particularly concerned that it does not seem to be compulsory to notify the next of kin.  If a person living along the Border is missing for seven days and the next of kin are not notified of his whereabouts, they can come to many conclusions. They may feel that he has been taken across the Border by the UDA or the SAS.  Where will they get the information that will allay their fears?  It is important that the Garda should be at liberty to inform his or her family where this person is being held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that when the national emergency motion was put forward many Senators expressed themselves in favour of the thrust against subversion but put on record in that debate their reservations precisely about these minimum humane considerations. People were willing to go along with the seven day detention because they felt there was that degree of emergency.  Surely it is distressing to the Minister to realise that of all the independent Senators only one remains on his side of the House in relation to the Bill.  A great number of the Labour Senators have taken different attitudes against it.  The weight of all that opinion, and the weight of the Lower House, has been resisted ultimately and very stubbornly by the Minister.  It puts one into an odd kind of position to see the constant reiteration of the defence of the police, the pleading of their fine record and of their fair name over and over again the disclaimers about any possible abuse of that seven days' detention and the quite incomprehensible unwillingness of the Minister at the stroke of a pen <Col N="590" /> to relieve them of all the odium that will attach to them inevitably when these minimum requirements are being refused.</P>
      <P>There is a cloud surrounding the detainee's right to consult a solicitor, a doctor or to have contact with relatives. The Minister declares that the regulations concerning detention and those matters are unresolved.  There was a chance to resolve them in this Bill but this has been deliberately refused.  The effect of that seems to be quite sinister and quite incomprehensible. I do not think Senators are prolonging this debate because they want to be perverse about it.  They are positively puzzled and disturbed about it on both sides.</P>
      <P>This cloud of interrogation will hang over the entire process unless something is done now.  It is hopeless to expect the Minister to recall the Lower House or accept these amendments.  It may even seem perverse to keep pushing these amendments but what choice has one got? Either to yield to it and say nothing or else to use the only forum left to us to protest against it.  I had hoped that I could vote for this Bill and I put on record my intention of voting for it if these minimal humane requirements were embodied in it.  The amendments have been rejected and I am left with no choice but to oppose the entire Bill root and branch.</P>
      <P>We have all learned a great deal from this debate.  There are certain areas which will still remain absolutely impenetrable to me.  Why, in the first place, consensus could not have been had between the two parties about the state of national emergency?  Why this endless wrangle surrounds the Bill which is in spirit sound?  Why have these comparatively modest adjustments been stubbornly and repeatedly refused?  The entire measure, which had such a promising start, has been clouded and a very large area of suspicion and mystery created leading ultimately, to a vague feeling of distaste.</P>

      <P>The whole vagueness of the situation in regard to the human rights referred to in the two amendments was highlighted in the <Col N="591" /> question posed by Senator Robinson and answered by the Minister.

      <P>It clearly indicates that he cannot say that a person has the right.  I have not participated in this debate at all and I will not vote on this because I agreed to pair with a Senator on the other side.  If I was entited to vote, I would vote in favour of the two amendments even though on the Official Record I supported the measures in 1972 and again in the case of the condemnation of the killing of Senator Fox.  I was gravely disturbed by the Minister's attitude to these points today.  If such a decision is taken, the House will be branded as obscurantist and retrograde in its actions.  In other words, it will say that a person in detention has not the right of access to a doctor and his whereabouts need not be conveyed to his relatives.  The interpretation in the public mind will be that a person will not have the right of access to a legal adviser.  This would be terrible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are not aware of Article 40 of the Constitution.  To use this as an argument for the denial of the rights requested in the amendment is wrong and will be meaningless to the public.  I would appeal to the Minister at this stage to meet the situation by giving a firmer assurance than the one already given that he will look into these matters.  That assurance is very vague.  It is quite obvious to any reasonable person&mdash;the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; has already been used to a great extent here&mdash;that these are fundamental human rights; the right to medical advice, medical care, legal advice and the right to inform relatives of a person's whereabouts.  They <Col N="592" /> should not be denied by any reasonable person.  I know the Minister is a reasonable man and have always found him so and, as I said, he could meet the situation by entering into a firmer commitment than that already entered into.</P>

      <P>If an impression of the type which Senator Brosnahan is fearful of goes abroad, it is the fault of this debate.  I sense the impression growing, as the debate continues, that refusal to accept these amendments means a denial of the right to set out amendments, but that is not so.  The point I am making is that these rights are available under our Constitution. I am not impressed by the argument that is inclined to regard constitutional rights as being less than perfect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister, as I said before, appears to have changed his mind, and this is disturbing. I recall him leading the other House along in his pursuit of points of this kind in emphasising the necessity to safeguard individual civil rights.  If all he can say is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then he is obviously acting correctly, but in using the phrase &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; he is introducing an element of doubt that his opinion is simply that of an individual.  The element of doubt introduced into this dramatically altered situation&mdash;and this is the point which most Senators tried to emphasise&mdash;is where a period of 24 hours, which one hopes would be the period a person would find himself in custody, was extended to 48 hours, the period in the past, and is now being extended to seven days.  The crucial change in the existing situation&mdash;extending the period to seven days&mdash;has altered the whole position in relation to four questions: the question of minors seeing their parents, relatives seeing their next-of-kin, the right to see a lawyer and the right to see a doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is diffident about his approach to the question of rights.  He says &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo;, and he is correctly diffident in the light of his other remark that the law is uncertain in this regard.  The logic of these two points together would be that, as the responsible Minister, he should <Col N="593" /> eliminate any uncertainty.  He should be able to say to the House in respect of the four questions: the right of a minor to see his parents, yes; the right of an individual to see a doctor, yes; the right of an individual to see a lawyer, yes; and the right of the individual to have his relatives contacted, yes, and without any doubt. He must concede that he has been unable to say that to us with absolute certainty.</P>

      <P>May I give an example if one started to draft that? Senator Browne says: &ldquo;The right to see a solicitor, yes&rdquo;.  I would say, broadly speaking, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, but if the solicitor who presents himself is one who has been recently fined £250 for improper conduct and has been barred from visiting two prisons, and I have said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the right to see that solicitor, what do we do with that gentleman?  There is no such thing as an unqualified right.  If we get into the area of definitions, it becomes a most complex subject.</P>

      <P>The point the Minister is now making is that which we discussed in the amendment to the Prisons Rules which arose out of the unprofessional behaviour of a particular legal adviser.  The basic fault of this Government seems to be that they allow the occasional malefactor to drive them into progressively attenuating, weakening, the democratic structure of our society and the civil rights and liberties of our people.  In that way, as I said when I was quoting Newman, the retiring head of the RUC, we are <Col N="594" /> creating a victory for the extremists and terrorists.  If there is such a person who has broken his professional conduct behaviour pattern, that is a matter for the Law Society&mdash;and I will not discuss it now&mdash;but it could not justify the Minister saying &ldquo;Because I am frightened that the prison authorities will be faced with a dishonest solicitor, I cannot give the rest of our people these rights.&rdquo;  In other words we are legislating for the one individual.</P>

      <P>Is it not now clear that the Minister has deserted the position he took up when he said he favoured the broad constitutional guarantee because of its flexibility, and that the reason he favoured the refusal to be specific about this amendment is because he is frightened by the possibility that the prison authorities will be faced with a dishonest solicitor and therefore we are legislating for the antics or activities of dishonest solicitors rather than the broad body of the legal profession, which is honest, and which does its job properly.</P>

      <P>If that is certain why can the Minister only say to us &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo;?  Why can the Minister not give us a certain guarantee that the solicitor, the relatives, and the doctor have immediate access?  It seems to me that the Minister is putting on the police the responsibility of arbitrating in this question of constitutional rights.  We have a position where a member of the Garda with somebody who has some kind of medical problem has to decide whether this is a diabetic, an epileptic, or some kind of emotional or cardiac problem, and whether this is the kind of case where he should permit the doctor to come in.</P>
      <P>If the person makes an application for a doctor must he accept that application or has he discretion?  If he has discretion, in what way can he exercise that discretion as a layman trying to deal with a medical problem?  I do not think that is something that should be left to the members of the Garda.  It should be built into our legislation so that there is no doubt whatever that on being taken into custody these rights which we have all referred to&mdash;the legal rights, the right to medical attention, the right to access to relatives, the right of parents to know where the minor is and, above all, the right to be assumed to be innocent until proved guilty&mdash; are made quite clear to each individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to the Minister and throughout this whole debate there appears to be&mdash;I choose my words carefully&mdash;some kind of conspiracy amongst the two Ministers we have listened to here.  I raised the question of the 1875 Act and the rights of individuals without the protection of the Trade Disputes Act.  I remember Senator O'Higgins saying that he has flat-footedly denied that.  As we progressed through the debate we found that he did not have the power to flat-footedly deny that.  We are moving into this question of what is the purpose of the detention for seven days. It now transpires it is not simply the question of the isolation of the individual <Col N="596" /> and other matters arising out of that, the protection of witnesses, interference with evidence and so on.  We are now given to understand that the purpose of the seven day detention is to facilitate prolonged interrogation at the discretion of the Garda.</P>

      <P>We have established &mdash;and this is the disturbing part of this whole debate&mdash;the evasion and the conspiracy within this Government to conceal their true intentions in regard to this legislation particularly arising from the deterioration of our economic situation and the defects of the law in relation to trade unionists, on which he has now given an undertaking to Senator Mullen to do something about.  Now we have this question of the real purpose of the seven day detention which is not only isolation but interrogation.  It would seem to me that this is four square with the refusal of the Minister to give what would be real safeguards against harassment under interrogation&mdash;the right to legal advice, legal representation, the right to talk to relatives at reasonable intervals daily, and the right to medical advice if that is required.  If these people were going in and out of jails or in and <Col N="597" /> out of the Garda stations, then there could be no abuse of the interrogation process.  If the Minister did not suspect, or did not know as a matter of fact from the Garda, that they want a free hand in regard to interrogation <Col N="598" /> over a prolonged period in order to break down these witnesses, he would accept these perfectly reasonable amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) A person who has been arrested and kept in custody under this section shall not for a period of six months following such period in custody be subject to the powers contained in this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the possibility that a person could be arrested and kept in custody again and again.  It is generally acknowledged that the power given under section 2 is a very extreme one, a very unusual one, and one which would only be exercised in unusual circumstances.  It is possible that the power could be used in such a way as to subject an individual to successive terms of seven days in custody and could be used in effect as a kind of internment, of indefinite detention.  I am quite sure the Minister does not intend that that should happen.  I am sure it is unlikely it would happen but, nevertheless, the power is there.  It is possible that the security forces would be plagued by some individual who was obviously up to no good, that frequently they would have some reasonable cause for arresting and keeping him in custody for seven days.</P>
      <P>To remove the possibility, no matter how remote, that the power contained in the section would be abused in this way the amendment is designed to ensure that if a person is arrested and kept in custody under the powers contained in the section, it cannot happen again for a period of six months.  I am sure the Minister will agree that this is a perfectly reasonable amendment, in the sense that what it envisages is perfectly reasonable.  I am sure he will feel it is not necessary.  If it is acknowledged that this is a very far-reaching power, something that should be used only in very unusual circumstances then to say that it cannot be used in relation to the same person more than once every six months is not an unreasonable restriction of the powers contained in the Bill.  In order to avoid something which may not happen but could happen, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the thinking behind this amendment.  The same thoughts were expressed in the Lower House.  It was also said in the Lower House that some Deputies were aware that the existing power to detain for 48 hours had been abused to their knowledge in some instances where successive arrests were made.  I stated that I was not personally aware of such instances and, of course I would be distressed to hear of them.  I invited Deputies to bring them specifically to my notice and said they would be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unlawful in my opinion for the measure to be used in that way because the prior conditions before an arrest can be effected are such that it would be inconceivable that they could exist successively at the end of the period of detention.  They would have been exhausted and they could not recur if the person were immediately let out and then re-arrested.  They could not recur and therefore the arrest would not be in accordance with the section and would be unlawful.  I readily admit that there could possibly be a very short interval.  There could be even as short an interval as a day between the arrest and a subsequent arrest, but the subsequent arrest would <Col N="601" /> also have to comply with the conditions in the section.  Because of the short interval, the onus on the police would be that much greater to be able to stand up to any claim that they were not acting with reasonable cause.  That is the deterrent against an abuse under this section.</P>
    <P>To provide by statute that there would be an interval of six months would rob the measure of its effectiveness. It could mean that a person who would properly fall to be detained, perhaps even one month after being released, would know that he could thumb his nose, so to speak, at the Garda for six months. In practical terms I do not think we can limit the right to re-arrest.</P>
    <P>A limitation is contained in the wording of the section itself, that a re-arrest, especially after a short interval, would put a very heavy onus on the arresting garda to be able to stand up to any legal attack on him that he was acting unlawfully. The immunity which the Bill gives does not extend to an unlawful use of the powers of the Bill, so if a garda were to attempt to use his powers unlawfully he would be open to be constrained by the courts at the suit of the person in respect of whom the powers were being exercised.</P>

      <P>If he had he would not be breaking the law and he would be entitled as it stands to re-arrest even after a short interval.  What we want to avoid is any injustice or abuse of it.  The protection against an abuse of it would be the fact that there would be a heavier obligation on a garda to justify reasonable cause after a short interval.  The shorter the interval, the heavier the obligation.  It would be my opinion that it would not be <Col N="602" /> possible to have reasonable cause to permit arrest immediately on release.  I do not think that would be possible as a matter of fact and it would immediately raise the issue that the garda was acting without reasonable cause.  He would then be open to sanctions.</P>

There is a danger that it could be used but, unlike some of the other apprehensions we have about this Bill, the balance of probabilities on this one is probably very much lower than the others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position we are in on this Bill is that we opposed it at the beginning very largely on the basis that we had reason to believe that there were precautions in relation to the powers given in this Bill which were not going to be taken into consideration by the Minister.  We discussed the Bill in full and put down amendments in an effort to prevent anybody who was subject to the powers of this Bill from being in a position where their human rights and liberties were affected.  Our efforts to improve the Bill in this way were of no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill can be looked at from two points of view.  On the one hand, there was the security point of view, that the security forces wanted the Bill and considered it necessary to have the powers of detaining a person increased from two to seven days.  On the other hand, there was the point of view, <Col N="603" /> even on the part of those who voted for the Bill at the beginning, that even if it was necessary there should be certain reservations and precautions built into the Bill to ensure that those who were detained would have certain rights.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very convincing, persuasive and adamant that he must have the powers, but he has been anything but convincing or persuasive in regard to the precautions which many people in the House considered were necessary.</P>
    <P>If some of the amendments had been accepted, although we would still have been unhappy about this Bill we would have been a good deal happier than we are at present. There has been a complete blind eye as far as the Minister is concerned. He sees it entirely from the point of view of what is necessary from the security aspect.  He does not seem to acknowledge that there are other aspects of this Bill which are equally important and possibly in the long run even more important than the powers he seeks in the Bill and which he has received in the Bill.  Consequently, we are in the position on this side of the House that the attitude of the Minister leaves us no alternative but to oppose the Bill, to oppose it because nothing in it has been changed.  We voted against it initially.  Nothing has been changed in the way we thought was necessary.  None of the precautions that we thought necessary has been embodied in the Bill, and consequently it is a Bill which has, from our point of view, a lot of very bad features. Even if one accepted that it was necessary to have these powers, the fact that the other features have not been embodied and that we have not been met to the extent of one comma in this Bill means we have no alternative but to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indeed a sad day for the Oireachtas that we should be passing this Bill in which are incorporated many fundamental dangers to the structures of our society.  I say this genuinely because the measure has entailed complete reassessment of an <Col N="604" /> earlier judgment.  I genuinely regret to see that a Minister whom I have always believed to be an enlightened liberal democrat attempting to justify completely reactionary repressive provisions. In this Bill we are committing a grave assault on the fundamental civil rights of our people.  The Minister's defence of the cause he was trying to establish was so thoroughly bad as to convince me that he is carrying out a dirty job for somebody else. That does not exculpate him for what he is doing.  We still could assume that he, as the agent, would probably not be party to this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>The big disappointment to all of us has been the apparent failure of those who have spoken for the Bill&mdash; many of whom are distinguished jurists lawyers, legal men, and on their record men of liberal attitude, men with whom I had the honour of sharing in struggles of the kind I am still engaged in&mdash;to speak against these assaults on the democratic freedom of our people.  However, we have had a very enlightening debate and the same can be said of the debate which took place in the other House. I cannot remember another occasion when I got so much satisfaction watching the process which I value so much &mdash;the right of free speech, the right of an individual to hold his point of view, without fear or favour and to allow other people to hold directly contradictory views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of the cut and thrust of different views and attitudes has educated a number of us.  The sad truth is that we are to be deprived on this very serious issue of that right in the future.  We will be discussing a resolution put down but which obviously cannot be used to change in any serious or fundamental way the main provisions of the law.  What is even more ignominious is that we will be discussing it in Private Members' Time with all the limitations implied by that.  We have a gross extension of the right of the State to take an individual into custody, a guilty individual, and more important, an innocent individual, and hold them in custody for seven long, fearful, frightening days.  Can anybody here <Col N="605" /> imagine himself being subjected to that kind of treatment by the officers of the State for whom, incidentally, I have some sympathy because this responsibility is now left entirely to them and not to the politicians?  We are imposing this odious task on them rather than through our Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We have been denied the various amendments put forward by the main Opposition party and by Senator Mullen.  We have been denied what we believed to have been perfectly reasonable safeguards.  Accepting that the seven days proposal was inevitable in the light of the Government's intransigence, the safeguards against the dangers that we see in the seven days detention, the dangers of abuse in the circumstances of the pressures which will inevitably arise in our society, when the social, economic and political situation deteriorates sufficiently&mdash; these safeguards which the House has asked for, particularly this evening, have been denied by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have the request to establish the rights of each one of us&mdash;we are all simply citizens.  There are some queer quirks and changes in politics. We can look back to the unfortunate 1916 generation and the horror of their ordeal by civil war.  Who could have foreshadowed that?  Any one of us might find ourselves the victim of this kind of legislation.  That is not the reason I am pleading it.  I am pleading it for all citizens&mdash;that they should have the minimum protection of right of access to their legal adviser, the right of access to parents in relation to the minor; the right of access to medical adviser, and have these as of right established in law.  The Minister has refused to accede to any of these safeguards.</P>
    <P>I regret, but I must conclude that the sole purposes of this Bill are: first the isolation of the individual for the obvious reasons of protection of witnesses and the safeguarding of evidence: and second&mdash;whether the Minister denies it or not it comes through throughout this debate&mdash;the right for prolonged interrogation of varving degrees, depending on the <Col N="606" /> circumstances and the state of society at the time.  Whatever the Minister may say about the integrity of the Garda&mdash;he could not say more than I have said about the broad mass of Garda&mdash;this is open, unless there are safeguards, to abuse by the minority. We are in a most remarkable way failing to learn from the realities of centuries of oppression how little effect this kind of process will have and, even more immediate, failing to learn from the failure of our fellow-Irishmen in the North of Ireland in their introduction of brutally severe repressive laws which gave consolation to the terrorists and won sympathy for them which had not been there.  I know this from having been there in 1969 in Gerry Fitt's house when the people were asking for protection by British troops.  How that is all changed now.</P>
    <P>We are learning nothing at all from the disastrous experience of the Northern Ireland authority, both in relation to the army and more importantly in relation to the RUC. As men and women, I suppose members of the RUC, are not any much better or any much worse than anybody else.</P>
    <P>Looking back over our history it would be a particular optimist who assumed that we are not capable of the same kind of brutality.  I accept my responsibility as an Irishman and I am saying this as much about myself as anybody else. This is something I know from my own professional knowledge: that any one of us, given enough provocation, can behave in a way which would shock any individual who looks on himself as a normal member of society.  We appear to be taking much the same road as they did. This legislation is an attempt to solve the political problem by introducing repressive laws.  That is not the way.  Fifty years of experience of repression, repressive laws piled on repressive laws; jails full, jails empty, jails filled again, young men executed, assassinated, punished in various ways.  Why can we not learn from history that this kind of legislation, this kind of repression, <Col N="607" /> simply breeds the response of counter-repression?</P>
    <P>I must finally assume that the real purpose of this Bill is to give the authorities (1) the power of isolation and (2) and the power of interrogation, which is the power I fear most, without some safeguards of the kind we have put forward here in the various amendments and arguments we have advanced to the Minister tonight.  I deeply regret the passing of this piece of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dare to emulate Senator Browne's gift of oratory&mdash;for that is what it is&mdash; his ability to express his passionate conviction which, I assure him, I believe is real.  I have in my own way, out of a sense of duty to the people of Ireland&mdash;all of Ireland, the Fourth Green Field as well as the three and a bit we have&mdash;to express my profound disagreement with him on the matter of judgment as to our situation.  I agree&mdash;I have stated this on the Second Reading&mdash;that it is a sad thing that we have to have, as I believe we have to have, this legislation</P>
      <P>I do not think repression, in the long term, will ever be the solution to the problems of this country.  Despite the description which Senator Browne has given us of the legislation which had to be enacted and re-enacted by different Governments, I believe all of them were justifiable because there are fruits to be shown from what can be described as repressive legislation.  If you use a particular type of language it can be more properly described as protective legislation, protective of the true liberties of the great mass of the people of Ireland: the liberty not to be intimidated; the liberty not to have their lives extinguished; the liberty to say what they like, no matter how armed those who dislike the opinions expressed may be, no matter how powerful their ability to invoke the traditions of the past, to produce the lessons of their school masters which Senator Browne properly condemned as one of the sources of our troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can all look back on 54 years at least, nearly 55 years, of self-government <Col N="608" /> and what have we got?  We have plucked out of a civil war a free democracy.  How many of them survive in the world?  I feel jealous of Senator Browne's rights to speak his opinions and do what he likes subject to the law, properly enacted in accordance with the people's will, expressed in free elections.  How many of them have that achievement to look back on?  I value very much all the contributions in this House, whatever they may be, in whatever direction they may go, whether in disagreement with a judgment I make, or a view I form, of the representatives of the two universities.  Long may they be here.</P>
    <P>All the writers I have read recognise as a total necessity for the survival of the free speech and liberties of the great mass of the people the democracy which they want.  Senator Browne who is not always entirely thoughtful in some of the language he uses, and that is all I say by way of criticism at the moment, talks about a &ldquo;so-called democracy&rdquo;.  I just do not think he thought that one out as well as I would wish him to.  It is a very real democracy and its test is this finally.  It can put the Government out.  There has been talk of the suspension of the Constitution.  This is a gross misuse of language.</P>

      <P>It is a very simple thing in this Bill.  Senator Browne talked about interrogation.  As a member of my profession, from time to time I remind myself of my primary duty.  I am an officer of the court. Every solicitor is.  A garda must never tamper with justice.  He must never mislead the court.  The Garda are a noble force, a peace force, and except, in special circumstances, they do not carry arms.  This was a decision of the first Government.  No political point there for the very good reason that those who are seated on those benches supported it because subsequent Acts never varied from it, recognising its wisdom.  Is it to be thought that force is to betray its description?</P>
      <P>In other countries there are members of the law who are fences, but this is the description which, if they get it, destroys their repute among their colleagues. All the weight of their professional tradition prevents them becoming fences, prevents them from cheating. I would suggest that all the weight behind this force, to whom we owe a great deal, lies in their continued devotion to peace, which is not a static thing, which is a dynamic thing, which recognises the different characters and the different positions of the people whom it is their duty, cast upon them by us, to investigate as to their positions, if they have reasonable cause to suspect they have committed or are about to commit an offence, <i>et cetera, et cetera.</i></P>

    <P>It is all spelled out before every Senator in the House.  It is not necessary to quote the section in full.  That is not to say I do not agree with Senator Browne that it cannot happen here.  Of course it can happen here but we must make a proper judgment in the light of what we know about existing Ministers and their supporters <Col N="610" /> and the criticisms they get from their supporters in this House and the opposition with which they are faced, well expressed from many of those who spoke.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan, perhaps, expressed it best when he judged the two matters of security in which he thought the Minister was convincing.  I attach importance to that judgment.  Senator Ryan is a very experienced person. He doubted whether the Minister had allowed enough for the sense of infringement of liberties.  I am in a different party to Senator Ryan but we agree on very much.  But we disagree on this.  He knows me well enough to know that I would not be standing up here tonight if I did not genuinely disagree with him.  Besides that, there are plenty other places in this House for me to be if I disagreed with my Minister and did not want to express the disagreement on a matter of such great importance.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of judgment.  People have talked about the taking away of rights.  What, in fact, have we done here today or are we doing now?  We are acting as that great imperial Parliament acts every damn day.  We are acting by virtue of the resolution that has been passed by both Houses as if Parliament were supreme.  What if we are?  In this Bill, which is all I am entitled to talk about, what have we done?  We are proposing to extend, presumably on advice given to the Minister, who comes from the liberal tradition&mdash;let me say to those who criticise him for his actions and speeches in December, 1972, that he is part of what Senator O'Higgins described in this House on several occasions as the liberal wing of Fine Gael and there are two wings.  Sometimes I find myself closer to the breast than to the wing.  Senator Higgins will be allowed to speak, indeed encouraged to speak, certainly by me.</P>

      <P>I have been deflected from what I want to talk about at the moment.  The fact of the matter is&mdash;and this is the most important point made by a number of speakers throughout this debate, and it is a very valuable assembly even if one must go through this kind of thing occasionally&mdash;that we had a free expression of views.  Nobody has been inhibited.  My back can be exposed and will not be found to bear the mark of a whip of any kind.  We have spoken freely.  But there are these admixtures, I would suggest, in all parties with different emphasis.  The fact of the matter is that the Government cannot introduce legislation which goes beyond the distance their political supporters elected to these Houses are prepared to go.  The most important point made in this debate was&mdash; and I hope that nothing which was said in my absence today has affected that matter&mdash;that there should be no alienation through misunderstanding, resulting from any interjection from Senator Lenihan, of the true nature of this measure.</P>
      <P>This Bill, when enacted, will have one slight difference to the British. Why we should always think we are worse if we differ from the British I cannot for the life of me understand. Even the very presumption of innocence is a very narrowly held Anglo-Saxon notion, very much criticised by the great philosopher of the liberal tradition, Bentham, who saw no conceivable justification for presumption of innocence if you were engaged in the administration of justice.  We are doing in this Parliament today what the British did.  I am not saying that we should be imitating the British but I am saying that we are faced with an infinitely greater problem that they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRA, the suppressed organisation, the unlawful organisation, does <Col N="612" /> not pretend to be the British Queen or the Imperial Parliament or to represent the true traditions of Britain&mdash; from the point of view of the British they are a bloody nuisance who kill people in Birmingham, Manchester and London.  What are this bunch doing? They are trying to silence us.  I will be damned if I will be silenced by them; be damned if Senator Browne should be silenced by them; be damned if Senator Ryan should be silenced by them or Senators Martin, Connolly or Michael D.&mdash;as I shall call him, helpfully&mdash;or that any other Member of this House should be silenced.  That is what they are trying to do.  They represent a far greater threat, and they have done.</P>
    <P>I looked back with some nervous anticipation at what I would find myself recorded as having said on the 19th December, 1972.  All I can say is that I did not speak as well as Senator Boland that night.  I said: &ldquo;Why did you not ask us for what you want and I would have given you anything&rdquo; and Senator Boland correctly said: &ldquo;Anything reasonable, I think he means&rdquo;.  That was, of course, what I meant.</P>

I support this measure and I want to clear up any misconceptions there may be about it, because it is a very narrow extension of existing powers which I never heard anybody on the other side of the House criticising.  Twenty-four hours is alright if certified by a chief superintendent for another 24 hours for 37 years.  It becomes all wrong if the certification is to extend 48 hours by five days because it is still the chief superintendent and it is not the Home Secretary or his equivalent.</P>

      <P>Good, splendid. I want to deal seriously with this. We have this so-called extinguishment of our liberty.  It means simply that we have done what the British Parliament has done in the face of a much minor threat.  God knows, in terms of liberty it is as free as it jolly well wants to be, perhaps freer than some of us would like it to be.  However, that is another matter.  That is what we have done. But to do it, by virtue of the Constitution we had to pass the resolution.  The extent of the narrowing of liberty is to be found in the construction of one section of this Bill.  The so-called suspended Constitution will be construed&mdash;and Senator Ryan knows this&mdash; by an independent Judiciary and their finding will be as it may be.  All they will not be entitled to do is to refer to the Constitution.  Incidentally it may interest the Senator that in construing it they do not even have to have regard to Article 28 which is very interesting in regard to certain principles of construction.</P>

      <P>The Bill has been improved by the general debate and the Press has played its part there; not that I am given to praising the Press or that I intend to do so now, but there has been a free debate going on there, largely based on misunderstanding of the kind that one generally expects.  We have had an improved set of measures, an improved package, improvements I accept as being genuine and important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is a law about?  It is to cure a mischief, and the mischief is an attempt to take away the liberties of the people. A democracy has to have the necessary power to preserve these liberties and it can do that only if it has the support of a public who understand the measures that are being taken.  This is a short-term measure.  For the future I would not mind seeing a Committee of this House, or of the two Houses, established to see how over a long period we will cure what is, to use language that Senator M.D. Higgins would approve of, a socially delinquent group.  Now that socially delinquent group, Senator <Col N="614" /> Browne said, are to be referred to their environment and their&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing with a socially delinquent group.  I do not think Senator Browne would disagree with that.  He would ascribe different origins to it.  We have to solve that over the long term and after this debate I will recommend him to the consideration of many writings on the subject.</P>
      <P>For my part I commend this Bill to the House on this Fifth Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as there are voices more weighty than mine ready on my left to speak.  I agree with Senator Alexis FitzGerald that there are a great number of different views not only within the House but within different parties and among those people of no party.  For instance, I find myself with constant admiration for the attitude of Senator Browne, above all for his profound sensitivity towards the rights of the individual and his profound and compassionate understanding of people who could be described as socially delinquent groups. I thought for a moment that he was referring to the Cabinet but after a while there seemed to be someone else he was referring to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, my attitude towards this Bill is rather different from Senator Brownes'.  To my shame, I cannot claim to have immersed myself as deeply as he has in the sufferings of disadvantaged people.  My attitude would be much more rough and ready, much more pragmatical and ultimately less subtle than his, and perhaps less concerned. I believe in law and order and I endorse what Senator Alexis FitzGerald has said.  I am proud that we have built up in Ireland a civilised society based on democratic principles. We still have that and this Parliament is a sign of it.  That this Bill is being <Col N="615" /> debated in such depth is another symptom of it.  In other words, I do not see ours as sick a society as a great number of commentators, some of them here in the House, would see it.</P>
    <P>However, I find my disenchantment with the Bill based on a growing sense of ambivalence, almost of equivocation, certainly of ambiguity, a certain kind of shiftiness and mystification on the side of both Ministers who have been here. I will yield to no man in my admiration for the present Minister for Justice. One of the things he must be praised for is the indomitable courage he has shown in the face of an enormous threat to the country; and in facing this armed threat he has shown great political skill up to now.  He has isolated the IRA.  He has them on the run, and he has done that with enormous skill. I compliment him on that.</P>
    <P>However, I think that he has faltered in that skill with regard to these measures.  First of all, we were asked to say whether there was a state of emergency and I asked myself that question.  It took me a long time to answer it.  After the killing of the British Ambassador and the attack on the Central Criminal Court as well as the drift towards anarchy as evinced in the bank robbings, the killings, incendiary bombs, post office robbings and so on, I thought there was an arguable case for declaring a state of emergency and I voted for that.</P>
    <P>The other House was debating the same motion at the same time so we had to look forward a little and foreshadow the first Bill that was to come consequent on the declaration of a state of emergency.  This Bill before us now was circulated to us.  A great number of people in this House said that they could consider supporting this second Bill provided certain humane provisions were built into it.  There were people in the Labour Party who said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the state of emergency; there were people who abstained from voting on it but I as an Independent Senator said &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and I continued to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; until we came to the Second Stage of the Bill today because I did not know, and there is no way of knowing, how the Government will deal with amendments until the Committee Stage is <Col N="616" /> reached.  That is the point at which I began to vote against the Government.</P>
    <P>There is the question of whether persons detained will have legal advice. Will their relatives be told?  Will they be held <i>incommunicado?</i>  Will it be in an unknown place?  Will the Bill lapse after a year?  The Minister got endless signals from the Seanad and from the Dáil on these and he remained pretty intransigent, and I found myself faced with the fact that I would have to vote against the Bill.  I had hoped to vote for it but I really cannot.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned equivocation.  Will there be interrogation?  This question was asked over and over again.  Of course there will be interrogation. What the hell is the Bill for except to bring people in and interrogate them?  I approve of that.  I approve that people who are justly and reasonably suspected should be interrogated and I find it deplorable that the Minister will not come out and say: &ldquo;Yes, there will be interrogation.&rdquo;  That is what the police do.  That is how they collect evidence and I would approve even seven days' interrogation and that honestly, to be stated in front of us all, provided certain humane safeguards were built in such as visitation by doctors, relatives and legal representatives.  The process of interrogation is the process of any police force and why can it not be admitted?  I am not talking about torture.  I am talking about questioning. I am talking about isolation.  We get all kinds of shifty and equivocal answers to the questions: &ldquo;Will they have a doctor?  Will they have a legal man?&rdquo; We do not know.  The law is unresolved. Why can we not resolve the law?  Why did we not resolve the law?</P>
    <P>I could not feel more strongly than I did when I said that I would vote for the following reasons, that there is a state of emergency, that there is a new and particularly gruesome and calculated attack against the people as distinct from the institutions of Ireland and against the institutions too.  I do think that the moment has come for the final thrust against the men of violence and a measure which would only last for 12 months with the built-in restraints and provisions that I have mentioned would not be too much of an <Col N="617" /> affront to our democratic institutions.  I stand on that.</P>
    <P>These very, very reasonable requests made by the Fianna Fáil group, made over and over again by Senators on both sides of the House, were relentlessly turned down, not only were they turned down but extremely equivocable and ambiguous answers to them have been given from beginning to end.  I do not understand what is happening on the other side where a straight question &mdash;will there be questioning of these people brought in?&mdash;is not answered. What kind of &ldquo;ejits&rdquo; are we?  Of course there will be questioning.  Can that not be said?  If there was not questioning it would be nearly worse; if a policeman sat there and did not question a person detained for seven days, it would be a kind of Chinese torture. That would be a worse kind of intimidation. Why could we not have straight answers to the question?  It seems to me that as it went on and on the thing became more murky, more and more mystification descended around it.  In other words, my arguments are rather different from those of Senator Browne, and every man here probably has different views on the matter, but I found that extremely distressing, and in the heel of the hunt when one after another of these questions was relentlessly stonewalled and refused I found myself in the situation of saying that I would like to vote for this Bill; I am behind its intention.  I would like to see these men of violence defeated.  I will even permit the Government these seven days, but I will not permit them seven days in which they can keep a man <i>incommunicado</i> without his relatives knowing, without a doctor knowing, without a lawyer knowing, or without anybody knowing necessarily, where he is.  I am sorry I will not allow that but I would have allowed the rest.</P>
    <P>I think the Government for once and the Minister stand indicted for an extremely maladroit handling of a very important national issue.  I think in the first place anyway it should have gone to the Leader of the Opposition; it should have been right across the board and he would have got the state of emergency declared in a day.  Now it will bring the police into disrepute, <Col N="618" /> the whole Bill, and in fact almost ourselves.  This is why it is so important to say this and to put it on the record that really this legislation cannot go through with the kind of defence it has got unless we stand up and at least show that there are numbers here in the House who find certain aspects of it quite distasteful and unacceptable. Therefore, instead of being able to vote for a Bill which I think is basically reasonable, and 90 per cent of which I approve of, I have to vote against it, lock, stock and barrel, root and branch, because the Government have left me no alternative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments I make on the last Stage of this Bill will be very brief indeed.  I began my own contribution on this day with an appeal for caution and an appeal for fairness on both sides of the House.  I asked that the people who spoke against the terms of this legislation would not be branded as supporters of the Provisional IRA. I asked as well that we would not ever, at any stage during the debate, seek to score points for party political advantage which might distract from the very serious debate which was afoot.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald is a Senator for whom I have a very great respect, one of the Senators whose speeches I always read, but I find two things disturbing about his speech.  The first of these is that in a long delivery he suggests that Senator Browne is all right for oratory and rhetoric but that is all.  Then in his turn in a long and eloquent denunciation of the IRA Senator FitzGerald says: &ldquo;The IRA are trying to silence us&rdquo;.  He once again resurrects this old, old bogey by which people like myself who have expressed grave reservations about this legislation will be whipped.  That, Sir, is unfair and that ill becomes somebody who knows better.  It is now necessary for me this evening at a time I had not intended to speak to say once again that I am not a supporter of the Provisional IRA, and it is not for purposes of indicating support that I have made any of the comments I have made in this debate.</P>

      <P>I will be here tomorrow all day and I am willing to be educated.  I want to tease out what is involved by this notion of complimenting a person for oratory or for rhetoric, to compliment a person almost for intelligence and its implication for this Bill in response to debate on all of its Stages.  It is patronising at its best and it is dishonest at its worst; it is to say that the person has an eloquent argument, but it need not be taken seriously.  Of course, a consistency for which I compliment the Senator, it is related in its distortion of the truth. Senator Browne is sensitive to the needs of socially delinquent groups.  I suppose professionally, because of what I am engaged in, I would be also tagged with the same label.  We never appealed in all of this debate to the rights of socially delinquent groups.  We spoke about the rights of the citizenry in general.  My own two speeches so far spoke about the rights of citizens not only in present times but in future times.  It was not a partisan concern.  It was a general concern, and a general concern for the quality of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I raised was that of balancing the intentions of the occupant of a Minister in the Executive of the day against a guarantee of a Constitution, which transcends a particular generation.  It is so wrong at the end of a good debate to try to revive the old tarnish of the worst kind.  The argument that has been prosecuted by many of us here within the labour movement has been out of concern for the general rights of citizens.  We bring to this House, however badly or well, our own experience as citizens and our own practice.  We draw in different ways from that experience, but to suggest that we only represent those people is so very wrong.  Another aspect on which we made an appeal, one after the other was on the subject of the civil liberties.  We said we were in no way making allegations against the Garda Síochána.  Then a rhetorical question is asked by those who are not one of us: Is it to be thought that the Garda Síochána will betray their repute?  Who said they would betray their repute? We said that their repute must be copperfastened in the public mind by good law.  No person who stood here <Col N="620" /> in defence of civil liberties made any allegation against the Garda Síochána except to say that they were like any other community of workers in the State in that a tiny proportion of them might commit acts of which the majority might not approve.  Taken altogether, what have we at the end of the day?</P>
    <P>The IRA tarnish is revived.  The notion that we are attacking the Gardaí is revived.  The notion that, after all, we are airy-fairy people is revived.  The notion that we are really speaking about the rights of socially delinquent groups is offered as a distortion.  All so unfair in the second House of the Legislature. Therefore it becomes necessary for me to end my speech by saying in a few words what we were about.  It is right to say we differ from the perspectives of Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  We do not see repressive legislation as protective legislation.  Correct mark scored for that one.</P>
    <P>It is also true that we have not read the same books as the good Senator, for example, somebody who has read more in the past than in the present.  All the writers whom I have read recognise the necessity of legislation such as this. What a partial presentation of literary experience.  The main thrust of literature has dealt with the great transitions in life, be it from youth to age or from beauty to less than beauty, or something else.  It has never dealt with these conditions except to destroy them.  How fascinating that somebody who would speak about the requirements of men and of law being just for all citizens would be regarded as rehtorical and as a good auditor and that a distinguished lawyer who has said that all the writers he has read recognises the necessity for such laws as this would not be regarded as somebody who was a good orator.  The Senator sells himself short.  He is a very good orator and he is very good at rhetoric but he will forgive us if we insist that law must be subjected to scrutiny in the interests of all the citizenry, not only in this period but in future time.  It was his own colleague in the other House who said that judgment will be by the longer lines of history.  That is no special group or interest.</P>
    <P>We have deliberately, in this debate <Col N="621" /> so far, tried to keep it on that level to ask ourselves what is the quality of what we are doing now as law.  We have put oursevles beyond the position of saying who will occupy the Minister for Justice's chair at any time.  It is irrelevant to our argument who will occupy the Minister's chair at any time.  That is why again and again an insistent theme of what we have said has been that a ministerial assurance, in so far as it is personal and limited in time, is no adequate response for the assurances we have reasonably sought in scope and duration for these importunate laws.</P>

      <P>The Fifth Stage of this Bill has stemmed from an unfortunate miscalculation and misjudgment on the part of the Government is regard to what is required to be done to meet a situation.  I was Minister for Justice for three and a half years.  I realise the type of advice which is given to the Minister for Justice, the action which needs to be taken and the balance that has to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What any civilised Government does in a democratic State is to seek to deal <Col N="622" /> with subversion and violence in the most effective way possible within a reasonable civilised umbrella of legislation and powers.  That being the objective, what was the situation facing the Government two months ago or whenever they were coming around to a decision to introduce the resolution abrogating the Constitution and the consequent Bill which we are discussing? The situation was that they had offences against the State legislation approved by the Constitution.  I want to emphasise that because some people do not apprecitae it.  The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, approved by the Supreme Court, has been in accordance with the Constitution.  The Act of 1972, under section 3, deals effectively with the main problem.  This is the situation that faced the Government.  I am only dealing with the politcial judgement aspect of it.  Faced with that situation and with the undoubted problem of violence and unlawful organisations in our community, and with the activities mentioned by the Minister leading to the assassination of the British Ambassador and the bombs in Green Street courthouse, a security response was required.  The security response should have been an intensification of existing security arrangements and an overall guideline for the courts by way of substantially increased penalties within the existing list of offences.</P>
    <P>That is where, in the sense of political judgment, the Government should have gone without raising this ridiculous and outrageous scare which has done nothing but divide our community in a serious way.  The opportunity was there. The Criminal Law Bill is one with which the Opposition party are in agreement, subject to the question of the Army, about which we have serious reservations.  We are in agreement with that Bill as amended in Dáil Éireann.  That type of Bill should have been brought in in the first instance. There was no need for this legislation. It is a gross act of political misjudgment. I am not just speaking as a member of the party to which I belong. I say this very deliberately.  I am speaking on behalf of the members of the SDLP as well.  They have officially expressed this point of view to me as representatives of the responsible <Col N="623" /> minority in the North of Ireland and they view this as an act of gross misjudgment. If the Minister thinks I am not being straightforward about this he can check out what I am saying having met the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Responsible Army and Garda personnel concerned with security have the same point of view.  The whole area of security in the difficult state in which our community finds itself, both North and South, is one that should be handled in a sensitive manner.  I do not mind being tough when one has to be tough and I fully support the Minister in regard to the penalties under the Criminal Law Bill which we shall be debating shortly but it is very dangerous when we are seeking to establish, and enhance a reputation as a democratic State, that has regard for a Constitution, for laws and for respect for the individual, to introduce a Bill that is so totally unnecessary in the context of our situation.  This is where political judgment comes in.  If there were thousands of people being slaughtered around us, if a Lebanese situation existed in Dublin, Cork or Waterford, then we could declare a state of emergency.</P>

      <P>There have been serious offences but there is nothing that cannot be effectively dealt with by strengthening the existing security forces and the existing Offences Against the State legislation which is involved in the Criminal Law Bill.  What do we do? We declare a state of emergency.  This is accompanied by a panoply of publicity all over the world.  We incur a banana republic odium straight away and on top of that we introduce a Bill involving a radical change in regard to our existing situation as far as detention of people without trial is concerned, a situation that has existed since 1939, 24 hours, 48 hours and no more, and that as a limitation <i>in toto,</i> but we say no, seven days is the requirement.  Why should this be?</P>

      <P>No reason has been given why we require five extra days <i>incommunicado</i> for this purpose.  If we must have such a provision, in effect setting aside the Constitution, introducing detention up to seven days, we must as a civilised Parliament embody within such legislation safeguards that would be regarded in any other democratic society as being civilised.  I feel that a large part of the instinctive gut reaction of the people against this measure stems from this Bill we are discussing now. They would not have objected to an extension of the Offences Against the State legislation being incorporated into the Criminal Law Bill, a strengthening of the existing security situation through laws, penalties or extra personnel.  This is where the general public&mdash;and the media properly expressed it&mdash;feel in their hearts that this is wrong.  This legislation involves giving the sort of power the security forces do not want. Fundamentally, intelligent policemen or Army personnel, do not want this power.  They can handle the situation if they are given the facilities, the powers of arrest, the powers of search, given all the powers and penalties to the courts, given all that panoply of control, all of which I agree with.</P>
      <P>I view with horror the question of people being detained <i>incommunicado</i> for seven days and the whole question of the visitation to them of medical or legal personnel or relatives, being left in a vague manner.  I view that with very real abhorrence.  If I was in that position I would not allow that to be done and would insist on the elementary safeguard suggested here be written into this Bill.  If the Minister states it is contained in the Constitution, that it is there by reason of the normal practice that has operated over the years what is the objection to writing it into the Bill as Senator Mullen, Senator Ryan and myself proposed by way of amendment? This would be an enormous ease to the public mind at present.  The public are a highly intelligent sophisticated electorate.</P>

They are a very sophisticated electorate and in regard to this matter they have the gravest reservations.  It is primarily on this question of deprivation of human rights that they are most anxious.  We as a people have been conditioned for hundreds of years in regard to what the psychology of deprivation of liberty means.  This measure to deprive people of their rights for seven days, without recourse to the normal facilities they should be entitled to, is one that does not wear well with the public.  It does not wear well with any intelligent student of the whole area of human rights.</P>
      <P>I attended a seminar organised by the Institute of Public Administration in the Royal Marine Hotel in Dún Laoghaire which was opened by the Minister for Finance and I was asked to speak on human rights on Tuesday. I was questioned extensively by people from all over the world, not about the Constitution, not about the Criminal Law Bill, but about the detention for seven days without safeguards being written in and the suspension of the Constitution in order to achieve that. That does not wear well.  Whether it is called suspension or set aside, or immunity or invalidation&mdash;I am not going to get into legal semantics&mdash; effectively, the Constitution does not operate as far as this Bill is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the invalidation section which is written in here, the invalidation preamble in the Bill in relation to Article 28.3 of the Constitution.  I do not know what sort of semantics Senator Alexis FitzGerald wishes to engage in but I wish to say I have already said it in my Second Stage speech that there is nothing that brings the law into such disrepute as lawyers arguing semantics in regard to law.  I believe in the plain meaning of the article.  This is advice which was often given by the late Chief Justice Lavery in the Supreme Court and he was right.  What we are concerned about is the plain meaning of the section and let us not argue about semantics.  We are talking to the people outside who want to know their rights. They want us to speak plainly.  We in this parliamentary assembly try to communicate to them the plain truth of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can argue whether the Title to the Bill expresses what is set out in the Constitution.  It is my view that that is the basis for another expensive law suit because the reading in the Title is not in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.  I will not go into that because it is a matter for lawyers at another date.  We shall have a number of expensive law suits on foot of this Bill, but what is required&mdash;the Minister is aware of what I am speaking about&mdash;under this particular article is not written into the Title of the Bill.  However, that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>We have here a situation where the Constitution is not valid in regard to this Bill.  There is no point in lawyers trying to fool people; I believe they should be straight with people.  In case anybody has the idea that what I am saying is not true, I shall ask the Minister a practical question.  Why has this Bill been introduced and expressed to be an Emergency Powers Bill on foot of Article 28.3 of the Constitution?  If it does not invalidate the Constitution as far as that Bill is concerned, why set out that matter at all in the heading of the Bill and why bring in the Bill on the basis of a declaration of a national state of emergency?  Instead, why not confine the Government's necessary security measures to a continuing extension of the Offences Against the State Act legislation as is set out in the Criminal Law Bill?  If that does not make sense, I do not know what does.</P>
      <P>Senator M.D. Higgins and Senator Browne support my case on the basis of a sincere and devoted attachment to human rights.  I share that attachment but I should like to add to it a degree of common sense.  I realise the exigencies which face the Minister for Justice and the Government of the day.  I cannot see why they should bring in this divisive measure at this time when the matter could have been dealt with in the course of ordinary legislation for which they would have had the fullest support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to prevent this kind of situation arising again, and causing such discord in Parliament, in the media and among the people generally, we should not be so foolish&mdash;in the governmental sense&mdash;to create a confrontation <Col N="628" /> situation on a basic matter involving the suspension of fundamental human rights and involving this type of legislation.  Why should this be done? We are a small country.  All the Members of the Oireachtas are agreed on having a decent democratic republican society, a society in which we are reasonably free from social stress and tension, a society in which we can organise ourselves reasonably effectively, having a social and republican conscience&mdash;in the correct meaning of the word because that word must never be left to the people of violence to adopt for themselves.</P>
    <P>Why should we not be able to handle this type of situation without having the kind of divisive debates which have been taking place for the last three weeks?  It is in this area that I am suspect of the Government's intentions, this is the area that gives the impression that a stunt is on.  We all share a common concern in this area.  We, on the Opposition side, shall demonstrate this concern by supporting the Government in the next debate.  Therefore, why create the division?  Either the Government's motives are suspect or else it is plain stupidity.  There is no rationale.  In charity, I will take the view that it was just plain stupidity.</P>
    <P>If people with hubris wish to exercise their power in government in this manner, it is time to consider how they should be corralled and controlled. One of the ways&mdash;I offer this as a suggestion which should be considered either by this Government, some future Government or by an all-party committee&mdash;is that in the future we cannot and should not be enabled to pass a resolution of this kind unless by a two-thirds majority of each House of the Legislature.  The irresponsible behaviour of the last two weeks induces me to put this forward as a constructive suggestion.  It would mean that no Government, in reality, could even do this sort of thing in a cavalier manner because it would need to have the support of a percentage of independents or the main Opposition.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach in this matter, but I make this suggestion because I feel strongly <Col N="629" /> that some restraint of this kind will have to be written in to keep back mad dogs and people who seek just at the drop of a hat to renegue on the Constitution, on the declaration of the state of emergency, and in particular on the substantial diminution which is involved from two to seven days in human rights in regard to the deprivation of human liberty without as we have suggested the introduction of some basic restraints.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin made a very civilised stand for which he was rebuked in a very fascist-like attitude by the Minister for Lands this morning.  Senator Martin in a very constructive manner voted for the motion and voted for the Second Stage of the Bill but wanted the proper restraints written into the Bill so as to ensure that whatever measure emerged in regard to detention would at least be circumscribed by civilised controls.  For that stand he was treated as I just described this morning by a Minister of the present Government.  That is indicative of the attitude of mind.  The terrifying thing in regard to the exercise of power is that we are giving it to people who have lost their nerve and have lost all sense.  This is government by reaction.  It is a very serious matter which can be dismissed by Senator FitzGerald who I notice was totally absent this afternoon when this most fundamental series of amendments were being moved and debated.</P>

I regard the two amendments moved by Senator Mullen and the amendments in my name and Senator Eoin Ryan's name as being the most fundamental last bastion protection amendments involved in the series of amendments <Col N="630" /> here before the House and there was no contribution in regard to the matter from the Fine Gael Party.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commence by extending to Senator Lenihan the same charity that he offered in his assessment of us.  In that regard his contributions here in these debates invariably suffer from the fact that so many of us know him so well.  It has been suggested that this legislation represents a sad step and a bad day for democracy.  The answer to that has been very eloquently and fully given by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  It is a sad thing that the circumstances of our times forced this legislation on us.  It must be a matter for some pleasure that this legislation is being introduced in an entirely democratic way using the democratic process, subjected to the full glare of publicity and subjected to the most close and certain analysis.  There is nothing secret being done or proposed by the Government.  This is not an executive act not answerable anywhere. This is to be contrasted with the last time that the liberty of a citizen was interfered with.  In 1957 in a situation that had not any of the elements of seriousness now unhappily existing in this country, the reaction was not to come into Parliament and invite debate or come into Parliament to put a limited measure before the Oireachtas for its assessment and its judgment or to invite the media of the country to report line by line for the education of the people of the country what was happening.  It is pertinent at this stage to recall so that our sense of proportion and balance is maintained that the reaction at that time was to make a proclamation&mdash;an executive act purely and simply.  As a result of that proclamation made the day after the Oireachtas rose when there was no hope of it being challenged here for the entire length of a long recess, powers were taken to detain people not for a maximum of seven days but indefinitely and without any rights whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To show that was not, to use modern <Col N="631" /> jargon, a once-off notion or that this could be dismissed as being the thinking of the executive for the administration in 1957, I have to recall that so short a time ago as 1970, when the Government immediately preceding this Government was in office, the Government solemnly proposed to this State that internment would be re-introduced. That was a Government of which Senator Lenihan who has been crying here for democracy and human rights was a member.</P>
    <P>Internment does not involve coming in here having the matter examined and teased out by parliamentarians and having it exposed to examination by the Press.  It is an executive act that can be done behind closed doors, literally at the stroke of a pen and liberty is gone. That was solemnly proposed and proposed on a television broadcast because there was threat of kidnapping.  I suppose there was a certain wisdom in shaking the fist before anything happened but we are here in this situation where there have been these serious incidents.  I will not go over all this ground again but they culminated in two incidents that had a different and horrifying dimension.  Our international standing was struck at by the murder of the ambassador, The very administration of justice was struck at by the explosions in Green Street.  In recognition of those two climatic events and a series of lesser events preceding them, and in recognition of the ever present and, unfortunately, not diminishing but possibly increasing state of armed conflict in Northern Ireland and its palpable effects down here in terms of the identity and place of residence of perpetrators of many crimes down here, and the way the cult of violence rampant up there has infected the activities of criminals down here and made them more violent and extreme, the Government, not as a political gesture, not as a piece of window dressing, but fully conscious of their obligation as the temporary guardian of the institutions of this State and of the freedom of the citizens asked the Oireachtas to declare a state of emergency.</P>
    <P>On foot of that state of emergency the Government are proposing to the <Col N="632" /> Oireachtas, in the full glare of publicity and daylight, this limited measure that requires the immunity granted by Article 28.  It would have been much easier and it would not have surprised anybody if the Government had introduced internment.  There was a general expectation that in the aftermath of those atrocious events this might be the Government's response.  If that been the response this Parliament would not have the privilege of coming and debating human rights and their curtailment in this very limited fashion.  It is important that a sense of perspective and a sense of balance be maintained in regard to this whole area.  It is important, too, that democrats in this time under the pretence of considering themselves to be enlightened democrats do not actually become blinkered democrats and have so narrowed their view of democracy and their view of what is happening around them that they fail to see the enemy coming up from behind and from the side.</P>
    <P>Some of the speeches made in the course of this debate indicate to me that very sensitive and concerned people are, unfortunately, for whatever reasons, blinkered and, therefore, not seeing in its entirety the world in which they are living.  Perhaps they prefer to be blinkered.  Perhaps they want the luxury of the narrow view because it shuts out unpleasant things.  Those of us who are temporarily charged with responsibility for maintaining our institutions and safeguarding our freedoms cannot afford the luxury of a narrow view.  We have to see democracy and society as they are, warts and threats and all. Seeing that we have to react as we, in our judgment, think fit.  We have been trusted to make that judgment by the electoral process and we have no fear of seeking a vindication of that judgment in due course.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this measure represents, as Senator Lenihan so extravagantly said, the abrogation of the Constitution and the setting aside of the Constitution.  I dread to think what impression he gave to the foreign visitors to whom he spoke on the subject of human rights when these are the views he is expressing here.  The Constitution is not suspended.  The <Col N="633" /> Constitution is not abrogated.  This must be said over and over again because the contrary false assertion is continually being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the power taken under this Bill to detain for seven days and the Bill in which it is taken are immune from constitutional challenge.  That is the beginning and end of this so-called suspension of the Constitution.  That is an eventuality that the very Constitution itself, the very repository of our freedom and our safeties, envisages and anticipates.  It recognises a situation could arise where that might have to be done.  To that limited extent there is constitutional immunity from challenge, an extent limited to the particular Bill which, in turn, is limited to this particular power to restrict a citizen's liberty for up to seven days without charging.  We must get both our perspectives and our proportions right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was alleged in the course of the debate that the powers given in this Bill to be exercised by the Garda could lead to an alienation of our Garda from the people.  I do not know why anyone should put forward that proposition because there has never been anything whatever in the entire relationship between that force and the population for the past 50 years or more to give the slightest credibility or the slightest sustenance to that particular argument and I regret to say that that argument was put forward by drawing a false analogy between this State and an adjoining jurisdiction where there are clear reasons why there was such an alienation and all that stemmed from it.  Our Garda are integrated with our community.  They are part of our community.  They are not identified with any particular section, sector, class or political faction.  They identify completely with the people because they are of the people; they are themselves the people.  There has been nothing whatever in their entire conduct in the discharge of their duties since the foundation of this State that could give rise to anybody now suddenly feeling that, because of this limited power they <Col N="634" /> are given in this Bill, they will suddenly go berserk and so conduct themselves that they will alienate and set at nought this tradition built up over the last 50 years.  They are a highly disciplined force, highly sensitive as to their role within the community.  I am peculiarly in a position to know their thinking and feeling on this matter and I can assure the House that I gladly, and with complete trust, approve of their getting the powers proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This leads me to comment very critically on something Senator Lenihan said. I do not know the status or the strength of the information that led him to say that there was a Garda and Army point of view totally opposed to these powers.  I must qualify that again by repeating that I have no indication, and Senator Lenihan did not give us any indication, of the status or the strength of that particular view, whether it was just gossip or in what way it came to him but, as he has said it here publicly, I must comment on it lest it go unanswered.  With regard to the Army, this is not a matter for the Army at all.  With regard to the police, it is a matter for the police.</P>
    <P>The justification I gave for coming before the Oireachtas with this measure was that the Garda had convinced me and, through me, the Government that they required and needed this measure in order effectively to strengthen their hand in their fight against terrorism and gangsterism.  I repeat that and that is completely at odds with what Senator Lenihan purports to have heard and what he advances here.  What he advances can be described at best as mischievous and it is certainly contrary to the facts.  I state that quite categorically.</P>
    <P>He also made reference to the views of the SDLP Party of Northern Ireland &mdash;that they are opposed and they consider that the Government have made an error in proposing this legislation.  I respect the views of that party.  Certainly we all respect the views of that party, and they are entitled to whatever view they please, but their views can no more divert us from this course than their views that the Fianna Fáil position of calling for a declaration of intent in Northern Ireland placed them in the <Col N="635" /> same camp as the Provisionals deflected Fianna Fáil from continuing holding that view.  In the same way, we will continue to hold our view while respecting their right to criticise it.</P>
    <P>What has worried Senators chiefly with regard to this legislation has been the rights of a person detained under it with regard to legal access, knowledge of his whereabouts, the rights to have a doctor visit him.  On the question of medical access, when it was first raised I felt it carried an implication that it would be necessary by virtue of the detention.  Lest that implication be not finally removed I want to take this opportunity on Fifth Stage once again to refute it categorically.  I have said sufficient about the traditions and standards of conduct of our Garda to be able to say completely and convincingly, in the knowledge that this is what the people know, that this implication has not a shred of truth to substantiate it.  There is no reality whatever in it.</P>
    <P>This provision in this Bill does not take away in one iota the rights which citizens have in those areas.  The rights which they have in those areas are guaranteed by the Constitution.  They are part of their constitutional rights and it is my opinion for us to attempt now to start defining these would lead us into a very murky and difficult legal area.  I indicated here, and I say it again, that it is my considered opinion that the first assessment would have to be consideration of whether the rights of citizens are more properly vindicated and protected by leaving the position as it stands, where those rights are guaranteed by the Constitution or the position of the citizen is improved by attempting to define these rights.  That is the first examination.  It is an examination which I will get under way.  That <Col N="636" /> point must be cleared and, as of now, my feeling is that the position as under the Constitution&mdash;and bear in mind that that is the position which has pertained since 1937 and right through the entire currency of the 1939 Act, which provided for people being deprived of their liberty for up to 48 hours&mdash;is amply safeguarded.  Can any Senator say to me that there has been a widescale deprivation of rights, a campaign or contention looking for rights of which people have been deprived, or that there have been abuses of citizens?  No Senator can say that to me.  We must take account of the reality of life as we find it and not of the theories as we think it might be in some abstract way.</P>
    <P>This, again, is possibly the blinkered and luxurious view, the failure to look at the real world.  I am quite satisfied that the apprehensions expressed here, genuinely expressed, but which have snowballed, are misheld and are not genuine apprehensions.  I point to experience, in the first place, and to the Constitution in the second place to sustain me in that view.  This measure is a proper measure, adequate for the situation with which we are faced.  It is a measure of reasonable response by a Government concious of their democratic obligations, conscious of the traditions to which they succeed.  It is a measured and adequate response and holds the balance adequately and correctly between the need to safeguard democracy and, at the same time, take account of personal rights.  I commend the Bill with confidence to the House.  It has been suggested in some way that it should not have been a matter of contention at all.  My short answer to that is&mdash;the Government did not make it a matter of contention.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Law Bill, 1976: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum that was circulated with the Bill will, I hope, provide sufficient detail to be of assistance to Senators, though amendments that have been made to the Bill during its passage through Dáil Éireann are not referred to in the explanatory memorandum. The Bill, which has 16 sections, proposes to make a number of amendments in the criminal law.  Some of those amendments relate directly or indirectly to the Offences Against the State Acts but even those that are not in terms related to those Acts are designed primarily to strengthen the law against those who actively participate in subversive activities and those who assist them, although some of them could, in practice as well as in theory, apply to certain crimes unconnected with subversive activity.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is the definitions section. The terms &ldquo;governor&rdquo; and &ldquo;prison officer&rdquo; are defined in the section to include Army personnel in any military establishment to which prisoners are transferred to military custody under the Prisons Act, 1972, and the term &ldquo;Defence Forces&rdquo; is defined as the Permanent Defence Force within the meaning of the Defence Act, 1954.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for increased maximum penalties for a number of offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Details are given in the table in paragraph 3 of the explanatory memorandum.  The Government are satisfied that the maximum penalties in the 1939 Act are totally inadequate in present circumstances.  This applies not only to offences that are the subject of frequent prosecutions such as membership of an unlawful organisation but also to offences such as the obstruction by any form of intimidation of the carrying on of the government of the State which are contrary to section 7 of the 1939 Act but some of which appear to be difficult in practice to prove so that prosecutions for them are infrequent.  Infrequent though prosecutions for them may be, these are very serious offences and the maximum penalty for them should reflect that fact.  In providing for this, it is also desirable, as a matter of principle, to retain an appropriate internal relationship between the various offences specified in the 1939 Act. Accordingly, if a maximum penalty of 20 years is provided, as the Bill proposes, for an offence against section 7 of the 1939 Act&mdash;an offence referred to in the side note to the section as &ldquo;obstruction of government&rdquo;&mdash;it would be inappropriate to have lower maximum penalty for an offence under section 6&mdash;an offence described in the side note as &ldquo;usurpation of functions of government&rdquo;, even though there have been few if any prosecutions for offences against section 6.  It would be inappropriate because an offence under section 6 could not in principle be regarded as of a lesser order of importance than an offence under section 7.  In proposing substantially increased maximum penalties for these offences, the Government had regard to the fact that the activities of unlawful organisations pose a direct threat to the Government and the institutions of government in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum penalty for the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation is two years and the Bill proposes to raise this maximum to seven years. The point has been made more than once in recent times that such a proposal is irrelevant in view of the fact that the courts rarely impose the present maximum.  However, I would point out <Col N="639" /> that the courts, when deciding on a penalty, have to take account of the fact that a particular maximum is prescribed by law and it is a fair assumption that they look on that maximum as something that ought to be reserved for the exceptional circumstances&mdash;what one might describe as the worst cases as shown by the evidence before them.  If, however, the Oireachtas decides to increase that maximum substantially, the courts are then discharging their functions in a new framework and they can, and I have no doubt will, take account not only of the wider discretion allowed by the new law but also of the clear intentions of the Oireachtas as to the inherent seriousness of the crime.</P>
    <P>Section 3 proposes that any person who recruits other persons into an unlawful organisation or who incites or invites other persons to join an unlawful organisation will be guilty of an offence carrying a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment.  This section is aimed at those who recruit people, usually impressionable young people, into unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>The section is concerned with a particular evil the essence of which is recruiting for unlawful organisations and it is clearly right to deal with it by a specific provision referring to the kinds of conduct aimed at and providing the appropriate penalty.  The offence is not to be limited to recruitment for the organisation or to incitement to join the organisation but will extent to incitement to help the organisation by other activities which might not be easily identifiable as specific offences so that persons could be successfully prosecuted for incitement to commit them.  The proposed offence will apply to inviting as well as inciting.  By providing a higher penalty for bringing other people into an unlawful organisation than for being a member, the Bill will show clearly that the Legislature regards recruiting as even more serious than membership.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the closing of buildings used for the purposes of an unlawful organisation.  It proposes to amend section 25 of the 1939 Act by increasing the initial period of operation of a closing order from three to 12 months and authorising an extension <Col N="640" /> for a period or periods not exceeding 12 months but so that the total period of closure shall not exceed three years.</P>
    <P>Section 5 proposes to replace section 29 of the 1939 Act and relates to the issue of search warrants.  The new section empowers a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent to issue a search warrant to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant in respect of any place in the circumstances outlined in the section. The member authorised may be accompained by any member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The new section provides for the issue of a warrant in respect of any evidence&mdash;section 29 only covered documentary evidence.  Moreover, section 29 provided for the issue, by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent, of the warrant to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector but the new section enables a warrant to be issued to a member not below the rank of sergeant.  This latter change is proposed because the requirement that an inspector be in charge has caused substantial difficulties especially in circumstances where it was very important that several searches be carried out simultaneously.</P>
    <P>There could be situations where unarmed gardaí executing such search warrants might need to seek assistance from the Defence Forces and, accordingly, provision is made to authorise members of the Defence Forces to accompany and assist gardaí to carry out searches under the section.  A person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct a search or who refuses to give his name and address or gives a false or misleading name or address will be liable on conviction on indictment to five years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to escape from lawful custody.  Subsection (1) proposes to make it an offence to aid a person to escape from lawful custody or to harbour such person after escape.  A person on conviction on indictment of an offence under this subsection may be sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Subsection (2) makes it unlawful to convey articles into or out of a prison contrary to any rules or regulations in <Col N="641" /> force in relation to a prison and provides a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment.  Subsection (3) empowers a prison officer in the interests of security to search any person while he is in prison or in the custody of the governor of a prison.  The prison rules provide for such searching and the object of the section is to provide for it by statute.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum points out that the section&mdash;that is, section 6&mdash; does not deal with escape itself, but only aiding or harbouring.  Escaping is a common law offence, as indeed are aiding and harbouring, at all events where aiding and harbouring are related to felonies, but escaping, of itself and unrelated to the use of force, is of no special relevance to subversive activities and any question of amending the law in regard to it will have to await another Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards aiding and harbouring, the proposed penalty, strange though it may seem, is in theory a reduction since, by reason of general provisions or principles of the common law, such offences could carry life imprisonment at the moment though I must qualify that by saying that it is possible that some old statutory provisions might be interpreted as having modified the common law rule in some respects.  Be that as it may, I need hardly say that it is not my intention in proposing this new section to seek to diminish the seriousness of these offences but quite .tethe contrary.  I am in no doubt that if a case were to come before the courts they would regard the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for such an offence as an anachronism that could not be regarded as a useful guideline.  By providing for a statutory offence with a realistic maximum penalty, the Oireachtas will be providing an up-to-date guideline reflecting in a realistic and credible way the seriousness of these offences.</P>
    <P>Section 7 proposes to give power to the Garda in relation to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act or under the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, to do all or any of the things that are specified in subsection (1).  The Garda already have some of these powers in relation to person taken <Col N="642" /> into custody under the 1939 Act and the additional powers are being proproposed so as to enable palm prints to be taken and clothing and so on to be examined scientifically.  Obstruction of the Garda when exercising powers under this section will be an offence carrying a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 8 relates to situations in which the Garda require vehicles to halt, as for example, at road checkpoints when they suspect that offences of the kind specified in the section have been, are being or are about to be committed. The Garda at present have no general power of search of vehicles without warrant.  They already have power under section 109 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, to require a driver to stop a vehicle.  The Bill proposes to give them powers of search whenever they are investigating any of the offences specified, which by the way, with a few exceptions, are all, under existing law, offences in respect of which the Garda have powers of arrest without warrant. If either before or after the search the Garda suspect that any occupant of the vehicle is concerned in any offence to which the section applies or that there is evidence of such an offence in the vehicle or on anybody in the vehicle, then, under this proposed section of the Bill, they can search all or any of those persons.  The Garda are also being given power in this section of the Bill to place barriers in front of vehicles to force them to stop whenever the Garda are operating pursuant to the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>There is a need for these Garda powers.  Many serious crimes that have been perpetrated in recent years have necessitated the mounting of widespread road checkpoints by the Garda with the assistance of the Army in an effort to apprehend the culprits.  On occasions too, checkpoints have been mounted where the Garda had reason to fear that some particularly serious offence would be attempted.</P>
    <P>The public have co-operated exceptionally well on these occasions and indeed the readiness with which all but a very small minority have co-operated is, I think, evidence that the public recognise very fully that these road <Col N="643" /> blocks, inconvenient though they be, are necessary for the protection of the public and that the vast majority of people would unhesitatingly agree that it is right that the Garda should have a clear right to insist on checking a car in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the exercise of these powers is being restricted to situations where the Garda are investigating offences of the kind set out in the section. It is proposed in section 15 of the Bill to give the Defence Forces like powers when a specific request for their assistance is made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent.</P>
    <P>While I have said that the Garda have no general right to search cars, the fact of the matter is that public acceptance of the need for such action, in present circumstances, particularly, is so near to being unanimous that the person who refuses to co-operate is virtually asking to be treated as a suspect and, of course, when the Garda have reasonable grounds for suspicion, they have a number of powers which they can call on.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides a power for members of the Garda, the prison staff or the Defence Forces to seize anything found by them in the course of searches which they believe to be evidence of an offence or suspected offence.  Subsection (2) provides that a document relating to legal advice may not be seized or retained unless there is reasonable cause to suspect that it was not used or intended solely for the purpose of obtaining, using or communicating such advice.  The section provides also that anything seized can be retained for a reasonable time, if proceedings are introduced, until the conclusion of the proceedings where it is required for use in evidence.  Thereafter the Police Property Act, 1897, will apply.  The 1897 Act makes provision for the disposal of property that has come into the possession of the Garda in connection with a criminal charge.  An application to the District Court may be made either by the Garda or by a claimant of the property and the court may make an order for its disposal.  The Bill proposes that this will also be the case in <Col N="644" /> relation to anything that is seized under section 9.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill prohibits unauthorised possession by a prisoner or by a visitor to a prisoner while the visitor is in the precincts of the prison of photographs, sketches or such like of a prison, Garda station or courthouse and it provides a maximum penalty for an offence of five years' imprisonment. Subsection (3) exempts from the prohibition the possession of such a document in a courthouse where it is intended for production, use or reference in that courthouse.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the offences of kidnapping, false imprisonment and &ldquo;hi-jacking&rdquo; of vehicles to be felonies and for a penalty of life imprisonment for a person guilty of kidnapping or guilty of false imprisonment.</P>
    <P>In section 12 we are dealing with the serious problem posed by bomb hoaxes. These hoax calls are numerous.  They not only cause serious inconvenience to the business and social life of the country but cause serious economic loss both directly and because they involve, in many cases, the deployment of Garda resources to investigate them.  Senators will be aware that the streets of central Dublin have had to be cordoned off and cleared on many occasions in recent times.  Anyone who makes such hoax calls will under the Bill's proposals be liable on conviction to go to prison for five years.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 13 of the Bill. The incidence of assaults by prisoners on prison officers, assaults by prisoners on other prisoners, rioting and wilful damage to prisons and prison property has been on the increase.  The prisoners concerned who are usually serving lengthy sentences are aware that, when they are prosecuted, the courts have tended to impose sentences which are concurrent with the sentences they are already serving, with the result that the sentence really means nothing.  This section of the Bill proposes that a sentence consecutive on the sentence being served be imposed in every case of this kind with the proviso that consecutive sentences passed by the District Court shall not in the aggregate exceed 12 months.  As Senators will appreciate, the proviso is included for one reason <Col N="645" /> only, namely, as a safeguard against the risk that the provision might otherwise involve giving a greater jurisdiction to the District Court than the Constitution would permit.</P>
    <P>Section 14, which relates to definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;, is dealt with fully in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 15 proposes to confer on the Defence Forces certain limited powers of arrest and search in situations where they are on duty in uniform and only in response to a request by a Garda superintendent.  The members of the Defence Forces are being given exactly similar powers to the powers the Garda have&mdash;no more and no less&mdash;in relation to the offences set out in section 8 of the Bill and only those offences and only, too, when those members are operating following a request by a Garda superintendent and during the period specified in that request.  The giving of these powers to the Army will enable the Garda and the Army to deploy their resources to the maximum advantage and to initiate the most rapid and effective response possible to every situation calling for action by them when investigation of any of the listed offences may so require.  Subsection (8) provides that the section shall have effect only as long as the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 is in force.</P>
    <P>The extra powers will be utilised only to meet a special exigency and then only in relation to a particular spot at a particular time.</P>
    <P>The final section of the Bill is section 16.  Subsection (1) gives the Short Title. Subsection (2) is a transitional provision the effect of which is that the increased penalties being provided in sections 2 and 11 of the Bill will not apply in relation to offences committed before the Bill becomes law and that section 13 (1) declaring the offences of kidnapping, false imprisonment and hijacking of vehicles to be felonies will not apply to such offences committed before the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be seen as providing an acceptable toughening of the law against subversive type crimes and as such I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the other House <Col N="646" /> we will support the principle of this measure subject to the exceptions about which I will speak.  The principle of the measure can be summarised in the Minister's last sentence when he said that he hoped the Bill would be seen as providing an acceptable toughening of the law against subversive type crimes. We support this Bill unequivocably.  The Minister can be assured that on the sections in the Bill concerned with the toughening of the law against the activities of any organisation in the State seeking to rule outside the law and through such criminal methods to achieve some crazy form of power, either of the Orange or Green category, we totally support him in any endeavour in that respect.</P>
      <P>We do this on the basis of security provisions, personnel provisions, financial provisions and legal provisions that respect the Constitution of the day and do not upset constitutional safeguards in regard to personal liberty.  This Bill, subject to certain exceptions, meets the requirements that we, as a responsible party, would envisage in a democratic country, as being appropriate to deal with the situation.  As I said earlier this was the type of measure we should have been debating in a constructive manner. Subject to a major reservation in regard to the introduction of the Defence Forces under section 15, and because of the Minister's response to reasoned amendments put down by my party in Dáil Éireann, we are in a position to accept this Bill with a major reservation in regard to section 15, which we propose to oppose.  We feel very strongly, that as a matter of principle, the Defence Forces, now defined by the Minister categorically to exclude the FCA, should not have, for certain very valid reasons, police powers as envisaged under section 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree totally with the Minister in regard to section 2 which deals with maximum penalties.  I can see the point of view in regard to penalties that say that the courts at the moment are not imposing the maximum limits.  I believe in the moral persuasion of the Legislature in writing in stiffer penalties into legislation.  I believe that that moral pressure can be a very important factor in ensuring that there will be stiffer <Col N="647" /> penalties imposed by our courts.  Once the guideline is set down in the section I would expect the Judiciary to follow that guideline as being representative of the views of all of us who want to see any form of subversion or crimes of violence dealt with in the proper manner.  I am sure the courts will follow that lead.  We fully support the substantially increased penalty levels under section 2.</P>
    <P>We are very glad that the Minister has seen fit to withdraw from the rather ludicrous position in which he and the Government found themselves initially, by having an incitement offence so broadly phrased and drafted, that, in effect, muzzled anybody who had any political opinion to express in relation to the North of Ireland or the people who reported such opinion in our media.  This envisaged, in the broad manner in which it was drafted, and gave to the State a power in regard to the prosecution of people that was totally unwarranted in any democratic society.</P>
    <P>The section as it stood stated: &ldquo;whereby, expressly or by implication, by advertisement, propaganda or any other means, incites or invites another person...&rdquo; and so on.  That type of loose drafting would almost have enabled an excessively orientated State to put a person in jail for singing the National Anthem.  In regard to the national newspapers, local newspapers and people concerned with the democratic status of the Fourth Estate&mdash;it is fundamental that we have people reporting our proceedings&mdash;it is fundamental that they can fully report our proceedings, fully report the proceedings of political meetings, political gatherings, assemblies or comment made by political personages.  This is very basic to the survival of democratic life and to the survival of constructive and responsible democratic politics. These people are doing a service for the community.  They are a very real interrelated help in ensuring that the public are informed about what the Executive of the day is doing.</P>
    <P>It is true that partnership of activity between the Press and the media on the one side and the politicians and leaders <Col N="648" /> of the community on the other side, each in their own way making a contribution towards the public debate within the community, must continue to go on in an attempt to achieve the progress we want.  It is in that way we achieve improvement within the freedom of our society.  The section as it stood was outrageous.  The Minister saw the wisdom of our way.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on meeting the situation and in adopting the phrase we suggested in our Dáil amendment which meets the real evil and danger that a sensible Minister for Justice would be trying to overcome.  It is the question of recruitment.  As it was originally phrased the Bill seemed to be directed at the media.  It seemed to be directed at censorship in regard to comment on public utterance.  The section as now suitably cut down in accordance with our amendment in the Dáil brings in the very vital word &ldquo;recruit&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Recruit&rdquo; was not in the original section.  The section now seeks to deal with a person who recruits another person for an unlawful organisation or who incites or invites another person to join an unlawful organisation. It is getting at the person who is using his mature position in life to influence, invite or recruit people to join an unlawful organisation.  The section as cut down meets that type of person.  It rightly excludes the ridiculous situation that would have arisen under the original section 3 where incitement was at large to include every form of political comment, or song or ballad or discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on meeting our views on section 3 and meeting the views of all the sensible people throughout the country who expressed themselves accordingly. In particular he met the views of the media who have a very responsible part to play in the development of our democratic society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree with section 4 which deals with closure of buildings, something which is very necessary in regard to unlawful organisations.  Section 5 deals with search warrants.  We agree fully <Col N="649" /> with toughening up the police measures in regard to search warrants.</P>
    <P>We agree with section 3 which deals with harbouring people who have escaped lawful custody.  We agree fully with section 7 dealing with Garda powers.  We agree with section 8 dealing with traffic checkpoints.  It is a toughening up of the existing provisions and powers which the Garda have.  We agree fully with section 9 providing for seizures by prison staff or Defence Forces.  We agree fully with section 10.  We agree with section 11.</P>
    <P>We are in complete agreement with section 12.  I deplore totally the bomb hoaxer parasite in our society.  In fact, if I allowed myself to use other than parliamentary language, I know what I would do with that particular type of individual.  I totally support the penalties and increased controls envisaged under section 12 in connection with that type of offence which is regarded by everybody as despicable.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 cover matters with which we agree.  We do not agree with section 15, although I appreciate the fact that the Minister has, in the Dáil, met to some degree the serious objections to that section.  By accepting an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil, the Minister has brought the section conferring these powers on the Army within the ambit of the 12 months' limitation which applies to the Emergency Powers Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I go along with the Minister's interpretation of what he is seeking to do.  There is a matter of principle involved here.  I understand the difficulties which face the Minister and the Government.  There are two aspects involved.  I am talking now about the Defence Forces involvement in police matters.  Firstly, it is wrong in principle&mdash;and I hope the Minister will agree with me&mdash;that Defence Forces personnel to the rank of private should have the same powers as Garda personnel who are trained and equipped, are an unarmed force, and are geared by way of education and training for a job which is totally separate from the independent job for which an Army is established.  Furthermore, there is the important point of principle that the Army and the Garda in any democratic community should be organised separately. It is a fundamental principle that we should have an independent Army separate from the police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that the exigencies demand that Army personnel should have the same powers as Garda personnel.  I appreciate that at the moment they are on duty in aid of the civil power under the direction of Garda personnel.  I feel strongly that that situation should be maintained. The Government's problem at present is due to the financial mess in which they find themselves.  For the sake of saving money&mdash;and this is a very dangerous breach of a principle which has been established since the foundation of the State&mdash;and because of the exigencies of the financial situation, in effect they are making policemen out of Army personnel and transferring them to do policemen's work because they will not pay policemen overtime and will not recruit enough police personnel.  I am inclined to be of a <Col N="651" /> pragmatic frame of mind and that is my view of what is happening.</P>
    <P>If the Government made the political decision to have the Garda personnel functioning for 24 hours of the day, on overtime rates, and recruited additional Garda personnel, there would not be any need for this gross breach of a principle which has been established since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The Army are most reluctant to do this job, and the Garda are reluctant to see the Army doing this job.  Both security forces were separately established, and they recognise their separate functions. They are concerned that these separate functions should be exercised in a separate and responsible way and that there should be a proper legal determination of the area of responsibility for the Garda and the Irish Army.  The Minister cannot deny that there is very serious opposition within both forces to this proposed measure at every level. The Garda recognise the dangers involved for people who are not trained, as they are trained, to do the search and arrest work envisaged here for Army personnel.  There is opposition from the Army who do not want to be engaged in that type of work and who recognise their separate function and operation.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity in our community to imitate what is being done in the six north-eastern counties.  We know the situation there has been exacerbated by the British Army operating in a police capacity.  Responsible people in Britain are realising this now.  I do not want to go into this at length but there is a total separation of responsibility in regard to the work of the two organisations. The British authorities are very conscious of the fact that the introduction of the British Army into a police area of activity in the North of Ireland has done no good to their Army, and it has done no good to many of our people.  It has lead to a general debasement of standards in the North and in the British Army.  That is a fact of life.  We all know about the absence of a respected police authority, and so on.  We do not want to transfer that type of situation down here.</P>
    <P>I feel it is purely because of the financial exigencies of the situation that this <Col N="652" /> is being done, but that is the wrong reason to do it.  It is wrong to breach an honourable tradition, an honourable principle, just because at the present time the Government cannot afford to pay the Garda overtime, cannot afford to recruit extra Garda personnel, cannot properly deal with the criminal situation and for this reason has, in effect, to get Army personnel to do police work on the cheap.  That is what I think is involved.  It is such a serious step that I can think of no other reason for it. We will be opposing that for the reason I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Other than that aspect, on which we will divide tomorrow and express our democratic position, we support the Bill, as it now stands.  We would have violently opposed section 3.  It has now been amended to limit the operation to recruitment and exclude the press and media censorship that was originally there.  We approve of the penalty section, of the search sections and the other firming up of police powers.</P>
    <P>We will be opposed to the introduction of the Army into police work.  I should like to say in conclusion that this is the sort of legislation that we could have been debating in a very sensible way without the introduction of any suspension of the Constitution or emergency powers legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on this Bill will be brief.  I regard certain aspects of this Bill as being necessary in the present situation.  It is extraordinary that during all the debate which took place on all the other Bills nobody ever made reference to the cause of the subversive activities which have been going on during the past eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real cause of all this trouble is the continued presence of the British troops in Northern Ireland.  If we can ever hope to achieve any measure of success or hope to achieve any measure of peace restoration in this country, then the British Government must play their role and decide on a date and a time when they will leave Northern Ireland and allow Irishmen to settle their affairs between themselves.  Until that day comes we can expect to have organisations springing up&mdash;subversive organisations, <Col N="653" /> gangster organisations&mdash; who will perpetrate acts of violence which were unheard of in Ireland before.</P>
    <P>Therefore I feel that, while Irish Governments want to do their best to ensure peace in our land and to ensure that this country continues on the road towards progress and prosperity, their efforts are being impeded by the activities of all illegal organisations.  We in the South tend to lay undue stress on the activities of the IRA but we cannot exclude the other illegal organisations that seem to have greater licence to indulge in illegal activities in this country, namely, the UVF, the UDA and that other dreadful, barbarous organisation called the SAS.  If the Army are to be used to assist the police force I feel that is one organisation that should be run out of this country whenever they set foot on any part of the Twenty-six counties, because in my opinion they are the successors of the Black and Tans.  They have no right whatsoever to cross the Border to arrest and apprehend people and I would like to hear the Minister say that those people will be dealt with in the same way as the IRA, the UVF and UDA or any other of the illegal subversive organisations which we have in this country.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that there were some amendments with regard to the section which dealt with inciting or inviting others to join illegal organisations.  I wonder will this legislation be strong enough to catch the real culprit in any organisation, the boss in the background, who is never heard of but who gives the orders to the unfortunates to go out and do their dirty work.  I feel that these are the people who must be arrested and apprehended if we are to achieve any measure of peace in this country.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful if this Bill will serve the purpose which is expected.  The real culprits are the intelligent, well-educated people who are making a good thing out of all this illegal activity, out of all the bank robberies that have taken place in recent times.  We know that all this money goes to the big boss, a practice somewhat similar to that of the gangster organisations in the North. It is extraordinary that despite the best <Col N="654" /> efforts of the Garda very few of those people have been apprehended and brought to court.  Until such time as those people can be starved of finance we can expect further bank raids and so forth.</P>
    <P>I believe, too, that the Garda could be instructed to do a better job in policing in so far as subversives are concerned, but I am afraid that at the present time the order which was made some months ago by the Minister for Justice instructing all Garda to have at least 200 summonses each year will have a detrimental effect on his efforts.</P>

      <P>That statement was issued in the papers and I watched carefully to see if the Minister would contradict it and he never did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has availed of the opportunity to contradict it, because the statement was made and it was never contradicted either by him or by any other member of the Government.  Indeed the Garda themselves were greatly disturbed by the fact that no effort whatsoever was made to contradict that statement because it would seem to indicate that the real role of the Garda is to book people, to issue summonses and have fines collected and to regard themselves as a sort of a back door method of collecting revenue for the Government.  I am glad that the Minister has availed of the opportunity tonight to contradict that statement, which appeared in the national press some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one reason why I say that the duties of the Garda could be directed more in pursuance of subversives than in trying to catch, apprehend or book the ordinary law-abiding citizen who drives in his car around the country.  It was extraordinary that on the day the British Ambassador was murdered here I was stopped twice in this city and my tax disc was checked twice.  The only conclusion I could come to on that occasion was that the Garda wanted a summons.  He did not care how he got it <Col N="655" /> or who it was.  The murder of the Ambassador was not his chief concern but to see was my car taxed on that occasion. I was only one of the thousands of citizens travelling through Dublin on that day.</P>
    <P>I feel that with the existing Garda force you could do a better job if proper directions were issued with regard to the chasing of the subversives and with regard to tracking down the criminals because I, like all other law-abiding citizens, have no time for any of those organisations&mdash;whether they are the IRA, the UVF, the UDA or the SAS or any other.</P>
    <P>I believe in the right of the people to elect their own Government and I believe in the right of that Government to make laws which they think fit to preserve the peace and to ensure political stability in this country.  Like Senator Lenihan I believe there is a great deal of disquiet and discontent among the members of the Defence Forces at the present time because of the new role which they will be asked to fulfil under section 15 of this Bill.  The Army personnel have always regarded their role as being purely that of a defensive nature but now new duties are being added to the existing ones.  While they are regarded as a defence force they are now being looked upon as a second police force.</P>
    <P>I come from a county where we have two barracks, one in Athlone and one in Mullingar.  I have met many members of the force who expressed disquiet and dissatisfaction with the section of this Bill which requires them to carry out duties hitherto unknown in so far as Army personnel were concerned.  Therefore, there is unrest because members of the armed forces feel that they are being asked to do something which they have never been trained for.  I do not know if any special training will be given to members of the Army to assist the police in carrying out searches of persons suspected of being involved in subversive activities.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Garda feel that their status is being lowered somewhat, that this is the thin end of the wedge and that eventually more and <Col N="656" /> more duties of a policing nature will be transferred to members of the armed forces.  These points are the real bone of contention.  I would hope that common sense would prevail and that the fears rampant both among members of the Garda and of the armed forces would be allayed and that a tightening-up of the duties of the Garda would be embarked upon to ensure that the Garda would be better equipped to chase subversives and to carry out their role as members of the police force, because there is a big difference between members of a police force and members of the armed forces.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the harbouring of people.  Again, this can be a dicey situation.  You can have members of an illegal organisation taking possession of an isolated farmhouse, as has happened, without the knowledge of the owner.  In County Westmeath in recent times members of an illegal organisation took possession of a farmhouse. The herd on the land knew this but was afraid to inform the Garda and he now finds himself before the courts through no fault of his own. Because he feared for the safety of his wife and children he did not inform the Garda and seek police protection as he should have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The court will take his cowardice into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a situation which must be guarded against because you can have innocent victims brought before a court, you can have people living in fear, you can have husbands living in fear for the safety of their wives and children&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that some flexibility would be written into the Bill to ensure that innocent victims would not be imprisoned or heavily fined in a situation like this.  Members of subversive organisations have intimidated people.  People are living in fear.  They are very few, but I would hope that some safeguards would be built into the Bill to allow those people to have greater access to courts.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the House.  I have not a lot to say because most of the points that have to be made on the Bill&mdash;following Senator Lenihan &mdash;will be Committee Stage points.  I will make a few general remarks.</P>
      <P>It struck me that in the debate on the last Bill there was an inordinate amount of protestation by the Opposition of how unpopular that Bill was to the general public.  These protests were made so often that there was a definite ring of whistling past the graveyard.  It was a debating point but they really were not sure.  I think they felt that they were on thin ice in taking the line they did and that there was misjudgment of public opinion.  That rather tip-toeing operation and the constant references to public opinion to justify their injudicious opposition to the Bill are in contrast to the almost tangible sense of relief that one finds in the Opposition benches as they reach the safe bank of this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this tangible sense of relief that the Opposition can reach out again for that new, but rather ill-fitting and skimpy, law and order suit.  It can be donned again on the safety of the bank with this Criminal Law Bill.  I got that sense of tangible relief very clearly in this House and also in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan said that it is totally wrong in principle to give the Army the powers that it is proposed to give them in this Bill.  I disagree; it is not totally wrong in principle.  It may be a change that we would rather avoid.  We will debate this in more detail on the section. I was disappointed in the hoary argument which he produced as if it was <Col N="658" /> something he just suddenly discovered. This argument has been trotted out right through this debate, that the Government cannot pay the Garda, that the Government will not pay overtime, that the Government should recruit more gardaí.  The Garda force is at its highest strength in the history of the State.  A further 500 are being recruited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about overtime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount being paid by way of overtime far exceeds the highest amount ever paid in the days of the Opposition.  It amounts to a very substantial sum indeed.  The point is that even if we were to treble the size of the Garda should that be an argument for leaving a uniformed and disciplined force that is in the service of the State standing&mdash;in that immortal phrase&mdash; idly by?  It would be the height of nonsense and it would be a gross error on the part of the Government to do so. Our soldiers are highly trained, loyal to the State and highly disciplined.  In the very limited way proposed in the section they are subordinate to the police because the primacy of the police is clearly set out in that section.  I think it is only right and proper that the Army should be utilised in the manner proposed.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan said that since the foundation of the State this principle of not giving police powers to the military has been in operation.  I will correct him.  It was necessary in the early days of the State to give police powers to the military.  Unfortunately the exigencies of that time demanded that they had to be given on a much wider scale than is proposed now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan also indicated&mdash;and Senator Keegan echoed him in this&mdash;that he got information from the Garda and the Army that these powers are not wanted.  I have not come across this.  I can imagine that there would be individual members of the Garda who would not fully appreciate the entire nuance of what is <Col N="659" /> involved, who might not have read the fine print of the Bill and who would not fancy this change.  In every walk of life there are people who are suspicious and slow to accept change.  I am sure there might be some members of the Army who would have the same point of view.  What I want to say is that I have not the slightest doubt that if this Parliament passes this law every member of the Garda and every member of the Army will loyally accept the law. I feel there is some feeling in the Opposition that they would be secretly pleased if this might not be so.  When they next come to debate this section they should remove that suspicion and clear themselves of any charge&mdash;</P>
