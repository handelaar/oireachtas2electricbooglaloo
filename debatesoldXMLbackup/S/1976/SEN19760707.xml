      <P>Last night I was trying to place the recent Supreme Court case on adoption in its proper context.  It was a case which shocked and outraged the public, and understandably so, but it was not an isolated or a freak case.  It could have arisen at any time down the years since 1952 because we have not ensured that our adoption code reflects essential basic principles.  The first principle which I examined is that the welfare of the child must be the paramount consideration.  This necessarily involves removing any legal disability or disadvantage to a child and therefore abolishing the concept of illegitimacy.  If the welfare of the child is paramount, then no child should start life in Ireland with legal disadvantages, the social stigma and with all the problems of being illegitimate in our society.  If the welfare of the child is paramount, then these must be abolished, as has been advocated by Bishop Casey, by the Council of Bishops, by people involved in seeking change, the Charter for Children which I quoted and, obviously, Cherish, the association of single mothers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The second principle is that the choice open to the single mother whether to place the child in adoption or to keep it herself must be a real one.  To exercise a genuine choice the single mother needs adequate and objective counselling during her pregnancy and she needs help to cope with the whole combination of social and economic problems she faces.  At present Irish society does not provide these types of services, in-depth counselling and adequate back-up services, if the single mother decides to keep her child.  I made the point last night that it is very important that Irish society affirm strongly the right of a mother to keep her child, if she wishes to, and encourage and support her in that choice.  This has been one of the imbalances in the operation of adoption, that Irish society has not genuinely made this affirmation.  Proof of this is illustrated by a brief report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21st May, 1976, about a mother who adopted her own son.  A single mother had put a notice in the newspaper announcing that she had adopted her own son.  Obviously the mother in question is perfectly entitled to do this.  But it is a reflection on our society that a mother feels the necessity, in some artificial way, to affirm and reinforce her relationship with her child.  Of course what that single mother was doing was trying to get over the disabilities her child would suffer.  It is a very sad reflection on our society that there would be even one single mother feeling the necessity to adopt her own child. That really does identify one weakness in our present approach.</P>
    <P>Therefore the first principle is the fact that the welfare of the child must be of paramount consideration.  The second principle is that adoption must be based on a real choice as a result of adequate counselling, adequate knowledge of the services that will be available if she decides not to place her child in adoption.  The third principle, which I had just begun to examine last night, is that adoption law, procedure and practice should operate equally with high standards and strict control for adoption societies: this includes the class of children <Col N="1089" /> who became available for adoption and the way in which the practice operates throughout the country.  The first step here would be that the categories of children to be adopted should be broadened.  They should be broadened to include those who have been seriously maltreated or abandoned by their parents who are married parents.  This is not the first time that I have raised this subject in this House, nor am I the only Senator. In the debate on the Government Bill on 9th July, 1974 this matter was raised, first by me and then by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in much greater detail.</P>
    <P>At that time the Minister seemed to be of the view that there might be some constitutional impediment although he expressed interest and indeed I think he in the end seemed to be persuaded by the need to broaden the category of children.  He gave at least indirect indication of an intention to examine the position and bring in a subsequent Bill to deal with the position.  For example, at columns 958-9 of Seanad Official Report of 9th June, 1976, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have listened closely to the arguments put forward.  I sympathise with the argument which asks what kind of a Constitution do we have if it gives rights which prevents justice being done to those children. This is an argument which is difficult to resist.  One answer would possibly be to seek an interpretation from the Supreme Court on the Bill suitably amended to cover this point before it becomes law.  I will give this matter consideration.  There will be a question of delay but as Senator FitzGerald stated that might be overcome by a separate Bill dealing with this point.  I foresee a serious drafting difficulty.  When one talks of a drafting difficulty one is inclined to dismiss it as a legal technicality, but in this case I suggest it is more.  When is a child abandoned?  When is the act of abandonment final and complete? At what stage can the law or society say to the natural parents &ldquo;You have abandoned your child forever&rdquo;?  Is society entitled to say <Col N="1090" /> that to a natural parent, who possibly for reasons beyond their control such as financial, psychological, physical, had at some stage to part with the child either to a foster home or to an institution?  If it should happen the causes which provoked such parting with the child were removed or disappeared and that a stable home was then available for the child with its natural parents, possibly with brothers and sisters, who are we to say that that child would not be better off back in its own home rather than to be left in the foster home?</P>
    <P>I quoted the Minister at some length there because I think he raises a whole series of issues which somehow never seem to be raised in the case of a single mother.  Why might the single mother not provide the good and stable home for the child if she had adequate back-up support and if the legal, social and economic disabilities were removed?  I think that there is an unreal distinction between natural and married parents, so that married parents apparently have unlimited rights in relation to their children, rights to seriously illtreat them, to abandon them, to forego all their responsibilities as parents without forfeiting inalienable rights which allow them to do this.  Consequently, such legitimate children cannot be placed in adoption where they could have a happy and loving, caring relationship with adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>This issue now takes on even greater seriousness because of the proclaimed intention by the Government to bring in a Constitutional amendment. In the Lower House on 17th June, 1976, the Taoiseach said on the Order of Business, at column 1185 of the Dáil Official Report:</P>
    <P>The intention is to proceed with the constitutional amendment as soon as it is possible to get the Bill drafted.  Because of the possibility that the 1952 Act is unconstitutional, it is felt that it should be put beyond any doubt.  For that reason, it is proposed to introduce a constitutional amendment.  If it is ready, it will be introduced before <Col N="1091" /> the recess, if not, it will be introduced immediately after it.</P>
    <P>I know some Senators and, perhaps, the Minister, would prefer not to open up this whole area of the constitutional issue.  That would be shirking our responsibilities.  We must face the whole range of possibility opened up by an intention to amend the Constitution and also examine the various matters which come up under that heading.  So far there has been no clear statement by the Government of where the focus of thinking is, but several serious questions come up when the Government express an intention to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would begin with the question of the rights of a family, of how we define a family and the rights of all children in relation to the general law and, specifically, in relation to adoption. Article 41 of the Constitution which deals with the rights of the family reads:</P>
    <P>1º The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>A provision of that sort is subject to judicial interpretation down the years in order to decide what precisely is the meaning of the words used: the meaning of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; for example.  It appears to be feld, and I think the Minister would agree with this interpretation, that the &ldquo;family&rdquo; here is the nuclear family based on marriage&mdash;married parents and children. That is what is meant by the family, and that is the &ldquo;fundamental unit group of society&rdquo;, and the unit group that has inalienable and imprescriptible rights.  This is an aspect which we should examine very seriously at this point in Irish society. I put it to the House that there is a possibility of serious question of <Col N="1092" /> this proposition.  There is serious question of the identification of the family as being the nuclear family, as being just that unit, the parents and the children.</P>
    <P>If one looks back to more primitive societies and more primitive cultures one will see that the emphasis was on the social unit of a group of families, a small village or small community.  It was not on the nuclear family in an isolated context.  It is the small group, the inter-related social group which defends itself, which carves out its civilisation and which is interdependent. Down the years this reflected itself in the extended family, in the importance, particularly in Irish culture, of the relationship with grandparents, uncles and aunts, the extended family relationship and, again, a high degree of interdependence in that relationship. It was not really until modern times, and I believe very directly related to industrial society, that we get a concept of the isolated nuclear family.</P>
    <P>When we hear reference to the sacredness of the family as the fundamental unit group of society we should not necessarily feel that we are confining that to an isolated fragile social unit, the nuclear family based on marriage.  This is particularly important in modern society because of the increasing encroachment of Government, and Government agencies, in every aspect of our lives.  It would be a great mistake to narrow the debate to the isolated fragile social unit so much dependent from the beginning now to the end of a life span on the various types of social welfare benefits, employment from the State, depending for so much of its food, resources, services, education, the whole range of activity dependent on the State.  One would be counterposing an isolated nuclear family to an impersonal, commercial all-embracing state.  This would be very questionable.</P>
    <P>This identification of family, if that is what we mean by family, as a unit group, excludes the single parent and family if the single parent is not married. This is one of the reasons why there is a totally different attitude towards taking the child of a single mother and placing it in adoption <Col N="1093" /> with no parallel follow-through from that as to whether, perhaps, six months after the child was placed she might find herself in different financial circumstances and so on.  This was the kind of argument the Minister was making where if one takes a child abandoned by the natural parents&mdash;the inference being the natural parents were married in those circumstances&mdash;they might after a period be able to offer a home to the child.  We have to realise that a narrow definition of the family in this way excludes very dramatically the single parent who does not fit into this narrow category of the nuclear family based on marriage.</P>
    <P>This results in a very marked contrast between the single mother and her child and the other single parents in Irish society; the widows, the very significant number of deserted wives and widowers bringing up their children. They suffer from none of the same challenges by our society of their right to keep their child.  Nobody would suggest that a widow should be deprived of her children because she is only one parent and she could not cope with the problem of bringing up the children, or it would be bad for those children to be in an environment of only one parent.  The judgment of society of the single parent and child is a judgment in the isolated nuclear context, looking only at the parent-child relationship.  This is sociologically and socially undesirable. It is something that does not enrich our Irish society; if anything it impoverishes us that we would view the family in that context.  If one takes the single parent and child out of that narrow context and into the context of an extended family, or a group relationship&mdash;I am glad to see that the group relationship tends to be more and more common with single parents with their children grouping together for all the support and interdependence of a small community&mdash;then one has a different idea of the relationship.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the constitutional provisions in Article 41 that I read, if the Government seriously want to insert into the Constitution in some <Col N="1094" /> way a guarantee that in all matters relating to the welfare of a child, the primary consideration will be the welfare of that child, then there is a need for a redefinition of what is meant by &ldquo;family&rdquo; and a reconsideration of those two parts of Article 1 which I read.  This is necessary because later Article 41.3 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>This was an opening preamble to the constitutional prohibition of divorce but it has led to the narrowing of what is meant by a family to mean a family necessarily based on marriage. I would suggest that is not acceptable in modern Irish society because it undermines family relationships not based on marriage.  It gives them no constitutional protection in our laws. The consequences for our society, particularly in a changing Irish society, are very serious indeed.  The family relationship is the natural bond between a parent and child, whether it is based on marriage or not.  The family involves also other relationships, either family relationships or, indeed, close community relationships. This is a very important issue which will have to be faced if the welfare of the child is to be the paramount consideration.  Otherwise we are going to talk about a different welfare for a legitimate or an illegitimate child and we are going to perpetrate the existing inequality.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this third principle that adoption should operate evenly and with strict standards is, of course, the question of control of adoption societies, control of the standards of adoption societies and of their activities.  Again this is a matter which has been raised several times in this House in different debates.  In particular on 9th July, 1974, in the context of a Government Bill I tried once more to persuade the Minister that, despite what he may hear from whatever sources he listens to, there is a very broad base of dissatisfaction about the fact that the Adoption <Col N="1095" /> Board do not have statutory control and that there are not statutory regulations defining standards for adoption societies.  On that occasion I was dismayed at the complacency of the Minister in referring to our adoption law and practice.  I referred to a speech of his given in Limerick in April, 1974, and I quote from column 911 of the Official Report of the debate on 9th July, 1974:</P>
    <P>There have been almost 20,000 adoption orders made in this country since 1952 and, while we cannot say on a scientific basis or on the result of research that our system is successful, we can as a matter of subjective judgment by those who work in the field say that it has worked well and that our society is better for having it.  If our system had not been successful the volume of adoptions&mdash;20,000&mdash; would surely have produced adverse social consequences that would have been apparent long before now.</P>
    <P>Having put this quotation on the record I went on to say:</P>
    <P>I have to say that I do not share the Minister's complacency.  I do not share his general satisfaction that adoption is working well in Ireland. Many voices have been raised including the voices of social workers, of members of adoption societies, of adoptive parents and even of members of the Adoption Board, who went to the point of resigning from the Adoption Board in disgust when proposals that they made for reform were not considered and were not going to be implemented.  The numbers of people directly involved who have been dissatisfied with our adoption law and the number of those who expressed concern were far from the periphery, far from voicing either emotional or unsubstantiated grievances.</P>
    <P>In the course of that contribution I called on the Minister to introduce statutory control and I moved an amendment in the course of that Bill to try to have that control implemented. At column 931 of my contribution to <Col N="1096" /> the Second Stage of that debate I said:</P>
    <P>I now wish to look at another matter.  That is the question of the role of the Adoption Board in controlling adoption societies.  I am very disappointed that the Minister has expressed a view that the Adoption Board do not &ldquo;want&rdquo; to have the power to make regulations governing adoption societies and that he is content that they are right and that there is no need for such power.  I believe that there is a very strong need for the statutory authority to make regulations which would be binding on all adoption societies.  I propose to introduce an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading Miss Darling's Report would have no doubt of the need for regulations imposing standards on adoption societies.  The Minister has expressed the view that it is not possible through legislation and regulation, to impose standards. At least one can create standards. Then, by a proper system of supervision and, if necessary, by de-registering adoption societies, one can go a long way to imposing standards.</P>
    <P>I believe the point expressed there is as valid now as it was then.  The only thing we have is perhaps less complacency. We have had one really bad case which might shake some of our complacency.  Do we have to wait for several others before we get around to ensuring strict control and strict standards in relation to our adoption societies?</P>
    <P>If I might add one type of argument to the arguments that have been expressed in favour of the need for regulation and control, it stems from the volume of adoptions now in Ireland.  If one looks at the most recent report of the Adoption Board for the year ended 31st December, 1975, one sees a dramatic increase in the applications for adoptions and in the number of adoption orders made since 1953.  In 1953, there were 381 adoption orders made.  By 1963, the number had gone up to 840 adoption orders made.  In 1973, there were <Col N="1097" /> 1,402 adoption orders made, in 1974 1,415 and in 1975, 1443.  That is close to 5,000 adoption orders made in the past three years.  It is a very significant number.  The number of applications for adoption is obviously just that bit higher, because not all applications would be successful, and not all would be processed in the same year as the application is made.</P>
    <P>This means the board are dealing with nearly 1,500 adoption cases to be finalised.  Are we so sure that, without any statutory control and regulation, as is standard practice in other countries, the proper scrutiny is taking place, there are proper placement controls, proper counselling of adoptive parents, a proper and speedy hearing for adoptive parents?  For those in the process of adopting a child, it is very important that the natural tensions and natural vulnerability in those circumstances are not aggravated either by unnecessary delay or by the activities of adoption societies where the standards and the practice may vary from adoption society to adoption society.  I am far from criticising the operation of all adoption societies or even perhaps of the majority of adoption societies.  I am saying if there is any cause for dissatisfaction we probably do not know about it in detail because no research is being done.  We certainly cannot feel happy that, in the volume of adoption cases now being coped with, the standard is uniform without any insurance that the standard even exists.</P>
    <P>If one looks at newspaper cuttings at various times&mdash;I keep a file on adoption because I am particularly interested in it&mdash;one sees outbursts of controlled rage at the system by people more deeply involved in adoption. For example, in March, 1974, there was a headline &ldquo;The Adoption Board Accused of Depriving Children of Homes&rdquo;, &ldquo;Unreasonable Demands, says Priest&rdquo;.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 6th March, 1974:</P>
    <P>In the most scatching criticism of the Adoption Board since its inception the Vice Chairman of the Central Council of Adoption Societies yesterday accused the <Col N="1098" /> board of making such unreasonable demands about the medical assessment of children being placed for adoption as to be depriving them of their legal right to a secure home which adoption alone could provide. At the same time, it was not showing the same concern about the health of adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>The report went on to say that the Adoption Board seemed to be artificially concerned about the 100 per cent health record of children who might be placed for adoption, and less concerned about the health of future adoptive parents, and that there was an imbalance there and a lack of proper control.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board work through the various adoption societies.  They could standardise the practice.  They could ensure a uniform high standard of professional advice to the adoption societies.  They could ensure that there was proper counselling of the adoptive parents, that there was proper pre-placement and post-placement supervision.  In some instances this is very good and in other instances it is less satisfactory.  Whatever it is, it is not guaranteed to be uniform and of a uniformly high standard because the Minister resists attempts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>Has the Senator knowledge of societies where the practice is less than satisfactory?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, in all the years we have debated this subject, has never given me the names of these societies that have had practices less than satisfactory.  I would have been pleased to take that up with the Adoption Board because we now have financial sanctions over these societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>What I did do in July, 1974, was give a whole range of case histories of tragedies in relation to adoption, and the Minister, in response <Col N="1099" /> to my doing that, was very unsympathetic to the point of view expressed. He said at column 953 of the Seanad Debates on 9th July, 1974:</P>
      <P>I have no way of knowing how old these case histories were.  I am well satisfied from the discussions I had within the adoption world that the procedures which are being implemented now are satisfactory to ensure a uniformly high standard of adoption procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>These case histories were in the two years before the debate in July, 1974.  There was no case history older than that.  We have had shocking incidents in the papers as the Minister knows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of them.  With respect to the quotations from newspapers, if the Senator gives me hard facts in relation to malpractice by a particular society it will be investigated.  That is what I want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I think the Minister has narrowed his range of information very dramatically if he is unaware of the various heartaches in cases down the years.  It seems to me incredible that I can be so aware of this and have such avenues of people coming to me and saying: &ldquo;Is it that the Department of Justice do not want to know, that they close themselves off from this sort of information&rdquo;? Because it is certainly there.  I am extremely surprised at the Minister trying to wash his hands of any knowledge of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inviting the Senator to furnish information, and I look forward to getting hard facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Minister up on that invitation.  He will have a great deal of information about the position in relation to adoption, since I will deposit some of my file on it in his file and perhaps we will then get a bit of progress on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> The next matter I would like to look at is the role of the Adoption Board and I think an examination of the role of the board is particularly necessary both from the point of view of the functions and responsibilities of the board and from the point of view of the volume of adoption cases which the board are now processing. Before examining objectively the role and functions of the board I would like to make it clear that the examination I am making is about the objective functions, role and responsibilities of the board and it is not a reflection of the Adoption Board.  The chairman of the Adoption Board is a friend and colleague of mine both in Trinity College and at the Bar.  There are other members of the Adoption Board whom I know well and I know that they are very responsible and concerned people.</P>
    <P>I am sure they have had many sleepless nights since this particular case and have had to cope with reassuring the anxiety of many adoptive parents throughout the country.  They are victims of the situation in which they find themselves.  They are trying to do a very responsible and serious job for which they are not well equipped.  It is the serious responsibility of this House to ensure that the Adoption Board is well equipped.</P>
    <P>First, I would like to refer to the legal role of the board and indeed the possibility of constitutional infirmity in the discharge of responsibilities by the board.  I would hazard a guess that it is this aspect that is higher on the priority of the Government in considering a constitutional amendment than indeed the intention to insert some change in relation to safeguarding the welfare of the child.  It is an apprehension that the Adoption Board may not be constitutional under the present relevant sections of our Constitution which is prompting the introduction of a Government Bill to amend the Constitution which will necessitate a referendum in the autumn.  Again it is an issue which we should not dodge or put aside and say that is for the future, and that at the moment all we want to do is rush in a Bill to stabilise the present <Col N="1101" /> situation.  We have a responsibility to examine what might be the possible constitutional infirmity of the board and then examine other aspects of the work of the board.</P>
    <P>The problem arises from the fact that in Article 34.1 our Constitution requires that:</P>
    <P>Justice shall be administered in courts established by law by judges appointed in the manner provided by this Constitution...</P>
    <P>Article 37 adds a qualification to this as follows:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or such body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>So you can have a person or body exercising judicial functions of a limited nature and not being a court of law.</P>
    <P>In most other jurisdictions of which I have knowledge in regard to their adoption practice, it is a court system of adoption with all the attendant safeguards of the court.  In 1952 we opted for a system of an adoption board, with a legal chairman and otherwise a lay voluntary part-time adoption board.  This approach raises doubts about the constitutionality of that body, particularly in the light of the interpretation of what is meant by a limited function of a judicial nature which a body can discharge.</P>
    <P>One of the first cases decided on this was a case <i>In re</i> Solicitors Act, 1954 reported in the 1960 Irish Reports at page 239.  I would like to quote briefly from the facts of that case as summarised by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy John Maurice Kelly in his work on Fundamental Rights and the Irish Law and Constitution.  He says at page 299 of his book&mdash;</P>
    <P>The first of these cases was <i>In re</i><Col N="1102" /> Solicitors Act, 1954.  Here the plaintiffs had been struck off the roll of solicitors in consequence of an order to that effect made by the Disciplinary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society under the provisions of S. 18 of the Solicitors Act, 1954.  The order was challenged on the ground that it amounted to an unconstitutional exercise of judicial power, since the Committee were not judges or a Court.  The Supreme Court said:</P>
    <P>There is no question here of a domestic tribunal with a jurisdiction based solely on contract.  Here we are dealing with a tribunal which depends for its existence and its powers on a legislative act of the State.  If the effect of such legislation is to confer the power to administer justice on persons who are not regularly appointed as judges, it is by Article 34 unconstitutional, unless it can be brought within one of the saving provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>And Deputy Kelly goes on:</P>
    <P>It was argued on behalf of the Incorporated Law Society that the function of the Disciplinary Committee did, in fact, fall within the saving provision of Article 37, as being a &ldquo;limited function&rdquo;; but the Court rejected this contention:</P>
    <P>He goes on to quote the Supreme Court:</P>
    <P>A tribunal having but a few powers or functions, but those of far-reaching effect and importance, could not properly be said to be exercising &ldquo;limited&rdquo; powers and functions.  If the exercise of the assigned powers and functions is calculated ordinarily to affect in the most profound and far-reaching way the lives, liberties, fortunes or reputations of those against whom they are exercised, they cannot properly be described as &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.  The power to strike a solicitor off the Rolls is a &ldquo;disciplinary&rdquo; and &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; power. It is a sanction of such severity that in its consequences it may be much more serious than a term of imprisonment. The powers and functions <Col N="1103" /> conferred by the Act on the Committee...are of such a far-reaching nature that their exercise amounts to an administration of justice, nor...can they be described as merely limited powers... Their exercise is unconstitutional. It follows that the two appellants were not validly struck off the roll of solicitors.</P>
    <P>Professor Kelly then goes on to examine other cases, more recent cases, but the Solicitors Act case is probably the most relevant one in considering the function of the Adoption Board.  Even for a lay person, it must be difficult to see how the functions exercised by the Adoption Board could, in that context, be regarded as &ldquo;limited&rdquo; because they terminate and create legal relationship.  They terminate the legal relationship between the single mother and the child, and for legal purposes they create legal relationships.</P>
    <P>During 1975, the Adoption Board, by making adoption orders in relation to 1,443 children, changed the legal relationships and legal expectations of those children and changed the legal relationships and legal expectations of the adoptive parents of the children.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to do is to add to the uncertainty, the heartache and the tensions of adoptive parents in the country, but we must face the position that there is quite serious doubt about the position of the Adoption Board under our Constitution because of the fact that they may be exercising unlimited functions of a judicial nature which the Constitution says must be operated by a court.</P>
    <P>Presumably the Government would seek to amend the provisions of Article 37, and presumably the concern would be to find a way of doing this without undermining the work of the Adoption Board down the years and the legal certainty of the adoption orders made.  It is extremely important not to undermine or in any way create uncertainty in relation to existing adoption orders.</P>
    <P>Apart from that very difficult and thorny constitutional issue, there must <Col N="1104" /> be an examination of the adequacy of the Adoption Board as at present constituted, leaving aside the constitutional issue, to discharge the very significant functions which they are called on to discharge.  The Adoption Board consists of a chairman who is a district justice and other members, part-time, who are lay people, who give a great deal of their time to this activity, but who also have other jobs and activities in society.  Therefore they can necessarily be only part-time.  I ought to mention, because it is relevant in examining it, that on 4th December, 1975, a barrister and former justice of the District Court was made deputy chairman.  Therefore, there is now a legal chairman and a legal deputy chairman, the position of deputy chairman having been provided for in the 1974 Adoption Act.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for serious consideration whether the part-time Adoption Board have sufficient resources and expertise to perform the functions assigned to them.  Are we confident that this board can adequately process close to 1,500 adoption orders in a single year?  Are we satisfied that there is adequate knowledge of the particular problems in a procedure as vulnerable as adoption?  Are we satisfied that the board if given statutory power to make regulations would have the manpower and equipment to enforce those regulations?  Or is this the real reason why the Minister is so reluctant to give the Adoption Board statutory power?  Does it mean that they would have to become more full-time, that they would have to get serious back-up help and expertise in order to do their job?  Would we have to invest more in the procedure for adoption and give the Adoption Board the necessary powers and manpower to discharge their responsibility?</P>
    <P>I know from contact with prospective adoptive parents that one of the things which causes great heartache from their point of view is the considerable delay in having their applications processed.  One can understand that there would be considerable delays when a single adoption board of part-time members have to deal <Col N="1105" /> with nearly 1,500 adoption orders a year.  It is understandable that no matter how hard the Adoption Board work, there would be some delay in operation.  Once again, one cannot say anything very definite about this because there has not been adequate research in the whole area of adoption.</P>
    <P>This question of research was raised two years ago when the Adoption Act, 1974 was being debated and the Minister seemed more confident than I sense he is now that the adoption procedure was working so well there was no need for this research. The time has come for a very&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was confident that he would express the subjective opinion which I have quoted, that the volume of adoption orders made, 20,000 since 1952, was evidence that everything was all right, because if it had not there would have been serious complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on record in that debate as being in favour of the need for research and I regretted that no research had taken place in our adoption code, because the need for research in this area would need to extend over 21 years before any conclusions can be drawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, then, have the Government not sponsored research? Other countries do this.  It has been done several times in Northern Ireland and Britain has done it several times and so have other countries which have had such a procedure down the years.  The Government are responsible for either establishing an independent commission or a partly Government, partly independent commission to examine our adoption law in practice.  It is far <Col N="1106" /> too important and there are far too many adoption orders made every year affecting the lives of the children concerned, of single mothers concerned and the adoptive parents. There are far too many doubts being expressed.  It would be far better to have a broad-based study.  The only study we have to go on is Miss Darling's study which I quoted at some length in 1974, where on a small objective sample&mdash;she did not have the resources at her disposal to carry out a large-scale sample&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One would like to put her foreword first so that one might look at those conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put her foreward on record first.  The relevant part <Col N="1107" /> is, and I do not wish to distort the issue:</P>
      <P>This study is an attempt to evaluate the operation of the Adoption Act.  It has been attempted single-handed on a very part-time basis and suffers from the fact that time and resources did not allow for a more thorough investigation.  As far as the author is aware, however, no study has heretofore been undertaken on adoption in Ireland.  The first Act in 1952 was an important piece of social legislation, but it was introduced under difficult and controvercial circumstances and at a time when open discussion on such matters was often inappropriate.  In recent years, however, there has been much evidence of a reawakening of interest in the subject as indicated by articles, letters to the press, television programmes etc., attempting to highlight the supposed inadequacies of the system.</P>
      <P>Then she goes on with a further qualification on paragraph 2:</P>
      <P>This study does not attempt to evaluate the success or otherwise of specific adoptions although this might well be the subject matter of an independent study.  Rather, it is more in the nature of an evaluation of adoption practice and policy and it has been necessarily limited by time and other pressures and should only be regarded as a preliminary to further study on a larger scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that she adverted to the difficulty of getting co-operation from the people whom she would like to have interviewed and said that the withholding of this co-operation by adoptive parents was a further difficulty in her report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, we have all those difficulties on the record now.  Could we have some of her conclusions in the light of all those difficulties?  She prefaces her conclusion by referring again to the limited nature of the study:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this study has been on a limited scale I feel there are enough indications to suggest that <Col N="1108" /> the standard of adoption practice in some agencies leaves much to be desired in certain respects, viz.</P>
    <P>(1)  Counselling services for applicant-adopters seemed to be rather limited at all stages of the process, before the decision is taken, in preparation for adoptive parenthood and in post placement supervision.</P>
    <P>(2)  The assessment procedure leading to selection in too many instances does not appear to be more than superficial.</P>
    <P>(3)  In some cases there is little to suggest that much thought has been given to the actual placement and indeed it sometimes appears as if there is a most casual approach to the arrangements for handing over the baby to its new parents.</P>
    <P>(4)  The best possible use is not being made of the present six month probationary and supervisory period.  It seems as if supervision is often regarded merely as an opportunity for checking that nothing is amiss and social workers do not see it as their role to use this period in the more positive way of helping the adopters to integrate the baby into their family.</P>
    <P>Then she goes on to suggest factors which might contribute to the rather poor quality adoption practice that she has observed.</P>
    <P>A study of that sort has the limitations that it has.  An adequate Government response rather than emphasising the limitations of such a study would ensure that there was a broad-based and balanced study of the whole operation of adoption and of the adequacy of the Adoption Board as composed and as functioning.  I say adequacy as apart from the much deeper and thornier problem of constitutionality in the light of the articles of the Constitution to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Adoption is obviously a limping situation from the beginning, a very vulnerable situation which requires the most humane concern from those trying to improve the law and procedure and practices in adoption.  I certainly agree with other Members <Col N="1109" /> of the House who have spoken on this Bill that there is a very real need at this point to reassure the many adoptive parents here who have been shaken and bewildered by the judgment of the Supreme Court.  There is a need to guarantee that in future our adoption law will be strong, good, fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>This leads me to consider reaction to and, indeed, even to the contents of this present Adoption Bill.  It is a limited Bill to respond to a very serious tragedy and crisis in adoption in Ireland. But the reaction has been very much to paper over some of the defects that I have been talking about, to paper over examination of the more basic principles.  If that is to be the response, then we are not going to have an outcome of a broad-based reform of the law in line with the Charter on Children's Rights which I read out, or in line with the aspirations for a balanced adoption law and procedure. If Irish society is prepared to invest in adoption by ensuring proper control, proper skills and advice, that whatever mechanism we use, be it an adoption board or some other system, has adequate expertise, adequate social services back-up, adequate control, then we will have a more adequate system of adoption.</P>
    <P>If we proclaim the welfare of the child we must know the full implications of doing so.  It is against that background that I turn to the provisions of the Adoption Bill, 1976 which are before us.  As the Minister said when introducing it, this Bill is confined more or less to responding to the recent Supreme Court case.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the validity of certain adoption orders and consents to adoption orders.  The first part of section 2 provides for the validation of existing adoption orders, where the procedure used by the board was the same procedure as was used in the recent Supreme Court case, where the form sent out was the same form and where the board had not made it clear to the single mother that she had a right to withdraw her consent up to the point when the adoption order was made.  As such the section will do that. We must be aware that in doing that we are really putting a further legal <Col N="1110" /> seal on the position of imbalance and of inadequacy, but we have no choice but to do that because it is much more important now, for the sake of the children involved, for the sake of the adoptive parents involved, for all concerned, to ensure certainty and the validity of existing adoption orders. But we should be aware and sadly aware that that is what the first part of it does.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) deals with the case of applications for adoption in the pipe-line at the moment.  Perhaps these are the most vulnerable people of all.  These are the people who are going through the tensions and the difficulties of adopting a child.  It is a time of great emotional involvement and great uncertainty and that uncertainty, of course, has been compounded by the Supreme Court decision and by the widespread discussion on adoption law and practice here.  Subsection (2) again I think adequately meets the problem that these people have.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the future in the light of the fact that the existing way of getting the consent from the single mother had not been found to be adequate by the Supreme Court.  It provides that</P>
    <P>(1)  A person whose consent to the making of an adoption order is necessary&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall be informed before he gives the consent or as soon as may be after such giving&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the consent may be withdrawn at any time before the making of the order, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that he is entitled to be heard on the application for the order, and</P>
    <P>These were the two requirements that the Supreme Court found lacking.</P>
    <P>(b)  shall, if he gives the consent, be asked, at the time of such giving or thereafter, to indicate in writing if he wishes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to be informed of the date on which the Board will, if he wishes to be heard, hear him or <Col N="1111" /> his counsel or solicitor on the application for the order, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  otherwise to be consulted again in relation to the application for the order.</P>
    <P>This provides for a more explicit opportunity for the single mother placing the child in adoption to indicate that she would like to be heard before the Adoption Board.  It is interesting to know that until a few short weeks ago despite several requests to be heard by the Adoption Board, Cherish, the organisation of single mothers, had never come into contact with the Adoption Board. Then after the Supreme Court judgment, perhaps in the light of reflection on it, the Adoption Board invited Cherish to come to have a meeting.  It was an indication, perhaps, of a change of attitude by the Adoption Board which has isolated itself totally from the single mother in former adoption practice.  This, again, reflects the imbalance of the whole procedure.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear of the precise scope of section 4 and I would welcome some clarification by the Minister.  It relates to inquiries on behalf of the Adoption Board.  Subsection 1 provides:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of compliance with section 15 (2) of the Principal Act and section 3 of this Act, the Board may request and authorise any person either in or outside the State whom it considers suitable for the purpose to make enquiries on its behalf and the Board shall be entitled, if it so thinks fit and accepts the report of the person in relation to the enquiries, to regard such acceptance as compliance by it to the said section 15 (2) of the Principal Act, and as sufficiently demonstrating compliance with section 3 of this Act as respects the subject matter of the enquiries.</P>
    <P>Surely it would be of limited value for the Adoption Board to use people on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis who happen to be in a particular area to make inquiries in relation to the consent of the single mother.  It would be much better if the Adoption Board had <Col N="1112" /> trained personnel of their own and had their own infrastructure of expertise&mdash;those who knew how to cope with the particular problems of people, of the single mother, in this instance, deciding to place her child in adoption&mdash;people who would have due consideration for the rights, aspirations and difficulties of a person in that context.  I do not think it is a job either for unskilled or, indeed, for <i>ad hoc</i> people thought suitable by the Adoption Board.  This seems to me to be trying to do the whole procedure on the cheap&mdash;to do it in the <i>ad hoc</i>, part-time and inexpert way. I would welcome some clarification from the Minister as to why he chose that particular mechanism.</P>
    <P>I would also like some clarification of the precise scope of section 5.  Section 5 relates to adoption orders and provides that adoption orders are not to be declared invalid if the declaration is not in the best interests of the children concerned.  I am not quite sure of the constitutional and legal implications of this.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) says:</P>
    <P>(1)  An adoption order shall not be declared invalid by a court if the court, after hearing any persons who, in the opinion of the court, ought to be heard, is satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that it would not be in the best interests of the child concerned to make such a declaration, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that it would be proper, having regard to those interests and to the rights under the Constitution of all persons concerned, not to make such a declaration.</P>
    <P>(2)  An adoption order shall be deemed for all purposes to be and at all times since its making to have been a valid adoption order unless it is declared invalid by a court.</P>
    <P>Let us take an instance which is different from the recent case in factual circumstances, but not really very different in essence, of a single mother who was coerced into placing her child for adoption.  There was actual evidence of real coercion and the child was placed in adoption; an <Col N="1113" /> adoption order was made and this was challenged by the natural mother. But, it being a High Court proceeding and there being delays, it is two years later that the matter comes up before the court.  The High Court says &ldquo;Yes, it appears there was not a real consent and, therefore, the adoption order is invalid but we look at section 5 which deals with the best interests of the child concerned, and decide not to declare the adoption order to be invalid.  To what extent would that provision stand to defeat what might be regarded as, if not the family rights of the single mother, at least her personal rights under the Constitution, if she is excluded from that particular form of protection? The single mother is a person for the purposes of Article 40.3.1º which provides:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>If the single mother said that she had a right to a relationship and to have her child, that she had been deprived of that right, wrongfully and by coercion, that her choice was not a real choice and so on, I would wonder what the effect of section 5 would be in that sort of circumstances, and if it would withstand the constitutional challenge?</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a provision which on balance I would support in relation to the question of custody of children. If an adoption order is declared invalid by a court it is probably better to await further consideration of the matter and, possibly, hearing other parties on it before making an order for custody.  Presumably this arises from the way the Supreme Court preempted the issue of custody but put a stay on execution for several months. Presumably, it may be reopened in another context.  It would be preferable to have a separate consideration of what would be, in all the circumstances, in the interests of justice and in the interest of the child concerned such consideration being subject to the provisions of section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act which declares that in custody proceedings the welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1114" /> In the course of the debate on the Family Home Protection Bill in this House reference was made to the provision of section 7 which provides that there will not, in future legislation, have to be separate reference to an adopted child.  I would like some clarification about the precise scope of section 7.  It says:</P>
    <P>Where, in any Act of the Oireachtas passed after the passing of this Act, there is a reference to a child of a person or persons, then, unless the contrary intention appears&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the reference shall be construed as including a reference to a child adopted by the person or persons, as the case may be, under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, and</P>
    <P>(b)  a child so adopted shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Act, to be the child of the person or persons aforesaid born to him or them in lawful wedlock and not to be the child of any other person.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to have felt that this was necessary.  I would welcome further clarification from him why this was not achieved by the provisions of the Adoption Acts, 1952-1974.  If there was any doubt about it, that doubt should be clarified.</P>
    <P>So far as the precise and immediate terms of this Bill are concerned, it is adequate to cope with that particular tragic problem and aspect of adoption.  It does nothing to redress the imbalance in the operation of our adoption law in practice.  It does not bring us back to the basic issues concerned. It will not advance our thinking on the welfare of the child concerned to any very significant degree. It tries to bring us back, more or less, to a position before the Supreme Court case, whilst accommodating the requirements the Supreme Court felt were necessary with regard to the consent of the single mother&mdash;that she be informed of her right to withdraw it at any time up to the adoption order being made, that it be made clear to her that she has a right of hearing before the Adoption Board, and she can seek a right to be heard in relation to the adoption order.  It <Col N="1115" /> is desirable that there be a Bill of this sort passed because of the high degree of apprehension, tension and legal uncertainty, but it is&mdash;as I think the Minister said in his opening speech&mdash; a very limited measure.</P>
    <P>I took some heart from the introductory speech of the Minister where he appears to feel there might be more cause to probe other areas of our adoption law and practice.  He says towards the conclusion of his opening speech:</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already, this Bill was primarily designed to do no more than respond to the immediate problems raised by the Supreme Court decision.  I recognise that there are other areas in the field of adoption that merit consideration but I think that the present Bill serves a useful and necessary purpose.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when contemplating a Bill to amend the Constitution and, hopefully, in the light of that&mdash; a series of measures of reform of the law and of safeguarding the rights of children in this country that he will be prepared both to initiate and support the background research in this whole area, and also to process these Bills with due speed through this House.</P>
    <P>A very large number of people who have been involved in a voluntary capacity in the law and the care relating to children in Ireland have become very disillusioned and disappointed. It would be very sad if they were so disenchanted with lack of progress on the legislative front that they turned aside from their concern to have change in Irish law and threw in the towel on this.  I am talking about people involved in Care and in Children First, who have got a new lease of life as a result of the recent adoption case; and also of those on the Government Task Force on Child Care, which recommended urgent implementation of measures for reform in child care.  These people are suffering from great disillusionment and great disenchantment.  It is time that they got a more firm declaration of intent and a firm <Col N="1116" /> purpose in the Government, to reform our law in the area of the rights of the child specifically, but also in the whole area of family law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators for welcoming the Bill and recognising its limited nature.  The Bill sets out, as I said, to cure the position arising out of the Supreme Court decision.  Senator Robinson has brought the debate into a consideration of the entire field of adoption.  The first thing is that we have to clear our minds as to whether we are for adoption or not, as being in the best interests of the child.  I am a firm believer that the paramountcy of the child must be supreme, and it follows from that, in my opinion, that the adopted child is likely to fare better than the child that is not adopted.  I can appreciate Senator Robinson's inability to have a clear view on that because of her emotional commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not emotional commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of her commitment which may have a certain amount of emotionalism in it to the organisation known as Cherish, the organisation for single parents, the majority of whom are unmarried mothers.  This is an organisation for which I have much respect, and I have indicated my respect for them by practical help and by acceding to some of their requests for legislative changes. I have a lot of respect and admiration for people in that organisation.  Their objective is to bring about employment in Ireland whereby a single mother can retain her child and rear the child herself.  Senator Robinson is president of that organisation and must be committed to its aims and its aims are incompatible with the very notion of adoption.  I am committed to the principle that the paramountcy of the child is supreme.  The child's interest is the only consideration that should affect us.  It must be the number one and only consideration.  The feelings of its mother towards it, the feeling of adoptive parents towards it and the emotions that arise from these feelings are all secondary and if they are to <Col N="1117" /> be hurt to ensure the paramountcy of the child's welfare, then they have to be hurt but I think we will have to fix very clearly in our minds that the prime consideration must be the welfare of the child.</P>
      <P>I firmly believe that the welfare of the child is best served by having a procedure for adoption and I am reinforced in that view by studies done in other societies with comparable cultures to our own, principally in the United Kingdom.  I mentioned this research and the conclusions of it when we debated the Adoption Bill here in 1974.  I would like to mention it again and I will refer to an article by Sula Wolff, who is attached to the Department of Psychological Medicine in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.  This was a review article in the British Institute Journal of Psychiatry.  Miss Wolff reviewed many works on the question of adopted children.  They are set out in the article. I will give the Senator the article should she be interested in it.  It contains a substantial number of very useful references to the research projects which have been carried out in this field.  She concludes her review of the study by saying:</P>
      <P>The studies cited permit some quite definite conclusions for those concerned with the care of mothers of illegitimate children.  In our present state of knowledge the responsible action is to facilitate rather than hinder the adoption of illegitimate children.  The fate of non-adopted illegitimates is poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the studies are very positive that the welfare of the child is served by adopting the child, rather than by leaving the child with a single mother.  This is due, of course, to the way society looks on single parent families and this is the way society still puts a mark on illegitimacy. There is no doubt that that is the harshness of the society we live in and I share Senator Robinson's feeling and wish that society would change so that this rather harsh approach to the single mother and her illegitimate child would change so that they would become a perfectly <Col N="1118" /> normal and acceptable unit of our society, but they are not and it is no use pretending that they are nor do I see any prospect of a revolution in our attitudes towards such a situation overnight.</P>
    <P>If a change is to be made, are the present generation of illegitimate children to be the guinea pigs in a social experiment to change attitudes towards the single mother and her child?  I think that would be unfair to them and it would be a negation of the principle that the welfare of the child is paramount.  The studies from similar societies to ours show quite clearly&mdash;these are studies which have had the benefit of full scientific research behind them&mdash;that the fate of the adopted illegitimate child is far more secure and far better than the non-adopted illegitimate child.  I do not think we can ignore those findings bearing in mind that what we have to be concerned with is the welfare of the child and nothing else.  We have to forget any question of sentimentality, of the mother's feelings towards the child or that sort of thing because what we are concerned with is the welfare of the child as the first paramount consideration.  Once that is our concern we must pay attention to these studies which show that that welfare is best served by adoption.</P>
    <P>I certainly have my mind clear that adoption is in the best interests of the child and I would always be in favour of encouraging it.  I have said as much to the brave people in Cherish and they have taken issue with me because they feel that so long as that sort of attitude prevails they will never reach the situation where they can become a natural part of society.  But what is to happen to the children who are retained by the mother in that evolving situation?  Willy nilly they are the guinea pigs in the experiment of evolving the change in society and I do not think we are entitled to say to any generation of those children: &ldquo;You will be guinea pigs for the unborn illegitimate children of the future so that they can be integrated fully into society.&rdquo;  We are not entitled to say that if we believe that the <Col N="1119" /> interests or the welfare of the child is the first consideration.</P>
    <P>I think also that because we live in a free society we cannot take children away from their mothers and if a single mother wants to rear her child, that is her prerogative and her privilege. She is entitled to do it and she is entitled to all the support she can get from the State or from society to enable her to do that completely and comprehensively.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the suggestion that the whole emphasis of approach by adoption societies is to persuade mothers to adopt, to try to twist their arm gently, so to speak, and make them place their children for adoption. This is not so and I will quote a passage from the first annual report of the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland which is a registered adoption society of long standing. The section from the report which I will quote will be put on the record of the House and will indicate the sensitive, careful approach by adoption societies to their task.  I think this is necessary to restore the confidence in adoption societies that migh have been shaken by the criticisms which Senator Robinson made in the course of her contribution. This shows a degree of care and a degree of sensitivity which is commendable and I think would be hard to improve on and I quote:</P>
    <P>The whole position of the unmarried mother and her child is extremely emotive, sensitive and delicate.</P>
    <P>The unmarried mother has many needs, material, medical, social, psychological and spiritual.  The social worker must help her to determine realistically these needs and assist her in meeting them.  Her baby, too, has many needs but is unable to voice them.  The crisis point is reached when a mother has to decide as to how best the baby's continuing and changing needs might be met. We regard it as the mother's strict prerogative to make this decision. We supply her with information; we <Col N="1120" /> help her to identify the baby's needs both in the short and long term.  We assist her in analysing her own particular situation and resources and to see how she might best be able substantially to meet the baby's needs.  None but the unthinking would dare accept responsibility for another's decision in such a vital and personal matter by being guilty of undue influence or pressure.  Each baby has a natural right to have its needs for love, affection and security adequately met with: each mother has a right to decide how best this might be achieved.  Each social worker has a duty to try to ensure that the mother's decision is an informed and responsible one.</P>
    <P>That quotation shows very clearly a high degree of sensitivity on the part of this adoption society for the duties imposed on it in counselling the mother on the question of whether she should place her child for adoption or not. It shows, too, that there is a strictly impartial policy from the point of view of encouraging the mother one way or the other.  This is a policy statement by this adoption society.  The figures for the year 1974 indicate that the number of children taken into care were 254; children placed for adoption 214 and children kept by mothers, 101.  If these societies were, as someone alleged, adoption factories and if the whole emphasis was on forcing the mother to place the child for adoption, that statement of policy and those figures might possibly end that particular misconception.</P>
    <P>Another society, the Rotunda Girls Aid Society, dealt with 129 single mothers in 1975.  Thirty-five kept their children; 72 were placed for adoption, two children died, three were placed with other societies; there were three private placements and there were three mothers who did not know at the time and lost contact with the society.  There were 11 children in nursery care. Again, those figures show that there is no&mdash;what I might call&mdash;undue number of children placed for adoption. The proportions are reasonable and do not suggest that the tendency of adoption societies is to twist the arms <Col N="1121" /> of mothers to place their children for adoption.  If that were the tendency, the figures I think would be different and far more children would have been placed for adoption than are shown by those figures.</P>
    <P>It is important to get this matter into perspective and, in fairness to the adoption societies, to show what the policies of at least two societies are.  I have not got the figures for all the societies but these are two responsible, well-established societies.  It is my ambition and the ambition of the board to ensure that high uniform standards will be practised by all societies throughout the country.  The year before last I introduced a system of giving grants to adoption societies conditional on the adoption societies employing professionally trained social workers to ensure that standards would be professional and uniform. I am glad to say that that particular strategem is working very well.  Social workers are now <i>sine qua non</i> with practically all adoption societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider giving a grant to Cherish who also have social workers?  I believe an application was made but they have not been successful. Cherish also employ social workers in comparable circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about adoption societies that have been urged to raise their standards and to ensure that the adoption procedures are of a high standard and are uniform throughout the country.  It is to those societies that I authorise grants to try to achieve those aims.  There is no similar aim to be achieved by the organisation known as Cherish.  It is a separate matter to be considered in a separate context.  The point I am making is that standards are rising all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot take the logic of this plea for statutory regulations to impose standards.  Standards are only as good as the people operating in the field. Standards do not arise from what is written on a piece of paper.  They arise from the knowledge, keenness and expertise of individuals doing <Col N="1122" /> their own job.  It is the same in all walks of life whether politicians, lawyers, journalists, doctors, engineers, people working in the building trade.  You cannot impose standards on a particular operator by a set of regulations in an Act of Parliament. The standards are those that he will apply by reason of his personality, his training, his personal energies and dedication.  I think it is unrealistic to suggest that there is some magic formula by way of statutory regulations to raise the level of adoption work.  There is no such formula.  The way we have gone about it is the proper way, encouraging the employment of professionals and hoping that they will be really professional in discharging their duties.  I am satisfied that the standard of counselling and investigation is improving all the time.  I am satisfied that the present procedure is the way to achieve that.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board are a board of part-time people.  There has been criticism of them from time to time in that they lack expertise.  The expertise that is wanted is essentially common sense and experience of life so that they can assess the reports coming in from the experts.  We do not want experts assessing experts.  What we want are people of common sense, maturity and experience of life to assess the reports coming in from the experts and make the decisions thereon.  I am satisfied that on the Adoption Board we have a group of people who possess those qualities in abundance.  We should all be most grateful to the members of the Adoption Board for the amount of time they give on a part-time, voluntary basis.  Part-time is possibly a misnomer because, to all intents and purposes, they are well-nigh full-time. For people to give almost all their free time on a voluntary basis in such a contentious area as this from time to time is a most commendable thing and they deserve our gratitude both for their generosity and the good job they are doing.  I am glad to have this opportunity to express that gratitude to them.  I would not dream of replacing them by a committee of professionals or so-called experts.  Who <Col N="1123" /> are experts in this field?  What we have is the ideal solution.</P>
    <P>I take the point Senator Robinson made about research.  I regret there has not been research in this country in the field of adoption.  We have lost 20-odd years.  Research in the adoption field has to extend over a very long period so that results can be valid.  In fact, they would have to extend over a period of 21 years to see how the adopted child turned out at the age of majority.  There would be assessments at various ages throughout that period to assess progress and produce conclusions.  One wonders also if a research project which has to be carried out over such a long period has built into it an inherent defect which will always render its conclusions invalid for application at the time the conclusions become available.  The point I am making is this: if we had had research over the last 21 years and we had certain conclusions now in 1976 with regard to the children adopted 21 years ago who are now 21 years of age, would they be necessarily a valid base on which to base policy decisions for the next 21 years? In this area the current customs of society, the social mores of society are changing so rapidly that they could invalidate the premises on which this research work was based.</P>
    <P>I mention this as an indication of the difficulties of research in this area, particularly research in a social field over a protracted period of time. Nevertheless, the Adoption Board have made certain propositions for research which I hope we will be able to do possibly in conjunction with the ESRI.  We have to decide what area of research is the most urgent and then decide on how it is to be carried out, bearing in mind that resources in terms of finance and personnel are not as plentiful as we would like them to be.</P>
    <P>We have researched conclusions from comparable societies, principally in the United Kingdom.  I am aware of the need for it here in our own society which has certain social peculiarities of its own and I regret it has not taken <Col N="1124" /> place up to now.  We will have to try to redress that imbalance, not as quickly or as thoroughly as I would like, but we will be able to make a start.  They are some general comments now on the area of adoption necessary to set the record straight.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson had a couple of questions on sections 4, 5 and 7.  Section 4 provides for the board making inquiries.  Senator Robinson wondered if this is trying to get information on the cheap.  It is not.  There might be a situation where a mother, with whom the board had been in contact at the time of the giving of the consent, who had to be interviewed subsequently in connection with that consent, might have moved away to another part of the country and it might not be feasible for an officer of the board to go to her to get the information at the precise time the information is necessary.  She might have gone abroad for instance. In that situation the section gives the board power to obtain this information through agencies, other than their own officers, in or outside the State and may act on the information so obtained.  I have no doubt the agencies the board will use will be people skilled and experienced in the adoption field. The board will use officers of an adoption society in the area where the mother might then find herself.  It is with that sort of situation that the section is meant to deal.  It is not in some way trying to save on staff.  The board have the resources in terms of their own staff to do their own work.  The number of staff available for the board was considerably increased some years ago and, lack of numbers was causing delay or the staff were not able properly to process the applications coming in, the board would be free to make an application for an increase in staff.  That would be examined as sympathetically as possible.  I am not aware, from any information available to me, that there is any lack of staff in terms of expertise available to the board.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a drastic section.  Senator Robinson gave an example of an adoption order which turned out afterwards to be completely illegal.  It could happen that an adoption order would be made on the basis of fraud or duress.  Section 5 allows the court <Col N="1125" /> to ignore that fraud or duress and to ignore an actual illegality in the making of an order if, at the time the court comes to consider the order, the court decides in the interests of the child that the illegality or invalidity should be overlooked.  That is quite a drastic and wide power.  The court has to consider the constitutional rights of the parties concerned.  It could well be that in the example quoted by Senator Robinson the court might come to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the power given to overlook the illegality and invalidity of the order, the court nevertheless is precluded from overlooking those factors by reason of a constitutional right. This is one of the areas with which the amendment proposed by the Government will have to deal.  What we all want to achieve, and it is common case, is that the welfare of the child will not be endangered by any technical legality.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the 1952 and the 1974 Acts.  Between them they cover the vast majority of situations touching the status of the adopted child <i>vis-a-vis</i> the natural child.  It was always my understanding that the adopted child was, in effect, in the same position as the natural child from the point of view of legal status. The matter arose in the other House, because in some financial legislation there was a specific reference to adopted children and the Opposition spokesman was wondering why it was necessary to refer specifically to adopted children if they had the full status of natural children by virtue of the Adoption Acts.  I gather it was a matter of prudence and safety to include a specific reference to them in the Finance Act lest the giving of the legal status in the Adoption Acts might be in any way deficient and there might be any particular matter left unattended to.  It was felt indivious to have to refer to them at all in individual Acts and this section accordingly is to enlarge the position given by the Adoption Acts of 1952 to 1974 giving the legal status of a natural child to an adopted child so that specific references will henceforth not be necessary.  It is not possible <Col N="1126" /> to be absolute in the giving of this status and this section goes as far as is practically necessary.  I hope it will not be necessary hereafter to make reference to adopted children as a separate category in any Act of Parliament.  They are referred to separately in the Family Home Protection Bill for the same reason that they have been referred to in the Finance Act.  This is new legislation and a new part of our legislative <i>corpus.</i>  It might not be caught by the references in the Adoption Acts. That is why the provision is in the Family Home Protection Bill which preceded this Bill, if it ante-dated this Bill there would be no need to make a special reference to it.</P>
    <P>They are, I think, the points raised in connection with the Bill.  To conclude, it is a narrow Bill designed to meet the need disclosed by the Supreme Court decision.  I am very satisfied that it does just that and that adoptive parents need have no worry that their adoptions will be upset or that they may lose the children they have adopted.  In order to put the matter completely beyond doubt and ensure there will be no attack constitutionally on anything relating to the adoption code the Constitution in due course will be amended.  The question to be put to the public has to be finally decided on. It will cure the point raised by Senator Robinson that there was apprehension that the Adoption Board were exercising a judicial function of a non-limited nature and thereby in conflict with Article 37.  Again, this is a matter that could be argued, but we do not want to have to argue it. Amending the Constitution will avoid the necessity for doing that.</P>
    <P>The argument would be that it is not a judicial procedure.  It merely validates the seal of approval on what is essentially a private arrangement. A mother surrenders a child and an adoptive couple adopts the child.  In the same way that the registrar puts a seal of approval, or confirms, that the forms are observed in marriage, which is essentially a contract between two people, nobody would suggest that, even though his presence is necessary, <Col N="1127" /> and he had certain legal formalities to carry out, he is acting in a judicial function.  I merely make that as a contrary argument.  What we want to avoid is having to make these arguments and perhaps find that these arguments fail and the whole position upset as a result of that failure.  The Constitution amendment will, I hope, copperfasten the security of the adoption procedure and those who have adopted children can be reassured that their adoptions will not be disturbed and those who are of a mind to adopt children will know that they can do so in the full knowledge that the children will remain with them for their lives as would natural children.</P>

      <P>This section deals with two different stages.  One is the validation of existing adoption orders made before the recent Supreme Court case to ensure that they cannot be disturbed in any way by the outcome of the Supreme Court case.  The second deals with adoption orders at present in the pipe-line.  I gather that there has been a considerable delay about these because the Adoption Board wanted this legislation through before they processed them.  I assume there will be no real delay and that as soon as the legal position is clarified the Adoption Board will be able to proceed without any further delay.  I say this because I know it is causing very considerable heartache and tension to people who are going through the natural emotional stage of adopting a child and which is compounded by the legal uncertainty of the present situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which relates to the future in the light of the Supreme Court requirements that the single mother be informed that she can withdraw her consent before an adoption order is made and that she has a right of hearing.  Is it intended that the Adoption Board will have new and different forms to reflect this?  Would it be possible to have copies of these forms deposited in the Oireachtas Library so that they would be available for Members of the House?  It would be interesting and necessary to see in what way the ascertainment of consent by the single mother is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I would see a very clear distinction between the Minister's attitude and mine towards adoption.  I am very much in favour of adoption and a good, balanced adoption law and procedure, but I am also very much in favour of it being based on real choice because that is the only way you will have good balanced adoption.  Then when you come to the question of real choice you have to have concern for the rights and responsibilities of the single mother.  She is the person faced with that responsibility.  The Minister has not answered the point I made, that she does not get adequate counselling or impartial advice during pregnancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may quote, and I accept it, that the adoption societies do take into account the interests of the <Col N="1129" /> single mother, but the heading on the door is &ldquo;Adoption Society&rdquo;.  It is not a place you can go to for impartial advice on the question of a choice.  We may improve the legal position in section 3 in relation to the consent of a single mother but I think we will have to go much further.  The State should provide a broad range of counselling in favour of the single mother and it should also provide other supports. For example, I believe the city of Cork has a particular policy in its housing of favouring the single mother and child. Dublin Corporation and other local authorities do not have the same policy to help the single mother to get adequate housing if she wishes to retain her child.  Although there is an improvement in the section, and presumably this will be followed by improvements in the type of forms and so on which the Adoption Board will distribute, it has to be backed by the reality of creating a situation of real choice in our society.</P>
    <P>I note the references made to the fact that if a single mother indicates that she wishes to be heard or to be heard through her counsel or solicitor, on an application she is entitled to do so.  The legal representation of counsel or a solicitor is not a very real facility for the vast majority of single mothers until we have a system of civil legal aid and advice where a single mother could get, first of all, legal advice on the question and then legal representation in a case where it was felt there was a need for her to appear before the board and to be legally represented in her appearance.  Let us not create too many paper remedies.  Let us create some real changes in relation to the consent and the real choice of a single mother.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be new forms and regulations to implement section 3 and I will arrange for these to be placed in the Library.  Whether consent is a real consent depends on a number of matters.  The standard of counselling the mother gets, her maturity, her intelligence and her ability to make a decision, are not things which can be given by an Act of Parliament.  By reading out a policy statement from one of the major <Col N="1130" /> societies I have indicated that their policy is quite clearly to give impartial counselling.  That society is known as the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland and it does not have &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; in its title.  I gave figures from another society, it is called the Rotunda Girls' Aid Society, which does not have the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; in its title.  The fact that some societies would have the word &ldquo;adoption&rdquo; in their title does not render less valid the counselling that they give or does not make it partial.  I am satisfied that the standard of counselling and advice given to mothers considering whether to place their children for adoption is impartial sound advice, taking into account all the circumstances of a particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for some clarification of the scope of section 4.  One aspect that comes to mind in relation to it is that because we have had a number of Acts, particularly the 1974 Act and this legislation, it is increasingly difficult to know where one is in relation to quotations of sections.  For example, section 4 begins:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of compliance with section 15 (2) of the Principal Act...</P>
      <P>Now one has to look not at section 15 (2) of the Act as it was when it was published but at section 15 (2) as amended by section 8 of the 1974 Act.  It is a very substantial amendment. It changes entirely the position so that section 15 (2) now reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall satisfy itself that every person whose consent is necessary and has not been dispensed with has given consent and understands the nature and effect of the consent and of the adoption order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that in some circumstances it might be necessary for the board to call for assistance from a suitably qualified person in circumstances <Col N="1131" /> where the mother has gone to a remote part, particularly outside the country.  It would be very desirable if it were the officials or staff of the board who carried out these inquiries, that it was not delegated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, that so far as possible there would be a very close monitoring of the way in which this section operates so that there would be some way of knowing about the standard of approach and the way in which it is done.  It is very important that the questions be asked in the appropriate way and the information be ascertained in the appropriate way.  The board should be concerned not to delegate it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis because they do not want to invest in their own manpower to ensure that they have adequate possibilities if necessary of travelling to where the single mother is or asking her to come to an appropriately convenient venue in order to ascertain her consent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally inquiries will be made by the board's officers but this is to avoid delay.  Speed may be important in some situations.  The board will have power to go outside their own officers.  I have no doubt that the board will have a standard procedure which will be implemented in the making of these inquiries.  The board have procedures for their officers to follow and will ensure that similar procedures will be followed by the officers of other agencies which may be used by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has again given some clarification on this section and he described it as a very far-reaching section.  I agree with him. For that reason it is all the more important to ensure that the choice is a real one by the single mother with all the counselling and guidance available, that she will know what are the resources of the State if she keeps her child.  I found the Minister's opening remarks in response to what I said very <Col N="1132" /> strange.  He appeared to be speaking in what amounts to a contradiction, that he would prefer a society where the single mother with her child was given the same status and support and was regarded as a full good family relationship by society but that is not the way it is.</P>
      <P>He then said that it is not fair, in the interim period, to use present illegitimate children in the pipeline as guinea pigs for a change by that society.  The real guinea pigs in society at the moment are the unfortunate illegitimate children who do not see change, in concept of illegitimacy and do not see steps being taken to remove the disadvantages.  I do not see how the Minister will ever break out of his present cycle where he says he is strongly in favour of adoption but will not make the changes which bring him to the situation which he admits he would prefer, where the single mother and her child are given full acknowledgment in society.  He accused me of a kind of emotional bias in the matter in favour of the single mother and her child.  I was trying, very specifically, in speaking to this Bill to make it clear that in my attitude I see basic fundamental principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say &ldquo;intellectual bias&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Even intellectual bias.  There are basic underlying principles. If the Minister says that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration then I do not see how he can avoid the follow-through of that.  No child in Ireland should suffer from legal disadvantage and disability but children do.  We have a concept of illegitimacy and we have illegitimate children suffering from our State disadvantage and disability. How can it be a primary concern and still equate that primary concern with existing laws on illegitimacy? That is a tortuous form of logic which quite escapes me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister, in quoting so definitely the reports of the particular studies to which he made reference, is falling into a trap that he was careful I would not fall into in relation to quoting from Miss Darling's report.  He left out all the <Col N="1133" /> qualifications.  I have read a good deal about these reports and there are qualifications.  First of all, a large part of the reason why a child is better in adoption comes precisely from the sort of security and support from the State and from the environment which a child gets from adoption. Happily now it is very respectable in Ireland because there was a time when it was not quite so respectable. It has all the resources and the support of the State.  The reaction to this particular adoption case shows what a strong support it gets from the broad base of the community.  That is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>Adoptive children are in the same position, to all intents and purposes or should be, as children of married parents.  The contrast then is with the deprived children who are deprived because they suffer from the disadvantages of illegitimacy, the environment in which they are brought up and from the fact that they are in, what they will always be, a disadvantaged family, the one parent family, whether it is a single mother with her child, a widow, a deserted wife or a widower.  The one parent family needs the care and concern of any society because it is necessarily socially disadvantaged.  It is more difficult for one parent to cope with all the supports and responsibilities which two parents normally cope with.</P>
    <P>In section 5 the impact is to ensure that a single mother will not be able to challenge an adoption order even if the original placement was illegal because she had not given her proper consent, because she was defrauded or whatever.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is sure that that will not be open to abuse?  Is he confident that in the present state of society that that is the appropriate balance to maintain?  It cuts off any legal rights which the single mother might have.  I am not suggesting that one wants to see a situation where there are further cases like that in the Supreme Court the other day, where it appears a child will be taken from the home and family environment of adoptive parents because the order was successfully challenged by <Col N="1134" /> the child's natural parents.  This is very far-reaching and it is in a country and in a particular stage of our development where already there are such serious difficulties and handicaps for the single mother.</P>
    <P>The Minister tends to overdo the absoluteness of his view of the rights of the child, that the welfare of the child should be paramount.  It is as though nothing else matters.  The welfare of the child is very tied up with the welfare of the mother of that child if she wants to keep that child.  No society should lend itself in its mechanisms to disrupting a mother and child relationship if the mother wants to keep her child.  There are many single mothers who do not want to keep their children.  There are instances where the mother wants to be advised about what she considers to be in the best interests of her child, that is to place the child in adoption.  It is not that I disagree with the intention in section 5, to avoid future instances where, several years after an adoption order is made, it can be invalidated and the child taken out of that environment but that it is devastating in its impact in cutting off the right to challenge an adoption order successfully and have it annulled even if you can show basic defects in it, which is a limitation on the rights of the single mother who is, in my view, already in a weak enough position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite drastic but it can only operate if there are two conditions (1) that it is not in the best interests of the child to make a declaration that an adoption order is invalid and (2) that it would be proper, having regard to the rights under the Constitution of the person or persons concerned not to make such a declaration.  While it is a drastic section it gives very wide power to the courts to disregard something illegal.  The courts can only exercise that power in those two situations and conditions in the best interests of the child.  This envisages a situation where a child has been with adoptive parents for a number of years and the mother has parted from the child for four or five years or even longer.  It is to prevent a legality then arising to enable that mother to take back that child after an interval of <Col N="1135" /> four or five years when the child had become completely integrated with the new family.  There is no doubt that the emphasis in this section is the correct one.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to set up a statutory national gas board which will be the national <Col N="1136" /> authority responsible for the supply and distribution of natural gas.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself, I would like to dwell briefly on the events which led up to the present proposal.</P>
      <P>Surveying and drilling in our continental shelf area was initiated in the late 1960s by Marathon Petroleum Ireland Limited under an agreement concluded originally in 1959.  The commercial gas field confirmed by Marathon in 1973 in the area south of Kinsale Head has been estimated to contain one million million cubic feet of gas, capable of sustaining a flow rate of 125 million cubic feet a day during a period of 20 years.  This is not a major gas find compared to some of the North Sea deposits but it is equivalent to about 12 per cent of Ireland's present total energy requirements.  Even more significantly it has confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the Irish continental shelf and has given encouragement to the programme for the further exploration of our offshore area.</P>
      <P>In considering the possible allocation of the gas, the Government had to take account of the fact that we did not have an established gas industry with the potential to absorb the flow of gas from this field from an early stage in sufficient quantity to remunerate the enormous capital investment involved.  The Government, after careful consideration, decided to allocate this gas for a new plant to be built by Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta at Marina Point in Cork for the production of ammonia and urea for the fertiliser industry and for additional ESB generating capacity of 400 MW in a new station at Whitegate and the extension of the board's existing plant at Marina.  An allocation is also being made available to Cork Gas Company to meet the requirements of their consumers.</P>
      <P>The allocation of natural gas for the Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta project will assure supply of nitrogenous fertiliser to Irish agriculture and a surplus for export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> It has been stated by various commentators that the use of natural gas for electricity generation is not the most efficient method of utilisation and is a waste of natural resources. I would, however, like to emphasise that all conversion of fuel to energy is wasteful to some extent of the initial thermal content of the energy. The production of electricity, no matter from what fuel it is generated&mdash; whether imported fuel such as oil, or native fuel such as peat&mdash;involves some loss of value of the original fuel.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested also that the allocation to the ESB is in conflict with the EEC directive on the use of natural gas in power stations.  This is not the case.  The directive in question, which incidentally was issued about a year after the Government decision on the allocation of the Kinsale gas find, does not prohibit the use of natural gas for electricity generation.  What it does is to set out the circumstances under which the use of natural gas for electricity generation may be authorised.  The use of part of the Kinsale Head gas for electricity generation is fully in line with the criteria set down in the directive.  Moreover, the supply of natural gas to the ESB is on an interruptible basis and could be reviewed at a future date if circumstances made that course desirable.</P>
    <P>While it is interesting to debate in a theoretical way the various ways in which natural gas can be utilised, one must not ignore the realtities which had to be faced in the allocation of our first gas deposit.  Very heavy investment is necessary to develop the field and bring the gas ashore and distribute it.  The financing of that investment can only be met from the revenue generated by the sale of gas.  Our existing gas market amounts to only about 10 per cent of the output of the field and, while the availability of natural gas tends to increase the market, this takes place only over a period of years and also involves additional capital investment.  The high rate of offtake required in the early stages to justify the heavy investment, both offshore and onshore, could in our <Col N="1138" /> present circumstances be provided here only by substantial users like the electricity and fertiliser industries. I would emphasise that the use of gas by the ESB will reduce the board's dependence on imported oil and thus safeguard the consumer against the worst effects of any future interruptions of international oil movements. This is, of course, an important element in our present energy strategy. In the light of all these considerations I firmly stand over the Government's decision to allocate portion of the Kinsale Head gas find to the ESB.</P>
    <P>The development of the field and the associated onshore projects will involve total investment in excess of £200 million.  The onshore construction projects will provide more than 2,000 jobs and there will be permanent employment for about 700 workers. The country's balance of payments will improve by an estimated £75 million a year and the total development will involve an accrual of new technology which will be of considerable benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>An important consideration in regard to the utilisation of natural gas and the arrangements for onshore transmission and distribution is the need for a system of co-ordinated national control.  It is clearly important that indigenous energy resources should be developed and exploited to the best advantage of the economy as a whole and that the benefits both direct and indirect, should accrue to the community.  Control on a national basis is also desirable so that uniformly high standards should be applied in the construction and operation of terminals, pipelines and associated installations.  Accordingly, the Government decided early last year that a national gas authority should be established and they authorised me to undertake the preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the preparation of legislation for the establishment of a new State-sponsored body takes a certain amount of time. To have deferred action on the development of the Kinsale Head field until a Bill was enacted and the new board established would have involved an unnecessary delay in bringing the <Col N="1139" /> gas on stream.  Accordingly, in April last year I set up Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta under the Companies Acts to undertake the conclusion of the negotiations with Marathon for the purchase of the gas and to initiate the planning of the onshore pipeline system.</P>
    <P>The board's first task was, as I have mentioned, the conclusion of a contract with Marathon for the purchase of the Kinsale Head gas.  The foundations for this contract had already been laid in the negotiations conducted initially by the ESB and NET with Marathon and, while ordinary commercial prudence dictates that the terms of the contract must remain confidential, I can assure the House that a very good deal was, in fact, negotiated.  Contractual obligations between BGE and Marathon envisage a first delivery date of 1st April, 1979 for the gas. However, at my prompting and with the encouragement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, both BGE and Marathon are pressing ahead with their projects with a view to meeting a target delivery date of early 1978.</P>
    <P>As regards the onshore pipeline project, I understand that this comprises a combination of conventional engineering skills with certain gas technologies new to this country. I know that BGE saw this project from the outset as a pilot scheme on which the foundations would be laid for any future gas developments. Maximisation of the involvement of Irish enterprise and skills has been a plank in BGE's policy and it was in this context, and with a view to developing the gas technology expertise which was lacking within this country, that BGE found it necessary to obtain consultancy services from the British Gas Corporation.  This decision met with a certain amount of adverse criticism at the time and it is only right that I should avail of this occasion to repeat my support for BGE's decision.  The consultancy services being provided by British Gas are mainly of an advisory nature, covering matters such as safety codes and standards, design <Col N="1140" /> parameters and route selection, areas in which the necessary expertise was not available within the country.  The engagement of British Gas does not mean that decisions on the placing of contracts have been taken from the hands of BGE.  On the contrary, the awarding of contracts remains the responsibility of BGE and in this connection I was heartened to learn some time ago that two of the earliest contracts to arise were awarded to the ESB. These covered a feasibility study of the pipeline crossing of the river Lee from Little Island to Ring Mahon and detailed design drawings for the pipeline system.</P>
    <P>The services of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards have been retained by BGE to monitor the possibilities for Irish manufacturers and contractors and I understand that a number of Irish contractors have already expressed interest in the construction phase, some in consortia with experienced gas pipelaying contractors, a move which BGE welcomes and which I heartily endorse.</P>
    <P>The principal onshore feature of any natural gas development is, of course, the construction of the underground pipeline.  It is in the public interest that the construction of such pipelines should be subject to overall control by the State and it is with that in mind that I have framed section 8 to require the board to obtain my consent to the construction of a pipeline and to adhere to such conditions as I may specify regarding codes and standards of safety and efficiency in construction and maintenance.  The section further provides that in the construction of a gas pipeline the Board shall take all reasonable measures to protect the natural environment and amenities including buildings and other objects of architectural or historical interest.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, provision is made whereby the board in the selection of a route for the construction of a pipeline shall take into account the representations of any local or harbour authority or any railway, electricity, water or other gas undertaker <Col N="1141" /> concerned.  The Minister for Local Government has agreed in the light of these statutory obligations that the laying of the underground pipeline shall be exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission and he propeses to make appropriate regulations under the Planning Act in due course.  In this respect the board's position will be similar to that of other gas undertakings.  The provisions of this section will apply to the onshore pipeline being provided in connection with the Kinsale Head development, and, indeed, I understand from BGE that detailed consultations have already taken place and are continuing with interested parties, including the Cork local authorities, statutory bodies and other representative organisations.</P>
    <P>The securing of wayleaves will be an important task in any natural gas pipeline project.  Some 30 miles of wayleave are involved in the Kinsale Head project and the need for the co-operation of the farming community hardly needs to be stressed. Negotiations have been taking place between BGE and representatives of the landowners with a view to securing by agreement the wayleaves for the pipeline.  It is, of course, important to ensure that a project as important to the country as a whole as the present one, or indeed any further natural gas development, is not frustrated or unduly delayed and, accordingly, provision is included in section 32 for the making of a ministerial order to authorise the board to acquire compulsorily land or rights over land.  The Second Schedule to the Bill sets out the procedure to be followed in relation to a compulsory acquisition order.  The board's powers to acquire land or rights over land are no different from those of other State bodies and local authorities who have to have such powers for the discharge of their functions.  Provision is made for the normal safeguards for all interested parties such as provisions for the hearing of objections and representations and for independent arbitration on compensation terms.</P>
    <P>At this point I should mention that the progress made by BGE to date gives every indication that, provided <Col N="1142" /> no exceptional difficulties arise, the gas should be on stream in accordance with our target date of early 1978.  I am satisfied that this could not have been achieved if I had not taken the step of setting up BGE as an interim company in advance of the legislation.  The company, Bord Gáis Éireann Teoranta, will, of course, be dissolved under the present Bill in the manner prescribed in section 35 but this does not mean that there will be any interruption in the project. Continuity and momentum must be maintained and the project will, of course, be carried through to completion by the Gas Board acting within the statutory framework which will be provided by this Bill.  I think it is appropriate that I should express my appreciation of the work of both board members and staff in getting a new and complex project so well advanced within a comparatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>The statutory board, which will be appointed by me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will comprise a chairman and not more than six other members.  The First Schedule deals in detail with the constitution and membership of the new board, while sections 16 to 20 deal with matters relating to the employment of staff, consultants and so on.</P>
    <P>The duty of the new board, as set out in section 8, will be to develop and maintain an efficient and economical system of supply of natural gas, as it may appear to the board to be requisite, with due regard to available sources of supply.  The duty of the board will, of course, be influenced in large measure by the scale of natural gas deposits which may become available as a result of exploration activity in our continental shelf.</P>
    <P>Offshore exploration activity is a matter which comes within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in this regard. Senators will note that section 36 provides for a consultation process on any development relating to a natural gas deposit.  Furthermore, section 37 provides that all natural gas landed in the State or got in the jurisdiction of the State for consumption in the State, <Col N="1143" /> shall be offered for sale on reasonable terms to the board except in particular cases where it is considered that the gas should be offered for sale for a specified industrial use.  Any dispute as to the reasonableness of the terms on which gas is offered to the Board will be determined by arbitration.</P>
    <P>Section 8 also sets out the general powers of the board.  These include powers to transmit, distribute and sell natural gas; to purchase and acquire natural gas from any source; to construct and operate pipelines, terminals and so on, and to carry out various works and activities to enable them to discharge their functions under the Bill. The powers provided in the Bill for the board are those which it is considered the board will require as far as can be foreseen.  However, in a new area such as this, where rapid technological changes can take place, it may become necessary in the future to confer additional powers on the board and provision is therefore made in section 9 for the conferring of such powers on the board.  These powers would, of course, have to be related to the provision of a supply of gas and could only be conferred by way of a ministerial order, which would be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas for prior approval.</P>
    <P>The new board will be subject to the controls normally applicable to State-sponsored bodies.  Accordingly, provision is included in section 21 for control of the capital commitments of the board.  Sections 22 to 25 deal with the board's borrowing powers and are generally similar to the provisions applicable to other State-sponsored bodies.  The Bill sets a limit of £25 million on the aggregate amount of long-term borrowing which may be incurred by the board for capital purposes. I should like to emphasise that this is a limit and not an allocation. While the limit may be more than enough to meet the board's requirements arising from the Kinsale Head development, and for investigating the possibilities and forward planning for the utilisation of any further finds, it would not be adequate to meet requirements arising from any significant gas <Col N="1144" /> finds and any proposals for financing of any substantial new projects will therefore have to come before the Oireachtas in the form of an amendment to this Bill.  This will, of course, give the Oireachtas the opportunity of debating the general activities of the board and the policy being pursued in natural gas development.</P>
    <P>It is intended that expenditure and borrowing by the board will be financed from revenue from sales of gas. Section 10 deals with this aspect and, in this connection, Senators will note that a separate section&mdash;section 11&mdash;is included to permit my giving the board directions as to financial objectives and pricing policy and the application of the board's profits.  The latter could, if I so directed, be applied for the benefit of the Exchequer.  It has been suggested that the Bill should impose a statutory limit on the amount of any State take under this provision.  It has also been suggested that in giving directives under this section, I should be required under the legislation to keep the price of gas as low as possible even if it is significantly lower than the price of other forms of energy. I am not in agreement with these proposals. I consider that it should be left in the hands of the Government of the day to take decisions in these matters as best suits the national interest from time to time.  Furthermore, I do not consider it equitable that all the benefits from a natural gas deposit should necessarily be restricted to particular users.  The benefits of a gas find could as far as possible be spread over the nation as a whole and it would be very unwise to make rigid statutory provisions at this stage which might limit the future options in this area.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt in detail with all the provisions of the Bill because many of them are fairly standard for any State-sponsored body and also because an explanatory memorandum has been circulated which gives a general outline of the Bill.  If, however, there is any matter which Senators may wish to raise about any of the provisions which I have not dealt with, I will be happy to deal with them in my reply to the debate.</P>
    <P>With the possibility of further gas <Col N="1145" /> finds, it is now necessary to give careful consideration to all options for the utilisation of natural gas.  Within the energy sector, gas could be used for power generation and could be fed through a pipeline system for direct heating and cooking uses.  Natural gas also has considerable advantages as a feedstock for petrochemical industries. Decisions on the allocation of gas will have to take account of all relevant factors including market capacity, investment costs and the related economic consideration and the comparative efficiency ratios of various uses. The nation is entitled to use its resources in a way which will optimise the benefits in terms of energy security and stability, employment creation and value added to the economy.</P>
    <P>With those considerations in mind I am arranging for an objective and authoritative study of all possibilities of natural gas.  On the basis of such study, realistic options on the allocation of future finds can be identified and assessed without delay.  Decisions will have to be taken within the context of general energy and economic policy and matters of such great significance for our future development will obviously be decided at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>The setting up of Bord Gáis Éireann is a complementary measure to the offshore policy decisions already announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is an important stage in the planning and utilisation of our national energy resources and it is a step into the future which will broaden our technological base and strengthen our infrastructure in a way which will significantly facilitate our economic progress.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the record of ineptitude in this whole matter over the past two years it is certainly highly desirable, as suggested by the Minister, that some objective and authoritative study of all the possibilities of natural gas should now be made.  I cannot understand why this was not done long ago and, indeed, why it was not done prior to the Government decision of two years ago.  Frankly, that decision <Col N="1146" /> emerges now as being a very grave mistake, having regard to the importance of preserving and conserving our natural resources and, in particular, natural gas and maximising its value to the country by making optimum use of it as an energy factor in our overall requirements.  In this Bill we are merely implementing and making possible the decision made by the Government two years ago by providing more than £25 million as a limitation of expenditure on behalf of the new board to enable the board provide the onshore facilities necessary to divide the utilisation of this natural gas, 40 per cent to the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser plant and 60 per cent to the two ESB power stations, one proposed at Whitegate and the other at Marina Point in Cork. This Bill provides the structure for the establishment of a new board to look into in a serious way the enormous possibilities that exist in this area for the country and I have no objection to that.  The more experts and people who know what they are talking about that we have in this area to advise whatever Government is in office on the proper utilisation of natural gas the better.</P>
      <P>The other leg of the matter is one on which I must take serious issue with the Minister.  Along with establishing this board, which is overdue by two years, we are also implementing a gravely wrong Government decision taken two years ago in regard to the utilisation of the natural gas in the existing field.  It is quite clear that the 40 per cent utilisation towards the proposed NET plant for providing fertiliser is maximum utilisation of the gas and that is agreed by all the experts. It was a correct decision to allocate 40 per cent towards the requirements of the NET plant to render us independent of the importation of fertiliser and, at the same time, give substantial employment and, hopefully, provide a spin-off industrial development giving employment in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, any type of utilisation of natural gas in any allied petro-chemical type industry represents a maximum or near maximum utilisation.  This is agreed and the Minister would not cavil with that.  However, the burden of our serious issue with the Minister <Col N="1147" /> is that a short term expedient decision was made two years ago to transfer to the Electricity Supply Board 60 per cent of this natural gas find on a conversion utilisation that is estimated, conservatively, by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards at a 70 per cent wastage.  In regard to 60 per cent of this natural gas coming off-stream, there is a natural, ordinary, expected wastage, according to the Minister's own experts in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, of 70 per cent.  We can argue about the percentage but all the experts, European, Irish and American, agree that the wastage is somewhere in the order of between 50 and 75 per cent in the conversion of natural gas to power purposes.  The figure in between is 70 per cent and is the one the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has found.</P>
    <P>This is a horrifying prospect when we are emerging as a country with limited resources.  The Minister said in the Dáil, and elsewhere, that we have only this find so far.  What I am going to say accentuates the importance of the matter.  If we have only got this field, and we are not in the way of getting any other fields, does this not emphasise to an enormous degree what I am saying?  If there is just a limited field there surely we do not utilise 60 per cent of that in a wasteful conversion manner to the extent of 70 per cent waste involved?  Surely that is cutting down the number of years substantially and knocking about one-third of the time span of the utilisation of this natural resource?  I do not believe it is a limited field.  I think we have substantial resources there in the general area.  I am not talking about the Kinsale area alone but the west coast and, possibly, off the east coast also.  But, if it is a limited field, surely the arguments are stronger for keeping it on tap and utilising it to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>There are industrial uses other than the nitrogenous fertiliser to which I referred and to which 40 per cent of the natural gas is being devoted.  I mentioned the petro-chemical industry but the smelter industry is another area <Col N="1148" /> where possible industrial spin-off with maximum utilisation might be investigated. The most logical one of all is the whole area of domestic and industrial consumption, providing the basic matters for domestic, industrial and commercial consumption that at present are highly priced.  I am talking of domestic central heating, domestic cooking, in the area of industry and commerce in replacing diesel oil and light fuel oil and electricity for space and water heating.</P>
    <P>I will give the Seanad some basic facts in this area.  They show the enormity of saving of costs involved in utilising this natural gas as opposed to other fuels at present.  It is authoritatively estimated&mdash;I ask the Minister, and his advisers, to argue this out with me because this assessment may be wrong as it is a prognostication but the area of difference is so enormous that give or take a few pence it is right&mdash; that the average price in pence per therm of natural gas, if anybody wants to utilise it commercially by 1980 or utilise it on the basis of reserving funds either for State purposes or for reinvestment purposes, can be 10p.  If we are concerned about its re-development in the appropriate way it can go up to 30p per therm.  I am talking about 10p to 30p per therm and 10p is on by 1980 for natural gas and 30p is the outside figure having regard to all sorts of State disbursements, development and reinvestment disbursements and research disbursements that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>The similar figure in regard to electricity by 1980 will be 90p per therm.  We are talking about 10p to 30p per therm as against 90p per therm. With regard to town gas cooking it is 51p per therm and for town gas heating it is 46p per therm, diesel oil 24p per therm, and light fuel oil 22p per therm. Electricity is at the top of the league at 90p.  The most expensive natural gas could be by 1980 would be one-third of that at 30p per therm.  We are talking in the area of a facility that can feed into a national grid and service areas that are now serviced by electricity and town gas&mdash;domestic, commercial and industrial areas.  It can provide a service that can range anything <Col N="1149" /> from one-ninth to one-third of the cost of electricity.  It can cut the cost of town gas by half both in the cooking and heating areas.  Yet the Minister says the proposal to utilise this natural gas in lieu of town gas is not on because town gas as it stands has only 20 per cent utilisation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Surely in view of the sort of figure I have mentioned we will get a massive switch from town gas and electricity into domestic, commercial and industrial utilisation of natural gas.  It will not happen overnight but the 10 per cent utilisation in regard to natural gas will very rapidly become a 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent utilisation, having regard to the disparities in price as far as the consumer is concerned, both on the domestic front and the industrial front, that will be available if natural gas is utilised properly and not wasted by handing it over to the ESB for power purposes and allowing 70 per cent of the 60 per cent of what we have to be dissipated in the manner I have suggested.  The Minister is well aware that this power conversion of natural gas has been well ascertained to be the most wasteful way of converting this natural asset.  If we have a limited field, then we should be concerned about preserving that limited field and maximising its utilisation. If we had much stronger resources than we have ascertained at present, the argument is equally strong.  We should again conserve and plan ahead for the future.</P>
    <P>This is not just the Fianna Fáil Party talking.  I have got all the European directives here which have been well researched in the past and well investigated by the Commission, the Council of Ministers, the Parliament and various technical committees.  The research was going on before the energy crisis. Since the energy crisis the argument has doubled for the maximum utilisation of natural gas for the purposes for which it is best suited.  In other words, to conserve Europe's energy resources and to conserve Ireland's energy resources.  The Committee spelled out the policy and the Minister is well aware of it.  He said in the Dáil there was not such a directive. He says here the directive does not <Col N="1150" /> preclude the utilisation of natural gas in power stations.  It does not preclude it but, in so far as you can read European language, it does.  That is the only practical meaning of it when we strip the actual directive of the hedging clauses.  What it basically means is that it is only under the most stringent conditions any member country should utilise natural gas in power stations. I quote from the Council Directive of 13th February, 1975.  It is headed &ldquo;On the Restriction of the Use of Natural Gas in Power Stations&rdquo; and says that more stringent national measures restricting the use of natural gas in power stations and conforming with the provisions of this directive may be maintained or adopted.</P>
    <P>It says that whereas special reasons relating to the protection of the environment can, in certain cases, likewise necessitate the use of natural gas in power stations, and whereas the main economic and technical reasons for the use of natural gas in power stations are the following, and so on.  Then it says in the hedging clause that the quantities of natural gas available cannot be disposed of in any other way.  In that sort of situation they will recommend the use of natural gas in power stations, or where it cannot be disposed of on the premium market.  We have a highly geared premium market in Ireland in the domestic and commercial area by our own national grid.</P>
    <P>It finally states that whereas it is necessary in the interests of optimum allocation of resources and security of supplies to prevent the natural gas being covered by provisions which differ from one member state to another, and so on. Then it has adopted the directive&mdash; this is the important one&mdash;to protect Ministers and Governments, like the wasteful Irish Government.  The wasteful Irish Government have apparently made their own decision in advance of the establishment of this board.  It says that the conclusion of new contracts for the supply of natural gas to power stations, the extension of contracts upon expiry and the construction of new power <Col N="1151" /> stations using natural gas must be subject to prior authorisation by the authorities of the member state responsible for the power station concerned.</P>
    <P>That article is trying to deal with people within a State who may try to utilise natural gas.  That article presumes that the member governments, including the Irish Government, will be so anxious to stop that, that no contract for the supply of natural gas for the utilisation of power stations can be adopted by the ESB&mdash;the obvious one in this country.  That article means that the ESB cannot on their own go ahead and do that without the authorisation of the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>What that directive did not envisage was that we would have a Government here who would actually themselves propose this wasteful utilisation.  It is not just a power authority within the State going mad.  It is not just the ESB going mad within the State.  It is the Government.  Despite all the recommendations here, the Government concluded an agreement and arranged two years ago for the ESB to get 60 per cent of natural gas.  Here the directive in Article 1 is designed to protect the Irish Government against maverick power station organisations like the ESB.  But the Government decided two years ago to take an initiative to waste the natural asset to the extent of 60 per cent of its utilisation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this directive is to control and corral the whole utilisation of natural gas in power stations.  That directive was issued following on a policy proposal.  I quote from &ldquo;Natural Gas, European Communities, Brussels 27th January, 1976&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Electricity generation on this basis is certain to rise from approximately 143 twh in 1975 to 150 twh in 1985, but a considerable reduction will be noted from 1980.</P>
    <P>This is a satisfactory trend.  It corresponds to the correct application of the Community Directive on limiting the use of natural gas <Col N="1152" /> in power stations.  It would not be sensible either to prevent the construction of gas-fired power stations in certain cases provided for in Directive No. 75/405, or to hope for the abandonment of plans for gas-fired power stations commissioned before the Directive mentioned above was brought into force which must be put into service in order to compensate for any shortfall in the electricity balance around 1980.</P>
    <P>What that is saying, in effect, is that if power stations were commissioned prior to the Community directive and if construction work had actually started and contracts had been signed, that is all right; if there is no other conceivable utilisation, as might be the case in some remote area, they will allow that as an exception.  All the Commission is doing is trying to put sense into member government's heads, and to say that if they are wise they will maximise the utilisation of natural gas and divert the resources from the power station utilisation into whatever is seen to be available in the member country.</P>
    <P>This is not just the thinking in 1976 or 1975; it was going on in 1974 when the Government decision was made. There is a proposal from the Commission for a new energy policy strategy for the European Community and it says on page 40 of this document of 26th June, 1974:</P>
    <P>1.  The use of natural gas in power stations in the Community began when large deposits of natural gas were discovered in Europe.</P>
    <P>2.  The consumption of natural gas by power stations is only justified when for economic and technical reasons it cannot be used more profitably elsewhere or when there is a grave supply crisis in other fuels which require it.</P>
    <P>3.  A ramified network for the transport and distribution of natural gas has now been constructed in the Member States of the Community and will be further developed in the future.</P>
    <P>This comes to what I want to talk about, and this is where we have fallen down completely.  What the Commission <Col N="1153" /> and the Community envisage there is that Europe will, to a greater degree, be dependent on its own resources, particularly its national gas resources for the whole area of domestic and commercial utilisation.  In the current issue of their journal for May, 1976, the European Investment Bank have a very interesting map which bears out what the Commission had proposed in 1974, that a network distribution be organised so as to supply the appropriate commercial and domestic fuel to members. In the past two years the European Investment Bank have spent over £250 million or 500 million units of account by way of loan facilities, which we have not availed of at all, to a large number of member countries and in some cases even non-member countries, that is Norway and Algeria, for the purpose of constructing right across western Europe a massive network distribution precisely for domestic and commercial industrial consumption.</P>
    <P>Some of the figures and the distances which these pipelines are going on this map which I have in front of me are very interesting.  There is a very large find off the north Netherlands coast at Gronirger, and that is finding its way by pipeline down to Paris on one leg of the pipeline and to northern Italy on another leg of the pipeline. This makes nonsense of our problem in bringing natural gas from Cork to Dublin and providing a minimum network for our industrial regions and housing areas which can be served from such a pipeline.  That one is already constructed and financed by the European Investment Bank.  They are envisaging a similar type of pipeline proposals from Norway to Britain and from Norway down to Memmel in northern Germany and into Germany itself.  There are proposals being programmed through the European Investment Bank for underwater pipelines going from Algeria across into Italy, southern France and Spain.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of thinking at the moment but it is not the sort of thinking in this Bill.  This is far-reaching, dynamic thinking which is looking ahead to a situation where, as is said in the statement from the European Investment Bank, because they know <Col N="1154" /> the realities, although gaseous fuels generally only contributed 2 per cent of the total energy consumption of the present member countries in 1960, the target for 1985 is that 23 per cent of the total energy consumption will be based on natural gas, which is a jump of 21 per cent between 1960 and 1985. That is the trend.  I have just referred to the increase in consumption, and it says on page 1 that this:</P>
    <P>is being increasingly reserved for the premium end of the market where preciseness and cleanliness are most valued (such as in domestic heating, glassworks, potteries and the food industry).</P>
    <P>It was away from the power consumption area.  The trend in regard to power station utilisation of natural gas is declining and will, if the Europeans have their way be a disappearing factor through the eighties.  The Minister is correct that there is consumption of natural gas for power purposes but it has stopped totally since the energy crisis. The futility of the whole development of natural gas in this area was quite evident, particularly from the energy crisis on.  In any event prior to that it was becoming evident that it was wasteful utilisation, but the energy crisis of 1973 certainly brought the message home in a big way that this is not the way for sensible people to utilise their resources.  The figure at the moment indicates that about 19 per cent utilisation of natural gas within the EEC serves power station purposes. That is a declining figure.  It was 23 per cent some three years ago.  It is going to be a declining factor.  I would like to know from the Minister if there is any example of a contract being placed by a member country with a power authority in that member country to build a power station catering for the use of natural gas since the EEC directive was issued.  That is the directive position of a year ago; the thinking was well in hand a year before that. The Government made this decision two years ago when all this information and data were available to them.</P>
    <P>I hazard an opinion that we are <Col N="1155" /> the only country, not alone in the EEC but probably in the western and North American world generally, that is starting at this stage to convert natural gas into a power outlet. My information is that the EEC directive is being fully observed and the only utilisation in regard to conversion of natural gas to power purposes within the EEC at the moment all relates back to a pre-1974 situation, that post-1974 there has not been any and there certainly will not be.  To what extent are we bound by this arrangement with the ESB?  To what extent does the State have to go ahead with it at this stage?  This is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said in the Dáil I understand that the proposed power station at Whitegate and the extension at Marina are both easily convertible to oil, that the basic structure and plant are not very different.  If they are different at all I would like some information on that.  If that is the case, then the ESB can continue with the erection of their proposed extension and new power station in that area and have it converted to oil in the ordinary course.  I do not know at what stage of construction they are and I would like some information on that.  I do not know how binding the contract is with the ESB.  There is a contract with Marathon, that is for the landing of natural gas.  Apparently some arrangements were made with NET, of which I approve, for 40 per cent. All the expert opinion is with the Government side in that respect. Let that stand.</P>
    <P>In the national interest, have the Government to go ahead with the ESB contract?  After all, the ESB is the creature of the State, of the Government who are acting on behalf of the people.  The Government should make it known to the ESB that, in the national interest, it was undesirable that we should give them an asset to be utilised in a highly wasteful form by them.  This would not even be in the long-term interest of the ESB.  This <Col N="1156" /> involves a short-term expedient gain for the ESB as against a long-term serious matter for them and for the country as a whole.  If the ESB were approached in that way, as a responsible State body subject to the Minister, the Government and taxpayers as a whole, their attitude would not be unresponsive.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister may think that the decision is justified.  I am trying to surmise but probably it was a decision not fully based on the facts of the matter.  Two years ago the Minister did not have what he is now proposing in the Bill.  He did not have a board with back-up expertise and knowledge to enable the proper advice to be given.  I am trying to explain why the decision was made. Probably at that time the ESB advised that they should get their hands on it because it presented them with an immediate short-term gain in the sense that they would be provided with a very cheap fuel, which, even with the waste, as far as they were concerned, would be very good value for money as against diesel oil.  Perhaps the Government and the ESB at that time had an over-fixation about the situation in regard to imported oil.</P>
    <P>Surely it is wasteful either way.  If we are speaking of having to import oil, that has to be done, but then the converse is also true, that if native natural assets are being wasted to the extent of 70 per cent for power utilisation, surely that is more wasteful than importing oil.  Surely the spin-off benefit of having natural gas used domestically, commercially and industrially throughout the State from the national grid, the reduction in energy costs and in the cost of living as far as the household is concerned and in energy costs as far as industry and commerce is concerned, would be incalculable, having regard to the high energy costs at present in regard to industry.  Surely, apart from the actual erection of the national grid for provision of gas services with the direct employment involved&mdash;and we need some direct employment schemes from the Government at present&mdash;the growth in industries which would follow in the areas through which this pipeline would <Col N="1157" /> pass would ensure a spin-off in employment. The growth in industry would reduce costs involved, and this would be a beneficial factor.</P>
    <P>In all of these arguments I do not understand why the decision was made, but it was made two years ago and, I suggest, used for expediency to get over an immediate situation, to get cheap gas into the power stations and relieve the ESB of a financial problem. On the Minister's own admission in the Dáil, that provided an immediate utilisation for this gas.  That is the worst reason of all.  The Minister's argument was that with the provision by the ESB of a power station the bringing in of the natural gas adjacent to the power station would mean immediate utilisation and that there was some great gain in getting this natural resource and starting to waste it immediately.</P>
    <P>I reject this argument completely. I dispute the logic of saying in regard to an asset of this kind that we will have a great quantity of it for a long time ahead and that there is some benefit in providing for its immediate utilisation irrespective of the benefit or effectiveness of that utilisation.  If any proper planning went into the matter that is certainly the worst argument. It is the sort of argument used if you want to throw out the bath water; if you want to get rid of it quickly throw it out the window.  This is the effect of the Minister's argument. He used it several times in the Dáil, that there was no other way in which this resource could be used expeditiously except by sticking it into a power station.</P>
    <P>If that arrangement was made with the ESB two years ago, it is still not too late to change it.  The gas will not be available for another two years. The ESB are building power stations which can be utilised as oil-fired power stations.  We must get the gas ashore.  That is provided for in the Bill.  The deal between Marathon and the new board stands and we will be able to get the gas ashore.  But have we to be hog-tied to a Government decision of two years ago to give it to the ESB?  I am sure if there are any contractual obligations on behalf <Col N="1158" /> of the State with the ESB, that the ESB are responsible people who have the national interest at heart and who will not hold the Government to a contract.  The Minister made one constructive point when he said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I am arranging for an objective and authoritative study of all possible uses of natural gas.  On the basis of such study, realistic options on the allocation of future finds can be identified and assessed without delay. Decisions will have to be taken within the context of general energy and economic policy and matters of such great significance for our future development will obviously be decided at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  My point was that this should have been done two years ago.  If the Minister, in arranging for his objective and authoritative study, would arrange for an immediate part of that study to be a discussion on the arrangement with ESB it would be a constructive area of investigation.  I am not alone in this opinion.  Everybody in the production and conversion of energy area will agree with that.  If the Minister will be advised by the people in the production of gas the Dublin Gas Company will say what I say.  The Cork Gas Company have said it and caused the Minister to vary, in some way, the initial Government decision when they came in at a late stage for 5 per cent of it to be used as natural gas converted into the Cork domestic and commercial grid.  That was a very good decision.  That puts the sums out a little.  I do not know where the different percentages come from but 5 per cent of the total will now go to the Cork Gas Company.  I do not see why the Minister cannot take advice from the various energy authorities here, in Britain and in the EEC.  I know that within seven days they will confirm that what I am saying is true.</P>
    <P>There are financial mechanics involved. The national grid from Dublin to Cork presents a financial problem. The various estimates, or guesstimates, I suppose, are all you could make now, would depend on how many side routes you had, amount to something in the order of £150 million to £200 million. <Col N="1159" /> If you did a comprehensive one to Dublin city, and branched off to Waterford and Limerick, it is probably in that order, branching also, possibly, to Athlone or some other towns and major industrial centres.</P>
    <P>At any rate, this is something that should not be too difficult to do fairly quickly.  It should not be too difficult to make up the sort of sum that will be involved and put that on one side of the balance sheet, the capital involved, and put on the other side the sort of immediate gain involved in building a power station and providing employment at a power station.  Is there much gain in that?  That is the other side of it.</P>
    <P>From the employment and social viewpoints there is probably far greater benefit in building your grid, in bringing in industry to follow the grid, in providing cheap energy for existing industries.  In converting people from town gas to natural gas, you create a whole area of economic activity. These are sums that have to be worked out.  I do not think it will require any great length of time to work them out.  Everybody is agreed on the basic fact, and I do not think the Minister would dispute it, that the conversion of natural gas to domestic and commercial industrial use through the provision of a national grid for these purposes is by far a more economical way.</P>
    <P>Problems arise with regard to creating the infrastructure for this&mdash;whether it is to be done by way of liquified form, conveyed in tankers, or by way of providing a grid through a pipeline system.  I think the latter is the right way, socially and economically.  There is an initial capital cost involved and that represents the only risk element. I mentioned to the Minister that the European Investment Bank are now engaged in a massive programme of contributing loan finance to precisely this development.  It has lent over 500 units of account and I quote from the May issue of the EIB journal:</P>
    <P>...£250 million ranging from Norway, without the Community, the North of Scotland right down to the South of Italy.  It has proposed loans <Col N="1160" /> to Algeria, North African countries...</P>
    <P>We have not sought any money from this loan agency for this purpose. That could help in solving the financial problem.  Has any effort been made to contact the European Investment Bank?  Has any effort been made to go to this loan agency who are obviously vitally interested in implementing a positive European policy in this area of natural gas and the utilisation of resources, and above all else the utilisation of resources in a planned way so that they are properly conserved and maintained for maximum utilisation and most effective use as far as the Community as a whole is concerned.  I have made my point. I may say that is my only point basically on this Bill.  I think the establishment of the board is long overdue.  The board should have been established two years ago.  The board, if established with the proper research and scientific back-up and know-how, will certainly advise in the direction I am talking about. I know that the sort of people the Minister will have on the board and has employed on the board, will be giving him that sort of advice.  If they had been there two years ago they might have given this sort of advice and the Government would not have walked into a decision that is totally based, in my view, on expediency.</P>
    <P>If this Bill in setting up the board does anything to prevent this sort of thing happening again, I am all for it. I am all for an Irish Gas Board properly established, properly staffed, properly financed.  I might say that the financial provision is a bit meagre. On the Minister's own admission I think it is £25 million.  That is only designed to cover the existing works, landing the gas and conveying it to the ESB and NET in Cork.  I do not think that is enough.  I know the Minister can come back to the House again, but I should like to see the Minister coming back very quickly with another Bill considerably enhancing the loan limits of the board with a view to engaging in the sort of development that is now going on in western Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> However, that is another point on the inadequacy of the Bill, which is reflected in the fact that while I am with the Minister in setting up the board, hoping that the board will be working with him in a dynamic way in the near future, the Bill basically as it stands is only designed to finance the board, to deal partially with the major undertaking of the provision of natural gas for power purposes. The board will have to provide the lines to deal with that, the pipelines and landing facilities and so on.  The only thing I will ask the Minister again is whether it is possible to get this board to reconsider the Government error of two years.  Is it possible for this board to make an immediate <i>ad hoc</i> study, as the Minister suggested they should do, on the overall basis of gas utilisation?  Would it be possible, once this board are established, to get down as a priority job to look at the Government decision? In other words, is the Government decision <i>vis-a-vis</i> the ESB irrevocable?</P>
    <P>I am asking can it be revoked? Could not further examination by the board now to be established, if they are given that examination as a matter of priority, bring home to the Minister that it might be a matter of considerable national importance if he went along to the ESB and if the Government and the ESB had second thoughts about this utilisation of natural gas before it is too late?  It will not be too late until 1978.  This board will be established within the next two months.  They will have a chance, given this task as a matter of priority, of reporting back to the Minister, and there is nothing wrong with the Minister or the Government saying that the mistake was made. There have been plenty of mistakes made by all Governments in the energy field, mainly resulting from the absence of long-term planning, because the resources and the facilities and the research were not available either to this Government or the previous Government.  I do not have to go into them.  We all know about them in regard to the oil concessions off the south coast, the main reason <Col N="1162" /> being the absence of authoritative research and scientific back-up to Ministers and Governments.  We are doing something about that in this Bill in this area.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give this board the first task of investigating whether a wrong decision was made <i>vis-a-vis</i> the ESB two years ago and whether, if a wrong decision has been made, negotiations can be entered into before it is too late between the Government and the ESB about the revocation of that decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We must realise that this is not a major find; in fact, it is a very small natural gas find.  Are we now going to agree with Senator Lenihan and invest in a national grid that he said would cost £200 million or more.  I think it will cost substantially more than that if we are to do the job properly.  Are we now to invest that much on chance? There is no guarantee whatsoever that we will find more gas.  It is speculation. I am sure Senator Lenihan accepts that it is only speculation that there is more gas to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we do not find more gas, then are we going to invest this substantial amount of money in a national grid? If the Government accept the argument that Senator Lenihan made and begin investing in this national grid and eventually after two or three years we find that there is no gas to put through this grid, then who is to blame?  Senator Lenihan will be up here two or three weeks after the Government finding out that the gas is not there condemning the Government for this substantial investment. That investment would be a waste and there is no doubt that it would be a waste.  We have already a national distribution system of energy, and that is the ESB.  With the type of find we have, I believe that what is now being done, what is now being proposed in the Bill, is the correct method of distribution of this energy.  I have no doubt in my mind about that.  I am not a gambler.  If I were a gambler maybe I would guess that Senator Lenihan may be right, but I am not a gambler.  I do not think the Government <Col N="1163" /> should gamble in this regard. We are not talking about gambling £2 million or £5 million, we are talking about gambling £1,000 million or more.  Therefore, I suggest that what the Minister has proposed here is the right thing to do.  We are a small nation.  We cannot throw away our money on speculation.  There is no doubt that extra work will be available in the ESB because of the proposed system, and in the fertiliser factories.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, we have imported fertilisers at a substantial cost to the nation.  If we have our own fertiliser industries, that will mean further investment in agriculture and in the land.  This investment is badly needed and will produce substantial finance for the nation.  If we can get the farmers to use this cheap fertiliser on their land, we will be doing a good thing and will have more produce from the land to export.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill before the House.  As I said, I hate waste of money and I hate the gambler who is not certain of winning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Bill as initiating a new and very important development in our country.  I agree very much with the sentiments of the last speaker, in that what we have at the moment is a relatively small find.  We must all remember that this was found in 1973 and we have not produced anything since then.  Our whole policy and development should be conditioned to what the next two to four years show of the resources off our coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the EEC appear to be very definite at present about an energy policy, about the utilisation of natural gas, and so on, in point of fact, a long-term energy policy is very dicey. Indeed, Senator Lenihan and his colleagues in Government were belaboured often with many figures on the shockingly wasteful process of making electricity from turf.  It was by far the most wasteful way we could generate electricity.  Yet now, less than ten years later, we find that turf is second lowest in the list.  In other <Col N="1164" /> words, economics have changed drastically and these economics can change very drastically in the future again, because a question mark that hangs over the whole of energy is the question of solar generation.  We are only beginning to tap the commercial utilisation of that.  In this we are heartened by the earlier results which give the astonishing facts that in our climate, taking the good with the bad, with the overcast and the sunny, we can generate 50 per cent as much energy per acre as the most arid desert can produce.  In short, when solar energy becomes feasible, we will be in this in a very big way, because we have under-populated areas&mdash;stretches of the country that would be ideal for suitable energy collection.</P>
    <P>If that is to be done, it will be on a relatively local or regional basis.  It raises a question mark on the question of this national grid which, of course, would be the ideal way to develop extensive finds off the south coast, provided there were no other finds being found elsewhere around the coast.  Your guess is as good as mine on that.</P>
    <P>The pattern for development of solar energy could be very different from the pattern of the development of this.  We all accept the fact that both oil and gas are relatively short-term. There is some talk of 20 years, 30 years, even the most optimistic would not hold that you would have ample supplies for much longer than that period.  Naturally, their utilisation and their conservation will have to be investigated and guarded.  In short, it is a field where we do not have the answers.  In such a situation we cannot take up committed positions. I do not say that the Government are right and Fianna Fáil are wrong in their approaches; I say we just have not got the answers either way.  When the answers do come, we have to recognise that the ESB are a semi-State body, under the control of Parliament.  If at any stage in the future economics and the judgment of the Government say that gas should no longer be used for electricity generation, I do not see there being any difficulty whatsoever in <Col N="1165" /> Parliament imposing their decision on the ESB, no more than there should be a difficulty in imposing it on any other State body created to serve the nation, and the best interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the present arrangements, in providing for nitrogen as applied to the fertiliser industry, make a start on what is the most profitable and most beneficial utilisation of natural gas in the petro-chemical industry.  It has the advantage that the cost of the pipeline is relatively low.  They have a good start and with more finds off the coast, there is no reason why the scale of activities there should not increase very spectacularly in the years ahead and develop a very profitable and worth-while export business.</P>
    <P>We also have the utilisation of gas in homes.  A pilot gas scheme has been started in the Cork area.  If that is the success I know it will be, and if further finds are made, we will have to produce some kind of a link-up to Dublin.  How that can be done depends on many factors in the future.</P>
    <P>We will be watching developments in Europe, where they already have a much better established supply of gas, with some reasonable long term prospects.  We have to see how well they develop and so on.  Perhaps if our finds here do not materialise or do not prove to be as extensive as we would wish, the question of whether or not it is an economic proposition to import gas with an underseas gas main line from Europe will be considered. That is something we will probably debate in six, eight or ten years' time.  For my money and for the development of an energy policy here, I pin far more faith on the development of solar energy, and the potential it has for this country than what seems likely in our present gas finds. They are a short-term boost, but they will not solve our energy problems for any long term, and so I welcome especially the setting up of this advisory board suggested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like this board to be seen to be a relatively independent body, not a type of inter-departmental committee. <Col N="1166" /> I would prefer it to have a separate existence, because we would like to feel that the advice coming from it will be scientific and balanced and will not be dominated by the Government thinking of the day or by the ESB or any other unit.  I know that it makes good economic sense for the ESB and it solves their short-term problems that they can get this gas allocation.</P>
    <P>It also of course in a very vital way decreases our dependence on imported fuels.  At this juncture that is a move that is very desirable, even though it may look costly in the economics of today.  What will it be in the economics of three or four years' time?  We cannot hazard a guess.  In other words, it is a case where you hasten slowly, and where, with all the other commitments that we have to face, we cannot rush into exceedingly high cost capital development. Our priority at the moment is surely, employment, and employment that we can afford in some way or other.  All this investment is fine, but the amount of employment created is very costly indeed.  All petro-chemical industries are exceedingly high-cost and if you try to write off a national grid over any short number of years &mdash;you have to do that with present interest rates&mdash;again you get that priced out.  In short, our supply of money is very limited, and I think our present priorities have to be to try to produce jobs one way or another.</P>
    <P>Let us not take up political positions on this.  It is not a political question. It is a guessing question, where the guess of the politician is no better than the guess of the scientist at this stage.  We are entering into a new era, a new period in the history of energy development.  Let us keep open minded on that and let us neither criticise the Government at present for apparently being rather cautious in the allocation to the ESB nor criticise the Fianna Fáil Administration of the past in pinning so much faith on turf development or electricity generation at a time when all the economics were against them.</P>
    <P>Let us be thankful for what we have got, and proceed carefully, noting <Col N="1167" /> that the size of the finds over the next three to four years will determine very much what we should do.  If there is only a little there, it will have to be conserved.  At the moment we have to be watchful and keep an open mind on it.  Within those limitations, I think the Government's approach is prudent.  I do not think they could have done anything else, and I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I also welcome the Bill.  I would welcome any statutory board set up to control our natural resources.  However, putting it in the idealistic way, I would rather be talking about something that was absolutely State controlled.  In the circumstances of the society we live in, and the reality of the problems facing us in that direction and the fact that we have not as yet got the thinking of the people moving in that direction <i>in toto,</i> we must welcome any move that will take control of our natural resources and move in the best direction we can to get the best deal possible out of it.  Any effort in the direction of a system of coordinated national control of energy resources must give heart to those of us that hold the view I have just expressed.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of direct and indirect benefits, we naturally believe that the fullest possible benefits must accrue to the community as a whole, but I think we are sensible enough to acknowledge the fact that at this time, when the climate of opinion is not in that direction, and the economic situation and so on not moving towards that, we must accept that the best possible deal has been arrived at in the circumstances.  It is encouraging to see that we will have a statutory gas board to deal with these energy assets we come across from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the find constitutes only 12 per cent of our energy requirements, in these times of high unemployment it satisfies a hope that the employment this venture will give, coupled with the activities of organisations such as Fóir Teoranta and the Employment <Col N="1168" /> Premium Bill, will convince the people that there is an earnest desire on the part of the Government, to explore all avenues that might lead to easing the unemployment situation.  It would be dishonest to say at this time that we are talking about a solution to the unemployment situation, but any measure that can be engaged in by the State, which will help to ease unemployment must be encouraged, and must be accepted as being desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone will quarrel with the allocation of the Kinsale gas to NET for the manufacture of fertilisers and to the ESB for the generation of electricity and to the Cork Gas Board.  There would be no quarrel with the allocation of gas for those purposes.  In the case of NET we cannot deny the importance to the economy of the agricultural sector.  It is important that we should realise the value of that usage because fertilisers increase production and by having our own fertilisers, we can compete more keenly in the present situation.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the Bill on the basis that there will be probably 500 people permanently employed.  If we take the service industries such as transport, haulage, maintenance and shipping into account, by and large, I would accept the Minister's figure that somewhere in the region of 2,000 people will be employed.  In the ESB alone through being able to avail of the gas now, there is the possibility that a couple of hundred jobs could be created there also.</P>
    <P>It is also encouraging that the Bill should be introduced at a time when the whole question of the commercial resources in our Continental Shelf area is not as yet fully known.  If there should be further encouraging signs of resources being available in the gas or oil fields, then the experience gained from the recent round of negotiations and consultations that we sought should lead to a strengthening of bargaining power in any future deals which might be contemplated in respect of other finds with which this present Bill is not concerned.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has cleared up some concern and confusion about engaging British gas experts.  Many <Col N="1169" /> people were under the impression that there was more involved than just a consultancy service.  Having read the Minister's statement and the Dáil debate on it, I am satisfied that the Minister has cleared that point up very satisfactorily and the involvement of the British gas people goes no further than just a consultancy service.  While there may be a good explanation for it, I am not happy that we never seem to be ahead on the technology side in the oil and gas fields and yet we have many Irish engineers working in similar fields in various countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Not having had the benefit of either secondary or higher level education, I am wondering whether there is a lack of interest on the part of the educational authorities.  My belief always was that there were no natural resources.  That could be one of the underlying reasons why we have to call on British Gas Board expertise to advise us in situations like this.  I am not sure whether an educational programme&mdash;now that we have this advice and expertise&mdash; should not be embarked on and that some encouragement should not be given to people to take up those branches of technology provided there is sufficient confidence that opportunities will be available in this area. It may be argued that it might be a matter for the Department of Education or the various educational authorities.  If such a programme to assist Irish people to apply this gas or oil expertise or gas or oil technology or mining technology is feasible we should realise that it is not very acceptable not to have Irish people with technological expertise specific to these important areas, particularly when we have to argue that because of the technical nature of the enterprise there is tremendous risk involved and we cannot gauge the risk. We have to take the word of <i>entrepreneurs</i> who operate in this field that the risks are very large.  If we had our own experts, perhaps on a further examination the risks, while still existing, might not be really as great as they seem at present through lack of technical knowledge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> The conclusion of a contract with Marathon by BGE for the purchase of the Kinsale Head gas by NET and the ESB I have already welcomed.  I wonder whether we can convince the public that we got a good deal without the public knowing to some extent&mdash;perhaps not in total detail&mdash;the commercial aspects of it.  If I were not involved in politics I would want to know a little more about what type of deals have been done.  Some information was given about the type of deals done in the case of other resources.  I would accept the Minister's word that we have got a good deal, but there is the possibility that the &ldquo;knockers&rdquo; and the cranks who issue the various &ldquo;rags&rdquo; will take advantage of this lack of information.  It might be worth considering giving further information out in relation to such deals.</P>
    <P>It will not satisfy people to say that section 37 of the Bill provides that all natural gas landed in the State, for consumption in the State, shall be offered on reasonable terms to the gas board because it does not indicate that the gas board may dispute whether the terms are reasonable or not.  You can tell the nation we have a good deal: under section 37, the Bill provides that natural gas landed must be offered on reasonable terms and yet we have what to me seems a contradictory argument, that if you are not satisfied with the terms, you can dispute them and go to arbitration.  It is a paradoxical situation to me and I would like the Minister to clear up that particular point.  It is not very difficult to confuse me and the Minister might show me wherein my confusion lies.  I make the point in all sincerity in the interest of allaying fears the public have.</P>
    <P>On the question of policy in dealing with energy resources, credit must not be denied to those who have been handling the matter.  Whilst I will be critical of some aspects and confused about others, it would be wrong for me not to express my appreciation, and the appreciation of some of my colleagues, in that, despite the need for a change-over, from the very beginning there has been great continuity of endeavour.  That <Col N="1171" /> will be very helpful in bringing the gas to shore much quicker.  It will also help in our balance of payments situation.  It will, I understand, make the situation healthier to the tune of £75 million.  I have heard the figure expressed as £100 million but the Minister has made a conservative estimate of £75 million.  I commend the way the matter was handled.  We are up against the question of the high cost of imports and where imports can be replaced by our own raw materials that is a very desirable evolution.</P>
    <P>Again, the job situation crops up. We have the job situation, the balance of payments situation and the allocation situation which have all helped to sustain a certain impetus.  I am confident that the energy situation is being handled, by and large, very well indeed.  My ambition is to have an overall energy policy.  Perhaps there is some thinking about such a policy.  I do not know if time plays a part in that one must wait on developments and then, in the light of experience, adumbrate an energy policy.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that with the mining situation, the oil situation and these gas finds we have a situation now where we could have a policy covering all aspects of natural resources. There is great harmony between the various Departments.  I note that even the Minister for Local Government has gone out of his way to facilitate planning permission so that there would be no undue delay in bringing the gas ashore more quickly than it might have been had there not been co-ordination between the various Departments.  I include, of course, the Department of Industry and Commerce in that.</P>
    <P>There should not be any criticism of the utilisation of natural gas for the production of electricity by the ESB.  In an ideal situation there might be some grounds for criticism but we have to think about our security.  The ESB are a very large and important body and play a very important role in that security.  It is only right that bodies like the ESB should be facilitated in the use of natural gas for the <Col N="1172" /> production of electricity and I would oppose any other approach.</P>
    <P>We are not living in an ideal world.  There were situations in the past where we could have run into trouble.  In the oil crisis we had not sufficient reserves and we had no control. I have heard the date given trouble.  I have heard the date given as April, 1978, when we may expect to get the gas ashore.  I hope this is true for the sake of the employment situation in regard to NET, ESB and the Cork Gas Company because, if it is not brought ashore then, there will be some difficulty.  Having considered the situation, they have probably geared their schedules accordingly but, if it does not come ashore at that time, I can see all sorts of problems. It may even jeopardise the employment situation.</P>
    <P>In making that point, I do not think for a minute that nothing can go wrong but I have no doubt that the synchronisation between the various bodies has been very good.  I believe the gas will come ashore.  Perhaps the Minister might have a little more information than just the broad expectation of its coming ashore by 1978.  The ideal would be to have total State control over our energy resources, but one must face the realities.  Sufficient leeway must be given to the Minister.  As one who has been involved in negotiation, not at the same level but very extensively over many years, I say that no negotiator should be sent in to negotiate with his hands tied, and I would not like the Minister to think I was implying that in anything I said.  In fact, I refute any suggestion of that by other speakers.  The Minister must be quite free because in that way he will get the best kind of deal.  If we start tying the Minister's hands the risks will be big and we may not get the kind of deal we want.  The strategy must be the Minister's.  The strategy has been good and I hope we will realise the full potetial in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am not sure about the demands we can make on the exploration companies. It has been said that the Minister's hands should not be tied.  I hope that as the negotiations develop <Col N="1173" /> and this expertise grows a little there will be a revelation of the type of terms that are possible to advance rather than settle for the terms now offered.  That is a reiteration of the point that when we have got more technical expertise in gas and oil fields we should be able to strike a better bargain.  I do not believe that you can go much further on that particular point.</P>
    <P>On the question of the purchase of Irish goods, I wonder how realistic that is having regard to the type of material which is needed.  Would the Minister clear my thinking on this particular matter?  I welcome the idea and I know the Minister has put a lot of effort into putting this as a condition of bringing the gas ashore.  I know his problem with regard to overlapping into the Department of Industry and Commerce and so on but I wonder if sufficient stress has been put on this.  Even if we do put sufficient stress on it, how far can Ireland go to supply the type of material needed and how far can we go to build the type of structures and plants needed?</P>
    <P>The find is only 12 per cent but it is very, very encouraging to see that the employment content could be stepped up.  I am like the fellow in America who fell off the 56 storey apartment block and said when passing the 40th storey, &ldquo;So far so good.&rdquo;  I am an optimist.  I hope there will be a lot more gas found and that when we find it we will have the same capable, competent people to deal with the people involved in it.  With the experience they have gained I hope they will be able to make an even better deal in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is é príomh-chuspóir an Bhille seo bord a bhunú&mdash;bord Stáit atá i gceist agam&mdash;chun gás a sholáthar.  Measann an tAire agus an Rialtas, is dócha, go bhfuil bord den saghas sin riachtanach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to talk about the gas board we think of the various sources of energy that are available &mdash;what comes to mind immediately is the hydro system which has been in operation here for quite a long period, harnessing many of our rivers <Col N="1174" /> and in that way creating electricity which was fed to the country through a national grid.  This was augmented by turf-burning and coal-producing stations.  Later on oil was used but this has become very expensive.  Some people have been directing their attention towards atomic and solar energy; others have considered whether tidal waves might help us in the years ahead to create the energy needed to keep our industries and people in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of this legislation, it is only now it is beginning to percolate to many people that gas has been discovered here.  Nevertheless, the ESB were very quick off the mark in getting in here and collaring so quickly for themselves almost 60 per cent of this natural energy which was found around our coast.  I have no axe to grind about the 40 per cent which is being allotted towards the utilisation and implementation of a scheme which will help to produce fertilisers in the future at a very competitive price, much cheaper than if they were imported.  The farming community will welcome this development. Last year fertilisers were too expensive and were left lying in many stores.  That had repercussions in so far as the industries which are based on agriculture are concerned, in particular fruit-processing factories, milk production, butter, cheese and so on.  For that reason I think the Minister was very wise in allotting the 40 per cent to the fertiliser factory in Cork.  Perhaps in the north we may be a little bit jealous of the fact that Cork seems to be lucky at all times, even to come up with the natural gas finds.</P>
    <P>I wonder what information the Government have on the other types of explorations which have been made throughout the country regarding findings of natural gas inland.  In my own county when work on boring a well last year was being carried out gas was found instead of water and about ten years ago in the other end of the county where the oil company were drilling they also came upon gas.  I have actually seen the flame alight there.  Probably that indicates <Col N="1175" /> a very small flow but if they had gone down deeper there might be better results.  When gas is found on the continental shelf around our coast, and geography and topography being what they are, it is only natural to wonder if there may be natural gas resources right around our coast and even inland.</P>
    <P>I am not an engineer and I am not very well up in the way of strata, rocks, gas formation and so on but there are geologists and engineers who know about this and I am quite sure we have a number of them in this country. Many of them have gone abroad and distinguished themselves in work on discovering gas and manning many of these intricate gas rigs which are stationed in dangerous parts of the ocean.  We train many of them in our universities and it is a pity they have to go abroad and give their expertise to these foreign countries so that when we have a natural gas find as the one in Cork we may have to import foreign labour.  It would be a grave reflection on our universities and colleges of technology and the whole educational system so far as our country is concerned. We have the potential here and I think Irish workers have what is needed.  They have matched themselves with workers in any part of the world. Like riding a bicycle, when you have the know-how there is nothing much to it.  If a short-term course is necessary for some of our top engineers, I think the Minister would be wise in making sure that Irish engineers avail of such a course.  We know they built many of the power stations and they were a credit to them.</P>
    <P>This find is a very great asset to the country and I would like the Minister to pursue it as best he can within the national resources to find out if there could be a link-up throughout the country, not alone in the Twenty-six Counties but into the Six Counties to cover the whole island.  There may be some sense in what has been suggested, that instead of wasting the other 60 per cent in feeding it into the ESB there might be a case for running a pipline through the whole country and connecting off at various points, at big <Col N="1176" /> centres of population especially along the east coast.  There is no reason to doubt what has been said, because these people seem to have expert knowledge that there is two-thirds wastage in the supply of gas when you use it to manufacture electricity.</P>
    <P>That is very great wastage indeed. While it may create some extra employment in County Cork, it will not reduce the price of electricity for the ordinary consumer.  The ESB have made great strides in the past but their charges throughout the country at present are of a crippling nature. They are contributing greatly to the depopulation of rural Ireland by the fact that they have terminated the scheme through which electricity was supplied to a person building a new home out in the country.  It is now costing £1,000 for a person building a home outside a town to instal electricity. That is a wrong policy to adopt. Towns will be built up but the countryside will be depopulated and as a result there will be a shortage of houses, schools and so on.  This is something the Minister and the ESB need to examine.</P>
    <P>In the past, the ESB have provided amenities throughout Ireland. It is wrong for them to cease to do this in 1976 and fall back on a type of policy which will make it almost impossible for a person to live in the countryside because of the exhorbitant charges for rural electrification.</P>
    <P>If this gas were piped throughout the country, particularly to populated areas, it would be of immense benefit to the ordinary domestic consumers. This should have been considered. Unfortunately, the decision has already been taken before either the Dáil or Seanad had an opportunity to discuss it.  The Minister and the Government may have valid reasons for doing this but they would have benefited if they had held discussions first.  This country seems to be the only one in Europe adopting such a policy.  Surely, if we are a member of the European Economic Community, understand the implications of this and know what is happening in the EEC and in areas outside, where they <Col N="1177" /> are piping the gas down to the Mediterranean and into Africa, we would be wise to study this development. There is a European fund which would have been of great assistance to us in this respect.  If that fund, which would alleviate the high cost which will be involved in this development, is available, then the Government should approach the Community to get our share of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably come back to the House again to report on other finds.  It may be necessary to introduce legislation which would enable the new board to lay pipelines across the country.  In this connection, it is important that discussions be held with the farming community. With all due respect to the ESB, when rural electrification was a novelty and much sought after, many of the farmers were very foolish in the way in which they allowed the ESB plough up their fields, put up unsightly grids and lay their wires with total disregard for the person who owned the land.  That may have been necessary. then for economic reasons but with the advent of modern machinery the ESB would need to have a look at some of their installations in the countryside.  Indeed, some farmers have been killed through touching overhead wires with machinery.  In particular, the Minister should ensure that, if there is a national gas grid laid throughout the country, the farming community, who are very reasonable, should be consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKilbride" hpid="Mr. Kilbride Mr. Kilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long in discussing this Bill which should be welcomed not alone by Members of the Dáil and Seanad but by all forward-looking people in relation to our industrial advancement.  The Minister is to be commended for setting up this board so that the process for the exploration of natural gas will be an ongoing exercise.  This factor will justify the heavy expenditure involved in the early stages of this or any other innovation of technical advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The find of natural gas off the Cork coast is such a welcome event that <Col N="1178" /> the people may regard it as the forerunner of other finds in the Celtic Sea.  This find may be very small in comparison with the immense area of gas likely to exist there or in adjacent areas.  The cost of exploration at this stage has been relatively high but further exploration and new finds will justify this expenditure.  It will justify the effort being made by the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to what the ESB will get out of this gas find, it is only fair to say that the equation of that cost or loss, although I would not regard it as such, should be on the basis of the price we pay to import oil for the ESB to generate an equivalent amount of electricity.  It would be entirely justifiable on this basis.  It is easy for those who argued against the ESB having this facility to say that this is a natural gas and should be utilised for consumers in Cork, Dublin and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>I admire the extent to which Senator Dolan was able to draw on his imagination when he said that a line should run from one end of Ireland to the other, right into Northern Ireland.  We have been told that the amount of gas that is available at this stage is to some extent not as much as would lead one to believe in an unending amount of energy for the future.</P>
    <P>A wise and prudent application of the system will be necessary in the areas where gas is found in future.  We should have technicians to forecast locations.  This would enable us to explore with reasonable hope and expectation finds off the entire east coast. If you have gas off the Head of Kinsale you could reasonably assume that there will be gas finds along the coast from the extreme south-east to the north-east point of Antrim, parallel with the North Sea find.  We should be able to find gas, or have a reasonable chance of finding gas, in sufficient amounts to meet the needs of the nation.  Exploration should be an on-going exercise.  The Government, I am sure, will be planning on the basis of the outcome being satisfactory, and in proportion to the finds.  It would be <Col N="1179" /> wrong to say that the cost might be prohibitive to utilise gas for other purposes, such as in the case of NET or our other industrial projects.  It would be wrong if we were to shut our eyes to the fact that it is a natural means of producing employment.  The people who will find employment as a result of a gas find will be our own people. It will be a means of putting money into the pockets of the workers, money that would normally be going to the Arabs, Dutch and Italians for the gas that we are at present importing.  Our economy will benefit to the tune of £75 million a year on the basis of what we now see and what we now know exists.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful&mdash;and I am sure every right-minded person is hopeful&mdash;that we will be able to counter our adverse trade balance by not only £75 million a year but by hundreds of millions of pounds over the next four or five years.  It would be the greatest satisfaction we could have if we were able to say that we had discovered sufficient quantities of oil and gas.  This would make us as confident in the outlook for our economy as the British are in relation to the North Sea finds.  We are likely to have a rosy future from discoveries of gas and oil. I should like to compliment the Minister on the setting up of this board and on all the exercises that his Department are engaging in for the purpose of improving our industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to change the emphasis a little from what has gone before.  In fact, the debate in an almost monomaniac way has concentrated on the point raised initially by the Minister in his speech and then by Senator Lenihan, that is, the question of the allocation of 60 per cent of the gas to the ESB for the generation of power and the rightness and wrongness of that decision.  That has been very skilfully debated.  It would be churlish not to refer at all to it.  It seemed to me that Senator Lenihan's case and the case made by his colleagues was a very strong case and extremely well documented.  On the other hand, it was difficult not to take <Col N="1180" /> the weight of the Minister's own argument.  For instance, he said:</P>
      <P>I would emphasise that the use of gas by the ESB will reduce the board's dependence on imported oil and thus safeguard the consumer against the worst effects of any future interruptions of international oil movements.  This is, of course, an important element in our present energy strategy.  In the light of all these considerations I firmly stand over the Government's decision to allocate portion of the Kinsale Head gas find to the ESB.</P>
      <P>It was argued on the Fianna Fáil side of the House that because the decision was made two years ago it was a hasty measure, almost a panic measure in the light of the fact that the whole distribution of oil throughout the world had changed with the Arabs upping the price of oil, and that because it was taken at that time it is a suspect decision, a decision which now, in the calmness of 1976, is one that should be reconsidered if not extinguished.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is possible to argue that in the apparent calm of 1976 we have allowed ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security in the whole matter.  There is no reason on earth for the Arabs or some other source of power not to upset the applecart again.  The arguments on both sides are powerful.  The arguments put forward by Senator Lenihan were largely technical.  The arguments put forward by the Minister were in a sense strategic.  I suppose all one can do is to ask the Minister to look with even greater intensity at the question before finally committing it.  It is not committed to legislation at all.  It does not arise out of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by Senator Dolan's point because&mdash;and perhaps this is a reason for praising the modesty and limitation of the Bill, the recognition in the Bill that it may be replaced by another Bill&mdash;the uncertainty that exists with regard to power on our planet at the moment is enormous.  The discovery and the development of power, I would argue, is only in its infancy at the moment.  Senator Dolan <Col N="1181" /> is perfectly right to raise the point that inland oil strikes are a possibility.  We do not know what are possibilities. Senator Quinlan very properly referred to solar power.  It is not a viable proposition now but in ten years, with the galloping technology of our time, it is very possible that these things may come to pass.  The Bill has the necessary flexibility to deal with that and it has a provisional quality about it that makes it a limited Bill and one that can easily yield to a far more comprehensive Bill and perhaps ultimately to a comprehensive policy on energy for the entire country.</P>
    <P>The two limited points that I want to make, which are not related to that issue, are in relation to the environment. I note that subsection (9) of section 8 deals with this issue.  I do not want to delay too long on this but it strikes me that the provision for the environment is inadequate.  To summarise, rather than laboriously to read the section, this provision instructs the board to take all reasonable measures to protect the natural environment and to avoid injuring the amenities of the area, and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing and so on.</P>
    <P>It talks about flora, fauna, wildlife, and the geological and the archaeological riches that might possibly be destroyed if this reasonable care is not taken.  It then goes to to say that in thinking on this subject they should consult such bodies as the harbour authority, the Electricity Supply Board and Córas Iompair Éireann, and a gas undertaker is named too.</P>
    <P>Surely this is a very important aspect of the Bill.  If you talk about flora and fauna and so forth, that is within the ambit of the Department of Lands, so should it not be mandatory on the board to consult with the Department of Lands?  With regard to archaeological riches and historical buildings, should they not have to consult with the Board of Works?</P>
    <P>With regard specifically to archaeological finds and possibilities, should they not have to consult with the <Col N="1182" /> National Museum?  If ever there was a good example for the case I have been trying to make here for a long time, that is, the establishment of a Department for the Environment, surely it arises directly out of that.  It seems to me that the provision is there.</P>
    <P>There is not an over-arching body that takes care of the environment, the environment being interpreted in cultural as well as natural and tourist terms.  For instance, recently we have had a most unhappy and bitter quarrel about the chemical plant that was to have been set up in Waterford, where a very great industrial resource was lost to us because of the activity of a very limited and non-statutory interest who took on the defence and championship of the environment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that difficulty would have arisen if there were some Ministry or Department for the environment who would look into every aspect of a matter like this and report.  Such a Department would be able to deal with the situation of ill-will that arises when non-statutory or voluntary or sort of crank-like bodies sometimes come into conflict with the Government.  Such bodies can exert all kinds of almost indecent pressure from time to time, very often because of the irresponsibility of the media in the matter.  If we had a good Department of the Environment that kind of unseemly confrontation would not arise.  My specific consideration in regard to that section is that more people than those who are decided on here should be consulted. It does not seem to me to be quite enough just to hope that the board will take reasonable measures. I put that very strongly to the Minister for his sympathetic consideration and, indeed, I hope to embody it in an amendment.</P>
    <P>The only other point is a kind of local point and relates to the First Schedule, to the setting up of the gas board itself.  I am a bit dense with regard to the reading of strictly legal and technical documents.  I cannot quite glean from the internal evidence of this document why the board have to have another name called &ldquo;the <Col N="1183" /> company&rdquo;.  I am not asking for an explanation of that.  I am sure there is a very good reason for it.  Suddenly the board becomes a company occasionally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The company are an interim company.  The board will take over from that when the Bill is passed. It is not as mysterious as the Senator thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as copiously explained as that on the first page. Thank you very much for that.  A lot of effort has gone into ensuring that this board will be properly set up and will be protected against any kind of abuse to which a board with such responsibility might be subjected.  Section 2 provides that the board shall have six members, and then in section 15 it says that a quorum for a meeting of the board shall be three or other such number not being less than three as may be determined from time to time by the board.  It seems to me that three is too small a number there.  I think it should be four.  Any gathering involving three will be regarded rightly or wrongly not as a meeting, but as a conspiracy.</P>
      <P>The other point which seems to me important is that it is laid down that the Minister shall fix the date, time and place of the first meeting of the board.  Thereafter, it is up to the board to fix their own meetings.  I am thinking of a combination of these two issues&mdash;a quorum of three and no statutory obligation on the board to give notice of a meeting.  It seems to me that that itself even smacks a little more of a conspiracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It says in section 17 that every question at a meeting of the board shall be determined by a majority of votes of the members present and in the event that voting is equally divided the chairman shall have a casting vote. This means that three people being present to form a quorum, a vote of two to one could carry a decision.  I might summarise the points arising out of this.  It seems to me that once the Minister has set up the first meeting thereafter it is free to a quorum of <Col N="1184" /> three to decide what kind of notice would go to members for the next meeting and when that next meeting took place if only three people turned up, a majority of two to one could carry a decision.  Putting a sinister complexion on this&mdash;I am interpreting it in the worst possible way&mdash;it seems to me that there should be a proper provision that a quorum for a meeting be four, that there be provision in the Bill saying what is the proper notice for a meeting.  If these two provisions were there or at least, if it were provided that the limit should be four, justice would be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>I am not casting aspersions on the people that the Minister would appoint. I am sure that they would all be admirable people but if a man was very determined and very sinister in these circumstances, surely he could manipulate a meeting where the mere quorum of three would be present and where a two to one vote could carry an important decision.  It is purely a matter of practice I am concerned with.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill is overdue.  There is all the temptation in a situation like this to rush judgment. There is also a temptation to hesitate too long.  It seems to me that the Minister has struck a reasonable balance between these two considerations.  With the few reservations I have about it I would like in those terms to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the unanimously favourable reception given to this Bill.  Every speaker, from Senator Lenihan to Senator Martin who has just concluded, welcomed the Bill coming to the House.  Senator Dolan and Senator Lenihan did have reservations about the allocation of portion of the existing natural gas finds to the ESB.  That has nothing to do with the Bill, as they admitted, because a Government decision was taken outside the confines of this Bill. I am very pleased that this Bill, which is dealing with a new form of energy of which we have no experience in this country, should have got the unanimous support of the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> A number of pertinent and interesting points were made on the Bill and I shall endeavour to refer to them. Senator Lenihan, as I said, while welcoming the Bill, said he regretted the Government decision to allocate 60 per cent of the finds of natural gas to the ESB for generation of electricity. I think subsequent speakers answered very adequately the Senator in this regard, particularly Senator Harte and, of course, Senator Martin.  You could engage experts from all over the world; you could write tomes about the various options open to anybody in the use of gas, from a commercial point of view, from a strategic point of view or any other.  However, it boils down to the fact that the buck stops here and the Government, on my advice, have got to make decisions. We cannot engage in academic debate on the desirability of adopting option A over option B or option C over option D.  We have to do things.  We have a find of natural gas in this country&mdash;the first one we have ever had.  It is small in relation to our total energy needs and in relation to finds of natural gas all over the world it is very small.  We have to decide what to do with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan inferred that the decision was made in a hasty manner two years ago in the aftermath of the oil crisis and for that reason perhaps the best decision was not taken and it should be reversed.  Senator Martin also said that.  But even if that were so, has anything changed so much in the last two years that this decision should be changed?  Is there any more guarantee now about the price, the availability of oil supplies from the primary source of production in the world, the Middle East?  Have the producers in that area found out their own strength?  Are they more conscious of the effect they can and have had on the economies of the world by shutting off the oil taps so important for the industrial and commercial life of the whole of the western world?  In those circumstances what Government would not grasp the opportunity to lower our dependence on that source of energy, and to try and ensure the amount of oil we would have <Col N="1186" /> to use in the future was lessened by even this amount.  I think strategically it was the right thing to do.  I think for other reasons it was also the correct thing to do.</P>
    <P>Commercially, this is a relatively small field.  Senator Lenihan stole one of my best lines when he said previous Governments had made mistakes in this regard.  He having said it, I cannot repeat it.  Having invested over a number of years in the exploration for gas and oil off the south coast, these people were naturally concerned to get their money back in a reasonable time.  This is what business is about and these are business people. We cannot expect them to be motivated by the same concern for the Irish people as we are.  We have to build fences and write rules and introduce legislation that will control what is our natural resource.  At the same time we must require what many feel: that we have not the capital to do it ourselves in many, perhaps all, areas, and that we have not the technology or the expertise available to do it ourselves.  Therefore the involvement of huge, very powerful State companies has been and is accepted by everybody in this country as being the correct partnership in the development of our natural resources in this regard.</P>
    <P>When these people announced the discovery of their field&mdash;and one of the conditions of the discovery was that it should be landed&mdash;they then had to approach the Government to do a deal on price and rate of take-off and on usage of the gas.  On the other side, because the Government want to get the benefits of that energy into the economy as quickly as possible, they want to get it at the lowest price.  But the Government did not want to be inobligate in the use of natural gas.</P>
    <P>We have the choice of engaging in the hothouse exercise of mining consultants to engage in studies, to present reports for decisions to be taken by the Government on how to make the best use of natural gas in this quantity&mdash;grid, if possible; major users of large quantities essential; location, a consideration.  We are <Col N="1187" /> talking about a grid, and the rate at which you take the gas off a field is a determining factor on the price.  You take it off at twice the rate we are taking off in this field then the price will be lower because the people who invested the money for the exploration will get their money back.  Should we take it off at half the rate the price will be higher, but you have your &ldquo;afters&rdquo; for longer for the use of future people.  The price will be higher because the people who invested the money will not get their money back for a longer period.  These are ordinary commercial equations which broadly can be done on the back of an envelope but the fine print of which takes a long time.</P>
    <P>The Government had a look at the location, the NET plans for expansion and the ESB generating stations.  The Government decided that it should be broken down, as it has been, between a fertiliser plant and the ESB.  You must remember we were also conscious at that time of the effect the oil crisis had on the price of fertilisers in this country and the slackening off and dropping in demand for fertilisers by farmers with, as Senator Butler and Senator Kilbride said, the consequential lowering of production by the farming community.  So we were able to make ourselves self-sufficient in fertilisers&mdash;no imported fertilisers with a balance for export.  We were able, by giving it to the ESB, to reduce our dependence on imported oil.  Giving the use of the gas to the generating industry, together with the use of turf or peat for the generation of more electricity, we were putting ourselves a good way on the road to self-sufficiency in one form of energy.</P>
    <P>The building of a national grid to cater for this find would have set us back in the use of this gas, because the fertiliser factory at Marina Point is almost ready and the ESB generating plant at Whitegate will be ready by March, 1978.  Senator Harte asked how real was the date March, 1978, for the taking of this gas and I should like to state that the contract with Marathon is from March, 1979.  Therefore, it is only if <Col N="1188" /> we fail to take the gas after that date, or if they fail to deliver it after that date that there is a contractual penalty imposed on either party.</P>
    <P>Early last year I contacted Marathon and asked them to bring forward, if possible, their date of delivery and said we would be ready to take it in March, 1978.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for NET, backed up my request.  We pushed to see that Bord Gáis Éireann was set up.  That is the company Senator Martin had some trouble about, and which was established after the gas was found but before the statutory instrument to establish it was put through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  They were at the same time working on a gas route and had negotiations with the farmers Senator Dolan spoke about.  I can assure Senator Dolan that I am as anxious as he is that the relationship between the farming community and Bord Gáis Éireann should be as amicable as possible.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to deal with the national gas board but, hopefully, in years to come this company will assume an importance in the economy and the effectiveness in the economy as the Electricity Supply Board or Bord na Móna do.  I am as anxious as Senator Dolan to ensure that they have proper relationships with the IFA, the ICMSA or any other body, or individual farmers with whom they deal.</P>
    <P>We must provide in the Bill that, if in any one instance one farmer in any part of Ireland should at some future time, after all reasonable negotiations, hold up the laying of a pipeline that is for the benefit of people beyond his bit of land, the State should have the power compulsorily to acquire it.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan quoted the instance of pipelines being laid from Holland to Rome and Paris and transporting natural gas.  Holland generates 80 to 90 per cent of its electricity from natural gas and the British Government are at present considering putting a natural gas generating plant in Scotland.  Every country in Europe uses natural gas to generate electricity.  The EEC directive Senator Lenihan referred to <Col N="1189" /> is very carefully worded to ensure that it would not interfere with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that no country in the EEC has commissioned a plant for the consumption of natural gas for power purposes in the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the United Kingdom have.  I am pretty certain that is so.  The directive referred to by Senator Lenihan says:</P>
      <P>Authorisation for contracts providing for the possibility of interruptable deliveries may be granted.</P>
      <P>That is what this Government have done.  It is an interruptable contract with the ESB.  Therefore, we are within this directive if the use of the natural gas in a power station proves necessary for technical reasons or if the natural gas can be put to more profitable use.  Under those conditions we are within the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, the Minister is within the directive and I said that.  The Minister will agree that the overall purpose of the directive is to curtail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>To discourage, not curtail.  Senator Harte said we do not live in a perfect world.  We might read the correct decision on a blackboard but in real life a Government have to take different decisions taking the facts as they are at the time into account.  To lay a pipeline to Paris, which has a population of two-and-a-half times that of this country and concentrated within a radius of 25 square miles, is a different commercial proposition altogether than to lay a pipeline all over this country. The pipeline from Strand to Cork city will cost in the region of £15 million.  The distance between Cork and Dublin is five or five-and-a-half times that distance.  Therefore, the minimum cost of the pipeline will be £80 million.  In Dublin, if the Dublin Gas Company be the prime user, they have only 10 per cent and they must engage in capital investment to either (a) convert the gas to town gas as it is called or (b) convert the cookers, or whatever, for the end function of <Col N="1190" /> the gas.  There is a capital cost in the pipe and in the Dublin area.  On top of that, even if it is doubled, it would double over a number of years.  The rate the use of natural gas grew in England was something like 11 per cent per annum.  It will take, therefore, six to seven years to double. That will interfere with the contract with Marathon and will shove forward the take-off date, meaning higher prices.</P>
      <P>For those reasons, the Government were right to find immediately users for this gas, and to set up a board whose function it would be to engage in a detailed study as to what the best use of future finds would be.  If we had had a study to deal with the existing find it should have commenced in 1971, assuming a study takes about two years.  It was not commenced because we had no natural gas.  Although exploration was going on off the south coast, none of us really believed there was anything there.  It was only when we made a find that we could engage in any real studies, discussions or debate on its use.  I am glad that debate is going on now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a conference on natural gas held here about three months ago both sides of this case were put forward. The chairman of the ESB who read a paper is technically very well qualified to argue this case.  As well as being chairman of the board he is also very highly qualified academically. He argued about whether the Government were justified in building a second energy grid here when the ESB grid is there already.  He said that not alone were the Government correct to give this find of natural gas to the ESB but he felt they should give future finds of natural gas to the ESB.  There is a loss in any fuel that is converted to electricity whether it be oil, turf or natural gas, but there is also a loss in the use of the fuel at the end purpose.  Electricity is, in that part, far more efficient than gas because there is less loss at the point at which it is used, not the point at which it is generated.  He argued that we have a distribution system for energy here.  It is the ESB electricity <Col N="1191" /> grid which is established and goes to all parts of the country.  It would be a waste of capital resources to build a second grid to distribute natural gas.</P>
    <P>Another paper read at that conference put exactly the same point of view as the one put here by Senator Lenihan and Senator Dolan.  I subsequently made a speech outside that conference in which I said I was very glad to see this debate going on.  I hoped many more people would engage in the debate, but eventually I would make the decisions.  In the Dáil I was presented with amendments which would have effectively removed from the Government, or the Minister for Transport and Power, the freedom to make those decisions.  I resisted those amendments. A Government must make decisions of that nature.  The instrument in this case to see the decisions are implemented is Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan also said it relieved the ESB of a financial obligation.  I do not think that is correct.  It may, in fact, have imposed some financial obligations on them&mdash;not severe&mdash;because it meant they brought forward the building of a power station although they might not want it so soon.  The Senator said £25 million was not enough for all that is envisaged for the Gas Board.  I agree it is not enough for all that is envisaged, but it is sufficient to deal with the Kinsale Head find.  It is sufficient to provide the board with money to engage in studies about a national grid or about any other possible use of natural gas.  It is right that Bord Gáis should come to me and I should come back to this House and justify any further money I give them. If Bord Gáis say they will give all the gas found in future to the ESB, then I should come back to the Dáil and Seanad and justify that decision.  If you gave the Gas Board £100 million, as was suggested in the Dáil, no Minister for Transport and Power would be back here for the next ten years to justify anything done by An Bord Gáis. This £25 million will enable them to complete the job now on hand.  If there are further finds the Minister for Transport and Power of the day will <Col N="1192" /> have to come to the Dáil and Seanad to amend this Bill to increase that £25 million to £50 million or £100 million and justify the uses for which that money will be put to develop gas in the future.</P>
    <P>The argument Senator Butler made regarding investing money in a grid when we did not know its future is unanswerable.  We do not know what gas will be there in the future.  We know what is there now and to invest huge sums of money in a gas grid&mdash; perhaps it will be the only gas grid&mdash; would be unjustified at the moment.</P>

      <P>The money for research and development comes under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am not just palming that off.  That is where the allocation is made.  We are taking part in all the research and development functions engaged in in Europe.  The matter of the generation of electricity from other sources within the technical competence of the ESB has been done by them.  I frequently use their advisers in this regard.  The research <Col N="1193" /> regarding nuclear energy is done by the Nuclear Energy Board.</P>
      <P>What Senator Quinlan said about the future is quite right.  You cannot write down in capital letters &ldquo;This is Ireland's Energy Policy&rdquo; and put it on a shelf and leave it there forever. There are too many question marks over the whole future of energy.  We must have a&mdash;that awful word&mdash; pragmatic approach to it.  We must deal with what we have now in the most suitable way possible for the economy.  There is solar energy, fusion and wave energy.  There has been research into this whole area for the past three years.  We have to be thankful to the Middle East countries who raised the price of the oil in that money was not allocated for research of this nature prior to that because of the cheap fuel available from the Middle East.  It now warrants research and hopefully the development of further and other forms of energy in the future.</P>
      <P>Natural gas is short term in the life of a country.  We are talking about a term of 20 years for the existing find.  Experts all over the world would hold that the use of any fossil fuel of this nature as energy is wrong because it is of a limited nature.  It will be gone, perhaps, in the first ten years of the coming century.  If the world has not, at that stage, developed another form of energy to replace it &mdash;fusion, solar or some other form&mdash; then the world will be in trouble.  The date for the development of fusion energy seems to be like a ping-pong ball on a slope.  Any time you grab it, it moves ten years ahead of you again.  I hope it will come.  I suppose the fellow drinking the pint in the pub is totally oblivious to it.  Perhaps I am not as conscious of it as I might be.  Scientists all over the world are very worried about the future energy sources of the whole world.  In the first half of the next century if some breakthrough is not made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not in the quantity now required.  Senator Quinlan also referred to the new board being independent. <Col N="1194" /> I think he was referring to the study being conducted by the new board.  I assure him the board, as set up under this Bill, will be independent of the Minister.  They will be the same as a board of any semi-State company.  They will not engage in this study themselves but will hire consultants and people who are knowledgeable in the field to ensure that the best input possible is got for the study of the future use of natural gas.</P>
      <P>Senator Harte made many pertinent points in his contribution which I thought was extremely good.  He said the experience gained by An Bord Gáis in negotiating the contract with Marathon, in laying the pipe, and in dealing with what will be their first customers&mdash;the ESB, NET and the Cork Gas Company&mdash;will strengthen their ability to negotiate in further finds and further deals.  I agree completely with that.  He said there was no technology here to deal with oil and gas, although he understood there were highly qualified engineers, technologists and scientists working with oil companies abroad.</P>
      <P>It is fairly natural that people who wanted to live here and who took third level education in any field would turn towards agriculture because that is our industry.  Up to now oil and gas were not industries associated with Ireland.  Therefore, young men who wanted to live in Ireland and wanted to develop a technology would develop it in a field that existed in Ireland.  Those who wanted to study oil and gas would have to go abroad.  Hopefully these people who are abroad working for other companies, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce advances with his legislation, and when this Bill becomes law, would come back and work for us.  As Senator Harte says, we could use these to oversee the operations of the oil companies, and we wonder if the risks were quite as great as the oil companies said they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the find of gas off Kinsale Head there were about 21 drillings and it was either the 21st or 22nd which produced the gas.  On average, <Col N="1195" /> throughout the world there are about 15 holes bored before there is one find of gas.  Considering that and depending on the depth to which the drilling is done in the water it could be as high as £2 million for each drilling, so the risks are pretty considerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with Senator Harte's suggestion that there be a scientist on every boat to give us national information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear Senator Harte saying that, but I would want to think about it.  Of course it would not be our boats that they would be on.  The Senator also said it was a very good deal, but he wondered why the man in the street would be questioning this even though he would be willing to take the Minister's word for this.  It is ordinary commercial prudence not to tell people who would make further finds of gas the price you are paying for the existing one, because that becomes the base on which you would then negotiate.  It may not be possible to keep this quiet forever, but it is just ordinary commercial prudence not to tell the next person what you are paying at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Senator also thought there was a contradiction between the terms used in the Bill about gas being offered at a reasonable price and the next subsection which says that, in the event of the parties not being able to agree with that they would go to arbitration.  A reasonable price is a matter of opinion. When Senator Butler thinks one price is reasonable and Senator Higgins thinks it is unreasonable, then we call in Senator Harte to decide which is correct.  That is a fairly reasonable approach to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the point which Senator Dolan made about agriculture.  Senator Kilbride said that because there was gas off Kinsale Head it was reasonable to assume that gas existed off all our coasts and perhaps inland.  Perhaps it is and perhaps it is not.  We would hope this is so from the number of companies of international repute and quite long pockets who have shown an interest in exploring for oil and gas on <Col N="1196" /> our Continental Shelf, but you cannot be sure until it actually comes up out of the ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Martin said this was a limited Bill, but I am not quite sure what he meant by this.  My view of this Bill is that this is a Bill for all time to deal with all finds of natural gas.  It may have to be adjusted and amended in the future, but it will deal for all time, I hope, with natural gas.  It is certainly not intended that it should become void when the present find of natural gas has run out.  This is a Bill to deal with any natural gas in the future and it is not just to deal with the Kinsale Head find.  If that is what he meant, I do not agree that it is limited.</P>

      <P>I meant it in the larger sense that concern has been expressed that we did not have an over-arching kind of energy Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In that sense the Senator is correct, in that it is dealing only with natural gas.  The Senator also said that in listing the people who should be consulted, the Department of Lands should be included because they were the people who were responsible for the environment. If he looks at the definition section of the Bill, section 2, he will see the commission referred to in section 28 is the Irish Land Commission which, of course, is under the Department of Lands.</P>

      <P>But it does not dispose of the other two points, that is in relation to the Board of Works and the National Museum.</P>

      <P>This came up during the ordinary inter-departmental conference and I have agreed informally by letter with the Ministers involved in the Board of Works and the museum that they would be consulted before Bord Gáis do anything in this regard.</P>

      <P>Why, if the Minister is willing to make that concession did he not call it the Resources Bill, 1976?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I called it the Gas Bill, 1976 because it is dealing with natural gas, and the point which Senator Martin was raising had nothing to do with the resources as such but it was about the damage Bord Gáis might do in laying pipes and the people with whom they should consult before laying the pipes to ensure that that damage would be minimal or non-existent.  It had nothing to do with resources.  I think the point which the Senator raised about the voting of the board is technically correct but it really does not arise because where three is a quorum then two could make a decision.  As I will be appointing and have the power of removing the board, I would very quickly appoint another board and have that decision reversed if I <Col N="1198" /> thought it was not in the national interest.  I think any other Minister would reserve that power for himself and if he thought that the chairman, who would be the one to call the board and another member operated like that to get decisions in their own favour, he would very quickly sack (a) the people who did not turn up and (b) the people who did to allow this decision to go through.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for their approval of this Bill and their acceptance of it.  I hope I have answered adequately the points they have raised during the debate which I found extremely interesting and thought-provoking.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage ordered for Tuesday, 13th July, 1976.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.05 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13th July, 1976.</P>
