      <P>I might inform the Seanad that despite the fact that this motion is only appearing for the first time on the Order Paper today I propose to allow it to be taken today on the grounds that the matter was discussed among all groups in the Seanad before being placed on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders and unless the Seanad shall otherwise resolve, the following provisions shall apply in respect of each week in which the Seanad sits:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the first day of sitting the Seanad shall meet at 2.30 p.m.; and</P>
      <P>(b)  on the second and any subsequent day of sitting the Seanad shall meet at 10.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the hours of sitting of the Seanad has been considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is agreed that in future the customary hour of adjournment shall be 8.30 p.m. on days when at present the Seanad adjourns at 10.00 p.m.  In order that this change will not reduce the time available for the discharge of business it is proposed in this <Col N="1170" /> motion that unless the Seanad otherwise resolves the Seanad shall meet at 2.30 p.m. on the first sitting day of any week and at 10.30 a.m. on the second and any subsequent sitting day.  Where a matter is to be discussed on the Adjournment the present arrangement whereby the discussion commences 30 minutes before the adjournment time will continue. It is also proposed to continue the present practice of suspending the sitting for lunch on days when the House meets at 10.30 a.m.  The evening suspension will, however, be discontinued unless, exceptionally, the state of business allows it.  Since the adjournment time and suspension of sittings are treated as a matter of custom it is not necessary to provide for them in this motion.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems an appropriate point at which to suggest that we might hasten the dispatch of a Bill which is very daunting for us to face in view of its detail and having regard to its nature.  It is a new tax but it is in part a codification of an existing tax transferred to the entity of the company, the corporate entity. In part it contains, I think, amendments to the fundamental income tax code where applied to the company. In common with anyone else who is going to try to make a contribution here today I have tried to grasp the principle of the Bill and I have tried to go through it but we have not been helped by the fact that we have not had all the printed copies of the proceedings of the select committee to read but I would like to thank the Minister for his offer, which I took up, of giving detailed illustrations of the different sections.  I understood him to say at the select committee's first meeting that the tax load will be similar and that there may be a small &mdash;I think about 1 per cent&mdash;addition. Would not all Members of the <Col N="1171" /> Seanad be particularly helped in our consideration of the sections if we knew from where this 1 per cent additional is coming?  That is probably a net percentage because there are, as appears in various parts of the Bill, reliefs and they are very welcome. Perhaps these reliefs have been taken into account as an offset in discovering the 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>That may mean, of course, that the 1 per cent is much more than the 1 per cent gross if account has been taken of the benefit to companies, for example, of relief.  I take it 1 per cent relates to the tax load on the corporation and not to the collection of tax from the special treatment of this new identity of the distribution.  I think that is not taken into account&mdash;that there will be a haul of tax under Schedule F or from the two combined. If the Minister did what I suggest it would be a help.  I do not ask the Minister to do this on this section; it might be too much to expect.</P>
      <P>On this particular section, it is proposed not to include certain entities. These are listed in subsection (5).  One particular kind of entity which might be included in the list are bodies enjoying body corporate status under the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Act, 1971.  I had a quick look at that particular Act and section 2 describes it as having the function wholly or mainly of deliberating with the health of persons, of health insurance of the use and treatment of the sick or the administration of the health services, of medical and dental research.  It did not seem to me that this would necessarily fall within the section dealing with charitable exemptions because of the use of the words in section 2 of that Act &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;, but I imagine that the Minister will confer body corporate status on any such company.  I know he has given it to a few.  This would promote Ireland as a centre for international research.  It would seem to me to be there would be the place to put the full exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company, as defined, includes all the special classes of companies as <Col N="1172" /> defined in Part III.  These are industrial provident societies, building societies and so on; they are listed in sections 28 to 52.  They are included because there is special treatment for them.  It also includes all the companies in Part IV which are the export companies. It also includes those in Part V which are Shannon companies.  In regard to both Part IV and Part V, the process connected with certain goods, process and trading within Shannon Airport, it seems absolutely relevant on this section to give advance notice that the House will be very concerned to see that in no way will the enactment of this measure adversely affect the investors in these companies or reduce their position, affect either the corporate entity or the distributions they received; otherwise we will be departing from what has been the practice since we entered the Common Market. As the Minister is well aware, it is not now merely a question of statute law but a matter of governmental obligation in the event of the export tax relief being withdrawn for any reason; likewise in the Shannon company.</P>
    <P>There is another type of company&mdash; and again I give advance notice of this &mdash;which should be close to the Minister's heart because he introduced in this House the special provision which can only be enjoyed by a company benefiting from the packaging of exemptions here.  I mention these points in anticipation that the sections will be looked at in advance by the Minister's advisers, to see whether for example, the relief from corporation tax which is provided in relation to these companies is sufficient where, for example, there is provision for a third charge on certain companies.  For example in the case of an inventor, who must form a company which, according to the Minister's own dispensation, is a service company within the definition, if a 20 per cent surcharge is imposed where is the exemption from that surcharge granted to that particular company? There will be much more to be said in connection with section 162: one does not have to say it now.</P>
    <P>Another point on this matter&mdash;is it the case with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board that only certain income <Col N="1173" /> is exempt, the income received from health insurance?  Is this a pure codification so as to maintain precisely the position of the Voluntary Health Board?  Would it not be a good thing in this case to make it an exemption and to list it &ldquo;but does not include the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.&rdquo;  If I may remind the Minister, on a previous Finance Bill I mentioned this question of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and some explanation was given.  I would now argue with the Minister that if local authorities, health boards, vocational education boards, committees of agriculture, and as I suggest, bodies incorporated under the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Act, 1971, are to be excluded, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board should be moved from the section where it is given special treatment, section 80, and be made exempt for all their income.  If they manage to invest some money, buy a stallion, for instance and do something wonderful with their money, who will benefit only the insurer because all the money the Voluntary Health Board make from any of their activities must come to the relief of the payers of voluntary health insurance?  I suggest that point to the Minister.</P>
    <P>One is referred by section 1, by implication and inevitably to section 155, where there are most of the definitions. I do not know why they are not all put in section 1 rather than two-thirds of the way through.  I understand that the meaning of subsection (3), as seems clear from the illustrations the Minister has provided, is that chargeable gains tax is chargeable at the same rate by a very ingenious device as under the capital gains tax.  Is it premature to ask do they enjoy the same exemptions as they would have enjoyed previous to the existence of the capital gains tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald has covered quite a wide field under section 1.  It shows what a comprehensive section it is.  I would like to assure the House that I will do my best to act as guide as we move through the Bill and not mislead anybody, because it is a very comprehensive piece of legislation. <Col N="1174" /> Quite an amount of it, as Senator FitzGerald said, consists of adapting existing law in such a way as to make it apply for corporation tax purposes. As few changes as possible have been made in the law as it stands at present. The changes which are being made have already been indicated in the two White Papers published and in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>As far as the revenue is concerned, it is not possible to say precisely what will be the effect, whether there would be a plus or minus.  On the face of it, it would appear that the revenue would gain marginally because the rate of tax will rise from 49.5 per cent to 50 per cent, but this change takes place not with a view to increasing the revenue but as a necessary consequence of applying the tidier and more modern package of one company tax rather than maintaining the old system of income tax and corporation profits tax.  Against that there are quite a number of heads where revenue will be lost by reason of a number of adjustments which are being made.  For instance, there is more favourable treatment of small companies; we are raising the threshholds below which profits will be subject to corporation tax at a rate less than 50 per cent.  We are also giving group relief under which losses sustained by companies in a group of companies can be set against the profits made by other companies in the group.  By and large, the revenue impact will be neutral, but there will be significant reliefs for some companies and it is considered there are good business reasons for giving these reliefs.  Some of them have been in operation already on a non-statutory basis since we published the last White Paper.  On the other hand, we have deliberately moved to stop some tax avoidance practices in order to prevent a leakage of revenue.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald referred to the 1971 Health Act and the exemptions that are given to bodies set up under that Act.  I would refer him to section 11 (6) which says that any income tax exemptions which are enjoyed at the present time will continue to be enjoyed and will have the like effect for the purposes of corporation tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> The Voluntary Health Insurance Board are, as Senator FitzGerald said, dealt with in section 80 under which they will have the exemption which they at present enjoy.  It is not proposed to effect any change.  For instance, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board are not subject to tax in respect of their insurance activities, but they could be subject to tax in respect of their investments.  To bring them within the ambit of the exclusions mentioned in section 1 (5) would confer total exemption from corporation tax.</P>
    <P>There are a number of changes which I could understand Senators might like to urge should be made in taxation provisions.  Such issues would be more appropriate to the annual Finance Bill where matters of current policy change in relation to the general impact of taxation.  We have kept to the minimum the number of alterations which are being made in the tax code. There is a new suit designed, as it were; we have to put that on the whole corporate structure and made such adaptations as are necessary to fit out the new corporate taxation system, but otherwise we are not making changes.</P>
    <P>As to definitions, Senators will find that virtually every Part of this Bill has certain definition sections.  It was considered that it would be more helpful in an understanding of the Bill and more helpful to practitioners in applying the Act to have the definitions conveniently to hand for individual sections.  As that was done, it was also necessary to have a more omnibus definition section and that, as Senator FitzGerald said, is available in section 155.  It is very difficult to achieve total agreement on the proper way of handling definitions and as to the more appropriate location of definitions in Bills.  But people will find the general handling of them in this Bill has made them more conveniently available than has been the case in other Acts in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Harbour boards are dealt with in Part VII of the Bill, as, indeed, are railway companies and canal companies.  The question was raised in the other House whether they could possibly generate profits which would create liability.  We have to assume that liability remote as it may appear.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question on section 2?  The section says:</P>
      <P>Except as otherwise provided by this Act, corporation tax shall not be chargeable on dividends and other distributions of a company resident in the State ...</P>
      <P>What would be the position with regard to a non-resident company that would be paying dividends out of profits already subject to corporation tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Senator correctly, he is asking about non-resident companies making distributions. We are dealing only with distributions by resident companies and the Bill would not apply to distributions by non-resident companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, if a resident company had an investment in a non-resident company which derived profit from the branch or agency in Ireland which is subject to the corporation profit tax, it would pay corporation profits tax twice&mdash;first, because the company which declared the dividend paid it, and secondly, on its receipt of it.  I thought there was a general bar against double taxation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

The Minister might find it convenient to answer a question like that at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to answer now because Senators might like to be able to refer to it so that they could absorb the meaning of the sections before we arrive at them.  I refer the Seanad to section 38, page 43, section 41 (3) on page 44, and section 43 (2) on page 46.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions in relation to export tax relief have been left unaffected by this Bill.  We so say in the relevant section.  That is one of the areas where the reliefs under the existing law are applied to corporation tax.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am desirous to be educated on this section.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, where after the 5th day of April, 1976, a company resident in the State receives any payment on which it bears income tax by deduction, the income tax thereon shall be set off against any corporation tax assessable on the company by an assessment made for the accounting period in which that payment falls to be taken into account for corporation tax (or would fall to be taken into account but for any exemption from corporation tax); and according in respect <Col N="1178" /> of that payment the company, unless wholly exempt from corporation tax, shall not be entitled to a repayment of income tax before the assessment for that accounting period is finally determined and it appears that a repayment is due.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that if it gets at income from a dividend which is ripe for repayment, the repayment cannot be looked for until the corporation tax assessment has been made, if there is any question of repayment, in other words if the set-off is greater than the amount of corporation tax liability of the company receiving dividends?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing here with dividends at all.  We are dealing with payments such as rents and annuities.  Under the existing law of income tax, annual payments such as annuities and royalties are not allowed as deductions in computing income for income tax purposes but the company have the right to deduct and retain income tax on those payments. For the purpose of corporation tax, annual payments such as annuities and royalties made by a resident company will be allowed as charges on income under section 10 and will have to be paid under deduction of income tax which the company will be obliged to remit to the Revenue Commissioners under section 151.  Interest, whether annual or not, paid by resident companies for the purposes of a trade or a business of letting property will not be a charge on income but will continue to be allowable as a deduction in computing the income.  Annual interest and short bank interest will be allowed as a charge on income under section 10, subject to the same restrictions as apply under the existing law. Annual interest which is allowed as a deduction in computing income, and other annual interest whether allowable or not as a charge on income, will be payable under deduction of income tax and the tax so deducted will have to be remitted to the Revenue Commissioners under section 151.</P>

      <P>This is the section which sets out the general scheme of the corporation tax.  It provides for the taxes to apply to the profits, that is, income and chargeable gains, wherever arising.  The tax will be assessed on the company for each accounting period on the profits arising in that period.  The rate of corporation tax will be fixed for each financial year.  Where an accounting period does not coincide with the financial year, the profits will be apportioned between the respective years.  The tax will be payable in two equal instalments on dates broadly corresponding to the present dates of payment of corporation profits tax and income tax.</P>

For such a company the date of payment of the second instalment of the corporation tax for the first accounting period, where that accounting period is one of 12 months, will by virtue of clause (I) of subparagraph (i), be January 1st, 1977.  Clause (II of subparagraph (i) secures that, where the first accounting period within the charge to corporation tax is a period of less than 12 months, the interval between the end of that accounting period and the date on which the second instalment becomes payable will be the same if the first accounting period were a period of 12 months.</P>

This formula will ensure that the interval between the end of any accounting period subsequent to the first accounting period and the date of payment of the second instalment of the tax for the subsequent accounting period will be the same as the corresponding interval would have been for the first accounting period if the tax for that period had been assessed at the normal time and not at the time it <Col N="1184" /> would bring into play the second part of the proviso to paragraph (b) which deals with the payment of the second instalment in cases where the assessment for the first accounting period is not made at the normal time.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of interpretation of subsection (5) of section 155.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>It depends, I suppose, on the number of brass plates on the door.  If the person in question was carrying on the profession of a <Col N="1186" /> general agent for a number of principals then such presence would probably not be regarded as a branch or agency of a particular principal, but if a person was an exclusive agent of a principal then it certainly would give rise to stronger suspicions that an agency or branch existed here.

      <P>I will deal with the amendment first which is contained in subsection (5), the proviso to subsection (5).  Section 11 of the Bill applies income tax principles to the computation of income, and the whole section generally applies the income tax code, including the exemptions.  This, therefore, brings in sections 20 and 21 of the Finance Act, 1973.  The effect of the amendment which was moved in the Dáil Special Committee is to maintain the benefit of the existing exemptions which are granted in respect of covenanted payments for research, teaching of the natural sciences and the promotion of human rights and freedoms.  They will enjoy, under the corporation tax code, the benefits which they previously enjoyed in respect of the income tax code.  Such payments, of course, are not ordinary expenses in the course of trade.  That is why they have to be referred to <Col N="1190" /> separately in the Bill.  Income Tax Acts set out the ordinary deductible expenses and so on which would apply to ordinary business affairs or ordinary deductions in the course of trade or business.  As payments for charitable purposes are not payments which are made in the ordinary course of trade, they must be dealt with separately.</P>

This corresponds with the provisions of section 38 of the Finance Act, 1974.  There is a provision excluding <Col N="1191" /> from this restriction any interest which may be deducted in computing income under Case I, II or V of Schedule D, and any amount of interest which, though not deductible in computing income under Case I, II or V of Schedule D, is allowable for income tax purposes without restriction under section 496 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.

A parent company liable to an insurance company for 10 per cent, 12 per cent or 15 per cent, or whatever might be the negotiator of the loan and only through that company could the borrowing be made.  It obviously could not afford to lend it to its subsidiary.  It might be a subsidiary within the terms of the Bill.

      <P>A company is domiciled where it is incorporated. The remittance basis could not apply to a company incorporated here, but you could have a foreign corporation resident here.  For example, take the export tax relief.  That does not have to be done by an Irish company or any body corporate whether established to carry on business here, but it could be managed and controlled here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is only going to be taxed as heretofore on remittances it makes from foreign earnings as distinct from the turnover of the company which is entitled to the export tax relief.  This seems to say that it shall not have effect so as to apply.  If we look at section 76 of the Income Tax Act, would we know what we are talking about?  I am aware of some companies who have chosen for particular reasons not to incorporate themselves here.  Subsection (1) shall not apply to any person who satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that he is not domiciled in the State.  All he has to do is to produce a certificate of incorporation according to the law.  If he does that, subsection (1) would then not apply and he would not be taxed save on a remittance basis.  This could have a very adverse effect on companies which have established themselves here to do the business they are doing here.  For example, they might be companies entering into partnerships, joint ventures and so on, and they might not want to establish for their own tax reasons, for their own internal <Col N="1194" /> commercial reasons, an Irish corporation. They might have to work on the basis of a foreign company; they might have to finance it here; their arrangements might be that they want to remit to this country their foreign income.  Is that not something to be encouraged?  Is this not a change in the law of some importance which may not have been assessed because there is not sufficient information available?  I speak with knowledge of at least two companies which are carrying on substantial industrial ventures in this country, giving substantial employment, and are not incorporated in this country.  If they have foreign incomes, they will run like mad if their foreign incomes are to be subject to taxation here.</P>

It is a change in the law.  What is the justification for the change in the law?  Subsection (1) of section 76, is not applied to any person who satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that he is not domiciled in the State. The only company which is domiciled in the State is a company incorporated in the State.  There is no doubt about that.  It is an indisputable proposition of law.  Why therefore in the case of the company&mdash;and this only applies to corporations&mdash;should we change what is the law?  I suggest that you delete it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential element in taxation in relation to companies is not domicile but residence. The section to which Senator FitzGerald refers is dealing with domicile, but tax liability arises in relation to residence.  The effect of subsection (7) of section 11 is to prohibit the deduction of foreign charges in computing foreign income.  The charges are afterwards allowed as charges on income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the matter is of such importance that I shall have to read subsection (3) of section 76 of the Income Tax Act:</P>
      <P>...any person who satisfies the Revenue Commissioners that he is not domiciled in the State, or that, being a citizen of Ireland, he is not ordinarily resident in the State...</P>
      <P>A person, of course, is a company. A company will immediately satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that he is domiciled elsewhere if he produces a certificate of incorporation elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 76 says:</P>
      <P>In the cases mentioned in subsection (2)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the companies domiciled abroad</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the tax shall...be computed on the full amount of the actual sums received in the State from remittances payable in the State, or from property not imported, or from money or value arising from property not imported, or from money or value so received on credit or on account in respect of such remittances....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is varied by section 4 of the Finance Act, 1971, which captured these notional remittances.  If we are codifying income tax and making as few changes as we can, why take away the benefit which has been in existence since 1925 for bodies corporate in this country being so domiciled? This is serious.  It may be primarily designed for individuals. The reasons for its existence are many.  For example, in your codification of the export tax relief, the Shannon code, you are clearly not <Col N="1196" /> changing the requirement.  It has got to be a corporation and it could be not an Irish corporation.  For the vast majority of cases I am quite sure they are domiciled here and they like to look as Irish as they can.  If there be one body corporate in this country which is here because it can avoid paying tax on remittances not received here, let him stay here.  He would be paying solicitor's fees anyway. Why change the law without knowing why we are doing it?  I always try to make changes which are justified where tax avoidance is known about.  The Minister has told us that the Revenue Commissioners do not know of any such cases at all. Therefore it cannot be tax avoidance that is bothering him.</P>
    <P>It would be my duty to tell the Revenue Commissioners of any such cases.  I believe they exist.  I can verify that further as a general statement.  I know they were in contemplation in certain cases.  There was this privilege that if they had income from foreign possessions they did not remit it here and were not liable to tax on it.  If the Revenue Commissioners were not aware of the existence of such companies they cannot be worried about tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has time between now and Report Stage to consider this matter.  For reasons of convenience we have to get this through before the 5th April.  What date does it have to be enacted by?</P>

      <P>A company shall be chargeable to corporation tax on all its profits wherever arising</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There cannot be any serious dispute that the appropriate test for tax liability is residence, where business is being conducted.  The effect of acceding to Senator FitzGerald's suggestion <Col N="1197" /> would be to create a very convenient avoidance practice.  That would be against the spirit of the Bill.

      <P>It does.  The date on which a company begins, or ceases, to carry on a trade or begins or ceases to be within the charge to corporation tax in respect of it, is to be taken to be the date of commencement or cessation of the trade, as the case may be, even though the trade was previously, or may thereafter be, carried on by someone else.  Annual interest will not be prohibited by section 11, subsection (5) (b), as a deduction in computing trading income.

      <P>The income of an Irish resident company from a trade carried on wholly abroad, although chargeable under Case III of Schedule D, will be computed in accordance with the rules of Case I of Schedule D.  Foreign income tax will be allowable as a deduction from income from foreign securities and possessions.  It is also provided that foreign income, mainly rents, interest and dividends arising to a non-resident company from property attributable to a branch or agency through which the company trades here will be chargeable to corporation tax under Case III of Schedule D in the same way as a resident company will be charged on such foreign income.</P>

It provides that distributions made by a company <Col N="1207" /> are not to carry tax credits except to the extent that distributions are made out of profits charged to corporation tax or out of franked investment income. The section ensures that a tax credit will not be given in respect of a distribution made out of a surplus arising from mutual trading as such a surplus would not attract a liability to corporation tax.  However, other income of a company carrying on a mutual trade, for example, bank interest or investment income, will be liable to corporation tax and accordingly a tax credit will attach to distributions out of such income.</P>

The deduction to be made from the proceeds of the policy is not to exceed corporation tax at the full rate on the chargeable gain, reduced in accordance with section 13, subsection (1), on the disposals, or deemed disposals, of the investment.</P>

      <P>This is a new provision. The section brings into charge to corporation tax foreign interest and dividends arising to a non-resident bank, insurance company or other person carrying on a business of dealing in stock, shares or securities in the State through a branch or agency where the foreign securities are attributable to the branch or agency.  In the absence of such a provision income tax in the hands of non-residents under section 50 or section 462 of the Income Tax Act, 1967&mdash;exemption from income tax of certain dividends payable to non-residents&mdash;would be exempt from corporation tax because of section 11 which exempts from corporation tax anything which is exempt from income tax.  This section also provides for a restriction of expenses in computing profits or losses or management expenses, where interest on certain Government securities, for instance, is excluded in computing income or profits for corporation tax purposes and the expenses are attributable to those securities.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is that nobody will get less relief than they get at present and some, in fact, will get a little more. It is in ease of the taxpayer.  The section defines the &ldquo;relevant accounting period&rdquo; for the purposes of export sales and provides, in effect, that export sales relief cannot be granted to a company for an accounting period in respect of a trade unless the accounting period falls within the 15-year period running from the latest of three dates.  These three dates are October 1st, 1956, the date of commencement of the basis period for the first year of claim for income tax purposes, and if there was no such first year of claim, April 6th, 1975.</P>
      <P>The definition contained in the section is to take the place of the definition of &ldquo;basis period&rdquo; for export sales relief for income tax purposes contained in section 398 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 and the definition of &ldquo;accounting period&rdquo; for export sales relief for corporation profits tax purposes contained in section 28, subsection (2), of the Finance Act, 1960, both of which are being repealed by section 164 and the Third Schedule. The definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; in section 398 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is not reproduced, as the general definition of company in section 1 will apply for the purposes of export sales relief.  In the example I have taken the case of a company which commenced trading in January 1st, 1966.  Under corporation tax the company in question has six more years of relief.  If we had not this provision in the Bill it would have only four-and-three quarter more years of income tax relief and six more years of corporation profits tax.  So, in fact, it is a net benefit of one-and-a-quarter years of income tax.</P>

      <P>That does not apply obviously to any other type of export company such as, for example, Cow and Gate, who are established here and buy from co-operatives.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a specific provision.  They are regarded as bodies which are not themselves profit-making; they are simply channels for the more effective disposal of Irish exports.  At one time as the House is aware, there was an obligation to sell to those bodies, but under EEC rules state monopolies are not permitted.  However, it is considered desirable to maintain the incentive to operate through these channels so as to secure good marketing. That is why the particular provision <Col N="1215" /> is there.  Obviously, export sales relief can be given only once. Therefore it is given to the actual exporter, except in relation to the specific exemptions which have been provided by way of incentives for the Pigs and Bacon Commission and Bord Bainne.  It is presumed that if the ultimate disposer gets the relief it percolates back to the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a much different and wider field altogether. If the exemption is removed from co-operatives which do not sell to either of these two bodies but to a company like Cow and Gate, they will not then be entitled to the export tax relief?  Cow and Gate or some such firm will be entitled to it but not the contributing co-operative.</P>

The doubt is removed by the insertion in the opening part of subsection (1) of a condition that all or some of the manufacturing services must be rendered to persons not resident in the State.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to extend the export sales relief to profits and certain export sales of services. The relief may be claimed by a company which receives remuneration for the carrying out in the State any manufacturing process from materials belonging to a foreign concern where the materials have been imported into the State, provided that the finished products are exported out of the State while remaining in the ownership of the foreign concern?  There are cases &mdash;clothing, for example&mdash;where the material remains the property of a foreign company which sends the material into the country and it is then processed here and then reexported.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not relating this to the point in the Special Committee Report.  In regard to section 60, I appreciate that this is a repeat of the existing law in regard to relief in respect of engineering services.  My suggestions would probably be more appropriate to a future Finance Bill, but perhaps the Minister would consider it, that is, to widen the scope of this relief.  It is confined at present to engineering services.  I approve of that because it is in this type of professional service area that we can make a real contribution, both in terms of fulfilment of the professional individual or companies concerned and also a real, indirect export.  Our whole educational system is regared towards it and it is an area in which we are making good progress in many of the Third World countries in Africa and the Middle East.  While I respect the relief in engineering services I suggest that it be broadened to cover the whole range of professional services, in which at the present time, with the developments envisaged with the Arab finances and which are taking place in Iran, Iraq, the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia, to mention but a few places, where there are Irish engineers engaged in chemical, civil, electrical or mechanical work.  There are many Irish contracting firms involved in the preparation of projects throughout the Middle East.  I should like to see the whole range of building services included&mdash;architectural, quantity surveying and so on&mdash;and not just engineering services.  My objection is to the narrow definition of engineering services.  There is a whole range of professional and technical and building services which can be and are being delivered in a package and which are being successfully carried <Col N="1218" /> out by Irish firms in the countries I have mentioned apart from the large scope existing in countries such as Zambia, Tanzania and Nigeria.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider, in preparing his next budget, broadening that considerably to include the whole range of professional services which we can provide through our university and technological institutions and where we can have a growing area of indirect benefit, both from the export point of view and from the point of view of job fulfilment and satisfaction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the pleas made by Senator Lenihan.  When this relief was first given some eight years ago we appealed for the broadening of the definition, but the then Minister held it was just a pioneering scheme and that the broadening could be done when we saw the success of the initial effort.  We are happy that the initial effort in the engineering field and so on has been an outstanding succes. The time has come now for the Minister to broaden this&mdash;not necessarily in the present Bill but perhaps in his next Finance Bill.  The emergence of the EEC has also posed a number of questions, because there are research funds available within the EEC for doing somewhat similar type of work to that envisaged as being encouraged in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to feel that work done for the EEC could be regarded as work done outside the State, even though the handing over of the results would not have the same physical sense as envisaged in section 60.  It would be merely the publication of the results concerned or their transmittal to whatever central office the EEC had for this particular research project.  There is money for research in the EEC and we should get our share of it.  On the other hand, our research organisations are poorly endowed compared with similar groups within the EEC.  Therefore, that makes it all the more necessary for the Government to do everything possible to ensure that those groups get <Col N="1219" /> every incentive to get after this work. In this field, I would hope that the development would see joint projects developing between the regional technical colleges and the university centres and indeed between other independent groups outside.  There is a wide field here and I ask the Minister, &ldquo;Let us go and get our share of it&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not unfriendly to the exhortations that have been made here but I would point out that the section is extermely wide.  One should not look at the words of limitation so much as the very broad description of design and planning services which covers virtually every conceivable activity in relation to construction works of the type Senator Lenihan referred to.  It has been broadly interpreted to cover everything from engineering to quantity surveying to draftsmanship and scientific work and so on.</P>

      <P>From the begining. We were exhorted to specify particular professions and I think that specifying particular professions might lead to the presumption that ones which were not mentioned were not included, and I thought it better to leave it as it is.  I will certainly consider what has been said by both Senators.  I will conclude with the thought that I fear the EEC might be the very body that might object to extension of the provision to cover works which might be done in the EEC.  That is something we will not decide in the Seanad or in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section corresponds broadly with section 410 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which provides for the deduction of income tax at a reduced rate from dividends paid out of export-relieved profits.  However, the section contains a provision which has no counterpart in the existing export sales relief provision which will secure that where the distributions exceed the distributable income of the accounting period the tax credit in respect of the excess will be calculated having regard to any export sales relief for the immediately preceding accounting period.  Where the profits of the latter period are insufficient, the balance of the excess will be treated, for purposes of computing the tax credits, as coming out of the profits of the next immediately preceding accounting period and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain why that is an improvement? At present a company could, and the Minister is very well aware that many companies do, simulate profits within the State for an indefinite period of time.  The money they could distribute in certain cases that are not disclosed in any particular way but covered in a global disclosure of State accounts is lent to the Government.  I take it that in no conceivable circumstances could a distribution under this section mean that a company were limited by reference to some activity of a preceding year or caught under the distribution provisions which treat certain distributions as not expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it possible that an export tax relieved company could, under this section, find themselves in relation to certain distributions being able to treat them as expenses so that when they got into a situation where they were tacking the home market, for example, the availability of this expense would be useful and important <Col N="1221" /> to them?  I tend to take the view, which I have expressed twice, once in this House and once on one of those rare occasions on which I speak through a box and I am thankfully unseen, that the growth in population is not something to disturb us.  It creates problems for us, but viewing the thing historically if there is an element of growth in an economy, a growth in a population tends to accelerate the growth of the economy. I could see situations where the exclusion from the home market by virtue of an agreement under a grant, for example, might require to be varied by the company persuading the grantor of the grant to very it, or where there is not an exclusion to the home market where the company were not in competition with the local capitalist, they might choose to come into the home market and then be liable to tax.</P>
    <P>Is the position under this section that if they did that they would find themselves limited by the fact that they had not distributed profit which they could have distributed, which they retained in Ireland for the benefit of Ireland, by either ploughing it back or lending it to the Government on Exchequer Bills or whatever type of negotiable instrument was agreed on between the Government and the company in question?  If that is the position, I am sure the Minister will help us on that.  I would be totally opposed to the adoption of the section with that variation and would suggest that the redrafting of this change in the law is obviously not of the kind which could be done in the time that we know the Minister has. There are other sections where the redrafting would be quite simple and the printing of it a small matter, but the redrafting of this involves professional time on a very extensive basis.</P>
    <P>One could get this amended presumably in the Finance Bill, but as I read the section and as the Minister has explained it, it seems that it has this consequence.  I think this ought not to follow as a consequence because if it is to this country's advantage that the export relieved companies who establish themselves here <Col N="1222" /> are encouraged to retain their profits here, as a very lage number of them do for various other reasons.  It may not be for an idealistic motive such as moved everybody in the Seanad but for motives of material advantage to themselves but which inure to our advantage because this money is kept here.  In one form or another it bolsters up the banking system.  It is ploughed back.  Such companies may make other investments and they may then come within the formula which may lead to a surcharge arising for them.  If this sort of situation arose then it would not be true to say that we have not made a change which affected the undertakings we have given, some of which, since our entrance to the EEC, now amount to Exchequer obligations which it is our duty at least to recommend to the other House from which this Bill has come.</P>

      <P>I do not think I disagree with the objectives the Senator has in mind but I fear I may not have quite followed his reasoning.  The section is not referring to expenses at all.  It certainly is not obliging a company to make a distribution nor is it discouraging companies from retaining their money here or reinvesting it here.  All we are simply providing for in this section is a situation where a distribution takes place which is in excess of the profits which are available for distribution in that accounting period.  If we left the section as it was it would mean that simply because £1 of profit enjoyed earned income relief it could&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Export sales relief, as it is called.  That £1 alone could then colour or flood the total dividend. We are saying that in relation to the year in which the distribution takes place you look at the distributable profits for that year.  If they are insufficient to cover the distribution which has taken place, then you look to the export sales relief for the immediately preceding accounting period.  If that together with the distributable profits for the year in question <Col N="1223" /> is sufficient that is the end of it. If it is not you go back to the immediately preceding year until such time as you have a sufficient accumulation of profits to cover the distribution which has taken place.</P>

      <P>I take the point the Minister is seeking to cover. I agree with him that if he finds any loophole in the existing arrangement which would mean that income could get distributed with the recipient of the dividend getting the benefit of a full export tax relief where in fact the company were paying home corporation tax on part of the sales, that it would be closed.  I wonder if the formula is correct.  For example, if you have a company which have been doing this business of exporting for ten years and then proceed to get into the home market there are very complex negotiations going on with these companies all the time.  We are very conscious of any variation from this system of rights with regard to reliefs which encourages them.  I wish the Minister, in his spending capacity, would be aware that much the greatest attraction in all our systems of incentives to investors here is the export tax relief and not the grant. The grant is negotiable always.  If they have any doubts about the export tax relief they are out the door.  You have no further conversations with them.</P>
      <P>Can we see it so that the taxability of the recipient of the dividend relates to the total accumulated reserves and then their source, talking the total export turnover of the whole period of years and the total home sales, that it is that fraction only which the recipient of the dividend is caught by?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our population is going up.  As I tried to point out recently it was during the system of private enterprise encouragement that emigration stopped and the population growth began.  Let us remember that.  The projections for the future are based on something that has happened in the past.  I do not expect the Minister and his advisers&mdash;God knows they have enough to do&mdash;to change this now.  However, if the Minister finds <Col N="1224" /> that what I am saying is worth while &mdash;this is not a type of amendment which can be done between now and the Report Stage&mdash;he might deal with it is quickly as possible.  A very important question of principal arises here with regard to economic policy.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the case where a tax credit, reduced in accordance with section 64, is in respect of a distribution to which section 178, that is, dividends at gross rates, applies.  The latter section provides that an obligation created before 6th April, 1976, to make a fixed rate of distribution, for example, preference dividends, will as from that date be satisfied by payment of such an amount as will, with the addition of the normal tax credit in force on that date, be equal to the gross distribution which the company were previously obliged to make.  The section requires the company to make a supplementary payment equal to the amount by which the tax credit as reduced under section 64, which is the import sales relief section, falls short of the normal tax credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no criticism of any kind but just a desire to comprehend how the surcharge with regard to the distribution of a company relative to the estate and investment <Col N="1225" /> income ensures that the export tax relief is in no way affected by the surcharge.  Does the formula designed in this, indicated later on in section 178, ensure that?  If the position is that a surcharge can arise&mdash; and I tell the Minister that I think it does arise&mdash;in such a way that somebody who has shares in an export tax relieved company can find a surcharge arising which will effectively at the time of the distribution deprive him of the benefit of the export tax relief, we have reneged on the investors in these companies.  Let us face it, they are not all foreign companies.  There are many companies that are Irish investors.  Many Irish investors are involved in these companies.  I know that laws can be changed but specifically in relation to export tax relief, and more specifically in relation to Shannon, while we have entered into no international obligations, nor can we, which would oblige Parliament to very the laws, we have undoubtedly in a widespread fashion built up our international reputation on the basis that we will not change these laws to the disadvantage of the people who understood them as being what their advisers told them when they came in.</P>
      <P>This is of absolute importance in relation to the whole question of export tax relief and in relation to the Shannon Free Airport area.  Even if it were only a penny in the £, it will be a significant matter of principle. But it will be more than that in relation to export sales relief.  We have the duty of advising companies who are considering whether to do things here or not on the nature of the obligation which the IDA are authorised to give these companies, always related to an understanding that at some stage European policy will require us to repeal our export sales relief but never contemplating a situation in which we would of our own initiative in any way reduce that relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is of the very greatest importance.  There is another section which, if there is a sense of injustice removed, must be amended.  I do not ask that amendments be made in relation to all of these.  All I ask in relation to this section, connected with <Col N="1226" /> section 178 and the whole question of the surcharge, is that it would very quickly be put right and I do not mind how much administrative time is involved in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wandered with Senator FitzGerald down the side alleys which he took us because I think, with all due respect, it has not much reference to this section which deals with fixed rate distributions.  The surcharge provision in later sections would not apply to export sales relief which arises in relation to the trading activities of a trading company.  The surcharge does not apply to the trading profits of a trading company, so there is that division between the two. I do not disagree with much of what he argued in relation to various incentives. It is the Government's intention that existing incentives be preserved intact where such incentives were given.  It is intended to honour them. They have been acted upon and it is clearly a moral obligation to ensure that they are fully respected.  The Government are not proposing in any way to interfere with any of the concessions which were made available to encourage people to engage in manufacture of goods here for export. Section 65 in no way tampers with any of the rights to which such people are entitled by virtue of exemptions given in the law relating to export sales relief.</P>
      <P>We are simply providing in section 65 a means whereby the tax credit situation can be adjusted.  Under the old system the dividend was paid gross.  Under the new system the company will have its obligation to pay the dividend discharged, if it pays the preference dividend which with the tax credit will equal the old gross rate. If the tax credit is reduced because of export sales relief, the company will be required to make up the shortfall by a supplementary distribution.</P>

      <P>This corresponds to section 380 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, with a number of necessary changes.  Briefly, it provides that distribution made partly out of &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; income and partly out of &ldquo;liable&rdquo; profits is to be treated as two separate distributions.  The distribution made out of exempt income is in the hands of a company, to be treated as income from exempted trading operations, and in the hands of a person other than a company, to be disregarded for income tax purposes. A distribution made out of exempt income is not to carry a tax credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I hope the other Assembly to which we are never allowed to refer have been studying the examples that the Minister has made available.  A company's income for the accounting year, profits from exempt trading, is £60,000.  It gets rent of £40,000.  It pays corporation tax of £20,000 and it has a distributable income of £80,000.  The company pays a dividend of £40,000.  This dividend is divided into two separate dividends, that is to say, it is paid out of exempt income to the extent of the proportion that the exempt income bears to the total of all the income, and the other part is taken care of in the same way. The £30,000 will not carry a tax credit, will not be regarded as income for any purpose of the income tax code.  In the hands of the corporate shareholder the amount of £30,000 would be deemed to be income from exempt trading operations, so that the exemption enjoyed by the company from which the dividend came passes on to the company which rules the shares.</P>
      <P>In so far, however, as it arises from buying properties around Senator Russell's abode&mdash;it stretches more or less all over the south of Ireland&mdash; it is taxable to that proportion.  That is fair enough, because that is the experience of the company in question, is it not?  In regard to the fixed rate of dividend paid out of exempted Shannon income, what is the point here?

It reproduces section 387 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, suitably adapted for corporation tax purposes, and takes account of the changes introduced by the Finance (Taxation of Profits of Certain Mines) Act, 1974.  The tax reliefs in respect of certain mining profits terminated on April 5, 1974, and the section is concerned with distributions made out of tax-relieved income which arose before that date. It provides that such distributions will not rank as income in the hands of the recipients who will not be entitled to a tax credit in respect of such a distribution.  Where the recipient is another company, the distribution is to be treated as if it were exempted income, with the same consequences as if the recipient company had themselves been granted mining relief in respect of the income represented by the distribution.</P>

      <P>This section is not making any change in substance but it is providing new machinery.  It lays down the manner in which income tax is to be charged on receipts in respect of dividends and other distributions made by Irish resident companies. They will be charged under a new Schedule, known as Schedule F, on the aggregate of the distribution and the tax credit.  The new Schedule is necessary because of this arrangement of the distribution and the tax credit attributable to it.  A non-resident, however, will be charged on the actual distribution only at the excess of any higher rate of tax for which he may be liable over the standard rate and would have to account to the Revenue for income tax on any annual payments made out of the distribution.</P>

It does not deal with companies that do not reside in Ireland.  We will deal with section 84 and leave out 96 and 97 for the moment.  Am I correct in understanding that the first effect of something being a distribution is that it is not an allowable deduction for the purposes of corporation tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section for all companies, any dividend paid by a company, including capital dividend, is not an allowable deduction.  That is fair enough for the first part of that.  For the second part, it includes a capital dividend, for which we have no definition, but which all the dictionaries would seem to suggest means only dividends got out of a capital gain, wherever made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital gains tax Act specifically provided that a capital gains tax be levied on gains made before a date which is specified in that Act, and companies carried on and made gains long before the date given in that Act. Some of them kept these gains in their companies and did not distribute them as they could have done.  For whatever purpose they used them they kept them.  I cannot see how this is not retrospectively taxing at a higher rate than capital gains tax does, <Col N="1240" /> capital gain made before the introduction of capital gains tax.  I cannot see how it is not doing that except where a shareholder's general income was below his allowances and so on. In a lot of cases a standard rate of tax will apply.</P>
    <P>The people who have been managing these companies have been managing them knowing perfectly well that there was some capital dividend available for distribution which could be received free of tax at some stage, which they could have given out free of tax prior to the date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The retrospective element in this is unjust.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House that there is something else they can do with capital dividends&mdash;buy Exchequer bills, invest in the national loan or put them further into trading operations.  While they had capital dividends that they could have declared why did they not declare them? There could be all sorts of reasons why.  They could have got them out tax free anyhow.  What is the logic behind that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the fact that capital dividend accruing prior to April, 1974, and not paid out since then, that capital dividend which accrued prior to the passage of the Capital Gains Tax Bill&mdash;in that legislation there was a specific prohibition <i>vis-á-vis</i> tax on any capital gain prior to April, 1974&mdash;capital gain distributed in the form of dividend not declared prior to April, 1974, is now being made subject to tax?  If that is the case, it is flying in the face of this specific guarantee given in regard to the retrospective aspect in the course of the passage of the Capital Gains Bill through both Houses and would appear to fly in the face of the actual specific section which debarred retrospective tax in respect of capital gains written into the Capital Gains Tax legislation.  It is a very net point and I would like clarification from the Minister.</P>

      <P>The House should remember that we are dealing with actual distributions.  We are not dealing with a gain by the company as such.  That is dealt with under other legislation.  We are dealing with distributions by the company of capital dividends.  The treatment which we are according to them under section 84 is in line with well-established precedents in countries which have both income tax and corporation tax.</P>
      <P>The reason why such distributions of capital dividends were not previously taxed here was that we did not have a capital gains tax until comparatively recently.  It is interesting to note that in the neighbouring island, in Britain, the treatment which we are according now to distribution of capital dividends was introduced as far back as 1965.  Of course, they had capital gains tax as well as their corporation tax at that time.  Now, on the first available opportunity, we are amending the corporation tax laws and have for the first time a capital gains tax and it is obviously appropriate that we would introduce provisions which are similar to those which are in operation in other countries. There is a very good reason for doing so.  In principle there is no distinction in dividend arising out of a trading profit and one arising out of a capital gain.  In both cases, as far as the shareholder is concerned, they are a reward to him for his investment of money in the company. There is no intrinsic difference in the benefit which he obtains.  It is a reward for his investment, for his share-holding. It is appropriate that he should pay tax at a similar level on both distributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was dealt with in 1955 <Col N="1242" /> in a United Kingdom Royal Commission on the taxation of profits and income.  This commission report pointed out that it seemed to be the prevailing theory that a limited company could pay a special kind of dividend to its shareholders which was exempt from being included in the income of the recipients, either for the purpose of income tax or for the purpose of surtax.  The condition of the exemption appeared to be the company had made capital profits which were not chargeable to tax in its hands.  It was then assumed that these profits could, still preserving the title of capital profits which they bore as profits of the company, be passed on to shareholders in the form of dividends. While not questioning that a company might make a profit which, in arising from the receipts of its trading operations, was not a part of its taxable income, they nevertheless, regarded this theory as to dividends with misgivings and some surprise. They concluded that these special capital profits dividends must be regarded as cash dividends which the company concerned was in a position to distribute after making a general review of the current value of its assets and satisfying itself that they would be sufficient to meet the various claims upon them, including the claims of the share capital account. From this point of view these dividends did not appear to differ substantially from other dividends.</P>
    <P>The commission's view was that there was not sufficient ground for treating these capital profits dividends as if their nature was different from that of other dividends.  All represented benefits accruing from time to time upon the shares which were the source of the dividends.  All arose while the company was a going concern. None involved any reduction of the capital paid up on its shares.  The Royal Commission recommended accordingly that they should, by an amendment of the law, be regarded as taxable income.  In the United Kingdom they had both corporation tax amending legislation and capital gains tax, as we are now doing, providing the logical manner of treating such dividends.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of removing all anomalies in our tax system.  I am in favour of anybody being allowed to contrive a situation, by artificial means or otherwise, to his advantage over his colleague, contemporary or fellow-resident. All sorts of border-line questions arise about whether it is wise for the Government to seek the full type of equality of treatment.  All sorts of questions arise with regard to wealth tax and its usefulness for us at this stage of our development.  I have no doubt whatever that the Royal Commission was right when it said that they should receive like treatment.  I have no objection to somebody receiving a capital dividend in the future in respect of profits arising from gains made after the enactment of the capital gains tax legislation being treated in the same way as somebody who is getting profits, dividends based on his trading activities, or whose taxable income is Schedule E.</P>
      <P>I do not like the anomalies that are in Schedule E.  Some of these are badly in need of change.  I recognise the Minister's difficulty with regard to meeting all these problems.  Justice is what we aim at but cannot hope repidly to reach.  There is extreme difficulty, first of all, in becoming fully aware of the nature of the injustice, and, secondly, in conceiving the method of alleviating it.  We are enacting a provision which means that any poor old dud of a company that had £100,000 stuffed away in its stocking could have shoved it out before whatever date in 1974 and got it tax free and did not because it did not have some chap with a crystal ball saying, &ldquo;Ach, do not mind that thing about 5th April, 1974, you had better get it out quick because if you do not you will find that your capital dividend in the future is going to be taxed and not at 26 per cent, at a higher rate than 26 per cent according to the rate of taxation applicable at present&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard that as unjust.  I do not mind what the Royal Commission reported.  I do not know what the British Government proposed for enactment or whether they made any <Col N="1244" /> distinction.  In any case I would not know which government was in power at that time.</P>

Do we now have something like that in some other section where we have distributions made out of capital profits?  Do we not have already, in relation to the future, provision which distinguishes whether the money is coming out of capital gains or profitable income? You would think I spend my life receiving dividends.  Indeed, I do not. If I did I would not be so concerned about some sections of this Bill as I am.  The Minister knows a great deal more than I do, that out of somebody's transfer of capital, somebody's abstinence is necessary for the generation of employment.  There can be a great debate going on for a long time as to whether we are going to adopt a system here of shoving everybody's standard of living down by appealing to their nationalistic fervour to accept it voluntarily, getting them lined up in tribes like the Japansese do and singing songs to them to reduce savings to cultivate the future. Bring the money in and pay the people for giving it to us, a share of the profit they generate.  It is only out of these kinds of sources that we are going to get it, that is why I am concerned about it.  It does not matter to me, there is no company that I am connected with which can in any way give a capital dividend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that there be no retrospective element in our tax laws.  I accept the Minister's taking, as he has done in the various Bills, the publication dates.  There was the gift tax problem when everybody went around in circles making gifts the day after they heard they were going to <Col N="1245" /> be taxed.  He did not fix that as the date and the retrospective element is 27th November, the date of publication of this Bill.  Subject to that, retrospection is very dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to retrospection.  It is fundamental to the whole financial and investment structure that whatever taxes we impose and they have to be imposed, are seen to be done with integrity. That basically means an absence of a retrospective element, because if there is one thing above everything else that gets you into the banana republic league it is this element of retrospection or any suspicion of such that arises.</P>
      <P>This measure appears specifically to contain a retrospective element.  Like Senator FitzGerald I am not holding any brief for any company in which these circumstances arise.  I ask the Minister if, in the situation of a capital gain made prior to 5th April, 1974, incorporated in a dividend not declared before April, 1974, now being declared and distributed&mdash;I am relating here to profits made prior to 5th April, 1974&mdash;this now qualifies for the 35 per cent tax that it appears to qualify for under this legislation? Is that not in direct conflict with assurances given in regard to capital gains that they would not arise in respect of any profit prior to 5th April, 1974, not alone guarantees given but guarantees written into the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1974?</P>

      <P>Senators are overlooking the fact that we are not taxing the gains made by the company prior to the date of operation of the capital gains tax.  There is no question of retrospection.  The gain has been made by the company before the date of operation of capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taxing the distribution made subsequent to the introduction of the corporation tax code.  That is not retrospection.  If the distribution does not take place no occasion to tax arises.  If the distribution takes <Col N="1246" /> place afterwards then the occasion to tax arises.  I am sure that is why the British Government acted in 1965. If my memory serves me correctly that was a British Tory Government. I am corrected&mdash;my political informants tell me it was a Socialist Government. I do not know whether that puts Senator FitzGerald on the horns of a dilemma or not.  I am glad he has accepted my exaltation to debate it on its merits.  If he considers the merits he will see that we are not having any element of retrospection because the company is not being taxed on gains made prior to the operation of capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>An occasion of tax arises on a distribution made subsequently.  We say, and Senator FitzGerald accepts in principle, that there is no fundamental distinction between a dividend which arises out of trading profits or which arises out of a capital adjustment.  If that be so then I would say we are doing the right thing here and we are strengthened by the precedent and confidence of other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would agree when I say he is doing the right thing in regard to capital profits made subsequent to 6th April, 1974, but surely he is not quite right in saying that even though the capital profits are distributed post April, 1974, they were earned or accumulated prior to that date.  It is the date of distribution that, in the Minister's mind, decides the rate of taxation. We say there is retrospection in that the actual profits were accumulated prior to April, 1974.  There is no retrospective element, obviously, as regard the distribution of the capital profit but the earning of the capital profit does, to my simple mind anyway, involve retrospective legislation, because it was earned prior to April, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider this because the introduction of a retrospective element is there? It is only semantics to draw a distinction between distributed gains post April, 1974 and gains that were accumulated pre-April, 1974.  The <Col N="1247" /> capital gain secured or obtained or made prior to April, 1974 is being taxed here.  It is being taxed in the form, I agree, of a declared and distributed dividend which arose after April, 1974 but it is only semantics to draw a distinction.  It is a capital gain made prior to April, 1974, that is now redistributed in the form of distributed dividends.</P>
      <P>It is the same thing.  It is a capital gain made prior to April, 1974, that is now re-distributed in the form of a declared dividend.  It is a rose by another name and the Minister is well aware of that.  There appears to be a lacuna, an omission, and it is important to preserve the retrospective integrity aspect which we have always maintained in our finance legislation and particularly so in this case where we gave very specific guarantees and the Minister rightly did so in introducing capital gains tax.  I am in favour of capital gains taxation but as I said on that subject guarantees were given that there would be no retrospective element in it.  Everybody had ample notice prior to the enactment of that legislation that capital gains would operate from 5th April, 1974.  I can imagine a number of cases where such a gain would now be incorporated in a distributed dividend. After all, it is only two years ago.  It is quite on the cards that for a number of reasons the gain would have been retained by the company and would only now be declared and distributed in the form of dividend.  If the Minister can see his way to devising some drafting method of enclosing that, it is important from the point of view of the generally high regard in which we are held in regard to our finance legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a company had made a capital gains profit prior to April, 1974, and had held on to that and continued to hold on to it, no difficulty arises.  That is agreed by all sides.  The only occasion the question arises is when the distribution is made and the distribution is something which followed the introduction of the tax and, therefore, the parties <Col N="1248" /> know that if the distribution takes place subsequent to the introduction of the tax it will be liable to payment of tax.  There is no element of retrospection there.  A company can withhold the capital profit and use it some way other than by distributing it.  If it distributes it, then this Bill very properly provides that the distribution will give an occasion to payment of tax.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that a capital dividend paid by a non-resident company has always given rise to payment of tax, so we are not introducing here a concept which is strange to the law.</P>

Yes, that is a change but it is a change after the event.  There is no element of retrospection.</P>

      <P>Much of this is clearly right but I wonder where there is provision regarding redemption of bonus securities.  The normal old trick of issuing the bonus securities is caught and properly caught.  Has anyone caught on to the situation where the bonus securities might be taken in satisfaction of a right to the capital which could have been a bonus issue which is excluded but they are prepared to take the bonus securities over a term of years and provide permanent capital redeemed of the option of the company? I am sorry to put this question: these are rather commercial matters, but is there any possibility of this hindering the financing of companies? It seems that there is no consideration for bonus issues.  I do not want to fascinate the House with a long discussion of what is involved in the bonus issue but, in fact, when somebody gets a bonus issue he is giving up his rights to draw out the accumulated reserves and they are pushed up in paying for the shares that are issued.  I understand that bonus issues are not regarded as taxable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that point but I just wondered with the highly complex financial technology developing, whether for taxation reasons we have left the door open enough to make use of other types of bonus issues which could have a security element.  This, <Col N="1250" /> again, is something which could be amended in future paragraphs, if there is anything in it.  There are certain kinds of bodies who want to get a fixed interest on their money and they say: &ldquo;We will leave it in and do without the distribution to which we are entitled and it will suit us best if we get it when we are aged 70.&rdquo;  I do not know if there is anything in that point but I should like the Minister, in general, to consider it.  He has indicated that he is prepared to do that.  What is the position as regards subsection (2) (d)&mdash;interest or other distribution out of assets of the company?  What does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I would not be in favour of being so restrictive in tax legislation as to discourage desirable commercial practices and suitable arrangements. We, obviously, have to be very clear as to what distributions are that could avoid the charge to tax by making arrangements specifically designed to avoid a tax charge.  No doubt we will have the ingenuity of people applied to the new arrangements and I would be very disappointed indeed if any of the measures in this Bill kill any desirable arrangements required in the legitimate interests of investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On paragraph (2) (d)&mdash;it might solve many problems if I read my note.  It may help the Senator.  It deals with any interest paid on or after 6th April, 1976 or other distribution out of assets of the company in respect of the securities to which we have been referring.  This paragraph is designed to prevent the withdrawal of profits from companies in the guise of interest.  The effect of treating interest and the like under this paragraph as a distribution is to preclude its allowance as a deduction in computing the profits on which the company is to be charged to corporation tax, so that it would not be an allowable expense any longer.  It would be a taxable receipt on distribution, which it is anyhow.  So it is really directed at preventing an artificial reduction of the company's tax liability.  But no amount should be regarded as representing the principal secured by a <Col N="1251" /> security in so far as it exceeds any new consideration which has been received where the security issued before 27th November, 1975, which is the date of the circulation of the Bill. It is accepted in subparagraph (ii) of subsection (d) that the position is as quoted in regard to securities, where they are convertible into shares, or which are issued on terms which are reasonably comparable with the terms of issue of securities so quoted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Who determines that?  Can you ever get anything comparable on the stock exchange? You will take a lower rate of interest from a quoted security than you will look for from any company I have had anything to do with.  How can you compare like with like because they are not alike?</P>

      <P>If all parties were reasonable it would be possible to reach agreement but if they are not, then the Revenue Commissioners will express their view and any person dissatisfied therewith will have recourse to the normal rights of appeal.  I can understand Senator FitzGerald's fears that it could lead to innumerable delays such as have occurred from time to time in the operation of estate duty. This is inseparable from the complexity of company law and shareholdings, their value, control and so forth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is all this about securities provided by the company and held by a company not registered in the State?  I can understand excess interest but that does not arise here.  It says that a company will be regarded as issuing securities issued by the company and held by a company not registered in the State in certain circumstances, but not in all circumstances.  The circumstances are that the company which issues the securities is a 75 per cent subsidiary. What is a 75 per cent subsidiary?  I take it the idea here is to prevent the foreign company from depleting the profits of the company for corporation <Col N="1252" /> tax by issuing securities to its parent and taking the reward in the guise of interest rather than a distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest on loans, if I can use that term in order not to confuse the issue.  The purpose of the provision is to prevent the non-resident company from financing the Irish subsidiary by way of loan capital as extracting in the guise of interest, which is tax deductible, funds which in reality are distributions and not tax deductible.  A deduction for interest accords relief to the paying company at the full corporation tax rate of 50 per cent whereas if there is a full distribution of the profit the tax payable by the company, which it cannot impute to the shareholders is 23 per cent. For example, let us assume a profit before interest of £100.  Less interest payable of £100 would leave a nil situation&mdash;no tax payable by the company. Let us again assume a profit of £100, with tax at £50, which would give a distribution of £50 plus tax credit of £27, which would be seven-thirteenths of £50, or £77.  Tax ultimately suffered by the company would be £50 minus £27, that is, £23 or 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 84, subsection (2) (d) (iv) is to prevent the loss of revenue which would arise if there were no restriction on the allowance of interest to a non-resident company which controls the Irish company and which in respect of the interest is outside the ambit of the corporation tax.  It should be noted that for purposes of corporation profits tax, which is not imputable to the shareholder or on distribution, interest paid to a person in control of the company is not deductible.</P>
      <P>Another consideration is that if the country of residence of the parent is one with which there are double taxation arrangements on the OECD model then credit would normally be given against the tax of the parent for the full Irish tax underlying the distribution.</P>

In the case of a non-close company a bonus issue of share capital which is not redeemable and which is made more than ten years after the capital repayment is not to be treated as a distribution.</P>

      <P>We set out in subsection (1) rules for determining what is new consideration, a term to which there are several references in section 83 in particular and subsequent sections. Subsection (1) defines &ldquo;new consideration&rdquo; as consideration not provided directly or indirectly out of the assets of a company.  The capitalisation of profits is not &ldquo;new consideration&rdquo;.  There is a proviso that share capital paid up out of share premium account, itself representing new consideration, is to be treated as issued for new consideration unless the premium has previously been taken into account in deciding that a return on shares represented a repayment of share capital and not a distribution.  Subsection <Col N="1255" /> (2) (a) excludes from the definition of new consideration any consideration derived from the value of any share capital or security of a company or from voting or other rights in a company unless it consists of money received or the giving up of a right as described in subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) which I do think are self-explanatory.

      <P>The section provides that where a distribution is made after 5th April, 1976 out of capital profit, the company making the distribution will be assessed to income tax to recover from it tax equivalent to the tax credit in respect of that distribution, less the amount of any capital gains tax or equivalent corporation tax borne by the company in respect of it.  Provision is also made for the case where a company makes a payment to a participator or his associate or pays interest to a director or his associate in such circumstances that the payment is a distribution by virtue of section 96 or 97.  If such a distribution is greater than the profits of the company, the excess will be deemed to be made out of capital profit which has not been charged to capital gains tax or to corporation tax for the purpose of recovering from the company the equivalent of the full amount of the tax credit in respect of the distribution.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with a company which was formerly resident abroad and becomes resident here subsequent to the passing of this Act, say, on 31st March, 1977, at which date they might have undistributed profit of £100,000.  Section 91 will operate in this way.  If after the company become resident, on 1st April, 1977 they pay a dividend of £40,000 that dividend would carry a tax credit of £21,538, that is £40,000×35÷65.  This is provided by the application of section 88. An assessment to cover this tax credit would be made on the company in the following manner.  The assessment would be on £40,000 plus the tax credit, that is £61,538 at 35 per cent which would give a tax of £21,538.  I would not consider that the operation of this section would in any way act as a disincentive to investors coming here. If the company did not wish to pay the tax in Ireland it could easily be arranged to discharge the tax somewhere else.</P>

      <P>(2) (a)  a company is to be treated as controlled by or on behalf of the State if, but only if, it is under the control of the State or of persons acting on behalf of the State, independently of any other person, and</P>

      <P>That would be fine if it stopped there</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless it can be treated as a close company as being under the control of persons acting independently of the State.</P>
      <P>All I can say is, I congratulate the draftsman.  I deeply desire his explanation as to what he is proposing to us to legislate.  What conceivable meaning has he attached to this language?  Are we thinking of a company which are not to be treated as a close company because they are under the control of the State, yet, in some mysterious fashion, although controlled by the State, because they are controlled by somebody other than the State.

Those who have to go into the embrace of the bear ought to know the consequences of the hug.  We know that all sorts of consequences follow from being a close company. There must be some situation which is in existence.  After all there cannot be too many.  I take it we get the reports on the State bodies, companies that Fóir Teoranta have an interest in.</P>
      <P>Do we read their reports with avid interest and note the extraordinary success of the public sector in sponsoring enterprises everywhere?  What sort of situation are we talking about? Are we talking about a case where Fóir Teoranta are, for example, taking a great block of equity and because they are taking a great block of equity it would, were it not for this section, be a close company?  But it then does not want to give the benefits of not being a close company to the other shareholders of the company.  Is that what it is?

      <P>Does that mean if there is a bonus scheme to encourage employees to take shares in the company they are given preference, as they often are, on offers to the public?  Does it mean that the shares they take up are to be excluded? They are not to be regarded as members of the public for this purpose, even though they are given preferential rights as to the percentage they will get on the allotment.  I would be against that.</P>

    <P>I would have thought there was tremendous advantage to the country <Col N="1264" /> in getting the Dublin stock market expanded as much as we possibly could.  It is subject to enough restrictions as it is.  A lot of Department of Finance research has been done on this over the years.  The real sign of prosperity is not when you get manufacturing going; it is when the proportion that is engaged in service and supply is increasing that you have a really developing community.  This is one of the services which you can have expanded.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator FitzGerald has said.  I can see practical difficulties in knowing when the minimum 35 per cent is held by the public.  Who are the public? Is it the non-resident public?  There are a certain number of English shareholders so that in fact the shares could be held outside the country and qualify under this section.  There is a danger of putting Irish companies at a disadvantage in comparison to British non-resident companies who would not be circumscribed by this section. This is something that in practice might need to be looked at.  The implementation of this will raise obvious difficulties.  Once a percentage is decided on and if it drops below that percentage the company's structure changes.  It becomes a close company. How could you keep tabs on this? This would be so especially if there were foreign shareholders involved. Shares could be held in Hong Kong or any place.  How would it be decided when they dropped below the minimum 35 per cent?</P>
      <P>It is absolutely essential in a free market if you are relying for investment on the public to ensure that there is free sale and free purchase of shares.  That requires from time to time a change in the ownership of the shares and the size of the shareholdings. It is a fact that in times of difficulty it is not the timid shareholder who buys.  It is the person who has confidence in the future of the company and perhaps buys out some of the smaller and weaker shareholders. In principle I agree with what the Minister is trying to get at. In practice he might find it difficult to achieve his objectives.</P>

      <P>I do not think the figure of 35 is too high.  That is what operates in the UK in relation to the stock exchange considerations as to what is the appropriate norm. Senator FitzGerald posed the questions of why a merchant bank might not be an associate of a director.  I would not consider that such a bank would be an associate of a director provided the bank in question was the beneficial owner of the shares.  It is important that the 35 per cent of the shares be held by persons who have the beneficial ownership of them and that that beneficial ownership is independent of the interest of a director or any of the persons who are set out in subsection (5).  Who are &ldquo;the public&rdquo; is a question that has been asked.  &ldquo;The public&rdquo; is everybody except those who are not set forth in subsection (5).</P>
      <P>I can accept that there will be difficulties of interpretation and application. That is no reason for not doing the right thing.  Any tests applied involve judgment as to whether the facts disclose a breach of the conditions but the number of borderline cases would probably be comparatively few compared with the large number of companies which will come within the observation of the Revenue Commissioners.  I am sure that if there is good faith on both sides difficulties can be overcome.</P>

      <P>If I talk any more I do not think there will be any good things said about me in the Revenue Commissioners.  There is reference to shares &ldquo;acquired conditionally&rdquo; and held beneficially by the public.  Say there is an offer to the public of 35 per cent and you <Col N="1266" /> have to tell them all about it&mdash;there is an underwriting agreement under which various people said they would take them up.  They are not public. Presumably in the prospectus they will be told the consequences of their failing to take up the full offer.  One of the consequences will be the company will be a close company. Whether they take them up or not will affect the position of the company with regard to allowable expenses in the judgment of the financiers as to whether it is a good thing or not.  I say with the greatest respect that the underwriters to a share issue must come into or may, at any rate, come into the company; they may become principal members of the company, they may have to retain a bag of them in their wallet before they can get rid of them.  Is this a total copy of the UK?  I do not think it ought to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is designed to counter the tax avoidance device of withdrawing profits under the guise of interest.  It treats as a distribution interest in excess of a reasonable limit paid on or after April, 6th, 1976, by a close company to a director or his associate where the director has a material interest either in that company or another company by which it is controlled.  A person will be regarded as having a material interest in the company if he on his own, he and his associates, or his associates by themselves hold beneficially, either directly or indirectly, more than 5 per cent of the ordinary share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasonable limit is determined by applying the rate of 13 per cent or such other rates as may be prescribed by the Minister for Finance of the total of the loans or if less the issued share capital plus any share premium account.  There is provision <Col N="1268" /> to prevent avoidance by an arrangement for companies to make payments to one another's participators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Revenue are getting very wise to all sorts of things.  I do not object to it at all.  The only thing I object to is the high rate of direct taxation and I think that is the cause of all this.  If tax on earnings was stopped at 50 per cent an awful lot of this thing would not be going on.  Let inflation row ahead to the date when everybody is at a 77 per cent rate and then there will be a roar of a demand to get it down to a 50 per cent rate and we can start having proper economic policies instead of all this.</P>
      <P>Some lie and cheat for the money in their back pocket to spend it on drink or whatever other way they want to spend it.  I do not see why people in equal conditions should be treated unequally. If some sections are beyond detection the whole income tax code is going to be unconstitutional.  There is one question on subsection (4).  Does &ldquo;or such other rate of interest as the Minister for Finance may from time to time prescribe&rdquo; mean he can push it down as well as up?  Are you trying to force up capitalisation?  Why is it to be on the lower of the subscribed capital and what was the issued share capital?  You brought in the share premium account all right.  Does that force people into bonus issues?  What is the reason for it?  I am sure somebody has contrived something marvellous in the UK to get over this thing. I should like to know what it was in case we could work out some improved system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the figure of 13 per cent was fixed by the Dáil Committee, interest rates have fallen. Certainly in our environment there would be a case for making the interest rate law.  It was 12 per cent the Bill originally introduced under pressure. In the Committee I acceded to making it 13 per cent.  If one returns to the days of steady interest rates then it would be a very happy situation indeed, but I think we are a long way off that.  That is why we have to decide that the Minister for Finance <Col N="1269" /> may prescribe an appropriate figure from time to time and he certainly may move in either direction, down or up.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) is simply providing a manner for adjudicating whether or not a particular device in operation in a certain company is a device to withdraw profits under the guise of interest or is, in fact, a legitimate payment of interest.  It is very difficult to set out in legislation what should be the precise tests, but there must be some standards by which assessment can be made and that is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I take it the point is that if they exceed whatever is, from time to time, the amount fixed, we will not bother too much about the 13 per cent, that excess is treated as a distribution to the chap who gets it.  He is taxed on it on a grossed-up basis whether all his allowances are against it or not, and it is non-deductible as an expense to the extent that it is excessive.</P>

      <P>I think it is very desirable to maintain the rate of interest at what I would call a reasonable figure.  I do not necessarily mean too low a figure either.  I do not think anything should be done to prohibit directors and/or their associates coming to the assistance of a company in serious trouble.  If they did not do so, the company might have to go outside and borrow at an exorbitant rate which would not be covered by this legislation. I think a reasonable one might not necessarily mean bringing down the interest at all, but keeping it at a relatively high rate in accordance with the risk involved.</P>

      <P>It is absolutely right.  I have no objection to it on the principles enunciated as equal treatment.  I think the rate of tax is too high.  For example, if he gets £10,000 is this once again grossed up at 35 per cent in the year in which he gets it and then taxable?  Does the company pay the tax on the £10,000?  Is this slightly different in treatment from the other distributions?  I got the impression it was.  The company in this case accounts to the Revenue whatever its corporation tax liability may be for the 35 per cent interest to this chap on the £10,000.  If he repays the loan he is entitled to a refund of the 35 per cent tax, or whatever he is entitled to.  Am I right in that?</P>

      <P>Section 98 is best explained by an example.  A close company makes a loan of £6,500 to a participator. The company must be charged for income tax as if the loan were a net annual payment after deduction <Col N="1271" /> of tax.  For example, the loan of £6,500 would be grossed up to £10,000 and the income tax assessed on the company would be £3,500, and the net loan therefore would be £6,500. If the loan is repaid the company may claim relief in respect of the income tax which applies to the loan. For example, if the net loan of £6,500 were repaid in a later accounting period the company would then obtain relief of £3,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know a lot of human situations where, for example, old companies exist where the value of the company is quite high, but it is all held by great grandsons of the original founder.  Some grandchild of the original founder dies, leaves all her shares to her relatives, and because the death had not occurred before 5th April, 1974, they are stuck with estate duty.  The thresholds in capital acquisitions tax are still relatively generous in the case of nephews and nieces but it would not be in the cases of grandnieces and grandnephews, and the only way by which these people, who very often have nothing else but their share in the company, can pay Revenue bills that are due is by borrowing from the company.  I can see no subsection that can help in that situation where it is not really a distribution; it has to be repaid at the end of the day.  They are holding the company in existence because they are hoping that some of the family's concern may be to prevent their widows living in poverty or relative poverty, because they are outside all sorts of schemes.  They never thought of pension schemes, and their profits may not have been good enough anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am with the Minister on the general principle of this thing which is an obvious type of avoidance of tax on a borrowing which is really distribution, intended never to be repaid, washed out in a liquidation account or something.  Is there any amendment which could give the Revenue Commissioners discretion?  For example, even if it was only limited to the case of the kind I have just specified, if the money is needed to pay a debt of <Col N="1272" /> the recipient of the loan to the Revenue Commissioners?  I would prefer, however, if it was extended beyond that.  In English company law a director may not borrow from his company.</P>

      <P>I have a certain sympathy for the kind of hard case that Senator FitzGerald illustrates. The kind of case he mentioned is not very frequent.  That is not to say that it is not deserving of our attention, but it would be extremely difficult to provide for an exemption in this legislation for dealing with cases on the <Col N="1273" /> grounds of hardship such as he has outlined.</P>
      <P>There are many other cases where persons may receive assets which involve a liability to tax.  If the burden is unacceptable the gift may be repudiated&mdash;that may be asking for too much in relation to a family company to which one may have a certain loyalty, apart from being wishful of receiving benefit.  One could see that the appropriate thing would be to use the assets so as to provide means whereby tax could be paid.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see the operation of this legislation and, indeed, the other legislation&mdash;the capital acquisitions tax&mdash;and if particular difficulties are thrown up in light of the experience they could be dealt with.  I have said this on more than one occasion and I have always said it with some hesitation.  To speak in this way might suggest a certain sloppiness of mind or a lack of readiness to anticipate the difficulties.  One hesitates to widen the area lest by so doing one could facilitate avoidance and I hope that, even if I am succeeded by somebody else before the eventuality which Senator FitzGerald pictures that my successor would be similarly motivated to see if relief could be provided in the circumstances outlined.</P>

      <P>I am happy with the personal indication of the Minister's view, but we had ministerial statements on the operation of the wealth tax.  I have a case at the moment with the Revenue Commissioners of somebody who died who was liable for wealth tax, who was in a mental state at the time of the obligation to file his returns.  I made an estimate, as best I could, of what his wealth amounted to, sent in a cheque and said that I was just about able to persuade him to sign the cheque but it was not possible to get him to assess the present state of his affairs.  I asked if I could be assured that I was doing the best I could in the circumstances and that no interest would run.  I based my estimate on figures which had been given some years before to me for another purpose.  I have a formal reply <Col N="1274" /> from the Revenue Commissioners saying that there is no statutory power to enable them to relieve the estate from the obligation to pay interest.</P>
      <P>That is not just or constitutional.  I made the best guess I could as to my client's liability but I have this formal, stylised letter saying that there is no statutory power in the Revenue Commissioners to do this.  I am faced with a difficult situation&mdash; and I have one in mind&mdash;in relation to this section where I know there is no place where a certain man can get money.  He has had to reduce the amount of food he eats every week in order to exist at all, but he has a block of totally unrealisable shares. There is no means by which he can get money to pay the tax due in his circumstances except by borrowing from his company.</P>
      <P>I should like to see written into this section some obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to have regard to circumstances where there was no element&mdash;let us put it as extreme as the capital transfer abroad provisions are&mdash;of tax avoidance detectable in the operation.  If there is, kill it.  I go as far as that and, God knows that goes very far, although it is operated quite generously, I understand, in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unable to say anything about a possible successor of the Minister but there is a difference between ministerial statements and statutory rights.  The Revenue Commissioners should have the right to make a concession where they are satisfied there is no tax avoidance involved in the borrowing.  This is not the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  This is the Republic of Ireland and the vast majority of companies to which this legislation will apply are entirely different from the companies, and our social structure is completely different and the stability of our democracy depends on different factors and is much stronger because it depends on these factors than in the United Kingdom and we should seek to keep it as it is, in my view, that of a <Col N="1275" /> conspicuous Fine Gael conservative Senator.</P>

      <P>The Senator is asking that the Revenue Commissioners be given power to make judgments which they are not in a position to make.  There are many factors which the Revenue Commissioners would have to consider before making an assessment of the kind which Senator FitzGerald suggests.

Both of these would be imposing on the Revenue Commissioners judgments which they should not be called upon to exercise.</P>
      <P>A further consideration might be whether or not the person liable to tax had other wealth, had other means. Such a person could have other means which might not be brought to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners for reasons which might not be proper.</P>

Perhaps he is thinking of family obligation to maintain what the family had built up but there is nonetheless, the element of gift.  If a burden is unbearable, if the gift offered is unacceptable, it may be repudiated and the liability to tax does not arise.  The Senator may say that there may be obligations associated with ownership of the assets which cannot be lightly disregarded even though burdens and worries may attach to acceptance of the assets.  All these show the complexities that have to be faced and it is not possible to deal with all these situations in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald tells me of a situation which has come to his knowledge because he is involved in <Col N="1276" /> it in the operation of the wealth tax. I knew nothing about it until he mentioned it here today.  As we know, the Revenue Commissioners operate in a totally confidential atmosphere and it would not be usual for such a situation to come to my notice unless and until a problem appeared to be unresolved.  In that case, the Revenue Commissioners, in discharge of that great tradition which is theirs of serving the public interest impartially, would bring it to my notice.  Then it could be dealt with in the annual Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues Senator FitzGerald has raised would fall for consideration in the Finance Bill rather than in this legislation.  We are moving here to counter certain devices which could easily be used in order to avoid the proper liability to tax. Senator FitzGerald has said that he is with me in this objective but he has quoted some hardship cases to suggest that the law should be softened in some way to recognise those hardship cases.  It would be very difficult to devise, certainly in this Bill, procedures which would take account of the situations which he mentioned, but I would not be averse to receiving representations on this matter and dealing with it in subsequent legislation if even half the fears of Senator FitzGerald were to be realised in practice.</P>

      <P>A society is disgraced if one innocent man is executed.  I very much appreciate the Minister's attitude in saying that he will look at this for future legislative change, but let it not depend on reports to him by the Revenue Commissioners if there are many people affected by this and a lot of grievance. The fact which the Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and the draftsmen of this Bill should have regard to is that it has been permissible under our law to make loans to directors and it has not been permissible for 25 years to make loans to directors in the United Kingdom.  A different view should be formed as to the way of dealing with the loans to directors where they have been legally <Col N="1277" /> permissible.  Whether that was good law when enacted in 1963 or not is another matter but it means that there are a whole series of situations which were perfectly illicit all the time, which have been illicit in the United Kingdom.  It is perfectly clear that the amendment I am looking for is far beyond anything that could be got in this Bill.</P>
      <P>But let the Minister's decision on this be determined on questions of principle.  There ought to be recognition of power in the Revenue Commissioners to seek evidence of any kind they like in a hardship situation.</P>
      <P>We have a section in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill about gifts made which are normal and reasonable having regard to the income of the donor.  That is fine.  That has worked marvellously since 1894. There were no affidavits other than the original affidavits found in the Schedule because the Revenue Commissioners had presumably a sensible view and the taxpayer was always the recipient of the gift in that case but it always satisfied the Revenue Commissioners. All we want is not to be treated with a stereotyped letter saying there is no statutory power in the Revenue Commissioners to deal with this matter.  It is very unusual, and that is the 1894 estate duty code, to leave such a situation that there is not even provision for appeal on the matter.  Their decision as to what was normal and reasonable was final but it was always fair but times have changed.  Maybe it should be different now.  However, whether it should be subject to appeal or not, I would be as satisfied if it were normal and reasonable as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, and the Minister has been absolutely right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could have nearly written out the factors that will have to be taken into account.  I see that an existing borrower is going to be affected by this on the 5th April next and there is no question whatever of the person being able to repay it.  He has no cash.  He owns his house subject to a large loan.  He lives as narrowly as he can.  He draws a very small income from his company and he is <Col N="1278" /> going to be deemed to be subject to this as a distribution in the next 12 days.  It cannot be fair.  The man's name did not even enter my head until I looked at this section and I suddenly realised that he was affected and then it struck me that many other people may well be affected and may not know it.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to have this left to extra statutory concessions which we know are given, and let us face it, are generally given in response to pressures of pressure groups or an imitation of the UK practice or for some other reason that we have not been told.  Why do we not get a list of extra statutory concessions published such as is available in the United Kingdom?  That would be a great help to us if we knew that it was not in the section but that there was a practice of giving the concession.  If I am wrong in that, I would be glad to be corrected and I would be the first purchaser tomorrow morning of the publication in the Stationery Office.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we get rid of this idea that all is going to be well because the Revenue Commissioners are noble men, as they are, and I am not suggesting for one moment that they are not.  But one of the reasons for the nobility of the Revenue Commissioners is that they firmly face you with the proposition. Their duty is to exact tax in accordance with the provisions of the statute.  I have never had the basic reason for extra statutory concessions and so on formulated to me by our Revenue Commissioners but I am sure it is jolly good; it is in some way related to what is called policy. But it does mean that persons are not looked at because they are Mr. A and Sir J.  Their dedication to enforcing the statute is very important. I would like to have a section giving the full authority because they could be faced with a Government that did not want them to exercise that authority at some stage, and I would rather see the power vested in a body which has proven by past practice the concern to be objective and impartial between citizens who are taxpayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> I do not know what the Revenue Commissioners think of the revenue laws they are required to administer but I suspect that, looking through a lot of the provisions of this proposed law, they are very concerned, and the Minister ought to be concerned, too, about the impact which any variation in the proposals would have on the administrative ability of the Revenue Commissioners to deal with it. They should not shrink from taking on additional administrative duties merely if their shrinking from doing that is going to leave injustice done between persons.  This is very very important.  I do not want to call on the Minister to say anything more than he has already said regarding this.</P>

      <P>I am sure all the Senators, including those sitting opposite, would wish to join in this because it is of particular public importance that this should be recorded everywhere, that the trading companies are being relieved.  There is still, in relation to a period that is passing, a surtax provision prevailing but after the commencement period of this measure that will go and all trading companies can do what they like with their trading profits without any share of the surtax direction. They are only caught, as I understand it, for the surcharge in relation to what their rental and estate income is, how that relates to what they distribute.  If my understanding of that is correct, I am sure cheers would be audible, but they are not in order in the Seanad.  However, there should be cheers ringing out on behalf of the traders of this country for that, who should plough it back, get it used in business to generate further profitability and employment.  I want to say that; it is a most important and valuable decision and a very different decision from the one incorporated in the United Kingdom legislation.  Whether motivated by administrative reasons or any other reason, the decision is an excellent one in view of the reports and all we know about Irish corporations as being desirable and good.  Having said that, I do not want to confuse the issue.  Does the Minister or any other Senator wish to add anything further?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Purely for comprehension&mdash;and it is rather important&mdash;under section 101 is there any question, because of the definitions which arise in section 100 which we are enthusiastically debating, of a surcharge arising on the recipient, that is to say an Irish company which receives an export tax relieved dividend or a Shannon tax relieved dividend or even a patent tax relieved dividend?  In other words I should like to know if this surcharge is so framed and the definitions of investment income are such, and the formula applied to them is such that the surcharge cannot catch&mdash;as I think it does&mdash;the tax-free element resulting from the export sales relief.</P>

      <P>Up to now, there has been great stuff in the parts of the Bill which we have gone through so quickly on the assurances that they were restoring, restating and improving the English or the existing law, but now we are on something new to which there has been no reference at all unless we rush ahead to section 155 which, I imagine, will contain a definition of surcharge&mdash; strange to relate, it does not, but surcharge is bound to be somewhere; it would hardly be just in the side note. Yes, it is referred to here.  Say, for example, I had a company that took up all the shares in a company that started making tennis rackets for export to South Korea and did tremendous business.  The company had never paid any tax.  Now, I have gone into another business and am <Col N="1282" /> making cricket bats for sale on the home market, or perhaps guns or explosives, armaments under the European proposals for organising the armament industry, which I think should not be located here.  When we come to the distribution of the income of the company which invested in the tennis racket exports to Korea, does this mean that if it does not distribute as much as the income it received from the exports that it is caught for a 20 per cent surcharge? If so, it would be a departure from the previous Acts with regard to export tax-relieved companies, Shannon relieved companies.  It might involve the Government in obligations and in any case it would be entirely wrong.  The formula for treatment of investment income&mdash;I am almost surely wrong in my superficial reading of the section&mdash;is such that the dividend is tax-relieved because of the fact of that the source is totally tax-free it has been taken care of.  If it has not, something should be done about it.</P>

      <P>After that, there may be various creations for a variety of purposes.  I can see that difficulties can then arise depending upon the income sources of these other companies and the manner in which they distribute or retain income received by them.  We have a number of operations under old procedures which change once the procedures change.  I would expect that there would be different arrangements of companies and personal wealth holdings as a result of this Bill and other Acts which have recently been passed. It is wrong to try to create a new Bill to fit into every known legal business and financial entity.  That kind of thing is seldom possible; to the extent that we have tried to do it, it is an explanation for the length and complexity of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must, if one is introducing a new form of tax, try to deal with the fundamentals, <Col N="1283" /> leaving people to react to those once they are very clearly stated. I think they are very clearly stated in this Bill.  We will need some years of experience before we can say what adjustments are necessary to meet all the complex situations which may arise in the course of business arrangements following this legislation.  It would be wrong to try to adjust the legislation to fit every known arrangement which, in many cases, is no more than a reflection of laws which we are now changing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's statement as meaning that what I said was right and that the surcharge will affect the export tax-relieved dividend. I express the view now that it ought not to and that there is no experience required to change that.  That export tax relief will have been in existence for 20 years in October or November of this year.  There should be no means whereby people&mdash;and we are taking in a lot of Irish institutions that have invested in export tax relief situations; trading companies who have done so&mdash;are going to find that their distribution rule is going to be affected without regard to the fact that they bought these shares on the basis that they were going to be tax free, subject to whatever were the provisions applicable to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hate being a bore, but we have to be boring because we are introducing a whole new code in section 100.  We have to go on to section 188 and then begin the Schedules, which are the most interesting part of it; you can really &ldquo;get down to it&rdquo; on the Schedules.  The problem is posed by the introduction of the Bill on 27th November. The Minister wants to get it through.  It is important that there are a highly ethical group of characters in this country on whose advice people depend.  The Revenue Commissioners will be glad to hear that not one word I have uttered today will appear in any newspaper unless I have made some jocose description of the Revenue Commissioners or Senator Lenihan or Senator Yeats or Senator <Col N="1284" /> Brennan or the Leas-Chathaoirleach. They can relax.</P>
    <P>We are in the position that we have got to run the measure through, except for one section that must go.  I think the Minister will have been convinced of the necessity to get rid of a section that comes later and there will be no way of avoiding that.  The remainder of them could be amended in a subsequent Finance Bill.  I think everybody would recognise the Minister's exigencies.  This must be law before 5th April.  I do not think it was anybody's fault that it was not here earlier.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald overlooks the fact that no problem can arise if a trading company retains its trading profits.  That is the legitimate situation in which virtually all companies enjoying export sales relief are.  They are trading companies.  We are providing under section 101 special provisions in relation to the investment income or estate income of trading companies.  Later, we will deal with the non-distributed income of service companies. If income is retained by a trading company or if other income is distributed no problem can arise and that covers the overwhelming majority of cases.</P>

I do not think that my invitation to applaud was accepted by the other side.  I hope it will yet come.  This is a great improvement on the existing situation.  In principle, though, I think that the surcharge should be so expressed that the fact that the investment is being made in an export tax-relieved or a Shannon tax-relieved situation should be reflected in its language.  I know perfectly well nobody has the time to do that and get it through the Report Stage between now and 5th April.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 26, after &ldquo;excess&rdquo; to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;but if some or all of the said income cannot be distributed without prejudice to the requirements of the company's business (current, maintenance or development) then so much of the said income as is so required shall not be subject to surcharge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down this recommendation arising out of my contribution and Senator Eoin Ryan's contribution on Second Stage.  It deals with a very fundamental matter in that the effect of the section as it now stands is to put a surcharge of 20 per cent on close companies that are operating as trading companies in respect of their undistributed investment and estate income.  This is a manifestly disincentive measure.  We are talking about trading companies here, companies that are in business and in all cases other than the avoidance-type cases are retaining this income for the purpose of expansion, development and further employment.  How does the Minister expect a trading company to accumulate the necessary capital for future development unless it does so in this manner, by retaining and not distributing its income for a period of time until it has accumulated a sufficient investment for further expansion and development that can only be beneficial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section runs counter to a very basic principle in furthering commercial life and economic development of the community in that it discourages incorporations.  There is a bias against a group of people incorporating themselves in a trading company which is surely a matter that ought to be encouraged positively in <Col N="1286" /> legislation.  What I and my colleagues suggest in the recommendation is to add in section 101 following line 26, subsection (1):</P>
    <P>but if some or all of the said income cannot be distributed without prejudice to the requirements of the company's business (current maintenance or development) then so much of the said income as is so required shall not be subject to surcharge</P>
    <P>In effect, that means that retained, undistributed income required by the company's business for the &ldquo;current maintenance or development&rdquo; aspects of its business shall not be taken into account for surcharge purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister may improve on the drafting of that.  I do not want to get into a drafting argument. The principle is clear enough.  The principle is to eliminate any such beneficial and advantageous retention of income claimed by a trading company from the penal surcharge rate.</P>
    <P>I can understand the surcharge in regard to people who are using a close trading company for avoidance purposes.  I can understand it in the case of an investment company.  I am talking about the trading company that retains income for practical business purposes related to investment and development and expansion and further employment.  Nothing could be more straightforward than that.  I said on Second Stage that this is another example of what has crept into Finance legislation recently, another example of tilting the balance dangerously towards revenue requirements as against economic development requirements.  The essence of finance legislation is that a proper balance be maintained between what is required in the way of taxation for revenue purposes and what is required to stimulate the economy and maintain economic development.  Here is a penal surcharge designed to hit phoney trading companies for avoidance purposes. Here is a penal surcharge that is drafted on a crude basis in that in addition to rightly capturing the avoidance type of a trading company it also captures in the net the legitimate trading company that is <Col N="1287" /> retaining investment and estate income for the purpose of building up a reserve to engage in capital development for expansion of the company or firm.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about parallel developments in the United Kingdom heretofore.  Here, precisely, is an area where the United Kingdom has far more realistic legislation.  I refer to the Finance Act in the United Kingdom of 1972.  I refer in particular to Schedule 16 of that Act and section 8 of Schedule 16 which is dealing with the determination of relevant income.  Relevant income in this case is the income of a trading company and, dealing with the situation arising where the State income and the investment income&mdash;the relevant income as the British Act calls it&mdash;the relevant income, is not distributed but is retained for the purposes mentioned, for the expansion and development of the company.  What is proposed in Schedule 16, section 8 is precisely what we are seeking to secure in this amendment, that is to remove from surcharge that element of the retained income that is required for the company's business, current maintenance or development.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in regard to a point made by Senator FitzGerald, mentioned that it was not the Revenue Commissioners' job to make value judgments in making an assessment. The British Revenue Commissioners do not appear to exclude themselves from making such a rational judgment when it comes down to determining whether or not the retained income of the kind mentioned is legitimate or illegitimate.  As far as our Revenue Commissioners are concerned, as the section stands the legitimate retention and the illegitimate retention of income on the part of trading companies are regarded in the same light.  The British in their Act of 1972 have shown a far more enlightened attitude.  I quote from their Schedule 16, section 8, subsection (2):</P>
    <P>In arriving at the relevant income for any accounting period</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> (a)  where under sub-paragraph (1) above,</P>
    <P>that is relating to retained income by credit companies</P>
    <P>regard is to be had to the requirements of a company's business, regard shall be had not only to the current requirements of the business but also to such other requirements that may be necessary or advisable for the maintenance and development of that business but for this purpose the provisions of paragraph 12 below shall apply.</P>
    <P>(b)  the amount of the estate or trading income shall be taken as the amount included in respect of it in the distributable income.</P>
    <P>That, in effect, means that regard is to be had by the British Revenue Commissioners to the requirements of a company's business, not only to the current requirements but also to such other requirements as may be necessary or advisable for the maintenance and development of that business. The Revenue Commissioners are obliged in the United Kingdom under the Finance Act, 1972, to take these criteria into account.  These are precisely the criteria that we have written into our recommendation asking our Revenue Commissioners to take into account the requirements of the company's business, current, maintenance or development in coming to the extent of the non-distributed income which will be liable for surcharge. The purpose of the Schedule to the British Act is achieved by our amendment or, possibly, could be better achieved by an amendment drafted by the Minister's advisers, of preventing the surcharge from being imposed on the income of a legitimate trading company, claimed legitimately by that company, not for avoidance purposes but for the beneficial economic purposes of the development and expansion of that company.</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks closely at this matter and at the relevant sections of the British Act of 1972 he will see that improvement can be made by adopting this approach.  It certainly makes sense in our present economic circumstances <Col N="1289" /> that we should lean towards the encouragement of a trading company adopting such an attitude towards this retained income.  It would seem to me to be a logical type of incentive to write into this section.  It would certainly appear to be sensible not to lump the tax avoidance trading company with the legitimate trading company.  It would seem, on its most elementary basis, very wise not to lump these two together and give them the same treatment right across the board as is suggested under the section as it now stands.</P>
    <P>Some attempt should be made to differentiate between the trading company that is there for the purpose of avoiding tax and the trading company which is there for legitimate business reasons.  If it involves the Revenue in a little more work in coming to certain judgments as to whether the income is being retained for business requirements, that is a very excellent exercise for the revenue Commissioners in arriving at just such a judgment as to whether a company are making a contribution in the sense of retaining income for legitimate business purposes.</P>

      <P>I can now understand why Senator Lenihan and his colleagues did not join with me in applause of the section which was proposed and which we discussed in the debate on the previous section.  I think it is a very good trade-off for Irish companies to get freedom from section 530 of the Income Tax Act as amended by other Acts.  I know that there probably has been a loss of revenue, as estimated in the 1972 white paper with the yellow cover, called the Yellow Paper, as being half a million. It was probably considerably more. On Second Reading I mentioned some technical defects in the section that were known to me and there are many more known to the Revenue, I am quite sure.  I think a trade-off of this kind is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Senator Lenihan and his colleagues will not think I am ungenerous in my response to this recommendation because they have been sympathetic to <Col N="1290" /> some of the points I have been making. From what I hear of the UK provisions in the Spouses and Childrens Bill, there are people talking about the bishops provision for justices with misshapen provision for justices with mis-shapen feet, like the Lord Chancellor whose decisions depended on the length of his foot, coming into every houseshold.  I have my own considerable doubts about that.  It is a section of which I happen to have taken a copy.  As it is to be operated in the United Kingdom it means that in very many cases it depends on the power of advocacy of your auditor and the quality of mind of your inspector as to what you get away with.  It seems to me we have in this section a very reasonable and easily operable provision to deal with trading companies in general.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about the vast majority of companies.  If that burden of administration was lifted, there is a system which is an easy formula, taking one year with another, which companies can conform with, it is not too much of a burden to get rid of this over-hanging thing which is in section 130 to which I refer.  There are two types of costs involved.  First of all there is the question of what did you pay the professional gents who advised you to organise your affairs in this way so that you did not come under the Act.  What did you pay in taxation to pay the Revenue Commissioners' staff who were doing the business, or were not doing much of the business, if I understand the situation here, because of the technical effects of section 530.  They were using, understandably, a kind of blackmailing tactics.  They knew that these people were avoiding distribution and they threatened surtax directions.</P>
    <P>There were all sorts of ways of stopping them being used and they being wise men did not go on.  I imagine they lost their heart in the section.  In the UK we just have this applicable to all trading companies. There is a considerable burden in the cost of administration involved in this.  If we were to pay all the Revenue Commissioners special sums, which I do not think we ought to, a <Col N="1291" /> secret service fund for the Revenue Commissioners to go off to all these management conferences and tax institute meetings and find out what are the facts, that would be a terrific help, but that would merely inform them on legislation.  It seems to be one of the points which Senators were thinking about when tabling this recommendation.  I would not be in favour of this.</P>
    <P>I do not propose any recommendation to this section.  I do not hesitate to disagree with Senator Halligan from time to time but I might be inclined to recommend something on the lines of his idea of differentiating in some way between money put into some scheme which would relate to a cyclical situation which would make money available immediately through the Central Bank to the Government and which would be drawable when slump situations arose.  This he said was a Swedish thing.  I have never been to Sweden anyway and I do not see what inspiration we could get from there with the suicide rate and the divorce rate there.</P>
    <P>I would oppose this recommendation but would go on to give notice to the Minister that unless he proposes an entirely different kettle of fish and withdraw&mdash;which would, indeed, be the sensible thing to do&mdash;section 162 and reintroduce something to deal with any abuse that has not already been cleared by close company provisions in the Capital Gains Tax Act, I would recommend some alternative to this section, the very minimum which would leave contented the very responsible people in a large number of responsible firms.  I would suggest the adoption of something like this recommendation, and as far as I can read it it is a very well drafted proposal. Let me compliment Senators Eoin Ryan and Lenihan.</P>
    <P>There is a difference in talking about administrative costs when talking about 10,000 and 50,000 companies, or whatever the numbers may be.  One particular operation could be done by one or two men whereas dealing with all the trading companies would be a <Col N="1292" /> terrific organisational operation.  I should have thought that what we are proposing is better than what we have. There is a difference between Irish and British circumstances.  There is a different test altogether and the administrative cost in the other place will be very different because here it will be a small number of companies, perhaps so small that the administrative costs to the taxpayers could be small, and in relation to taxation I cannot emphasise the importance of this.</P>
    <P>I remember General Seán Mac Eoin saying years ago when talking about employment, &ldquo;Of course we could increase employment enormously if we put a subsidy on the people who would engage in the robbing of banks&rdquo;.  It is not the sole test.  What are they doing?  What is the benefit to the community of their operations?  The benefit to the community has to be borne in mind later by the Minister when he comes to look at another section.  On this one I would be against this change recommended because of what I am told is the situation.  The Senators correctly describe the law as it is in England as an everhanging problem all the time for companies there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as descriptions have been given by Senators, they are not unfair, but there has been one very significant omission from these descriptions and that is that whereas British legislation has a provision somewhat on the lines of the recommendation, it has no system of surcharge such as we are proposing, which will impose a tax of no more than 60 per cent, which is the limit of the tax on the non-distributed profits.  In Britain they have apportionment provisions which means that you look right through every company situation to see who is the ultimate beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the kind of cases which we have in mind here, the rate of tax would be well in excess of 60 per cent.  It could be up to 77 per cent.  Fair enough, one might be disposed to consider the recommendation if the apportionment provisions were brought in as well, which would expose people to the full whack of tax right through to 77 per cent.  I notice that is not proposed. <Col N="1293" /> What is requested is that the benefits of the surcharge provision, which imposes tax at 60 per cent, be retained but that the advantage to taxpayers under the British system be also introduced. That is wanting to have your cake and eat it at the same time.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the recommendation as I understand it is to secure that any distributable investments or estate income of a close company which can be shown to be required for the maintenance or development of a company's business will be excluded from the scope of the surcharge provided for the section.  The reference in the recommendation to the company's business would include the business of a company which is not a trading company and whose income consists wholly of investment and/or estate income.  It would also cover the investment and estate business of a trading company which has investment or estate income.</P>
    <P>The recommendation states that if it can be shown that part of a company's income is required for the maintenance or development of its business, any balance shall be distributed and if that balance is withheld from distribution that circumstances should not prevent it from being treated for tax purposes as if it were distributed.  It is, therefore, implicit in the recommendation that a system of appointment should be introduced to cater for the case where all or part of a company's income is withheld from distribution and the income so withheld is not required for the purpose of the company's business.  If section 101 were to be amended in the manner suggested, a corresponding amendment of section 162 and the introduction of apportionment provisions as respects income withheld from distribution and not required for a service company's business would logically and inevitably be forced to be inserted as necessary in section 162.</P>
    <P>I would recall to Senators paragraph 96 of the second White Paper on Company Taxation which was published in March, 1974, stating that the surcharge on close companies was proposed because it would have the advantage of countering tax avoidance <Col N="1294" /> by the retention of investment income without the necessity for the very complex legislation which would be required if the retentions were to be apportioned to shareholders so as to impose income tax on the retentions at the rates appropriate to the income level of the shareholders.  It should be noted&mdash;and it cannot be sufficiently emphasised&mdash;that the surcharge does not extend to the trading income of a close company.  Senator FitzGerald has recognised this and has regarded this as a very worthy provision.  The criticisms of sections 101 and 162 appear to indicate that a more refined instrument than the surcharge for taxing undue accumulation of income by close companies should be provided.  At least that is how I understand the arguments advanced here and in the representations which I have received.  If this is so, the only logical alternative would be the introduction of apportionment provisions applicable to all close companies, including companies which are trading companies.  That is the position in Britain which is not what we have proposed here.</P>
    <P>If these provisions were to follow the lines of the corresponding United Kingdom legislation the need in the case of a trading company to retain trading profits for the maintenance or development of its business would have to be taken into account, and subject to this the distributable income would, broadly speaking, be taken to be 50 per cent of the after tax estate or trading income and the whole of the after tax investment income.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I can understand and to some extent sympathise with the arguments advanced behind the recommendation, but it simply could not be taken and blended with the proposals being made in this Bill.  We would have to handle the Bill differently.  We would have to introduce apportionment provisions and we would have to have a closer look at retained profits of trading companies other than what they might have undistributed from investment and estate income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> I thought that the way we were approaching it was a better one.  I thought it was a reasonable way of handling it because it gave advantages to companies which certainly one needed to encourage to retain profits for further development and for expansion of trade and manufacture.  I have already expressed in the other House and at meetings I have had the privilege of having with people making representations in this matter that I was anxious to allow as a firm solution to the problem but others would have to accept that if we are to find some reasonable solution to all that has been urged, there will have to be a little give and take.  People cannot just be asking for additional benefits, taking all the advantages for the taxpayers which arise under the British legislation and asking that we retain in the Bill all the advantages that we have for the taxpayer in our Bill which are not contained in the legislation which is so liberally quoted from another shore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in so far as his brief related to the section that we are now discussing but I judge, rightly or wrongly, that this is the better system than the alternative which is in Britain, which is costly all round, to the Revenue, to the advisers, to the taxpayers.  When we are talking about the best interests and that people must make concessions, I hope the Minister is not thinking that anybody in this House is receiving some enormous fee for putting a case on behalf of anybody.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senators Yeats, Lenihan, Russell, Garrett or anybody else in the House is here to try to produce the best legislation that can be got in the circumstances we are in.  If we make proposals here and there it is not a trading-off business.  We are trying to get what is best for the situation.  I happen to think that the Minister has got the best for this particular situation. <Col N="1296" /> I do not shrink, in other circumstances for other types of companies, from apportionment provisions.  I do not think that the Minister mentioned section 162 but I mentioned it.</P>
      <P>For any of the persons concerned, because of mistaken public policy of treating professional people as if, because certain people have done what they were perfectly legally entitled to do and were advised to do so to provide for their families, it should have been headlined in the <i>Irish Independent</i> as if they were some sort of monsters. All they were trying to do was to provide for their families.  They have no superannuation and their opportunities to provide superannuation is damned limited by past legislation.  I am not joining in that sad attack on these people.  They did what they were entitled to do and they are not able to do it any more and that is closed off. But when we get to section 162 we will be dealing with a small number of people and in principle it is wrong in any way to these people of character and people who are subject to obligations as to performance that they can be struck off the rolls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a debate here yesterday about the consequences to certain people of going a course&mdash;other than the one the Minister proposes to go incidentally&mdash;and ended their careers. There are many people at the beginning of their careers who are caught doing the sort of things that get them struck off the rolls and off some of the registers that we are on.  In damn principle I object to any of the people on these registers being put into a position where they will get discriminatory taxation.  I am interested in its effect on the country and the attitude to people.  There is no capital, there is no large estate, there is no seedling growing in 60 years into timber.  In 60 years that timber would produce something remarkable, and where is the provision for it in our tax legislation? How could I or Senator Russell provide pensions for ourselves?  We cannot do it and there is no legislation there to enable us to do it.  If people find themselves in these situations, they should be encouraged to make as much money as they can and <Col N="1297" /> some regard should be had to their past.  There is a professional firm in this city at the moment that is being sued for £2½ million.  There is no Revenue Commissioner or any Minister in that position.  These are risks we must take.  I want to oppose Senator Lenihan's recommendation and to reprove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator FitzGerald when he said that the point of view he expresses on the recommendation is relevant also to section 162. I propose to agree with him on section 162 because I believe the surcharge is a disincentive and an unjust surcharge as it is in this case <i>vis-à-vis bona fide</i> trading companies.  My information about Britain&mdash;and it can be verified&mdash;is that <i>bona fide</i> trading companies in the United Kingdom since the operation of the 1972 Act to which I referred, in practice find themselves relieved of surcharge in regard to income retained for business purposes. It works out in practice.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this is linked in with apportionment provisions and that makes it fully effective. I put down the recommendation so that we could have some light on this matter.  It is one with which a future Finance measure will have to deal.  It is obviously undesirable that <i>bona fide</i> trading companies should be regarded in the same penal light as relates to tax avoidance.  The two should not be regarded in the section in the same way.  At some future date the Minister will have to make an effort, with apportionment provisions to make it effective, to draw the legitimate distinction and remove the surcharge from being a penal imposition on <i>bona fide</i> trading companies retaining funds for purposes of development and expansion.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I withdraw the recommendation and I will join battle with Senator FitzGerald on section 162, when we will adumbrate the same point of view.</P>

      <P>I have a query arising because of not really understanding the words in brackets in (b) of subsection (2).  First of all, you have &ldquo;...a company is to be treated as another's &lsquo;associated company&rsquo; at a given time...&rdquo;&mdash;That has got all sorts of implications&mdash;&ldquo;...if, at that time or at any time within one year previously....&rdquo;  I presume that is one calendar year under the Interpretation Act or is it a financial year?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We would not, to avoid confusion, say within 12 months previously.  There are all sorts of periods.  There is the nine months in the financial year 1975 and there are 12 months for all the other accounting periods which have to be apportioned. One of the great recommendations of the White Paper was that we would get rid of apportionment if we had a single tax, but we are going to be apportioned to the end of our lives apparently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any rate, while the Minister is thinking about that, what does &ldquo;that time&rdquo; mean?  Does it mean at a given time?  That is when the question of association arises.  Section 102 (1) <Col N="1299" /> reads: &ldquo;... at that time or at any time within one year previously, one of the two has control of the other, or both are under the control of the same person or persons.&rdquo;  Then we have to go on to &ldquo;control&rdquo;.  Is &ldquo;control&rdquo; for the purposes of this part only?</P>
    <P>You have to be very witty to keep up with the lot of you.  This is only related to close companies and has implications that a lot have escaped either the Revenue or some other people.  Subsection (2) reads: &ldquo;... a person shall be taken to have control of a company if he exercises, or is able to exercise or is entitled to acquire, control....&rdquo;  Acquire what?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Acquire control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a comma after &ldquo;acquire&rdquo;.  The comma must go in.  The printer has to do something with that.  He must not put a comma after &ldquo;acquire&rdquo;.  I have to look to the Leas-Chathaoirleach to give us a ruling on this.  But I think the comma after &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; must go. Even if we only got a comma out of this it would be no harm.  After &ldquo;control,&rdquo; it reads: &ldquo;whether direct or indirect, over the company's affairs, ...&rdquo; What does &ldquo;company's affairs,&rdquo; mean?  Is that defined anywhere? Who has control of a company's affairs?  Is it the shareholders who have control?  Is it the directors? They are allowed do some things and not others.  They can all be booted out in the morning.  Who else has control of the company's affairs?  It goes on: &ldquo;but without prejudice to the generality of the preceding words&rdquo; which are so general, &ldquo;if he possesses or is entitled to acquire&mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;I agree with the dash after acquire&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the greater part of the share capital or issued share capital of the company or of the voting power in the company;</P>
      <P>Does that mean at any time?</P>

That is an option but, of course&mdash;and this is a hopeful thought&mdash;we could so organise it that he would not be entitled in law to <Col N="1300" /> acquire it.  I presume he would have to be entitled in law to acquire it. Subsection (2) (b) reads: &ldquo;such part of issued share capital of the company as would, if the whole of the income of the company were in fact distributed among the participators ... entitle him to receive the greater part of the amounts so distributed&rdquo;.  He is not entitled to escape from the position of being a controller by saying: &ldquo;Look I am entitled to 51 per cent of that but I do not want it.  Give it to my maiden aunt.&rdquo;  Does it refer to his present entitlement?  We are trying to do here today in a very short period of time what the Companies Act Committee did over a long period of time. I do not know whether the Minister was on the Companies Act Committee, but that went on, I think, for a few years.</P>

Does &ldquo;entitle him to receive the greater part of the amount so distributed&rdquo; mean that, one way or another, having regard to all the kinds of shares there are in any year, he is the person who is entitled to get the most of it?  He is regarded as the controller.  Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come back to things that I could not understand.  Does &ldquo;without regard to any rights which he or any other person has as a loan creditor ...&rdquo; mean that he is prevented from becoming a controller of the company under the section by creating such rights as would reduce his entitlement to less than the greater part?  Does that mean any rights which he or any other person has as a loan creditor?  Why has it to be described?  The rights of the loan creditor will presumably have to be taken into account before the distribution is made, whether it is he or anybody else.</P>

There is a reference here to &ldquo;any loan creditor to the company&rdquo;.  The participator is a loan creditor.  He is a participator under that but he is not a controller of the company under section 102. Subsection (1) (c) states:</P>

    <P>Then you have to go back to the beginning of Part X, Close Companies:</P>
    <P>requiring a participator in one company to be treated as being also a participator in another company.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  We go back to subsection (1):</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Part, a &ldquo;participator&rdquo; is, in relation to any company, a person having a share or interest in the capital or income of the company....</P>
    <P>Let us say it is a shareholder, an option holder, a loan creditor, somebody who has a right to get at the income in the future or who has arrangement to get the right.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>The provisions of subsection (1) are without prejudice to any particular provision of this Part requiring a participator in one company to be treated as being also a participator in another company.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell the House what is the particular provision of this Part?  This seems to go beyond the section.  It seems to suggest that there is some other section in this Part which contains 11 sections.  Therefore, if the Minister could find it in any one of the sections, would he say where it is?  Does this mean that in another section somebody is treated as a participator in another company because he participates in one company, that the fact that he is a participator under subsection (1) does not prevent him from being a participator because of the operation of the other section?</P>

      <P>I take it that, if companies are associated, it is a different proposition and concept from an &ldquo;associate&rdquo; or a &ldquo;participator&rdquo;? When we are discussing subsection (2) of section 103, bringing in participators in an associated company under section 102, it is different from the definitions of&mdash;we should go back; can we dispense with Standing Orders to go back on the entire list?</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Part &ldquo;associate&rdquo; means in relation to a participator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Does that mean if I, for example, Alexis FitzGerald, have 5 per cent of a company, or 4 per cent, and my partner, or a relative who will be defined somewhere else, being a wife or a lineal descendant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not contest that for one moment.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) (b) reads:</P>
      <P>the trustee or trustees of any settlement in relation to which the participator is,</P>
      <P>We had better look at this very closely.</P>
      <P>or any relative of his (living or dead) is or was, a settlor...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot have a dead participator, but the read relative can make you a participator.  I think an awful lot of this has to be looked at very closely again in relation to Irish family companies. Maybe there is a desperate lot of tax avoidance going on that we have to capture.  The simplest way is to cut off that 27 per cent, reduce it 15 per cent and clear up nine-tenths of this.  You get far better revenue.  You will be reducing the number of accountants <Col N="1305" /> and solicitors who have to devote their time to this kind of rot and everything would be freer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Settlement&rdquo; and &ldquo;settlor&rdquo; having the same meaning as in section 96 (3) (h) will be decided when we turn up section 96 (3) (h).  It has probably been amended by reference to Part IV of the 1968 Miscellaneous Provisions Act.  It all relates to profits or gains from dealing in and developing land.  We will have to get a large number of people together to put it all out so it can be read in one piece. These have different definitions.  They have been popping into other things. We have had trouble with them before.  Because of the definition of &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; and &ldquo;settlor&rdquo;, you are in trouble with regard to certain sections where you tried to curb what you choose to call &ldquo;tax avoidance&rdquo; and which I choose to call &ldquo;exploitance&rdquo; of tax incentives.  You are in trouble because you adopted the definitions which are relative to dealing with trading of land taken from what you conceal under section 96 (3) (h) as being the Finance Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1968.  Who would ever be able to guess that unless he had all the volumes?  In relation to our job we should be given some kind of an exercise allowance to keep control over all these.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Revenue Commissioners.  Look at what they have done for us.  Admittedly, we have got to employ people, pay them, and get surcharged while we are waiting for a return on their labours to file in the relevant service sections.  That is not being done for us by anybody else.  It is a desperate business as the Minister well knows.  With the Landlord and Tenant Act you have to keep one foot there and one hand there, and you are moving around from section to section.  It is a very difficult job.  Is there a beneficial exercise in it, do you think, so that we should get an allowance on our life policies from it?  I have dealt with all the section.  The Minister will never extend &ldquo;relative&rdquo; to include an illegitimate, I suppose?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Where did the Minister get the definition? Earlier the Minister told me where the definition of the 75 per cent subsidiary was to be found.  I failed to take note of what he said.  It is relevant to the question Senator Russell has asked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 156 has the provision about the 75 per cent subsidiary. The thinking behind the 75 per cent interest is that before group relief is given, it is very important that the entities between whom it can be exchanged are substantially the same persons because the company which would be surrendering, as it were, its entitlement to relief to another company and would be forfeiting something which it might be able to retain to its own benefit in future years.  Therefore, it is important that this group relief be available only within the group which is very significantly and substantially one and the same person or group of persons. If you brought it down to 50, then you could have quite a number of strangers enjoying the relief.  It could then operate to the disadvantage of minority shareholders in a company. Seventy-five per cent is a fair measure of the kind of common interest that ought to exist between companies sharing group relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has made the right decision on this.  I presume the draftsman has looked at the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in the Companies Act, 1963, which includes a whole lot of other situations, and has also looked at the definition of &ldquo;subsidiary&rdquo; in the Northern Ireland Act, which contains another and a different set of provisions which might have a bearing if we are dealing with companies whose residences can be moved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am right.  There is confusion.  I said that section 115, which I was dealing with when I had a query from Senator Russell, would apply to loans irrespective of the date on which they originated.  If they were extant on the date of operation of this Bill they would come within the ambit of section 115.  But section 98 has to be looked at because they are the loans which have to arise after 5th April, 1976.  I should say that the material date is 27th November, 1975.  Section 98 subsection (8) says:</P>
      <P>Where on or after the 27th day of November, 1975, but not later than the 5th day of April, 1976, a close company makes any loan or advances any money to an individual who is a participator ... the company shall be deemed for the purposes of this section to have made the loan or advanced the money on the 6th day of April, 1976:</P>

      <P>Under section 8 if the loan was made on or after 27th November, 1975 that one is caught unless it is repaid.  Loans that were made before the 27th November are not.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>This section is designed to prevent abuse of group relief where, for example, because a parent company cannot, by reason of insufficiency of profits, benefit from capital allowances or losses of a subsidiary, it transfers the subsidiary to another group in a position to benefit by way of group relief from the subsidiary's losses, and so on. When the subsidiary's losses have been stripped it reverts to the original group.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have completed the group relief section and are moving into the capital gains area. <Col N="1316" /> Section 126 gives the Revenue right to recover tax from a person who is connected with a company which has made a chargeable gain but the company has not paid tax on the gain within six months of the due date, and the company makes to that person a capital distribution, other than one representing a reduction of capital, which derives from or consists of the disposal of assets on which the chargeable gain accrued to the company.  There cannot be much dispute about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When we have a capital distribution under section 126 there is special treatment of it.  That treatment is to be discovered by reference to the position of a person connected with a company who receives on or after 6th April, 1976, any capital distribution from the company, other than a capital distribution representing a reduction of capital, and the capital so distributed derives from the disposal after the 5th April, 1976, of assets in respect of which a chargeable gain accrues to the company or the distribution constitutes such disposal of assets.  It simply says what the section is applied to.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>If the corporation tax assessed on the company for the accounting period in which the chargeable gain accrues included any amount in respect of chargeable gains, and any of the tax assessed on the company for that period is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the company, the said person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is the chap who got the distribution</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;may by an assessment made within two years from that date be assessed and charged (in the name of the company) to an amount of that corporation tax&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  not exceeding the amount or value of the capital distribution which that person has received or became entitled to receive; and</P>
      <P>(b)  not exceeding a proportion equal to that person's share of the capital distribution made by the company of corporation tax on the amount and at the rate charged in respect of that gain in the assessment in which the said tax was charged.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>A person paying any amount of tax under this section shall be entitled to recover a sum equal to that amount from the company.</P>
      <P>He has probably gone for his cup of tea at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> Subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section are without prejudice to any liability of the person receiving or becoming entitled to receive the capital distribution in respect of a chargeable gain accruing to him by reference to the capital distribution as constituting a disposal of an interest in shares in the company.</P>
    <P>That is a very special provision for the capital distribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, but it is a very necessary one, otherwise the tax would be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not against the section, but it clearly relates to assets in respect of a chargeable gain accruing to a company which is obviously out of capital gains tax.  It sends one back to that concern already evinced for a capital dividend under section 84, which would seem to bring the recipient, connected or not connected, into the tax treatment whether the chargeable gain had ever arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 84 the distribution would be received as income in the hands of the recipient out of the company's capital profits. Therefore, it will be taxed at the income rate appropriate to the recipient. The distribution referred to in section 126 is one which is not regarded as income in the hands of the recipient&mdash;for example, a distribution on a winding-up.</P>
