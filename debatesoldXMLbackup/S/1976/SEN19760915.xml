      <P>This is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity to address this chamber, and it is rather sad in a way that someone has to speak in this country at this time to a Bill of this kind.  It has certainly been for me a baptism of fire and a very sharp reminder that democracy is not something that can be easily taken for granted.  It is not something that is ours by right or by some automatic self-continuing process, something that does not need constant vigilance and constant attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very wary of this package of legislation that has been offered to <Col N="340" /> this House and to this country.  I am very wary, not because I do not trust the Government which has come to us to implement it or is seeking these powers, not because I do not trust my own party and the party with whom we are in Government on their <i>bona fide</i> concern with rooting out what they consider to be the causes of the emergency, but because it opens up for us a way of dealing with elements in our society who manifest themselves as being violent which is counter to the whole democratic tradition that many of us have fought long and hard to achieve in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of concern in this country about the implications of this legislation, about the possibility that if it is introduced now it might readily be extended at some date in the future to cover other kinds of subversives.  A lot of concern has been expressed directly to me that the people charged with enforcing this legislation, under considerable provocation as we know they have been in the past, will be subject to suspicion and abuse that will do them no credit and will make the task of maintaining democracy in this country all the more difficult.  I say these words not lightly and not without care and consideration; but I feel that I am voicing the concern and alarm of a large number of people who by no manner of means could be identified with supporting what have come to be described as the men of violence, either from the Provisional IRA, the UDA or any of the other illegal and undemocratic organisations.  The most recent voice that has been added to express criticism rather than withdrawal of support or opposition has come from the Glencree Reconciliation Centre, and the last thing they could ever be described as being is subversive.</P>
    <P>Having stated that, I want to go back to the opening speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in this House, Senator Lenihan, in which he queries the whole validity of the Government's attitude in coming to this House, seeking these powers and attempting to squash the idea that there was an emergency in this <Col N="341" /> country, attempting to put forward the idea that the Government had enough powers to deal with such emergency, saying that anyway it was a bit late in the day to be coming back now, and that basically it is a problem of incompetence on the part of the Government and not one of legislation.  Senator Lenihan said that, other than Greece, we were the only country seeking derogation from the European Convention on Human Rights on this matter and that our situation was somehow analagous to the Greek situation.  I had the opportunity to live in Greece for a year when the Colonels were in power.  I had the opportunity to sit on a balcony with someone one night and that person coldly and calmly told me that he never told his wife what his political views were because by doing that he would ensure that they&mdash;the Colonels&mdash;would never be able to extract it from her.  By &ldquo;extract&rdquo; I mean the aside that Senator Alexis FitzGerald referred to yesterday of lifting toe-nails and all.</P>
    <P>I know Senator Lenihan was making a point by exaggerating it, but it is untrue and damaging to this democracy even to suggest by implication that we have reached by the remotest path that kind of situation.  We have a democracy in this country and we will retain it.  The question in the future is: can we and have we the courage to defend democracy without giving the ultimate victory to the terrorists by resorting to counter-terrorism?  I believe there is an emergency.  I believe that that emergency has been here since 1969, that it has exploded and erupted in the Northern part of this country and that it has subsequently had an extraordinary effect upon our domestic politics in the South and indeed on our political parties and our political history in the recent past.  Senator Lenihan and the Fianna Fáil Party must be very well aware of this.  That emergency effectively destroyed the last Fianna Fáil Administration, disrupting them in mid-stream and contributing in no uncertain way to their ultimate defeat.</P>
    <P>I suppose that emergency convinced members of the Labour Party that an <Col N="342" /> alternative Government was necessary in order to provide a democratic alternative in the face of what was then and is now an armed conspiracy against the democratic assemblies of this State by people who insist that they have a mandate from somewhere, from the grave or from some tradition which they claim exclusively to be their own and which they refuse at all times and consistently to have tested at the ballot-box by the people.</P>
    <P>The republican tradition is a very fine and honourable one in this country.  It does not belong exclusively to any political party, although many have attempted to claim it as their own.  It belongs to an attitude of mind and to many people in different political parties and they are represented in all three parties in this House who feel that the problems confronting our society require radical and fundamental solutions.  The vast majority of the people who inherit that tradition &mdash;and I count myself among them&mdash; have at all times validated that tradition by constantly going back to the ballot-box and saying &ldquo;This is what we want to do; do we have a mandate to do it?&rdquo;  We run the risk of allowing people who describe themselves as republicans and as being in the mainstream of the inheritance of the republican tradition to villify completely and to destroy that tradition so that our children in the future will want to disown what for me is a critical and important part of the history of this country.</P>
    <P>I am part of that tradition and proud of it, and in my knowledge I have no recollection of people being knee-capped as part of the republican tradition.  I am not aware that assassinations and murders of innocent workers who happen to be in the way is part of that republican tradition.  I am not aware of tarring and feathering, of constant refusals to go before the public as part of that republican tradition.</P>
    <P>It is one of the great tragedies of the current emergency that, in order to distance ourselves from the men of violence in the Provisional IRA and in the UDA, but particularly the Provisional IRA, we appear to throw out <Col N="343" /> the baby with the bath water.  I would suggest to those people who are keen on analysing history in that fashion that such a tendency denies a part of our history which is rooted in democracy and which has brought to this chamber a constant tradition of democratic radicalism without which this State would be very much the poorer.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage I do not propose to discuss in detail the provisions of this Emergency Powers Bill, with which I am very unhappy.  I know the Minister himself has received deputations and has heard arguments regarding these provisions.  I would propose at that stage to make explicit the reservations I have, particularly on section 2 (3) which refers to the detention over seven days and the form of access that will be open to people who are so detained.</P>
    <P>We should look at the background against which this emergency legislation was brought in.  Senator Lenihan again suggested that it was some kind of political gimmick, that somehow or other this was one way in which the Coalition Government might cover up their actions in other areas by producing this post-summer smokescreen.  I do not think a situation which since 1970 has effectively destroyed the Fianna Fáil Party to the extent that we now have two Fianna Fáil parties in the other House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add that this House is much the richer for that duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that that emergency not only has had disastrous effects, which are self-evident, for the members of Fianna Fáil but it has had disastrous effects for the people of this State who wish to see the Government of the day, irrespective of their political complexion, exercising their time and energies in resolving or attempting to resolve problems which confront us as a people.  The fact that since the present Government have come into office approximately 40 per cent of <Col N="344" /> their Cabinet time, as far as I can assess, has been devoted to issues related to either security or to the North has been one horrible symbol of the victory that terrorism has had over the southern part of the island in that they have forced the elected Executive of a democratic assembly to devote a disproportionate amount of their time in attempting to come up with a range of measures that will ensure that democracy can continue.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Robinson, made a very fine speech yesterday. Unfortunately much of this debate tends to be a lawyers' debate and I am not going to even attempt to follow the Senator on it.  She argued that the Government had not made an adequate case for the bringing in of these emergency powers from the point of view of law and that the implications in legal terms of these powers were enormous.  I would accept generally the Senator's legal analysis of that statement, largely because I trust her judgment, and frankly I am not capable of following the intricacies of the legal argument. However, I put to all the lawyers of this House that the reaction that I have had over the last two weeks from consistently talking to ordinary people has been somewhat as follows: they are uneasy about the implications as they understand them, such as they can read from the newspapers. They trust basically the Government's attempts to do something about the situation and they reluctantly, but consistently, say any measure or any package of measures that might go some way to solving this problem, even without a guarantee of success, is worth a try.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said consistently that the major new power in this Bill, the extension of detention from 48 hours to seven days, has been sought by the Garda and that he has reason to believe that he should support this request.  It comes back again in this instance to the Minister trusting the judgment of the law enforcement agency and to the Members of this side of the House trusting their own Minister.  I am the sort of person who believes a passenger in a car is allowed to give some kind of discretion <Col N="345" /> to a driver when they are driving.  I am very much aware of the dangers of back-seat driving, but the journey does not go on interminably. The fact that this Bill is not itself going to go on interminably, that it has to be renewed by order of the Government, allows us to look at these measures for a certain length of time and have them reviewed when appropriate.</P>
    <P>The various bodies that have objected in principle to the details of much of this legislation are bodies who, in all of their preambles, have stated that it is the right and the necessity of a democracy to defend itself.  Therefore, what we are concerned with here are the details and the implications of the legislation rather than the principle of it.  This is my reading of the situation.  I would like this House and the Minister to be very clear that what we describe today as subversive is rather clear in many people's minds; it refers to the obvious enemy with the bomb in Grafton Street and Nassau Street; the obvious enemy with the assassin's bullet who is declaredly against this State.</P>
    <P>This and the accompanying legislation we will have, presumably in a couple of days time, will remain on the Statute Book possibly long after the time in which, hopefully, the present troubles in the North subside.  There are undoubtedly people in this House who feel that anybody who challenges the established order of our society is in some way subversive, and that if they take action by way of demonstration or riot or picket or any other fashion they may be violently subversive. I am very apprehensive that in the next five to ten years the combination of population growth, the continued failure of our mixed economy to provide the level of employment we require for our population, the reality that emigration, as the great safety valve for conservative Ireland has now finally disappeared&mdash;all these social pressures are going to create the sort of tensions that in many other societies have produced social violence.</P>
    <P>If we have within society people who want to capitulate and to use that social violence for their own ends then <Col N="346" /> we are heading into a situation in the next ten years when we are going to have many situations where people could be described as being subversive because they wanted, for example, to question the basic right to private property in many parts of our society.</P>
    <P>As a member of Dublin City Corporation&mdash;I think the only member in this House&mdash;I am constantly confronted with the reality that the level of physical violence in the streets is rising each year.  That has nothing to do with the unfortunate problems in the North.  In other cities which are undergoing the kind of change and transition that Dublin is undergoing and that have, somehow or other, progressed longer along that process than Dublin has the level of urban violence and depravity is very high.  The ingredients that created that level in those cities are exactly present and mirrored in our own society.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the great danger in this kind of response to a problem is that the basic value of democracy in resolving problems and effecting change by discussion, negotiation and compromise, is going to be set aside in what could very well be the greatest monument to the terrorist in that they would divert the whole course of a democratic tradition over to solutions which were themselves repressive, themselves resorting to terror rather than negotiation, resorting to detention, imprisonment and other forms of physical intimidation rather than effective social changes, effective legislation regarding social reform.  If this legislation goes through in the way in which it is designed at present without very explicit instructions from the Government regarding the operation of the legislation, without the establishment of an independent complaints commission for the people at large in our society regarding the function of the law enforcement agencies, we run the very serious risk of alienating a substantial section of our people who today are either unemployed, poor, badly housed or uneducated, not because they choose to be so but because this society has consistently and constantly failed to provide them with the <Col N="347" /> basic human rights which are enshrined in the Charter of Human Rights in the United Nations.  Not only that, but this society and both Houses of the Oireachtas have consistently refused to implement the kind of radical social legislation that is necessary to effect democratically and peacefully a transition from the rural, poor agricultural society that we were to the mixed urban, rural and industrial society to which we all appear to aspire.  There is a gap and a lack of will in both Houses to respond with the democratic tools and implements which we have to create the kind of legislation that we need. If that gap continues and widens and if our response to problems is to batten down the hatches and flood the place with police or whatever, I fear very much for the future of democracy in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M.D. Higgins Mr. M.D. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say last evening I was encouraged by the tone of the speech of the Leader of this House, Senator Michael J. O'Higgins, in his willingness to draw distinctions between different kinds of criticism and opposition to the two pieces of legislation which have come before us.  He drew a distinction between those who criticised because they want no restraint placed on people who are involved in violence, who invoke republican aims for acts of violence, the opposition of those who oppose because they had brought in repressive legislation, and the position of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He then had a residual category: the civil libertarians&mdash;a term which has been affording Senator Alexis FitzGerald great amusement for at least a fortnight.  Above all else, Senator FitzGerald is a man who is consistent, as we must acknowledge, so the term will probably amuse him in the future.  In his treatment of the civil libertarian category Senator O'Higgins was extremely fair and sensitive.  He allowed that there was indeed a basis for feeling concerned about the legislation which was positively different from the other kind of criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, it is one of the disquieting things about the debate so <Col N="348" /> far, particularly when people see the force of the civil liberties argument, that people are willing to concede its essential logic at one stage in their remarks and then proceed to disregard it altogether in another part.  Let me put this rather bluntly.  Civil rights in the latter part of Senator O'Higgins's remarks were regarded as something abstract&mdash;I will give his exact words in a moment&mdash;and legislation, on the other hand, was presented as something practical.  We were told that we are not living in a Utopia; that we are living in a real world of crime and violence, in a world in which we cannot be seen to be soft on issues of violence themselves which threaten democracy.</P>
    <P>The general assertion therefore is that the civil liberties argument concerning this legislation is somehow weak.  It is rather like saying that we are similar to those harmless old ladies who were just knitting socks and were not really part of the war effort. We are vaguely concerned people.  The civil libertarians cannot be opposed because they have logic on their side. We must listen to them because it looks bad if we batter them because they are innocent, harmless people. Indeed, one person suggested, that, God help him, Senator Noel Browne had never harmed a fly.  That is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>The argument that is being presented by people who have been associated with civil liberties in this House so far has not been some kind of vague, fuddy-duddy argument.  It is an argument that has been presented on clearcut logic and it is an argument that is being presented because we feel there are principles involved. Unfortunately, it is because people relapse into this kind of condescending treatment of the civil liberties case that it becomes necessary to return, very often, to the very principle upon which that case is based.</P>
    <P>I would begin by reminding the House of the point which I made two weeks ago.  Civil liberty is not a luxury.  Civil liberty is not a residual kind of feeling that exists in a population, a feeling that it is some kind of fantasy recreation to be visited on <Col N="349" /> occasion.  Civil liberty, if one believes in a certain theory of the State, is the stuff of democracy itself.  It allows the State to develop, to change and to operate within a system of guarantee and fairness.  There are very concrete and urgent questions which derive immediately from this and to which answers must be given.  I reiterate one of them which I made two weeks ago. What are the implications for a democracy when constitutional guarantees are replaced by ministerial intention?</P>
    <P>Now unfortunately I have to disagree here with what my colleague Senator Ruairí Quinn, in a fine speech, has said.  I do not think it is as simple as that you trust the Government of the day or simply that you are unwilling to accept Ministerial good intentions, or that by showing concern for guarantees you suggest that the Ministers are inadequate to fill their particular offices.  The crunch question is: how valid is a ministerial good intention as a substitute for a constitutional guarantee? In the history of law, that is a very important transition, and it is quite ridiculous to try to ignore the implications of it.  Here I want to remind this House that we have been given advice in making this kind of assessment.</P>
    <P>So far I have been saying the principle of balance is involved.  In what circumstances can we suspend an aspect of individual guarantee in the Constitution and replace it by ministerial intention?  It is suggested that you can trust the Minister of the day, you can trust past experience, it can never be abused and so.  I have been saying that intention itself is not an adequate substitute for guarantee.  I now say something else as well, something I have said before, that present circumstances offer evidence&mdash;the many people killed, the many people injured.  People will say that all of this justifies taking a short-term measure coming down heavily thereby on the side of the suggestion that you can have a ministerial discretion and that you can have law that will deal with situations at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the other House the Parliamentary <Col N="350" /> Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy John Kelly, had this to say, at column 337, Volume 292 of the Official Report for 2nd September, 1976, and it is an instructive passage coming from a distinguished jurist:</P>
    <P>History will not be too sophisticated in sorting out people in the way they behave in this crisis and historians will not be too careful in reading politicians' histories, as to whether they had good reason for this sentence or that sentence.  They will be looking for the large lines of history, to see who in this moment of crisis stood up to violence, who condemned violence unreservedly, who threw his moral weight, whether heavy or light, into the balance against it, who tried to bring his constituency organisation with him in facing up to it and condemning it and in never temporising with it or making excuses for it; and who did not.  That is what history will be interested in.</P>
    <P>That version of history is a kind of a cross between history written in the time of Carlyle and the cowboy comic. It is the notion that anybody who has managed to persuade anybody else that violence condemned in any way under any fashion by any number of people will be what will interest people.  There is a very good line in his speech.  At column 338 he said: &ldquo;They will be looking for the large lines of history to see who in this moment of crisis stood up to violence.&rdquo;  I would rewrite that sentence and I suggest that people will be looking to the large lines of history and the test will be as to whether the legislative response was over-reaction or whether it was being calm and keeping one's nerve.</P>
    <P>To return to some more close terms that have been used in the Bill, one Senator has correctly suggested that many terms are used which should be given more definitions.  The Minister in the course of his opening speech said:</P>
    <P>This is the only emergency measure considered by the Government to be necessary at present to enable the Garda to deal more effectively with the problems created <Col N="351" /> by the activities in our society of subversive groups.</P>
    <P>Now already we have had quite a discussion as to what constitutes a subversive group.  Last evening I think we had a long, perhaps too long, quotation by Senator Noel Browne from the Minister for Justice's speech in St. Anne's.  I think that that speech was unfortunate.  It saw university organisations, students' organisations, infiltrated by subversive groups and individuals. It was almost a McCarthyite speech, and I know it probably is not a fair selection of the Minister's thoughts but just one of those unfortunate speeches that are quoted.  I do not want to dwell too much on it, but it highlighted the arbitrary nature of his definition of the word &ldquo;subversion&rdquo;.  To someone like myself, who has for all his political life attacked the private enterprise system and the related institutional arrangements that prop it up, for example, the way the notion of profit is inculcated in children, is that subversion? If I write on the many ethical and social advantages of having a socialist society, is this not to subvert the minds of people in a different way of life?</P>
    <P>This legislation is felt by the Government to be necessary at present to enable the Garda to deal more effectively with the problem created by the activities in our society of subversive groups.  Even if one agreed that the word was a useful one, which it is not, who in fact is to give it content?  Again here there are many social implications: those from middle-class backgrounds often see a mixed school as a major threat to their life style.  Again, people who believe in right-wing Catholic orthodoxy think that they can best advance Christianity by having schools which are separate from Protestant schools.  Then we come to the class differences.  It may be a particular class content who makes this definition of subversion and this will be shown in the definition itself.  It is a bad term and it is a bad term to use in law.  I offer this opinion as a non-lawyer, but my opinion is that it is a bad term.</P>
    <P>Another word which has been used loosely again and again in the debate in this House and in the other House <Col N="352" /> has been the word &ldquo;order&rdquo;.  What is order?  Take, for example, the latter day Chinese development around the time of the Cultural Revolution.  The orderly development of Chinese political consciousness just after the Cultural Revolution would be that groups would never crystallise so that social change would never take place or that a leadership group could never become so harmed so as not to be amenable to change.  In other words, the notion of there being a continual dynamic was their version of order. But if we mean by &ldquo;order&rdquo; the protection, willy-nilly, in any form of institutions which are regarded as being immune to criticism and which are wrongly but carefully and systematically imagined as serving the majority when in fact they serve an élite, then no social change can take place in society.</P>
    <P>Or is it that we are going to have the notion that extended good works will replace adequate social change and social criticisms and political reflection of that social change?  We will be told there are plenty of things to do, visiting the old, visiting the young. The way we are going, if you will excuse my being amused by it, there will be so many of the young with a lot of time on their hands that they will be indeed able to visit the old with greater frequency, which may be a good thing.  The notion here, then, is that &ldquo;order&rdquo; is a word which is used in a very restricted sense.</P>
    <P>To turn to the Bill in detail.  It is acknowledged that most of all the issue raised in this legislation, this very short document which comes before us, is section 2.  Most Senators have confined themselves to discussing the implications of section 2 (3) which deals with detention for seven days.  One need not be a lawyer to make a judgment on this.  I think that Senator Mary Robinson raised a question which is not only important legally but also socially and politically: what is the purpose of this detention for seven days?  Is it to remove people from circulation and, if it is, she dealt then with its test for adequacy for that purpose.  Or is it in fact to find out something else, to enable the police to investigate in a <Col N="353" /> particular way?  Then this raises other questions.  My own view is one that goes beyond this necessary legal distinction, and it is a question I think that must be answered in the reply as to what will be happening during these seven days.  I think that in practice&mdash; and after all here in this House we have to deal with the totality of our experience, not only what is legally possible&mdash;it would be extremely difficult to ever monitor a detention so as to ensure that it would either cleave with one definition or with another definition of purpose.  It would be practically impossible.  Therefore I must react to the period of seven days or rather the increase of five days in the light of what it is, the extension of the period of time in which a person can be held.</P>
    <P>In making one's assessment a number of considerations immediately arise to mind.  If one was to say there are people who are perhaps directly involved in committing acts of heinous murder, dreadful crimes, people who have fired shots and people who are involved in kidnapping and so on and that by keeping them out of circulation one could prevent these acts, one could say that some kind of a case had been made.  But in the absence of one being able to conclusively show this, what one must do is take this legislative action in Ireland and set it against actions that are taking place elsewhere.  One must say to oneself where has seven days detention been applied before in the free world, under what circumstances, and what has happened in general during those periods?  We may feel a great concern, but if we feel concern we should show an adequate legislative response to the number of people killed and the number of people injured.  But it is necessary, too, that we take a cognisance of the reports that have been published which show an abuse of periods of detention, and it is unfortunate that we are considering this extension precisely at a time when there is a growing volume of evidence in the world about the abuse of persons and the abuse of freedom while persons have been held in detention.</P>
    <P>To return to a point that I mentioned <Col N="354" /> at the outset, people will suggest this is all very fine but this is to deal with what the Leader of this House referred to last evening as &ldquo;academic niceties.&rdquo;  He said people who indulge in &ldquo;academic niceties&rdquo; deal with violence with, and I quote him, &ldquo;cottonwool softness.&rdquo;  With respect what I am suggesting is this&mdash; precisely in the same way that Senator Ruairí Quinn saw it&mdash;that to react with over-repressive measures, to indulge in counter-terrorist activities, is in fact to give a present to the terrorists themselves.  I am suggesting that the effect of suspending or circumscribing civil liberties in any way is wrong.  We are not willing to be stampeded into eroding what are our essential liberties because we are being threatened, and I want to promise the Minister here that when it comes to murder, when it comes to robbery, when it comes to intimidation&mdash;and in my speech on the emergency motion I went much farther and said when it comes to spreading fear&mdash;any Government and any Minister who come into the House will have my unconditional and full support.  However, I am speaking as someone who is concerned purely from the point of view of freedom. At the present time we are creating an atmosphere which will play into the hands of the very people who are committing these acts of violence.</P>
    <P>People have been speaking of public opinion.  Some Senators say that public opinion is with them; others say that public opinion is with someone else.  As someone who has been involved in carrying out polls professionally I would never accept the result of a poll.  I do not believe in them.  From the people who have been talking to me about this legislation, and before that from general conversations I had with members of the public, my impression was that there is a great disgust in this part of the country for the Provisional IRA and for their action.  I think that there is a disgust for them in Northern Ireland. It is true that it is difficult to change people's attitudes to change, over the age of 40 or 50 let us say, and there are people who will support these <Col N="355" /> people, these murderers, in any circumstances. But I think that there was a growing popular opinion against them.  But by showing your anxiety to circumscribe civil liberties, you are giving them an opportunity to incur some sympathy from the public, however indirect and however vague.  As well as that the arguments that have been made from genuine civil libertarians are being fired willy-nilly into the Provisional camp and this is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne last night made a comment which I think is quite valuable.  It is something that we discussed at some length in the debate on the motion and need not concern us here, but it arises in the next legislation <i>in extense</i> and it arises to a lesser extent here.  He asked the question: looked at historically what has been the positive response of legislation which might be in the category of repressive legislation, what has been its result?  He asked what had been the result in the '20s and '30s and '40s and '50s and now in the '70s?  What effect has this kind of legislation had in practical terms?  If you heap repression on repression on repression on repression, what will you achieve?  He made a suggestion in reply to that rhetorical question.  He suggested that the roots of the problem may in fact lie in the guilt with which all of us carry.</P>
    <P>I think we carry a very great guilt in not having been more critical about the influences that have shaped us in our experience, through educational forms and through other social forms &mdash;in being willing, for example, to put up with intolerable social and economic conditions in this part of the island.  I think this just answers the question which I might pose: is there any such thing as a legislative measure which can deal with the fear and the terror and the threats that exist in this island at the present time?  The straight answer to it is that there is no legislative response.  The only legislative response that would adequately root out fear and intimidation and terror all over this island would be primarily an invitation to a positive <Col N="356" /> philosophy of life with the related practical&mdash;eminently practical because it deals with life&mdash;philosophy that would deal with social and economic relationships from a communal rather than from an individual perspective; and to have an educational system which taught those values.</P>
    <P>You might say: does this not interfere with freedom in some way? I will come back to the principle of balance again.  If we are asked to strike a balance as to whether or not we will ever interfere through the spirit of our legislation with individual liberties the answer is not simple.  Is it not a real argument that, when we come to take the longer view, maybe we should interfere with economic liberties so as to ensure the economic and social survival and development of the community as opposed to individuals or an élite.  I will be honest to this House about that.  That is a time when I will willingly indulge in a debate as to what is an appropriate balance, and I hope we will have to do it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The next Bill is one which raises more questions concerning the social background to the commission of acts of violence themselves.  This brings us to a valid point raised by Senators Owens, Robinson and Browne: the threat posed to those workers who are not protected under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906.  By the placing of a picket, the people not protected under this Act could find themselves in some danger.</P>
    <P>It was Senator Robinson who suggested&mdash;I am not quoting her&mdash; that the trade unionists should be adamant in trying to ensure that section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, was removed from the Schedule which enabled members to be so placed under threat in so far as they had not got the protection of the 1906 Act.  I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator here.  Indeed I share her wonderment that the trade union movement did not react in 1972 when this section was included.  I mentioned in my speech two weeks ago two aspects&mdash;I will refer to them for short term purposes as the two Gardiner <Col N="357" /> aspects&mdash;of this kind of legislation.  In his criticism of this type of legislation Lord Gardiner suggested that there were two tests by which we could assess such legislation.  First of all, how sensitive is it in its scope. Senator Robinson has dealt with this in some detail.  The second criterion he had was that of duration. Obviously that point has been made again and again as to when these measures will lapse.  There is a refrain going through this debate which is insistent. It is the more interesting in that it is coming from some of the more distinguished Senators.</P>
    <P>Here I return to Senator Alexis FitzGerald who referred at the outset of his speech yesterday to the timidity of western governments in standing up for democracy.  The Senator suggested western governments were becoming timid; the general idea was that you would wake up one day and democracy would be gone.  This relates to part of the argument I was making some weeks ago concerning the liberal position.  It was always an old flaw in liberal political philosophy that at the end of the day the liberals would take the most repressive measures to defend what they called liberalism.  Thus in every democracy where constitutions have been suspended, it has always been invoked in the name of the common good. People have said: &ldquo;We need to suspend the Constitution and individual liberties because the common good requires it at this time&rdquo;.  We have always been told that the Constitution would come back.  It has happened in every State in Latin America where this type of activity has taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.D. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is the crucial dilemma of the liberal position.  I have never been a liberal; I am a socialist.  My view on human and civil rights is quite definitely developed within a socialist perspective and not within the liberal perspective at all, one that has so many very bad flaws that I do not think one could hold to it.  This is what is happening at the present time.  People are <Col N="358" /> criticising the timidity of western governments in standing up for democracy and asking for repression to bolster democracy&mdash;a great error.</P>
      <P>The obverse of timidity is temerity, and that is a very interesting word. Who will be timorous in standing up and defending democracy?  For example, if people said that you had not a real democracy that what you had was a phoney democracy, then you would have armies of the timid representing different versions and armies of the timorous going around suggesting that they would push it down everybody else's neck.  With the greatest respect, I say it is a dangerous notion.  It is interesting that it is developed by those who have often left a particular political regime without subjecting it to adequate historical or economic analysis.  This, in fact, shows very heavily the influence of Solzhenitsyn or, more particularly, Solzhenitsyn's more popular commentators, being as they are people who are not too interested in the historical development of the monster of the modern Russian State, who are more interested in description and emotional reductionism.  More of that again.</P>
      <P>I was fascinated by the arguments concerning <i>habeas corpus</i> yesterday evening, particularly the rather unusual version of this argument presented by Senator Brian Lenihan and the later thinking of Senator Mary Robinson. Some of the provisions of Article 40 were seen as being limited by the proposal to invoke Article 28 to suspend the Constitution.  This is undeniable, in my opinion.  However, it raises a question to which I should like us to address ourselves on another occasion, as to how one can take one Article of this Constitution and set it up as prior to or as more important than another Article.  I have always had the opinion that those Articles in the Constitution which dealt with individual guarantees&mdash;we have spoken about liberties and certainty in the law&mdash;had a greater status than the other provisions of the Constitution which were rather more loosely worded and which were social-aspirational in character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly one could even draw a <Col N="359" /> further distinction and say that within the category of guarantees, those Articles which spoke about guaranteeing individual freedom and due process as such, were prior also to administrative Articles, Articles which indicated how the State might administer its different agencies.  It is very important that the spirit of Article 40 be retained.  That spirit is affected by the invocation of Article 28 in a particular way.  Again I fid that very disturbing.</P>
    <P>I want to refer once again to what I think is the most unfortunate provision in this Bill, section 2 (3):</P>
    <P>Whenever a person is arrested under this section, he may be removed to and kept in custody in a Garda station, prison, or other convenient place for a period of 48 hours from the time of his arrest and may, if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent so directs, be kept in such custody for a further period not exceeding five days.</P>
    <P>I have said that the taking of powers in general and particularly this power must be judged against a longer historical period.  It will be judged as over-reaction.  I have said that it must be judged in a wider context, one in which we have had more and more evidence of periods of detention being abused, people suffering physical abuse, also the different guarantees which have been made for people in such custody having been ignored.</P>
    <P>I am not attacking the Garda Síochána.  In university communities people teach.  There may be one or two bad teachers but the majority of the people who teach may work well. In any community of workers there is always a small minority of people who are attracted to the work because of the type of personality they have or who develop a personality attitude because of the work itself. The public needs to be protected from excessive power being placed in the hands of such people.</P>
    <P>The placing of a person in uncertainty for such a long period in the atmosphere in which we live at present, with all the techniques of interrogation <Col N="360" /> developed to their present level, is unsatisfactory, given that at a time when we are told it is unsatisfactory people do have recourse in law when anything happens to them.  This is not an adequate substitution.  From the outset there should be a clear code available as to what could be done. This business of removing people from society for seven days is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>We are all appalled at the crime of kidnapping.  It has been suggested that the penalty for such a crime should be life imprisonment.  How can one have such a horror of kidnapping and at the same time accept it as a necessary procedure that a person be detained for seven days?  In the event of a person being wrongly detained, he is removed and his destination is unsure.  I think we could have managed without this and I think it unnecessary.</P>
    <P>What appears peripheral and tedious is often what is true.  Senator Robinson in a speech two weeks ago said that the battle was for the minds and hearts and wills of people.  Last night she suggested that it was of crucial importance for us that we secure the allegiance of the young citizen.  I would go a little further and say that, far from being seen to meet force with force in an atmosphere of over-reaction and giving the impression of insecurity, we should be developing a deeper analysis of our society so that we could turn the existing economic and social crisis into a benefit. It is an immensely exciting task for people who are young in politics to see that all the old economic order is falling apart, that new social forms are now not only necessary but inevitable.</P>
    <P>A distinguished Front Bench Senator has suggested that it is no longer a matter for argument as to whether socialism will happen; it is only a matter of when.  How much more exciting it would be to subject all the sources of institutional repression and all the sources of institutional violence, including those who have created the gunmen of the <Col N="361" /> IRA, to systematic examination and to develop an alternative conception of life and institutions in this country. Positive politics could be offered, politics in which the community would be stressed rather than the individual.  That would attract the allegiance of the young citizen. But we are faced with this: given that that does not take place, what will happen?  The population is increasing.  In the 1980s there will be more young people, particularly in our cities.  What are the choices facing people in the industrial sector?  It is my opinion that they will react more and more and they will put pressure on the unemployed.</P>
    <P>An alternative response, which is a socialist response, is that in joint action with the State we would move towards a socialising of the economy and make impossible all of the social horrors that are likely to happen.  If this was to take place everybody would realise the monstrous thing it is to take the life of somebody and by such an action to impede the new social and economic progress which this State is all about.</P>
    <P>But to ask for this legislation&mdash; not having turned one's face towards a new economic and social order&mdash; leaves one with a real fear that, in the reaction to sustain the old bankrupt economic and social order, these pieces of legislation will remain to be used at the end of the day.  They are a threat in the short-term to people not protected by the 1906 Act, but they are more fundamentally and generally a threat to people who form the vulnerable working class seeking to build an alternative society.</P>

      <P>I have been very impressed by the two last speakers, Senator Quinn and Senator M.D. Higgins.  I agree with a great deal of what they have said and feel that I will not have to spend too much time going over the ground again.  Senator Higgins said he was not a liberal and spent a lot of time explaining what a liberal is.  He said he is a socialist but he gave us little idea of what he meant by that.  Perhaps he could develop this theme at length next week, because in <Col N="362" /> my mind the terms, socialist, liberal, conservative and so on, become more and more meaningless as they are applied in such wide-ranging fashions.</P>
      <P>One has only to look at the many countries that call themselves socialist and practise repression on a great and grand scale.  Their system is based on repression.  That is not to disagree with Senator Higgins's point that there are many countries that call themselves liberal countries or democracies in which repression is also practised on a grand scale.  Perhaps the next time he uses the term socialist he could tell the House what he means by socialist and tell us what his philosophy is.  The terms are so wide-ranging now that they mean different things to different people.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we may be recalled on a day on which there is no other business and Senator Higgins can have the floor.  It is a pity he did not get an opportunity last week to philosophise.</P>
      <P>My feelings about this Bill are very much those I expressed on the emergency powers motion which was discussed some time ago.  These feelings have been put very cogently by a number of other Senators.  I am firmly in favour of any measures which are clearly seen to deal with the situation in which we have an increasing number of bank raids, hold-ups, hijacks, post-office robberies, gunmen wandering around taking large sums of money from business people, payroll robberies and so on.  I find it hard to see how the measures that we are discussing will lead to larger numbers of these criminals being caught and put behind bars, where they certainly belong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although many people are coming before the Special Criminal Court quite a number of them appear to be on charges of membership of illegal organisations.  I should like to see a higher detection rate of crimes such as bank robberies, payroll robberies and so on.  Our detection rate is low but I hope it will improve so that we can deal with these offenders.  I would have preferred to <Col N="363" /> see more positive measures aimed at strengthening the hands of the Garda, giving them better technical facilities, voting funds for the improvement of detection, rather than the measures we are discussing, which are rather negative.  It is said that they may serve to scare off people who are contemplating committing such crimes but one wonders if they will, I find it hard to believe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice made a point in the debate on the emergency motion and it was the only point which meant anything to me in deciding how I would vote on this package of legislation.  The point was that in the course of the investigations by the Garda when they took people in for questioning for 48 hours and then released them, these people &mdash;whom they strongly suspected&mdash; went around the country intimidating possible witnesses and those associated with the crimes which had been committed.  The Minister said that by increasing the period to seven days it would take these suspects out of circulation and would allow the Garda to go about their investigations unhampered.  That point is fair enough if the Minister had backed it up with some further evidence but the blanket reason of security was invoked for not giving more detail.  That is very unsatisfactory because it amounts to a situation in which the House is asked to support these measures without any concrete justification. After all, we are here to make decisions and we can only make decisions of this kind basing them on the facts available; if the facts are not available then it is extremely difficult to accept the good faith of the best-intentioned Ministers in Government.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of this legislation which one must consider. First, there is the actual form of the legislation and, secondly, there is the manner in which the legislation will be applied.  Many of the Government arguments have centred on the operation of the legislation.  The arguments have been put forward that <Col N="364" /> the legislation will not be abused and the Government can be trusted to use the legislation in a reasonable way; because of the respect one has for the Minister for Justice and for the Government as a whole, one can trust that there will not be widespread abuses of the legislation.  As a legislator, one should not be thinking on this at all but purely on the first point, that is, the legislation before the House.  We should consider that in a legal manner and should not be asked to make acts of faith which imply that we must trust the Government of the day in the way in which they operate legislation.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Justice, he is a person for whom I have considerable respect and he is a man of honour. He is operating in very difficult circumstances but I believe he will ensure that abuses are kept to a minimum. I would say that the same could be said of his predecessor and that abuses were kept to a minimum.  But this is not the way in which we should consider the legislation because there is no guarantee that a Minister of this calibre will be in office for very long or that a Government, such as the present Government, would be in office for very long.  One must consider the worst possible situation in which there might be a shift in political balance resulting in people with considerably less scruples coming into power and being able to abuse this legislation.  One hopes that this will not occur.</P>
    <P>The legislation is open to abuse and therefore it was heartening to see, in the other House last night, that an Opposition amendment which would tighten up the provisions for the rights of the individuals involved was accepted by the Government.  It was not actually an amendment which tightened up the rights of the individual, it was one which more expressly defined the term &ldquo;incitement&rdquo;.  It defined it more clearly and therefore restricted possible abuses.</P>
    <P>I have had two clear reactions from my constituents on this legislation. On the one hand, people want measures taken to deal with the criminal violence which these Bills are designed <Col N="365" /> to restrict and on the other, there is the real fear&mdash;it is not just confined to the so-called civil liberties group but to a wider group of people&mdash;that legislation such as this can be counterproductive. If it is abused, it will play into the hands of the subversives.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that when this legislation is on the statute book and when the Government are implementing it, if there is widespread abuse of the legislation, it would be made into an issue on which the Government of the day would be brought down.  There are sufficient people in the Government benches who feel strongly enough about this legislation that, if there were widespread abuse, they would be quite happy to vote with the Opposition on that issue, thereby bringing the Government down and forcing a general election. That is an important point and the Government must face up to it.  It is one of the things which one hopes will safeguard the manner in which the legislation is operated.  These have been the two reactions, on the one hand the very strong desire that something should be done about robbers, hijackers, kidnappers, but that it should be done fairly, and on the other hand, the feeling that this legislation is not really going to do this, that it is a legislative reaction by a government to the fact that, in crude terms, the IRA have been making a monkey out of the security forces and, therefore, of the Government, in their various operations and that the over-reaction will play into the hands of the subversives.  There is a balance.  I find myself somewhere in between these two feelings which have been expressed to me, these opposing feelings, by my constituents.  I want to see these crimes being dealt with and the criminals brought to justice.  I am not at all sure that the measures which we are discussing are going to do this.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give us some more concrete information upon which we can make a judgment, a little more than say, a couple of lines which say that if we take these people out of circulation then the Garda will be able to make successful investigations into many of <Col N="366" /> these crimes.  That is much too bland a statement and we really want something more from the Minister in his summary upon which we can make a judgment.  As an Independent who does not have any party axe to grind I am going to support the legislation if it is good, fair and just and is going to be successful.  I will not support this legislation if I do not believe this is so.</P>
    <P>I end up appealing to the Minister, as I did on the emergency motion, to give us some more information, perhaps some facts and figures about this.  I would certainly like to have some figures on the present detection rate for crimes of violence which have been committed&mdash;my feeling is that they are low but I would like to have the actual figures over the past number of years&mdash;and to give us something on which we can make a rational and unemotional judgment of this very difficult and critical issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in talking on the motion on a national emergency that we in the Labour Party would reserve the right to ask for certain assurances on this measure.  I desire now to bring to the Minister's notice very briefly just one of these assurances that would, in my opinion and in the opinion of Members of the House, expedite very much and make easier the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers to section 2 and the extended time that the Garda have under this for their powers of detention.  This section, as we all know, has excited certain fears among members of the community and more particularly I should stress that it has excited fears among trade union officials.  It has disturbed many of them and it has disturbed many of us to think that the Garda should have these powers.  Generally speaking we may have objection to it from the point of view of civil rights, but more particularly we are concerned that some gardaí who are not properly trained or who may have an individual predilection for overstepping their duties&mdash;because there are such gardaí&mdash;may interfere with <Col N="367" /> the lawful activity of trade union officials in the pursuit of their business.  This is a matter that causes serious concern to many of us.</P>
    <P>It may happen that many gardaí are not sufficiently familiar with trade union activities to be able to distinguish between activities, strikes and unofficial strikes and other activities, and some of them may find it difficult to distinguish between subversive activities, on the one hand, and trade union activities, on the other hand, such as wildcat strikes.  On the other hand, they may concern the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In the situation which we have at present where the unemployed are at the highest level ever in the history of the State, when the economic position is very serious, members of the unemployed will&mdash;as they have in the past&mdash;tend to congregate and organise themselves together.  The unemployed organisation will take part in marches and demonstrations and no doubt these will attract the attention of the Garda and rightly so.  We want the Minister, and I am sure he will find it no great difficulty in this, to assure the House that every possible measure will be taken to see that the Garda do not overstep their duties, that they will permit these demonstrations and these organisations of the unemployed to protest against economic measures that assail them and the consequences thereof, to protest against governmental measures or measures which they think stem from the Government, and that the unemployed should have full civic rights in order to protest and in every way to bring to the notice of the public their rights and their difficulties at present.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to give an assurance to the House that there will be no interference with the lawful&mdash;and I stress lawful&mdash;activities of trade union officials and with the lawful activities of any of those who organise and lead the unemployed for a just presentation of their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill and in doing so it must also be said it is regrettable that such a Bill has to be produced at this time. <Col N="368" /> This kind of introduction might sound contradictory, but I will try to explain in a few words what I mean.</P>
      <P>To me the first and primary duty of any Government is the protection of the citizens and this protective umbrella, if it is to succeed, must include the protection of life, of property and indeed of our democratic systems and institutions, which were put there not by this Government but by the people for their own protection.  Any threat to these institutions or any attack on them must be vehemently repulsed and I assume that this principle is accepted by all Members of this House and indeed of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>There is an idea abroad, no doubt created to some extent by the attitude adopted by the Opposition, that there is something wrong or evil, or something which is totally unacceptable about this legislation.  In introducing the Emergency Powers Bill the Minister is simply invoking a section of the Constitution which was put there to deal with the type of situation which now confronts the Government and every person in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 28.3 is being used by the Government.  It is not being abused as some people would have us believe. The Government have a clear obligation to take what most people regard as appropriate action as they see fit, if they consider that the prevailing circumstances warrant that action.  As in the past, and I suppose the situation will always be with us, we have small but vociferous sections in the community who are asking that the Government should show reason for the introduction of this legislation and why it should be necessary now.  The Opposition have repeatedly demanded that positive action be taken to alleviate hardship and to allay fears brought about by the barbaric violence being perpetrated by individuals and by subversive organisations.  To me this Bill is positive action.  The circumstances necessitating its introduction are to be regretted.  I am sure the Minister and the Government would much prefer to be dealing with other legislation in this House at this very moment.  However, the Government <Col N="369" /> have faced up to their responsibilities in this case.  I am quite sure from my contact with the people that they are quite happy that the right course has been taken and that the Government are living up to their responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that people are not concerned.  People are concerned; we are all concerned that such legislation is necessary but we must ask ourselves which is the lesser of two evils: to allow a situation to prevail and persist where literally nobody is safe, where subversives, through their organisations or individually, are prepared to go to any lengths to tear down the democratic Government and the democratic institutions of our country.  To me the answer is very simple.  We should face those people head on and use all the resources at our disposal, resources put there by the people to handle this type of situation. The concern shown by many people is what one might expect.  To me it is a very healthy sign because, as we know, no matter what Government are in power, people must be always vigilant.  they must always guard jealously their hard-won liberties and freedom.  This is what the people are doing at present.  They are probing, they are asking questions and they are getting answers and I think this is the important thing.</P>
    <P>Having expressed that concern, which is their right and obligation, they should also accept the logical answers given by the Minister.  In giving answers in this sphere of security we all appreciate the delicacy of the situation.  Much of the information sought by people cannot be given because of its security nature.  It is not like giving figures for unemployment or housing.  We are dealing with a situation in which all information cannot be given for security purposes. The Minister&mdash;and indeed the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;did state in the Dáil that he had no qualms about allowing this Government invoke Article 28.3 but&mdash;and he was quite right in saying so&mdash;there are circumstances in which some Government might in the future, having this power, misuse or abuse it.  However, in the Bill itself, both in the Title and in the <Col N="370" /> body of the Bill, there is written in a date which is a very definte safeguard for the termination of the special power.</P>
    <P>The abuses in the implementation of the powers which this Bill gives can be over-emphasised.  The result of this over-emphasis could lead, by implication at least, to a loss of trust and confidence in our Garda and Army.  It can be said now that since the foundation of this State no finger of suspicion could be pointed at either the Garda or the Army.  They are forces of which we can be justly proud.  They are our own people and they are able and willing to do the work as directed.  Any suspicion which might, by implication, cast a doubt on these people is very dangerous. These people are human beings. They can make mistakes but their past record will indicate that we can have full confidence in their activities in future under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have stated that there was no necessity for this repressive legislation.  The Opposition, when they were in Government&mdash;and the situation at that time was not as serious as it is now&mdash;issued a statement that they would introduce internment if threats made by subversive organisations of the day were to be carried out.  We all recall threats made on members of the present Government and on Members of this House.  The reaction of that Government was that internment would be introduced if these threats were put into action by subversives. That was the reaction of a Government whose members come in here and say that the situation as we see it now does not warrant this type of legislation which is a far cry from internment.</P>
    <P>Many people are showing concern about the umbrella effect of this legislation in that it might eventually suppress the activities of legitimate trade unions and their members.  This has been stated in the context of unemployment which is very high at present.  To me-and to many people who have talked to me about this-it seems that if we are to alleviate the hardship caused by <Col N="371" /> unemployment, if we are to create employment, the first thing we must do is to preserve the security, the laws and the institutions of this State.  We are dependent to a great extent on outside capital.  In order to entice these people to set up factories and so on in our country we must have stability of Government, security, liberty and freedom and the right of people to express themselves as they wish.  That is what this Bill&mdash;and, indeed, the Criminal Law Bill&mdash;is about.  It is trying to ensure that the so-called liberty sought through the barrel of a gun by subversive organisations and individuals is suppressed.</P>
    <P>It is a question of priority.  It is a question of which comes first the hen or the egg&mdash;stability of Government and institutions or employment.  The Government have acted rightly in seeing that the security of this country comes before anything else.</P>

      <P>Much has been said during the ongoing debate in this House and in the other House about the spectacle of persons wrestling with their consciences, especially people in the party to which I belong.  I feel impelled to say a couple of things about this.  The first and most obvious thing that must be said about it is that Parliament in general, and political parties in general, would be very much the poorer if people did not wrestle with their consciences from time to time.  The accusation comes very oddly from people who make it as if they had never wrestled with their own consciences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure that one of the people who might be anxious and ready to agree with this would be the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who, in a recent interview on RTE, was being questioned about the necessary compromises involved in joining a political party.  He quoted on that occasion, with some approbation, the statement of the French philosopher, Simone Viel, to the effect that every statement beginning with &ldquo;we&rdquo; is a lie.  All of us who are members of political parties experience this tension <Col N="372" /> on a more or less permanent basis.  Those of us who have left the heady atmosphere of independence for the stricter disciplines of a political party probably experience it even more so.</P>
    <P>I remember Peadar O'Donnell once saying about his own political views that he always knew there was one political party in Ireland he belonged to, even though he could never find any other member of it except himself. Even at that, he said, opinion within the party was not always unanimous.  This is, by and large, the position of the Independent; it is not the position of a person who is a member of a political party.  For people who are members of political parties, these problems&mdash;to call them problems of conscience is, I think, to overstate the case&mdash;arise quite frequently and I think the country would be poorer if they did not arise.  Having said that, it is also in order to draw attention to the other aspect of the problems of conscience, that is, that the actions to which they give rise have their own consequences, whether inside the party to which one belongs or electorally, or, indeed, in terms of public opinion.  So, exercising one's conscience or one's political judgment &mdash;it may be no more than that&mdash;is something which has consequences which one may not be able to predict and with which one simply has to live. It is not a sort of luxury the critics would often suppose it to be.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald went into considerable detail to indicate areas of misunderstanding that he thought affected the Bill.  He went at some length into what the Bill did not contain.  In so far as his exercise was a clarifying one, it was very useful for this House and, I hope, for the public as well.  I should like to follow him down that road a little bit because a number of accusations have been made about this Bill that I would like to reject while, at the same time not modifying my own disquiet about it.</P>
    <P>First, it is often said that this Bill is being brought in by the Government as a sort of smokescreen to divert attention from the serious problems affecting the economy.  Senator <Col N="373" /> O'Toole has already referred to that argument and, indeed, I would endorse much of what he said.  I do not believe that the Ministers, the Cabinet and the Government who have brought in this legislation intend it as any such thing.  I do not believe that they intend it as a smokescreen, as a diversionary tactic from the economy.  For one thing, I am quite sure that the time they have spent preparing, drafting and defending this legislation would, in their own estimation, have been far better spent if devoted to the problems of the economy and the need for economic planning. Secondly, there is the crucial fact that if we do not have any security we can throw our hats at the economy as well.</P>
    <P>The second accusation that is often made&mdash;and this is a rather more personal one&mdash;is that this legislation is an exercise in hypocrisy by people who said other things in 1971, 1972 and so on.  I do not accept that.  I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the people who have introduced this legislation just as I would trust, and I believe I know, that they accept mine.</P>
    <P>The third thing that is sometimes said is that this legislation is a general election gimmick, that the Taoiseach is only waiting for an opportunity to go to the country on a law and order ticket and take advantage of the very palpable anti-IRA sentiment in the country to come back with a hugely increased majority.  I do not believe this is the case.  I do not believe that the Taoiseach would be that irresponsible nor do I believe that the members of my own party, who see in this legislation a particular lever they would like to use to break the National Coalition Government, are in any way insensitive to the very deep political issues involved.  Anybody with two eyes in his head will recognise that for the Labour Party, to break any Government at this time on this issue would not only be political suicide for that party but would be grossly irresponsible in view of the total circumstances, economic as well as political, in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I must criticise the Bill on a number of grounds. <Col N="374" /> Perhaps one of the main grounds on which I should like to criticise it is a political ground and not one which can be readily met by amendment or improvement.  This Bill represents something of a lost opportunity, especially in so far as the Labour Party is concerned.  I do not believe that the Labour Party have ever been a part of Government at a time when a threat of this magnitude was posed to the State and its institutions.  I accept that it is a threat of some magnitude and I accept that remedial action was called for, especially in the light of various incidents which have taken place recently.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is traditionally a party which is very properly and rightly concerned with civil liberties, not only in terms of its own socialist tradition but in terms of a justifiable reaction against the very authoritarian society in which so many of us have been brought up.  The Labour Party's political tradition is not one which is anarchic.  It does not believe, and no sensible political party could believe, in total liberty for everyone all the time.  No, the Labour Party's political philosophy, as I understand it is very deliberate.  It believes the activities of some should be controlled so that all should be free.  It believes that because it finds itself constantly confronting a society in which the activities and very often the welfare of all is controlled, so that a very small and privileged minority might be free.  It finds itself in confrontation with a society in which market forces, economic forces, the various explicit or implicit mechanisms of social rejection and acceptance, all operate to ensure the continued existence of a majority of people whose rights are severely circumscribed so that the rights of a privileged minority may thereby be less fettered.</P>
    <P>This is why the Labour Party&mdash;and I feel I speak for some members of the Labour Party on this&mdash;are inherently suspicious of any legislation which purports to control everybody, and this is fundamentally what this legislation does.  It is an actual or a potential control on the civil rights of every citizen of this State.  It could have been possible for the Government, had they given more thought <Col N="375" /> to this exercise and given perhaps more care in its drafting, to have produced the kind of legislative package which would have won a wider and more whole-hearted acceptance from the Labour Party and the labour movement.  I regret very much that this has not been done because it is the loss of a political opportunity.  It is not absolutely critical, but sad nevertheless.  One of the aspects of the failure to grasp this political opportunity has been the almost complete lack of regret for the necessary infringement of civil liberties this particular legislation entails.  Government Ministers and others have been understandably at pains to defend the legislation and to defend the incursion of civil rights which is represents.  It would have been quite possible for this defence, spirited though it may be on occasion to have included an expression of the regret which I know is genuine at some levels of Government for the substantial invasion of rights that this legislation involves.</P>
    <P>With regard to the contents of the Bill itself, I have a number of points which can be made fairly briefly.  The first is that I should like wholeheartedly to endorse the very serious questions and doubts raised by Senator Owens with regard to the positions of trade unions under this legislation.  For some years I have been actively pursuing the need to change trade union legislation in order to bring the unions which she describes under the protection of the Trade Disputes Act.  It is a great pity that it is only a crisis of this magnitude that has suddenly exposed the need again.  I would urge the Government to take very speedy action to remedy what must be one of the most glaring deficiencies in our trade union legislation, which has been exposed by the debate in both Houses on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make on the Bill itself is related to the question of access to persons who are held in detention.  Like other Members of this House, I am concerned at the lack of clarity relating to the possibility of access to persons held in custody by legal representatives and by members of their family. <Col N="376" /> I have searched the debates of both Houses and have discovered nothing that gives me any real clarity.  We are told time and time again that a person would have the same rights under this legislation as he would have had before it was passed.  That is not satisfactory if we do not know what those rights are, if prisoners do not know what they are, if they cannot or will not be told and if the Garda will not and cannot be told how to clear up any ambiguities that may arise.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I have a slight difficulty with the proposals that have been made to insert specific access provisions into this Bill, for two reasons.  The first is that we may be accused of being willing to give greater protection to people who are suspected of terrorist offences than we are to people suspected of ordinary offences.  This is an argument which was used very successfully in Britain by the Home Secretary to reject similar amendments to their Prevention of Terrorism Act.  The second reason I am unhappy about the proposals is that this Bill is, after all, designed to be, very hopefully, temporary in its existence and its application.  It will last for at least a year.  We do not quite know how long it will last after that.  I would be sorry to see specific provisions for access and so on written into this legislation which would die with it.  To my mind the place for specific provisions on access is in the other piece of legislation which is not yet before us.</P>
    <P>I would urge on the Minister while that legislation is going through the other House, and the possibility of amending it there exists that he should think in terms of clarifying the access situation in that Bill which would be a permanent part of our law and which would be permanently available to all persons held in custody by the police, whether under this enactment or any other.  I do not believe in creating separate categories for persons held in custody.  One of the deficiencies of our criminal system for a long time has been this ambiguity about the rights of persons held in custody.  I believe we should clear up this ambiguity, not just for people <Col N="377" /> who are suspected of terrorist offences but for all people who are suspected of any offence and who are held in custody by the police for that reason.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make about the Bill relates to the time limit under which it operates and the method of renewing it adopted by the Government.  Again, for purely political reasons I could wish that the Government had taken another decision and had decided that the Act would lapse automatically unless it was renewed by an affirmative resolution of the Government in one or both Houses of the Oireachtas.  My reason for this should be obvious to people who think of the political consequences of the course of action that has been adopted.  At the moment if we pass this Bill as an Act the Government will be able to renew the legislation simply by putting down an order.  This order may then be made the subject of a motion in either House of the Oireachtas by one or two, at least by two, people.  In other words, if two people in the other House- and it is quite easy to see where they might come from&mdash;or two people in this House decide to put down a motion to attempt to annul a Government order made under this Bill, the Government will have to come into this House or to the other House and defend themselves.  They will have to adopt a defensive posture in order to keep this Act in operation. It would be far more politically wise for the Government to adopt a more positive attitude, to say that this Bill lapses unless it is renewed by a positive act of the Government such as an affirmative parliamentary order. If the Government come back to us after 12 months&mdash;a period of which I would be much in favour, however large my disquiet about the Bill &mdash;with a year's successful operation of this Act, a great improvement in the detection rate, no proven complaints of maltreatment at the hands of the police, and, with that record, asked for parliamentary approval for continuation of the Act, they would be very likely to get it and to get it without a great deal of the hassle that has characterised the debate in both these Houses up to now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> This of course is one of the main differences between this legislation and the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who spoke about this at some length, said that the similarities between the two Acts were far more important than their differences.  I do not agree. The British Act was first introduced for a period of only six months although it was later renewed for 12 months, and the British Government in their wisdom adopted the mechanism of going to seek positive parliamentary approval for its extension rather than relying on extending it by Government order and fighting maybe a pitched battle in Parliament to defend it.</P>
    <P>There is one other dissimilarity between this Bill and the British Act, which Senator Alexis FitzGerald may not have adverted to and which as a lawyer he should be very conscious of, and that is the decision by the Government to make the exercise of the power to detain people for an extra five days an exercise of the Garda Síochána and not of the Minister for Justice.  This may seem like a trifling point.  If a person is going to be locked up anyway does it matter who signs the order?  I contend that it matters very much who signs the order and it matters very much in the constitutional sense and in the sense that it is very important for the democratic institutions we are trying to preserve.  We have not, to my knowledge, in this House been given any reason for the decision to put this power in the hands of a Garda superintendent rather than in the hands of a Minister of State.  I imagine, for example, that it is not true that the reason this power is given one way rather than the other is simply that Ministers would be afraid of perhaps the personal consequences to themselves if they were to sign such orders.  I have confidence in our Ministers' capacity to resist the intimidation which I believe many of them are suffering at the moment.</P>
    <P>It might be argued that one of the reasons for giving this power to the Garda rather than the Minister is that <Col N="379" /> it would be more publicly acceptable if exercised by a Garda officer than if exercised by a politician because of a long-standing suspicion in Ireland that when politicians are given powers which they can use selectively there is always the temptation to use such powers selectively.  If this were the argument made, and I speak in total ignorance of this, I would be absolutely horrified because when we are talking about defending the democratic institutions of this State it is plain that the democratically elected Government of this State is the institution chiefly concerned.  If we are now going to pass into law a Bill which says in effect that we are going to give this power to the Garda because the people would not be happy if it were given to a Minister of the Government we are betraying our own lack of confidence in the elected Government.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that I would have no qualms about giving this power to a Minister of this Government. I believe that it would be possible for a Minister of a Government to abuse this power but I do not believe that such a person and the Government of which he was a member would long remain in office if he did this.  What we are talking about here, the right to confine persons for five days longer than the two days which is currently the norm, is fundamentally a political decision, an exercise of executive power, and as such, should be sanctioned by a member of the Executive, not by a member of the Garda force.  It may come to exactly the same result in the end. The same number of people may be detained, exactly the same people may be detained in point of identity, but the important constitutional principle would have been maintained&mdash;the principle that the exercise of force on behalf of the people should wherever possible, especially in exceptional circumstances like these, be directly exercised by somebody who is directly responsible to the people themselves. The formula which is adopted, for whatever reason, in this Bill runs the risk of at least enhancing this idea that Government Ministers may use <Col N="380" /> their powers selectively, and also perhaps undermines the need for a consistent and solid reputation for impartiality among the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>One further thing which I would like to raise on this section is the question of whether we or anybody are to know exactly who has been detained and who has been charged.  Is there any mechanism for knowing this?  Will it be possible for the Minister for Justice to direct the Garda Síochána in their annual report every year to state explicitly the number of persons detained under this legislation and the number of persons so detained who have subsequently been charged? There is a real danger that in throwing out this very far-flung net we may be doing a considerable violence to the principle that it is better that one guilty man should go free than one innocent man should suffer a penalty. The experience of the operation of the British Act is a concrete fact with which we have to contend here.  In the first 12 months of the operation of the British Act more than 1,100 people were detained under it.  Of that figure of more than 1,000 people the tiny number of 51 people were finally charged; that is, that less than 5 per cent of those who were detained were eventually charged by the police; 95 per cent or more were let go on the presumption of innocence or at the very least because there was no evidence which would even sustain charges against them.  Of the 5 per cent who were charged a substantial minority, perhaps as many as a third, were charged with offences that had absolutely nothing to do with terrorism at all.  They were charged with offences like wasting police time and conspiracy to defraud the Inland Revenue.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to Members of this House who are looking forward to the operation of this Bill to read the debate in the British House of Commons on the renewal of their emergency legislation there and see those figures, figures which would give all of us pause.  I would hate a similar situation to arise here, a situation in which the number of people we are locking up for extended periods of time bears less and less relation to the <Col N="381" /> number of people we are charging.  I would hate to have it said of us in ten or 20 years' time that we have passed from being a pre-liberal into being a post-liberal society without experiencing any of the compensations of an intervening period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the pleas made here and in the other House asking the Minister to take another look at this Bill.  I was pleased to witness the former secretary of the Labour Party advocating the setting up of an impartial and independent method of investigating complaints against the Garda.  That is not to be regarded as a reflection on the Garda. If such a system was instituted it would afford a great deal of protection to the Garda from malicious rumours, mischievous comments and indeed irrelevant complaints.</P>
      <P>During the course of the presentation of this legislation the Minister has been at pains to say that there are ordinary remedies of going to court to obtain redress.  The Minister knows very well that in this part of our country we have no system of legal aid to enable ordinary people to bring actions in court.  Until such time as that is done what the Minister is saying is absolutely meaningless.  It is very much in the interests of everybody that a dialogue be established between our Minister for Justice and the community. If this is done there will be a greater understanding and appreciation of the intentions on one side or the other.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that only the guilty need worry.  One has only to have regard to what is happening even now without the introduction of this legislation. I would like to refer the House to the front page of the <i>Evening Herald</i> of the 1st September which read:</P>
      <P>Slogan Shock For City Worker</P>
      <P>The Special Branch was accused today of manhandling an innocent worker as he was cleaning a Provisional IRA slogan from a city centre wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jimmy Byrne was carrying out his <Col N="382" /> employer's instructions in cleaning the slogan from the wall on the Marlborough side of the Dublin School of Catering.  He got the shock of his life when first a squad car and later a Special Branch car pulled up beside him as he was beginning to tackle the job.</P>
    <P>I need not read the whole article.  It was also reported in the <i>Evening Press,</i> and its heading on page 5 was: &ldquo;Garda Swoop Grabs Wrong Man&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Something very significant happened about that time.  The colleagues of that working man went out to advise, in the first instance, the uniformed members of the Garda that he was only doing what he was told.  He was not writing it up; he was taking it off.  The Garda then appreciated that and let him go. When the Special Branch came along and took a hold of him they told his colleagues to &ldquo;f&mdash;off&rdquo; or they would do the same with them.  That is not the type of dialogue to have between our police and the people.  Something would have to be done about that kind of thing.  Again it is not good enough to say you have redress through the courts.  It takes too long, apart from anything else.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, many organisations and individuals have expressed fear and anxiety about the Emergency Powers Bill.  I do not have to spell them out.  We read about them in the various newspapers.  They include such a body as that appointed by the Catholic bishops to the Commission of Justice and Peace, the well-known and respected Incorporated Law Society, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  What did the Irish Congress of Trade Unions find it necessary to say in connection with this matter?  They issued a press release which reads:</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is totally opposed to armed subversion and terrorism from whatever source it emanates and under whatever guise.  It recognises that the fundamental liberties of citizens and the democratic processes are threatened by the activities of groups that resort to terrorism. Such groups are not only anti-democratic in the fullest sense <Col N="383" /> but treat with contempt the will of the people as expressed through the ballot box.</P>
    <P>The methods of bombing, shooting, torture, intimidation and threats are repugnant to all that the trade union movement stands for.  The destruction of lives, limbs and propenty by these groups shows a callous disregard for elementary human decency and human rights. Congress is aware too of the enormous economic cost in terms of jobs lost as the campaigns of violence have involved the workers of this island.  Nevertheless Congress must be concerned that the means used by Governments to defeat subversion and end terrorism should not be such as to pose a threat to civil liberties.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the intentions of the authorities, it is essential that emergency legislation should not interfere with the basic rights of citizens.  For this reason Congress wishes to express its grave concern about some of the provisions contained in the legislative proposals at present before the Oireachtas. As regards a declaration of a state of national emergency, Congress has not been convinced that the present admittedly serious position, with the threat to democracy and freedom that is posed by subversion and terrorism, is such as to require the extreme powers being vested in the Government.</P>
    <P>Certain other provisions of the proposed legislation could have serious implications for our trade unionists.  In a period of acute tensions arising out of economic, political and security difficulties, the trade union movement must be particularly aware of the need to protect workers' interests and especially the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.  Freedom of association and freedom of expression must not be put at risk by legislative measures.  Congress strongly urges the Government to review these proposals about which serious misgivings have been expressed.  To do so would not be a sign of weakness <Col N="384" /> but rather of genuine concern to ensure the maintenance of democratic freedom even in the face of threats from those who would destroy it.</P>
    <P>Senator Owens, who is a very well-respected Member of this House, found it necessary to highlight the effect that this emergency legislation would have on the class of workers with which she is associated.  It should be known to the Minister and the Government that the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, gives protection to a certain number of workers.  It protects their right to enter into trade disputes, but that protection does not extend to what is generally described as service workers or people who are not employed in business for trade or commerce, such as civil servants, public servants, corporation workers and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Owens gave an instance as to what could happen under this legislation to members of the Rates Section of Dublin Corporation who because of a dispute refused to collect the rates. Under this legislation they can be dealt with.  Similarly, it could happen to ESB employees in the matter of collecting bills.  It seems to me that there was not sufficient consideration given to this legislation.</P>
    <P>On 11th August this year the Parliamentary Party of the Labour Party, of which I am a member&mdash;I am not a member of the Parliamentary Party for obvious reasons&mdash;decided to support new legislation that would be introduced. What Deputy Halligan and Deputy Desmond have found necessary subsequently to say convinces me that they were under a wrong impression about the intention behind this whole Bill.  In the 1976 Bill reference is made to the 1939 Emergency Powers Act.  In the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, there is reference to a Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  I am satisfied that it is not the intention of this Government to use this section of the Bill against trade unionists, but there is no point in saying it is not the intention.  It has to be spelled out.  It is the function of the Government to see that that is done so that there will be no misunderstanding. <Col N="385" /> We can ask if the Bill was really necessary. I say it was not.  The Government have over-reacted to a situation.  It is extremely unfortunate that they did not react to the other situation in existence which is more serious&mdash;the state of our economy and the mounting unemployment figures.  Are we to centre all our attention on people who believe in bombing and shooting and forget about the institutional violence being carried out day after day through the economy?</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves the question: is this Bill limited in scope? We have been referring to its possible effects on the trade union movement. It can be seen clearly that this Bill is far too wide.  It would not be an admission of defeat if the Minister had a look at this matter.  There must be no misunderstanding about the Government's intentions in connection with this Bill.  It is not even limited in duration. We heard the scoring off that was indulged in over Fianna Fáil's delay in removing their emergency powers.  Let us not fall into that trap.  I do not believe that what I have been saying can be described as contentious.  I do not believe that the earnest appeal made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions can be regarded as supporting subversives, but I do believe that if the Minister takes into consideration the entreatment that is there from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions he will be doing a good job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that in the proceedings here we have had a great deal of unnecessary misapprehension about the situation, about the emergency which is a technical one. This could have been eliminated if the Government had listened to appeals that were made in the past to set up an all-party committee on national security.  That is an absolute essential.  Stripped of the newspaper <Col N="386" /> headlines and all the distortions, there is no difference between any group in the Seanad or Dáil.  We are all united in that we want to see subversion dealt with.  We want conditions created to try to resume the building of the country.  In other words, we want to overcome the disastrous setback that has occurred in the last two years with world depression.</P>
      <P>A situation should not be created that would put groups into false positions where, because they argue certain defects or certain possibilities about legislation, they may be made to appear as if they are soft on the legislation.  The Government should make practical use of that united approach by creating an all-party committee on security.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to vote for any other package introduced under the Emergency Powers Act, invoking section 28, unless the recommendation comes to us endorsed by an all-party committee.  I have consistently asked for an all-party approach on many things including Northern Ireland.  I have pleaded many times in the past both to the Fianna Fáil Governments and this Government but all to no avail.  I have asked that the same appreciation of an all-party approach be shown by a party now that it is in Government as it showed when in Opposition.  When we were in Opposition we saw the need for an all-party approach.  Why then when they have the opportunity in Government do they not take it and set a headline for the country?  We cannot afford to have this divided front.  A united front is now more important than ever now that we are members of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, who many times supported my pleas for an all-party committee, to support it in the Cabinet.  Let the next newspaper headlines we read be of the setting up of an all-party committee on national security.  Let that be a prelude to an all-party approach to many of the other problems including the glaring, depressing and most urgent problem of unemployment, especially that of the school leavers who are aggrieved at <Col N="387" /> having institutional violence done on them at the moment.  For God's sake and the country's sake, let us tackle that job together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I wish it to be known that as a public representative I am fully behind these measures. The people with whom I am in contact every day are also fully behind these measures.  From listening to the media one would get the impression that there was strong opposition to these measures throughout the country generally.  This is completely untrue. The overwhelming majority of the people are 100 per cent behind the Government in what they are doing.  I have noticed that, since these measures have been introduced, this message has got across to many politicians.  The Opposition's attitude has become muted and has almost died away completely, because the politicians and the other commentators who protested so loudly have been left in no doubt about the people's views.</P>
      <P>The people want to see the Provisional IRA put down once and for all.  They are sick to death of them. They are willing to back any legislation which will see an end to their evil campaign.  People ask why we do not protest loudly against the UDA, UVF and other such bodies.  We do. We regard them as every bit as despicable, but the Provisional IRA emanate from our society; therefore, it is our job to see that the threat which they pose, both in Northern Ireland and here, is eliminated.</P>
      <P>We are told that it is wrong to introduce this legislation because if people with evil intentions assume power they can misuse the legislation.  Surely, we as public representatives are always under an obligation to the public who have elected us.  I could never visualise our public representatives misusing this type of legislation.  I have every confidence in the Government seeing that it is operated in a just and proper manner. It is a smokescreen to say that it could be misused.  It will not be in this day and age, and I doubt if it ever would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the legislation is a threat to free speech and democracy; <Col N="388" /> it is anything but that.  It is designed to ensure our right to speak freely and to continue to live as we do today.  We have one of the freest societies in the world, if not the freest. There is no other country in which it is possible to speak as openly or to carry out one's normal, lawful activities as in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I took exception to a remark in reply to a statement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, last week when he stated that nowhere in the world was there as much freedom of speech as in Ireland.  Deputy Haughey made the glib remark &ldquo;Russia&rdquo;.  This type of remark is anything but helpful.  This country is suffering quite a bit economically, due to the impression being created abroad.  There are many industrialists who will not come to set up industry in the country and there are many tourists who will not come here because they feel they are not safe.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, great damage is being done to the country by the impression abroad that life in Ireland is unsafe.  This is completely <Col N="389" /> false and the sooner we put down these elements the sooner we can return to normality.  The Opposition, of late, have started harping on the theme that the Government should not merely talk about security but should divert their resources to economic issues, that this Bill is only a facade.  Again, this is an entirely false view.  If the economy is suffering somewhat, the cause could be largely attributed to the security situation in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it could even be largely attributed to it.  Industry has taken a battering because foreign industrialists are loath to invest when they feel their money might be in jeopardy; tourists likewise would be loath to come.  We have had to increase the number of the Army and gardaí to a degree unknown before. All this leads to a tremendous drain on our financial resources, which are limited at the best of times.</P>
      <P>Today, we heard Senator Mullen telling the House that we should deal first of all with institutionalised violence.  What a lovely expression. So, we take on the Provisional IRA and deal with them.  Of course, we must deal with the Provisional IRA because they have let it be known in no uncertain terms that, as they see it, when they are finished with Northern Ireland, they will turn their attentions to the South.  These people's intentions are not a bit clouded; they may have been initially but their one objective is to take over the country in its entirety.  Then we will see what tyranny is all about and those people who were squeaking about these Bills will be down on their knees wishing that democracy ruled again.  Thankfully, we will never arrive at that situation.  This type of Bill being enacted by a Government such as we have at present will make sure of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be unduly critical of the Opposition.  Their tone in both Houses has become a little more conciliatory. The Opposition and the Government are seeing eye to eye at <Col N="390" /> last.  That is to be welcomed.  I have stated that I always had the highest regard for the Leader of the Opposition. When he was Taoiseach he showed a fine example in dealing with certain elements, namely, the Provisional IRA.  The present Government have done likewise and have even increased their vigilance.  We also owe a debt to the minority politicians in Northern Ireland, namely, the SDLP.  I condemn certain elements, the Provisional IRA, UDA, UVF and the politicians on the majority side in Northern Ireland. Those people, by and large, have shown themselves to be terribly weak and have allowed themselves to be manipulated by ignorance and militancy and I have no time for them. But let us give credit where credit is due.  Let us support the reasonable politicians in Northern Ireland.  Let us support the present Government in its measures and we can defeat the common enemy.  That is all I have to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> First of all, I would like to thank the Seanad for the reasonable debate to which I have been privileged to listen.  That is not to say that I agreed with everything that was said during the debate.  The Seanad is to be complimented on the manner in which it tackled this piece of legislation and for the manner in which it conducted this Second Reading debate.  I would like to get down to earth and tell the Seanad what I feel is involved in this piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>During the debate led off by Senator Lenihan it has been suggested that in some way or another the Government, through this measure, are attacking the Constitution, are undermining the Constitution, are abrogating the Constitution. That is not the case.  This House and the other House passed a resolution under Article 28 of the Constitution some time ago and that resolution passed by both Houses did not take away from anybody or any citizen of the State any constitutional right.  It did give the Oireachtas the right to pass legislation which might otherwise be unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> The Supreme Court many years ago held that the right to detain or keep in custody without charge for 48 hours was constitutional.  There was some doubt as to whether an enactment which gave the statutory right to hold people without charge for longer than 48 hours might be held to be constitutional and it was for that reason that the resolution I have spoken of was passed.  As I said, that resolution did not in itself take away anybody's constitutional right.  The constitutional rights laid down by the Constitution are being taken away only to the extent that they are spelled out in black and white in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I did not interrupt the Senator and I would like him to permit me to state my case.  Constitutional rights are only taken away to the extent that they are spelled out in black and white in this measure and the sum total of the infringment or of the alteration of the constitutional rights of the individual during the duration of this Bill is that he may be held without charge for up to seven days, instead of up to 48 hours.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to say is that we are not invading the Constitution. We are not abrogating the Constitution. We are working the Constitution, because Article 28 of the Constitution was written in by the people who drafted it and enacted by the people in anticipation of a state of affairs where more than ordinary powers would be required to safeguard the institutions of the State and the liberty and property of the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That was seen by the drafters of the Constitution and was written into the Constitution so that in certain circumstances&mdash;world war being one of them, an armed conflict outside the State which spilled over in here being another&mdash;the Oireachtas might have <Col N="392" /> available to it powers to protect democracy, to protect the institutions of the democratic State and to protect the property and lives of the people.  I say that we are using the Constitution as it was intended to be used.</P>
      <P>It is right, of course, that there should be a wide-ranging debate about legislation like this.  It is right, indeed, that that debate should take place in the House and, indeed, outside the House and it is also right that organisations and associations who take on themselves the responsibility of being watchdogs of the people's rights should speak and make their views known but it is not right that responsible associations or organisations should indulge in groundless scaremongering or that they should misrepresent the legislation in order to terrify the citizens of this country into believing that it is something which it is, in fact, not.</P>
      <P>I regret that in that context I have to refer to a document which I got from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and on page 11 I read this:</P>
      <P>Duration of the emergency powers. Although the powers, including seven-day detention, drafted under the Emergency Powers Bill are to remain in force for only 12 months, the Act itself and the state of emergency are more likely to continue.  This means that these emergency powers may be renewed and others may be introduced by the Government by Government order without further reference to the Oireachtas.  The public would be most unwise to assume that the duration of the emergency powers will be limited only to 12 months.</P>
      <P>With the greatest respect and subject to contradiction that paragraph means and is intended to convey to the people to whom it was addressed that this measure may be renewed without any reference to the Oireachtas.  You may have an argument with me about that.</P>

This means that these emergency powers may be renewed and others may be introduced by Government order without further reference to the Oireachtas.  That is fantasy.  That is misleading rubbish and I regret to have to say that the copy that I received bore a complimentary slip from a lady for whom I have the height of respect, Senator Mary Robinson.  I do not know if Senator Robinson read this paragraph or not.  It is a pity she did not.  She undertook a heavy onus in her capacity as a Senator, bearing the reputation that she does in this House and in this country with her powers of persuasion and national appeal, to let loose on this country with a complimentary slip under her hand that most misleading paragraph.</P>

      <P>If I might just intervene on the point, because I am on the executive of the council.  I did not in fact draft it but I do accept responsibility for the statement.  I think the Minister has some measure of the right here.  There is an unnecessary ambiguity in the statement.  I would submit that the Government, because they can renew or revise emergency powers without reference to the Oireachtas, have too much power as the Executive&mdash;we can deal with this on Committee Stage&mdash;and that it is not enough that this matter can then be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can extend the scope of the Emergency Powers Bill because the Government, and the Government alone, can schedule offences, and we can see in section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, the schedule of <Col N="394" /> offence.  Tomorrow the Government, by ministerial order, with no reference to the Oireachtas, can schedule a whole range of offences and then people can be arrested and detained for those offences.  It is not necessary to have any reference to the Oireachtas for that.  That is an extension of the scope of the Emergency Powers Bill.  That has not been sufficiently clarified in the section.  I accept that it is to some extent ambiguous and I would regret that.</P>

But I think that she and myself understand the same language.  I think it was unfortunate that Senator Robinson did not draft this document.  I thing it was unfortunate that she had not a close look at it before she sent it out because I want to say this&mdash;and I say it convinced that I am correct&mdash;this means that these emergency powers may be renewed.  These are the emergency powers contained in this Bill and the only emergency power contained in this Bill is the right to detain for seven days instead of two.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This means these emergency powers may be renewed and others may be introduced.  Nothing could be more misleading than to say that other powers, foreign and unassociated with the powers conferred in this Act, may be introduced by the Government without further reference to the Oireachtas.  I know that we are very busy and sometimes we sign our names to things we do not study as closely as we should.  The Minister for Social Welfare here a few years ago withdrew social welfare from half the country.  I do not believe he knew he did it but he found himself in a very awkward situation as a result.  I do not want to labour this, but it is unfortunate that this ballyhoo was loosed on the country because I believe it created an anxiety in people's minds <Col N="395" /> and perhaps misled other people in high and exalted positions to join in this debate and start a sort of scaremongering in the belief that this was right.</P>
      <P>Is there any precedent for invoking the Constitution, Article 28, about which I have been speaking?  Of course there is a precedent for it.  A state of emergency was declared as far back as 1939, and I do not have to labour the fact that it has only been suspended since these measures were introduced here.  It is true to say, as Senator Yeats has said, that that was in the time of a world war.  This country was not involved in that war. The effects of that world war were overspilling here and certain people living in this country wanted to avail of the conditions created by that world war to make things impossible for the Government of this country.  There is a great difference between those circumstances and the circumstances prevailing here at the present time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I hear Senators professing to be terrified because somebody is to be deprived of his liberty for five days. They do not seem to object at all to the fact that on the Statute Book and part of our statute law is the right of the Government&mdash;conferred on the present Government by the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;to intern people indefinitely. That right is there.  We do not have to come to the Seanad; we <Col N="396" /> do not have to come to the Dáil; the Government can operate it by proclamation, by passing a resolution. That right has been given and it is there.  There is not a word about it. Senator Ryan says that I dare not do it.  A very short time ago the Leader of his party in reply to a parliamentary question said he was about to do it because important personages in this country were threatened with kidnapping and because there was a scheme afoot to rob banks.  That happened as late as December, 1970, when the Fiana Fáil Government said they were going to introduce internment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was invited by Senator Trevor West to spell out here the reasons why this legislation is necessary.  He wanted concrete justification for the introduction of these measures.  I believe that the measure I am dealing with now is absolutely necessary and more than justified.  I will start a few years back, and I will put on the record of this House why I think these measures are necessary.  We have had in the country over the last number of years, not threatened bank robberies, but actual bank robberies taking <Col N="397" /> place daily and we have had bank robberies aggravated by murder of police officers who seek to prevent those bank robberies.  There were two instances, Garda Fallon and Garda Reynolds.  They were done to death because they discharged their duties in trying to apprehend bank robbers. If Garda officers happen to come on the scene of a bank robbery the likelihood is that they will be killed.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael O'Higgins mentioned yesterday the tragic death of Senator Billy Fox, a Member of this House, a Senator representing my native constituency.  Since then Castleblayney, Monaghan, Clones, Belturbet, Swanlinbar and Blacklion, all in my present constituency, were razed to the ground or, if that is an exaggeration, very considerably damaged by bombs and some considerable loss of life was involved.</P>
    <P>We had the kidnapping of a foreign industrialist, Dr. Herrema.  He was not detained for seven days.  He was detained for over a month in subhuman conditions to the terror of himself and the absolute terror of his wife and family.  It would not be out of place at this stage, when one does speak about the Dr. Herrema kidnapping, to put on the record a compliment that is more than well deserved to Dr. Herrema's wife, a brave lady, a perfect lady, a lady whose courage and appreciation of what was involved in this terrible crime was an example to the rest of the world.</P>

It set off in pursuit of the stolen car and eventually the stolen car was brought to a standstill.  Two thugs got out of the car with a sawn-off shotgun.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As well as that we have had bombs in Limerick, Dublin, Galway and Killarney during the present session. I am asked why this measure is necessary.  I have given the litany of horrific crimes committed during the last few years.  These crimes have not been committed by people who regard themselves as criminal but by people who claim the right to commit these crimes, who claim the right to do these deeds, who do these deeds in the name of the Irish people&mdash;in Senator Lenihan's name and in mine. They claim the right to commit them and to continue to commit them.  That is why there is a state of emergency here and why these measures are necessary.</P>
      <P>I have proved to the House conclusively that we are not invading or doing violence to the Constitution, that we are operating the Constitution, that enacted by the people in the way in which it was intended to be operated. I have proved to the House as well that we have ample precedent from previous Governments for what we are doing.  Despite the best efforts of Senator Lenihan and the other Senators on the front bench of Fianna Fáil, I have proved to the satisfaction of any reasonable person that there is in this country a state of emergency&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;that demands extraordinary powers.</P>
      <P>Let me come to the Bill and see what is in it.  Before I referred to the Bill it was necessary for me to deal with some of the mischievous propaganda spread by Fianna Fáil although their wilder men are being muzzled in both Houses and are not allowed to get across to the media.  Their mischief-makers and rumour-mongers are busy.  That is it.  You had better come out and say you are either for this Bill or against it.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 2 of the Bill enacts that it shall remain in power for 12 months unless it is sooner revoked.  At the end of 12 months it will expire unless it is re-enacted by a Government order which must be laid before this House and the other House to be debated if so desired by any Senators or Deputies. In any event, it will come to an end when the emergency acknowledged by the resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas is brought to an end.</P>
      <P>It has been said to me&mdash;and I had better deal with it here&mdash;by a number of Senators that it would be better if this Bill came to an end in 12 months' time, if it had then to be re-enacted by a full-blown Bill introduced in the Dáil and the Seanad and processed in the ordinary way through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We know how long that takes.  It takes about a month. This has taken the best part of a month.  That is the alternative that has been put to me.  There are two points of view.  I know the purist will probably say that the other is the perfect democratic way of doing it but I find it very hard to see any difference unless at the end of 12 months there might be a gap between the expiration of this Bill and the introduction of another one.  With all respect, I say that that could quite easily happen.  The important thing is that the Oireachtas has control over this Bill and these measures.  It cannot extend beyond 12 months without a Government order which is subject to discussion, debate and annulment in both Houses.  It just takes the same vote to annul the Government order as it would to enact a new measure.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 2 of the Bill, which is the section with the teeth in it, provides that a person whom a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds to suspect has been involved in a crime or about to be involved in a crime can detain that person for 48 hours.  A member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may extend that 48 hours to seven days.  There is really no difference between the provisions in section 2 and the provisions in section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Exactly.  The only difference between the Act of 1939 and this measure is that a person may be detained for seven days instead of two days.  In fact, in this measure there is a safeguard written in in favour of the accused that the garda must have reasonable cause for believing that the person was so involved.  Under the 1939 Act he just had to suspect and that was the end of it.  In my opening remarks I said that that is the only individual right which is being tampered with or taken away good, bad or indifferent by this measure and no constitutional lawyer will contradict me because that is a fact.  That is the only Constitutional right which is being taken away by this Bill.</P>

Senator Robinson was worried lest a person while held in custody for up to seven days might be questioned under section 52 of the 1937 Act.  A person, of course, can be released after one, two, three or four days but cannot be held longer than seven.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson was worried that the person might be questioned or interrogated under section 52 of the 1939 Act.</P>
      <P>In an amendment introduced in the Seanad provision has been made that section 30, that is the 48-hour arrest section, is suspended during the continuance of this Act.  A person cannot be questioned under section 52 of the 1939 Act unless he is in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  He will not be in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act; he will be in custody under section 2 of this Act. We are really putting in cold storage section 52, and I am sure the Senator will be glad to hear that.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It has also been suggested that, instead of the chief superintendent having the right to extend the power of detention from two days to seven days, that right should be conferred on the Minister for Justice.  The Government think it is preferable that this right should be conferred on a chief superintendent.  Indeed, the thinking of this Government has been to take decisions of this nature from a political head of a Department and hand them over to somebody else. The first example of that was the appointment of a Director of Public Prosecutions.  Until that Act was passed prosecutions were directed by the Attorney General.  Far be it from me to make any reflection on any Attorney General past or present, but he was always a political figure who <Col N="405" /> came and went with the Government of the day, who was subject, I suppose being a human being, to political practice.  We passed an Act which transferred the right of direct prosecution from the Attorney General and conferred it on an established civil servant who has fixity of tenure, who is not a politician.  We have passed through the Oireachtas, as we undertook that we would do, an Act to take from the political head of the Department of Local Government the right to adjudicate on planning appeals and to hand that right over to a judicial and independent board.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Senator Lenihan also suggested that the introduction of this Bill would in some way interfere with our tourist business and our industrial efforts.  I want to suggest to the commonsense of the House that Fianna Fáil must be very bankrupt for an argument to make a point like that.  Surely the bombing of the hotels in Galway, Limerick, Dublin and Killarney and the incendiary devices set off in this city are calculated to damage our tourist business.  The tourist will see <Col N="407" /> in this measure an effort on our behalf to protect them and to see that this is a safe place to live in.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil can be absolutely reckless. I remember that when the Wealth Tax Bill was going through the Oireachtas a senior member of the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil sent most misleading communications to the United States of America without checking them.  That act was calculated to do the same damage as this is doing.  I believe that efforts to make this country safe for tourists, to prevent the kidnapping of industrialists, is the way to encourage tourists and industrialists, and I am glad I have the support of Senator Lenihan, even belatedly.</P>
      <P>Senator E. Ryan in the course of his contribution&mdash;and we will be dealing with that later&mdash;said that 99.9 per cent of the police force were decent honourable men.  I go the whole way and say that they are 100 per cent efficient and a highly respected force.</P>

Senator Robinson dealt with this in her usually efficient way but she suggested that a measure of this sort was not the measure to deal with access to prisoners in a general way, that if this necessity arose, and it has not arisen yet, it should be dealt with in a comprehensive measure.</P>

That is what Senators are saying is going to happen. If it is what they are saying, they should say it publicly.  But Senator West said that they would never tolerate that.  He gave his reasons.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Government's record in the line of reform and in the line of looking after our under-privileged people and in bringing about long overdue reforms should be sufficient evidence that there is nothing to fear from this Government. I should like to put on record some of the enactments that we have passed since we came into power.  First of all, there was the reform on the law of adoption, two different Acts.  We established the office of Director of Public Prosecutions to make sure that everything would be independent.  We amended the maintenance orders so that unfortunate creatures were not living on sums fixed many many years ago and neglected by the previous Government.  We introduced the Law Reform Commission which must be the most enlightened institution that has been brought into this country for many years.  We introduced and enacted the Family Law (Maintenance <Col N="411" /> of Spouses and Children) Act, 1975 which was long overdue.  We put on the statute book the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, and the Juries Act, 1976, seven enactments which I am sure people of the enlightened approach of Senator Robinson were looking for for years and campaigning for for years.  We put those on the statute book since we came into power. It is unlikely, extremely unlikely&mdash;it is just not possible&mdash;that this Government with that record and with that approach are likely to tolerate any of the things that are being suggested.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> A point was made by Senators Owens, Connolly, Mullen and others in relation to offences under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, and I will deal with that before I conclude.  I hope that I will not be misunderstood when I say that it was refreshing to hear a Senator who is as highly respected as Senator Connolly dealing with one particular part of this legislation which he thought needed to be brought to the notice of the House.  It is good and encouraging for the Government to think we have people of his standing in our community to speak out for the people when he thinks it should be done and to stand up for the rights of people in general when that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, worries some Senators because they say the effect of it is that trade unionists who are not employed in industry and commerce but in the service sector have not got the protection of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, and that if they were picketing offices or places of employment they might be guilty of an offence under section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  First, this offence was scheduled on the 17th November, 1972, and has lain there quietly since and we have never heard about it.  I can conceive that what the Senators fear could happen in theory, but let me tell the Senators why that offence <Col N="412" /> was scheduled: it was because an illegal organisation decided to picket the houses of judges without any consideration for the fundamental rights of privacy or the ordinary human rights of the judges' wives and families. It was because that illegal picketing was threatened and in fact took place that this particular section was scheduled in order to put an end to it. There was no further picketing.  I want to tell Senator Connolly and others here that there is no intention good, bad or indifferent, of invoking this section against trade union officials and leaders, trade unionists or unemployed people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No, the DPP decides on prosecutions which are brought before him.  I am giving that undertaking to the House and a further undertaking that this is a section which has been scheduled&mdash; of course, it can be unscheduled&mdash;in prevailing conditions and the reason for which it was set down is to protect the private life of public servants, something which I am sure is dear to the heart of Senator Robinson&mdash;the right of people to live their private lives without molestation; the right of the wife of a public figure to live in her house without fear of being terrorised by thugs outside; the right of the children of these people to live the lives of ordinary children.  There is nothing more sinister than that behind this scheduling.  The Minister for Justice will have a look at it to see if anything can be done to put it beyond doubt.  The principal thing is that it can be dealt with by an order.  It can be unscheduled just as it was scheduled.  I hope that that will satisfy the fears of those who have raised this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if my concluding speech <Col N="413" /> was a bit topsy-turvy but I did not create the waves; they came and I had to try and battle my way through them.  I would ask this House to accept this measure.  I have a list of points made by various speakers.  I respect the views put forward by Senators Higgins, Quinn and others who had a contribution to make or a point of view to put forward.  I ask them to sit down and think with me, and to ask themselves: what is behind this Bill?  This Bill is going on the Statute Book to ensure that Senators like Senators Higgins, Quinn and Mullen can do the things they want to do without molestation.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to preserve democracy, not to attack it.  This is a Bill to preserve free speech, not to muzzle anybody.  This is not a Bill which is aimed alone at the Provisional IRA but at anybody who claims the right to rob a bank with firearms.  This is a Bill which is meant to deal with anybody who puts an incendiary device into a cinema in Dublin.  This is a Bill which is aimed at anybody, organised or unorganised, who thinks he is entitled to attack a squad car with a sawn-off shotgun and take the squad car away for the purpose of some other evil doing.  This is a Bill which is aimed at anybody who indulges in kidnapping, bombing, shooting, <Col N="414" /> bank robbing or any of the other litany of things which it was my unfortunate duty to read out to this House on the opening Stages of this Bill.  That is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Opposition trying to say that there is something sinister behind this Bill.  It is a Bill which is here to preserve democracy. If these people, whether organised or unorganised&mdash;and I would prefer not to give them a title&mdash;had their way they would impose their will on the people and on what they would say, print, subscribe to, on whether people would buy papers and so on.  We believe, though I think it is unlikely, that there may come a time when they will be entitled to do that but they will not be entitled to do that until they get the right from the Irish people to do that through the ballot box.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 1, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.  &mdash;(1) Unless previously terminated under subsection (2) of this section, this Act shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the passing thereof unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines and shall then expire.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Government may by order declare that this Act shall expire on a specified date being earlier than the expiry date of twelve months from the date of passing thereof and in that case this Act shall expire accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory and the reason and importance for it was touched upon by the Minister in his Second Stage reply.  Basically, what is set out in section 1 of the Bill in regard to the duration of subsection (2) is that it can remain in force for 12 months and, secondly, the Government, by way of order, may continue the Act in force for a further 12 months.  During the 12 months they may cease to have subsection (2) in force.  Under subsection (3), every order made under the extension &mdash;and what we are really apprehensive about is an order extending the Act&mdash;shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution annulling the order is passed within the next 21 days in which that House has sat after the order has been laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a reasonable presumption that the Bill will become law next week and what we are talking about here is a situation where in 12 months' time we will be in the middle of September and the Dáil may not be sitting until <Col N="416" /> the middle or end of October.  The situation may be that the order extending the Act for a further 12 months will be lying there pending a sitting day of the House and the resolution annulling it can be laid within 21 sitting days beyond that.  Time must be allocated for a debate on that order. It is a matter for the Government to allocate time and then the Opposition in the Dáil or Seanad can make their usual moves, when the sitting day occurs, to have the debate on the order.  However, the Government may not allow it.</P>
    <P>The trouble here is that, because of the negative situation which arises, the onus is placed on some Member of the Oireachtas to put down an order annulling the matter.  That order can then be delayed in the manner I have described, so that the 12 months granted under this Bill can be an ongoing process of 15 or 16 months.  That delaying situation can happen due to the nature of parliamentary process not being as expeditious as it might be.</P>
    <P>We are proposing something which should meet the point of view expressed by the Minister.  In his reply he took it upon himself to deal with amendments and emphasised, with a certain degree of sympathy, that he felt very strongly about the parliamentary review of the situation after 12 months.  Our amendment seeks to copperfasten that expression of sympathy made by the Minister.  I have described the delays, difficulties and weaknesses inherent in the situation in having the onus put on somebody in the Oireachtas to negative the order&mdash;the weakness because of the limit of sitting days and getting such matters debated and voted on.  What we are suggesting in the amendment is to switch the onus the other way: to make it incumbent on the Government, who have all the machinery at their disposal; whereas what is suggested in section 1 (3) is that the onus lies on a Member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the whole thing again.  The Government have gone to the extreme length of suspending the Constitution in regard to the matters contained in the Bill.  They recognise the importance of the emergency <Col N="417" /> nature of it&mdash;apart from the Minister for Foreign Affairs who regarded it as a mere technicality, as he told the American businessmen in Killarney the other night&mdash;and for that reason its duration is limited to 12 months.  But this, in effect, could mean much longer, for the reasons I have mentioned.  Having regard to the purported serious nature of the Bill we suggest that the onus should lie on the Government to suspend it.  They have the machinery at their disposal. They can, if the legislation incorporates it as we suggest, have a situation where the Bill will cease automatically after 12 months.  If they feel that the emergency exists in 12 months' time, they can bring another measure before the House.</P>
    <P>We suggest that a new subsection be inserted before section 1 providing that:</P>
    <P>...this Act shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the passing thereof unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines and shall then expire.</P>
    <P>Therefore there is an automatic expiration at the end of 12 months and it does not linger on to be nullified by way of an order through the cumbersome procedure I have mentioned. The new subsection (2) we propose states:</P>
    <P>The Government may by order declare that this Act shall expire on a specified date being earlier than the expiry date of 12 months from the date of passing thereof and in that case this Act shall expire accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Government may if they wish declare, under subsection (2), the Act expired within the 12 months, or, under subsection (1) that the Act terminates automatically after 12 months. The onus is then on the Government in 12 months' time to introduce a Bill, declare it to be on foot of Article 28 of the Constitution, set out the preamble and bring in this emergency Bill for a further 12 months.  We, as sensible members of the Oireachtas and the Government themselves, will have had a chance to see whether all <Col N="418" /> this was really worthwhile.  We can then have a debate at the end of 12 months in which we will be able to assess the number of cases in which this matter has assisted the security authorities. We will be able to hear a progress report, as it were, on the operation of the Bill for 12 months and the need, therefore, by reason of the progress achieved under the Bill, to have the Bill for a further 12 months, or the Bill will just hopefully die which is probably what will happen in reality.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to seriously consider this.  I think it is a far better approach than the other approach which puts the onus on the people who do not have the information, the Members of the Oireachtas who are not in touch with the security situation and who do not have the files or the facts before them, to bring in a motion nullifying the Government order.  That is basically what is required at the present time, that the order may be annulled by a resolution proposed in both Houses of the Oireachtas, that the annulling order has to be moved by a Member of the Oireachtas.  Under our system of party Government that means, in effect, assuming the present Government will be in power in 12 months' time, by a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party or an independent Member of either the Seanad or the Dáil.  That is the type of person or group of people who have to move the order annulling the order made by the Government before each House of the Oireachtas.  Whoever is in opposition plus independent Senators and Deputies will not have the information before them to deem whether or not the order should be annulled.  They will be people without the necessary security information from the files that are rightly private, files that are available to the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice.  They are the people, as it were, in the saddle.  They are the people who are in charge and have all the data and information available to them.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly that the onus should be on the people in Government with the facts available to them, to take the positive step of either letting <Col N="419" /> the legislation lapse automatically at the end of 12 months or, if the information available to them indicates another approach, to bring in a Bill on these lines for a further 12 months in view of whatever security precautions appear necessary to the Government of the day.  The information to prompt that type of decision can never be available to an Opposition or to independent Members of either House of the Oireachtas. Therefore, the onus should be on the Government of the day to renew such legislation, because such legislation, of course, has no <i>raison d'être</i> at all unless it is grounded on security matters that must, of their very nature, be private</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Lenihan in appealing to the Minister to agree to this amendment. When the Minister was replying to the debate on Second Stage he referred to the fact that it would be impossible and undesirable to have a new Act each year because of the length of time it would take and so on, and he pointed out the length of time that this legislation was taking. I thought that statement was a little unreasonable in view of the fact that, from the introduction of this measure to the Dáil until the likely date of its being successfully passed through this House, no more than 14 days will have elapsed which is really not bad for legislation.  Apart from that, I would remind the Minister that on the only previous occasion when there were Emergency Powers Acts in being&mdash;of which there was a number&mdash;they were in each case expressed to die after 12 months and had to be renewed each time.  These were Acts of far greater substance, far greater complexity, than this one. It was, of course, possible to do so because there was a genuine emergency, a real sense of national danger, which encouraged people to pass them through with some expedition but, nonetheless, this was done and it is a pity that that particular precedent was not followed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not in any event&mdash;and I do <Col N="420" /> not know why the Minister raised the question&mdash;asking for a new Act each year.  What we are asking for is that, instead of the Government making an order each 12 months&mdash;an order which can be debated in the usual way and can be turned down by the Dáil but which remains in force until then&mdash;there should be a positive order and that it should not be renewed until and unless the Oireachtas, by resolution, has determined that it shall.</P>
    <P>The Minister was a considerable time in Opposition as a very welcome Member of this House and later on as a Member of the other House, and he knows perfectly well from his experience of Opposition how useless that kind of order is as a safeguard. There are thousands of these orders made each year and very few, perhaps three or four each year, are actually debated.  As Senator Lenihan has said, there are 21 sitting days which can be stretched over a long period. An order of this kind would presumably be picked out of the thousands that are made each year and considered by the Opposition as one which should be debated, but it is a matter for the Government to decide when they should be debated.  It would be open for the Government to insist, for example, that it should be debated during Private Members' time for an hour and a half at tea time or alternatively, that Government time should be given for a limited period, maybe one, two or three hours.  The Minister knows as well as we do&mdash;better than we do because he was in Opposition for so long&mdash;that this is no kind of democratic safeguard, that an order of this kind might as well not be put in the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>For that reason we are suggesting that section 2 of this Bill which is of such constitutional importance should die after 12 months unless there is a positive agreement by the Houses of the Oireachtas that it should continue. It is not a far-reaching amendment; it is not a far-reaching demand.  It is an ordinary democratic safeguard and not one which would in any way hold up the whole legislative programme of the Government, because, as the <Col N="421" /> Minister knows, there would be no question of going through the Bill section by section and putting down amendments and so on.  An order of this kind is agreed to or disagreed to, and that is all there is to it.  You cannot put down amendments because there are no stages.  It is just the one debate.  It is a relatively simple operation and even if it did take a couple of days, I do not think the legislative programme of the Government, such as it is, would be gravely interfered with.  We are asking that this should be done.  I think it is a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>I might mention incidentally that section 1 is, to put it mildly, phrased in a somewhat ambiguous way.  What the media and many people have not realised is that the Bill which will soon be enacted is permanent, permanent so long as the proclamation of a state of emergency lasts.  It is only section 2 that remains in force for 12 months. The rest of the Bill remains in force permanently until the declaration of a state of emergency dies, in which case, under section 3, the Bill also dies.  It is only section 2 which is covered by this. However, that is only a point by the way.  Obviously, the crux of the matter is this somewhat ambiguous provision in the first two lines of the Bill.  In the early days before people came to realise what was involved in this Bill all the newspapers printed the information&mdash;which I took as gospel until I read the Bill myself&mdash;that this Bill would die after 12 months.  It was an unfortunate way of putting it.</P>
    <P>However, it is section 2 in which we are interested.  I feel that this is a kind of amendment which the Minister would have supported with considerable enthusiasm in his days in Opposition and he would have made the point that I am making&mdash;that it is not an unreasonable or excessive demand, that it is not a demand which would interfere in any way with the ordinary day-to-day legislative activities of either House of the Oireachtas.  We are suggesting that instead of this procedure by order which is of very limited importance and has very little practical effect, that procedure should be brought in, as suggested in this amendment, <Col N="422" /> which would at least ensure that the democratic process was gone through.</P>

      <P>I do not see the logic of this amendment at all when it is set in the context of the arguments that have been made for it. Senator Lenihan's strongest argument &mdash;certainly the one which he emphasised to a great extent during the course of his remarks&mdash;was to the effect that the ordinary Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would not have the information and would not have access to the information as to whether or not the Bill should be continued in operation, that it was only the Government, through secret information they had on private files and so on, who would be in a position to take that decision.  I do not think that is an unfair summary of the argument made by Senator Lenihan.</P>
      <P>What does the Bill provide?  It provides that the responsibility must rest on the Government of making an order to continue the measure or not.  That is exactly what Senator Lenihan argued for.  The Government are the people with the information; the Government are the people with the secret files and all the rest of it who give that information and it is not available to him.  So I do not see the logic of that argument at all.  Nor do I see the logic of the amendment when we consider what is in the Bill and have regard to the fact that it requires that the kernel of the Bill, section 2, expires in 12 months unless it is continued.  I do not think Senator Yeats was quite right in his reading of the Bill, that the measure is there for all time.  It is not, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the expiration of the measure when the resolution declaring a national emergency has been rescinded by this House.  Compare that with the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, the relevant legislation which, up to the passing of this Bill, is the one in force.  There, you have permanent legislation.  There is no need for the Government or anyone else to continue it.  It is there and it can only be ended if it is repealed by the House of the Oireachtas.  That is the distinction between what this Government <Col N="423" /> are doing and what a previous Fianna Fáil Government did in relation to legislation of this type.  What is in question in that?  In this, it is agreed on all sides of the House, what is involved is an extension of five days in the period during which a person can be detained in custody, arrested without warrant and detained in custody. That is what is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Suppose this Bill went in the morning, we are then back on the Fianna Fáil Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which still has the two-day period of detention without trial, which still has the possibility of continuous questioning and interrogation under section 52 of that Act, which is suspended as long as this Act remains in force, specifically suspended because the operation of section 30, under which a person may be arrested under the 1939 Act, as long as this Act is in being, cannot be enforced and, therefore, section 52 of the 1939 Act also goes by the board.  If you took away this Act, we are then back to the Fianna Fáil Act. There is a two-day detention with a possibility of renewal and, under section 52, the possibility of continuous questioning.</P>
    <P>The operative part of this Bill, the extension of detention from a maximum of two days to a maximum of seven days, is all in section 2, and it is laid down in section 1 of this Bill that the operative part of the Bill expires automatically after 12 months unless it is renewed by the Government. Senator Lenihan concedes that the Government are the people with the information as to whether or not it should be renewed.  What is the logic of the argument?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment because there is no doubt that, after one listens to the recitation by the Minister in his defence of the reasons for bringing in this Bill, one has sympathy with the Government that they are facing a very difficult situation.  There are those of us who feel that the situation could have been met by less stringent provisions in certain regards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> Throughout the debate we have seen, both here and in the other House, a laudable measure of contrition on the part of the Government and particularly their more prominent spokesman when in Opposition. Accepting the measure of fallibility that we all must admit to in relation to the assessment of situations of this kind the general thing now, as the Minister said earlier, is that every Opposition must eat its words when in Government; to my mind, it is a very bad sort of admission but it is the admission of the present Government because it is very difficult for them to do anything else in the light of the record against them.  Leaving that aside, without bothering to dwell on it, it seems to me to add to the feeling of contrition.</P>
    <P>The other feeling that most of us learned in the penny cathecism was a firm purpose of amendment, that we would not do the like again and this is something I would like to press on the Minister that they do need help in attempting to assess the seriousness of any situation at any particular time. They were not impressed by the Government when they were in Opposition, but at the same time we had the right to say what we thought and to that extent presumably the Government was helped or they might have ignored our advice, whatever they chose to do, but at least there is this act of faith&mdash;and this is all this amendment seems to me to be&mdash;in the parliamentary process, that admittedly we cannot possibly know as much as the Cabinet know, but that is in respect of a limited part of the problem that they are facing.  What we know is what the country is thinking. We come from all over Ireland, from urban and rural areas, and we hear what people are saying.  We are involved in various discussions, protests, agitations, controversies and, therefore, the whole corpus of the Oireachtas, with all its defects, is the nearest things that the Cabinet get to a consultation with the community as a whole, and that is probably one of the main merits of the whole parliamentary system, this resort to the people through their elected representatives or even people like ourselves, <Col N="425" /> some of whom are not in the ordinary proportional representation but, part of the Oireachtas at any rate and doing our best to help the Government in their dilemma.</P>
    <P>For that reason therefore, I am somewhat surprised at a Government which protests its adherence to the whole concept of democracy, in particular parliamentary democracy, to seek, in some way or another, to try implicitly or directly to set aside this process which has gone on here for some weeks and which I genuinely believe has been a most valuable undertaking even if it had not achieved the objective of changing the Government's mind, which it has done.  In one of his earlier speeches Deputy Donegan, the Minister for Defence, said the Taoiseach was not going to change this legislation by one iota.  All right that is the kind of bombast Governments tend to go on with from time to time, but the reality has been that the bulk of the arguments put forward here and in public is that public opinion has been educated to the grave dangers implicit in this legislation.</P>
    <P>While the Press obviously has been most influential, for its own reasons but certainly it has been most influential, in building up this, I would imagine from the Government's point of view, very frightening counteraction against the legislation, I think the Houses of Parliament have made their own contribution in the kind of opposition that has been put forward by the main Opposition Party obviously, and those of us who have made our own individual contribution. Therefore, on top of setting aside the courts and, as I have emphasised many times this is one of the things that shocks me, particularly the right of appeal to the courts.  In a society such as ours, it appears that we are now getting the next step of attempting to set aside the Houses of Parliament to some extent or to reduce their importance by not giving them the right to come back to a debate at specified periods and tell the Government that this is the kind of reaction we have seen throughout the country and in the light of that then the Government must, as Senator O'Higgins <Col N="426" /> said&mdash;of course they must&mdash;make the final decision.  Nobody can take that authority or power or should have a right to take that authority away from them, but they are acting then in the light of what they have been told <i>bona fide</i> and any other way&mdash;it does not matter&mdash;by their opponents and their supporters and in the light of that then they bring in legislation, or repeat this legislation, make it work if they can, but anyway they submit it to the parliamentary process of open, full and frank debate, fully reported.  We hope that that will continue in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>One has only got to remember the case of Brian Faulkner, who is not a man to make ready submissions of his own fallibility or mistakes, and his obvious chagrin at what he realises now was a very unwise decision to bring in internment, his <i>bona fide</i> attempt to deal with his emergency problems.  He was clearly doing what he thought was the correct thing at that particular time as the politician in charge, taking the responsibility as Senator O'Higgins has said, but it was quite clearly the wrong decision and if he had been better advised he would not have taken it.</P>
    <P>Now that all having been said, there is something even more important here, because the debate has now shown up something particularly sinister in the background of the motivation behind the introduction of this Bill and this was first raised by Senator Owens, Senator Robinson, myself and Senator Michael Mullen, and this is the reference to scheduled offences.  This means to me that this Bill could become a particularly controversial Bill.  The dangers arising out of scheduled offences whereby a certain health authority or municipal authority employee may not picket&mdash;&mdash;</P>

My reference to it incidentally arises from the fact that I understand that the appeal to deschedule <Col N="427" /> these offences has been rejected, and that is why it seems to me to change the whole complexion of the Bill, because it means the Government are quite obstinate in their determination to retain these offences as scheduled offences.  In those circumstances then they become amenable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the whole thing is as simple as that, then the answer is to deschedule these offences, because from now on when this kind of legislation is introduced the Government will be trying to put into operation the seven days proposal, the various other proposals in relation to, possibly, Press control and possibly censorship one way or another, and in those circumstances the public reaction could be very considerable and that the response among Deputies and Senators would be that they would look for an opportunity of trying to put things as they see it through the community, to the Government in order to try to get them to change this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not see the validity of Senator Higgins's rejection of Senator Lenihan's reference to the ordinary Members not having information that only the Ministers would have.  Quite obviously this is a situation which always occurs.  We always come in here with much less information than the Minister could possibly have.  All we are asking is that this process whereby the Minister should give us information which he feels he can permit us to have, which we have not got and which would help us to make up our minds whether he has a good case, should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to see the way the Seanad divided this afternoon to realise that there were some people who shared the Minister's point of view, shared his anxiety to the extent that they voted for him, some of them abstained and some of us voted against.  That reflected the whole process of debate in this House.  Therefore <Col N="428" /> all we are asking is that this process should be retained, that we should retain whatever we can.  As a Senator said last night, every encroachment on the democratic process, on the parliamentary process, is a victory for the militarists.  We should try wherever we can to resist that and to retain this process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the arguments may be in favour of retaining this section or accepting the amendment which has been put down I think one argument that is not acceptable is the argument that is being trotted out again that nothing much is really provided by this Bill.  It is only a matter of five days.  It is only a matter of somebody's liberty being at stake for five days.  It is only a matter so serious that the Government recognised that it would not be possible to bring it in under the law as it existed because the courts would throw it out as being unconstitutional. It is only so serious a matter that the Government found it necessary to bring in a declaration of a national emergency before they could introduce the provisions of this Bill, so that it simply is not acceptable to dismiss this amendmet as not being necessary because nothing very much was provided in this Bill.  It is a serious matter.  The Government or the Government's legal advisers have recognised that it is a serious matter and it cannot be dismissed as of no consequence, as being a mere technicality. What we are discussing in this Bill is a provision that seriously affects the liberty of the individual. In these circumstances should it be possible for the Government to extend it by making an order or should it be necessary for this to be reviewed every year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there are very strong arguments for reviewing the position every year.  This is an Emergency Bill that suggests a matter of urgency, something that is happening now, that may not be in existence in a year's time.  I think it is a matter which should in any event be reviewed and renewed every year.  Then, in the light of the experience of a year we would know whether the Government in introducing <Col N="429" /> this Bill&mdash;with the restriction of rights proposed in it&mdash;were perhaps justified in the sense that nobody in fact suffered unduly under the Bill.  On the other hand, we might find in the light of experience that the reservations and the fears of not only the Opposition but the many bodies, the many newspapers, the many people were in fact justified and that the powers provided in this Bill, even if they should be continued should be restricted in certain ways.</P>
    <P>The arguments are very strongly in favour of ensuring that there will be a renewal of these powers every year, if thought necessary by the Government, that they will be reviewed and that the two Houses should, if they were persuaded by the Government it was necessary to continue their powers, have the opportunity of amending them, of providing certain precautions so that people affected by the Bill would not be affected even more seriously than is necessary within the provisions of this Bill.  After all, what the Government are saying is that they need these powers, that the Garda want these powers and that it is necessary for security that they should be given.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been passed.  They now have these powers.  What we are talking about now is no longer a question of security, it is no longer a question of whether the Government and the security forces have the powers they want, they have them.  What we are talking about now is whether these powers should be circumscribed in certain ways so as to ensure that the liberty and rights of the individual are not infringed more than is necessary and that if, in fact, they appear to be infringed more than is necessary at the end of one year then we will have an opportunity of amending the situation in so far as it is possible to do so.  The amendment I have suggested is a very reasonable one.  It can no longer be said that those who oppose this Bill are trying to prevent the Government or the security forces from having the powers they say they want, they have them now.  It is only a matter of saying whether they should be circumscribed in the certain way so as to have regard to the possible infringement, undue <Col N="430" /> infringement of the individual citizens who may suffer as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am probably in a unique position in the House in relation to this measure and indeed to the whole train of legislation set up by the motion declaring a state of emergency. I voted for that motion.  I voted for the Second Stage of this Bill today. It was with certain misgivings that I voted for both.  On the basis of an emergency, the evidence for and against was rather hard to assess.  I made an act of faith in the Government and said, &ldquo;Yes, if in their judgment the state of emergency is just, then for the moment I will go along with that&rdquo;.  In making that concession I had a number of reservations which are very relevant to what is before us today.  I pointed out, for instance, that I asked if people who are held for seven days will be allowed to have legal advice.</P>

      <P>No, it is precisely this point.  In other words, I have some reservations.  The second one simply had to do with whether relatives would be told.  The third was in regard to where they would be detained and the fourth one was that I said I would find it very difficult to vote for that provision if it did not require reactivation after 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the greatest, the utmost, confidence in the Dáil, and hereafter in the Seanad, that the Government would yield to these very reasonable requests.  I believe that reasonable requests have been put over and over again and have been rejected in the Dáil and of course I was in no position to know, despite the foreshadowings of the Minister's speech today, <Col N="431" /> how these amendments would fare. That is why I say I am in a unique position.  It could in fact be the parting of the ways for me.  This far I could come because I can see that there is what is arguably a state of emergency.  I do see with as much clarity, I would imagine&mdash;I do not flatter myself&mdash;as the Government, the need to put down violence, to oppose and defeat the IRA, to establish the rule of law.  I am persuaded by that but I do not see nor can I be persuaded that such a radical suspension of the democratic process is needed.  Therefore, I absolutely support Senator Lenihan's and Senator Ryan's amendment and I intend equally to support amendments Nos. 7 and 8 put down by Senator Mullen.</P>
    <P>I am happy to go with the Bill as far as I have gone but if the Government reveal themselves as being intransigent on this point I will have to go into the other lobby.  It is with considerable regret that I will have to do it.  It looks like a divided mind on my part but I am quite clear in my mind.  I have come as far as I possibly could and in a spirit of goodwill.  I am astonished by the fact that the Government will not yield on matters such as this.  Above all, I would like to support Senator Browne's remark about the democratic process.  Of course the Minister and his Government have more information than they can safely divulge in public to us.  Let them divulge as much as they can and ask for our trust from that point on. I have given my trust up to this point with regard to this Bill.  If that trust was asked for from the Houses of the Oireachtas it would be given.</P>
    <P>To make the whole thing dependent upon the will of the Government and totally dependent upon an order as distinct from a vote in the two Houses seems to me to take the thing that degree beyond the democratic process which would make me disquited.  It takes it that unnecessary step closer to in melodramatic terms, what we call the police state.  There is enough in the Bill and enough pretty tough things there.  To be able to yield to seven days is one thing but to see that these seven days are, by Government <Col N="432" /> order, going to be carried on <i>ad infinitum</i> as the Government wish&mdash; sin scéil eile.  That is a different matter. One of the few matters which did persuade me that the thing should self-destruct after 12 months.  Then it would have to be renewed.  Then I would feel, as a member of a democracy, right let us see how it works for 12 months.  As an ordinary man in the market place talking to his friends I could then see whether this has been satisfactory.  Our views may not exactly gel with those of the Government. The Government held a majority in order to enforce it at that point.  On this point I would find myself, in conscience, unable to follow the Government another inch along the line.</P>

I do not propose going over that again.  This is tough legislation to deal with an extremely alarming situation which has prevailed here for some years back.  Speaking for myself and the Government we would much prefer if we did not have to introduce it. Indeed, we will welcome the day when it is no longer necessary.  The sooner the better.  We believe we owe it to the citizens to protect them from violent men, whether those violent men are members of one association or another and whether organised or unorganised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am probably correct in saying that over 100 of Senator Mullen's members lost their jobs in a hotel in this city due to bombing.  That is what the reports say.  Staff was reduced by about 120.  The newspaper reports stated that those redundancies were due entirely to the falling off in <Col N="433" /> business due to bombing.  That is the Government's position in regard to this measure.  We regard it as our distasteful duty to stand between the people and violence and to protect them from violence.</P>
    <P>The section as it stands provides that the Bill shall expire 12 months after its enactment unless within that time it is continued in force by a Government order or, if it lapses, unless it is reactivated by a Government order.  In either of those cases a Government order must be made before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Contrary to what some of the Senators opposite think, if a resolution is passed by either House within 21 days the order shall be annulled and the Act shall become defunct.  I am satisfied that if it is necessary to continue the Act by Government order and if such an order is put down, the Government will behave in a reasonable and responsible manner and afford time in a reasonable way to discuss the resolution.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can throw my mind back to the famous social welfare order introduced by Deputy Joe Brennan when Minister for Social Welfare.  A motion to annul that was put down in the Dáil.  There was a long discussion about it.  Deputy Joe Lenehan voted against the Government and left Fianna Fáil as a result.  If the Government were to take the line of refusing to make time available under another form initiated by this Government, there is Private Members' time available now every day the Dáil sits.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Every day the Dáil sits there is Private Members' time available for three hours a week.  That is contrary to the situation as we found it when we came into office.  I repeat that if a resolution is put down and carried in <Col N="434" /> either House the legislation will become defunct.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Lenihan, Senator M.D. Higgins conceded that the Government would be in possession of the facts as to whether it was necessary to continue with this Bill or not.  As the Senators can see, it might very well be that it would not be open to the Minister for Justice or the Government to disclose those facts publicly.  At any rate, if a resolution was put down and discussed in Private Members' time, the Minister for Justice would have to come into the House, give his reasons and disclose his information.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Seanad in a reasonable way that that is proper control. It is effective control over this measure.  It cannot continue in force for longer than one year without the Members of this House and the Lower House being given an opportunity to discuss it and to call the Government to account for its operation. The process of parliamentary question is available all the time. That is the position as I see it.  I put it to the Seanad that the Oireachtas have control over this measure from year to year.  When it is extended, if it is, it can only be for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the amendment.  I do not wish to start scoring points because I am well aware that Opposition Deputies and Senators put down amendments which they have not time to check over, and they have not available to them parliamentary draftsmen. My regarding of this amendment is that it would damage the Bill.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>Unless previously terminated under subsection (2) of this section, this Act shall continue in force until the expiration of twelve months from the date of the passing thereof unless the Oireachtas otherwise determines and shall then expire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe &ldquo;shall then expire&rdquo; are the effective words.  It will expire after 12 months.  That would involve the introduction of a measure in the Dáil to be <Col N="435" /> debated there through all Stages and then come to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I respectfully suggest that that is going much further than conferring on the Oireachtas the role of watchdog in regard to this Bill.  In the Bill as introduced, the Dáil and Seanad have the right to control the Bill.  They have the right to see that it is not continued for more than 12 months.  I respectfully suggest that that is adequate and <Col N="436" /> reasonable.  I ask the Seanad not to accept that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to get confused about this.  What we are really concerned about is making the function of Parliament as watchdog more effective than we would ordinarily wish it, by reason of the nature of this legislation operating as it will for 12 months with suspension of the Constitution for the matters contained in that legislation.  The Government have recognised that fact by having this order procedure written in.  If they seek an extension for a further 12 months to lay an order before the Oireachtas, it puts the onus on either House of the Oireachtas to nullify the order.</P>
      <P>In regard to the seriousness of the legislation and the declaration of a national state of emergency, that is simply not enough.  There is ample precedent for taking that point of view. A Government that was probably more concerned about the rights of Parliament and the rights of the Oireachtas in a far more difficult and dangerous time adopted precisely the procedures I am now advocating.  Under the declaration of emergency in 1939 the emergency powers legislation was renewed every year and was brought before the Oireachtas in those difficult times by way of a Bill.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald in the course of his contribution made that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had omitted to advert to that fact that from 1946 onwards there were certain aspects of emergency legislation dealing with industry and commerce, matters of controlling imports and exports, that were renewed every year.  That legislation was relatively harmless as far as individual rights were concerned.  While the serious part of the legislation under the emergency powers was terminated in 1946, the other part of it, dealing with economic controls and so on, was renewed each year in the form of a Bill by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Because the Government of the day regarded it as a serious matter, because it had in its preamble this very serious matter of the declaration of emergency suspending the Constitution, a Bill was introduced <Col N="437" /> every year.  Similarly during the difficult periods of the war, when the very serious emergency provisions were initiated and continued from 1939 to 1946, each year the Oireachtas met and we had the renewal of the emergency powers by way of legislation in open debate in each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is not by any means a small point.  This is a point where a precedent already exists.  I do not think this is a matter which should be dismissed in an off-hand manner.  It is a serious amendment put down to make the Government accord with the principle and precedent already established in regard to emergency legislation of this kind, on foot of the suspension of the Constitution under Article 28.  In view of the serious nature of the legislation, that is the very least the Government should do by way of duty and obligation to the Oireachtas and to the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne rightly said that this is a matter on which the Government have detailed information regarding security and police matters.  But, on the other hand, as the Government have found out over the last two weeks, this is also an area in which the ordinary man in the street can exercise his judgment as to the need or the validity of this measure.  If we regard ourselves here in the Oireachtas as spokesmen for the people outside&mdash;and that is what parliamentary democracy is all about&mdash; then I feel that we are properly interpreting the mood of the public in saying that they view this legislation with very grave suspicion.  It is not the sort of legislation which they would like to see continue indefinitely by way of an order which may be very difficult to nullify.  This is a matter which, if I am interpreting the public mood properly, they would like to see suspended automatically after 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Government should put forward their reasons for a renewal of authority to introduce such a Bill for a further 12 months and hear the considered views of the Oireachtas, expressing the will of the people in open <Col N="438" /> debate.  It is a matter of deprivation of personal liberties and should be subject to that type of parliamentary and public scrutiny by way of full debate on the Bill.  There is precedent for it already under the emergency legislation passed on foot of the 1939 declaration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I suspect that this amendment has had as much discussion as is likely to do any good.</P>
      <P>I should like to make two brief points.  First of all, regarding the Minister's query about the exact wording of the amendment, the Minister knows as well as we do that in a case like this if the Minister is not willing to accept the principle of the amendment then that is the end of it.  If, on the other hand, he is willing to accept the principle of the amendment, then he has an ample supply of highly efficient parliamentary draftsmen who can bring in an amendment on Report Stage which covers all possibilities.</P>
      <P>The second point is that this amendment, as drafted, seems to be perfectly adequate.  Senator Lenihan and I are correct in our interpretation of the provision.  It is patently obvious that, as Senator Lenihan has said, after 12 months has elapsed&mdash;if our amendment were accepted&mdash;the Bill has lapsed and a new Bill would be needed with all Stages and so on.  Only a very incompetent Government would allow this to happen if they wished the legislation to continue.  All they need to do is to come into the Dáil and Seanad, maybe after 11 months, while the Bill is still in existence, bring in a resolution to extend it for a further 12 months, and they can do this in the ordinary way without going through all the sections of the Bill.  There is no difference between Senator Lenihan's interpretation and mine.  Perhaps Senator Lenihan has a less sanguine view of Government intelligence that I have.  But no Government who wish to continue this legislation would act in the way the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point of the duration of the Emergency Powers Bill, would the Minister accept that the declaration of emergency <Col N="439" /> and the Emergency Powers Bill are intimately linked together, that the purpose of having a motion declaring an emergency was to bring in this Bill which would otherwise be unconstitutional?  In accepting that would he further accept that there is therefore a considerable link between the duration of the motion of the declaration of emergency and the duration of this Emergency Powers Bill?  Therefore is it not a fair question that it is likely that this Bill will remain in annual continuance by Government order for so long as there is a motion of emergency under the present formula of the section?</P>
      <P>If one takes a pessimistic view, as I do, about the length of time that that declaration of emergency will subsist, since it is linked to the existence of armed conflict in Northern Ireland, is it not one interpretation of section 1 that it is creating a permanent Emergency Bill on our Statute Book and that the permanence will be by an annual renewal by Government order?  If that is the case, is this not a new departure in emergency legislation in the country?  I would agree with Senator Lenihan that the precedents before have been for Continuance Acts and therefore involvement of the Oireachtas in the crucial decision&mdash;the decision whether to extend by Continuation Act, whether to prolong.  The present formula under the section&mdash;otherwise the motion for a declaration of emergency has no meaning&mdash;is one for continuing annually by Government order the operation of this section and the existence of power to detain people for seven days.  I view that as a very sad extension of the power of the Government and a diminution of the role of the Oireachtas in the protection of civil liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deliberately trying to make my words as unprovocative and as unexaggerated as possible, but I intimately link the declaration of emergency with the fact that the Bill can be kept in operation from year to year by Government order.  If one looks at the length of time that the previous declaration of emergency remained <Col N="440" /> in existence&mdash;37 years&mdash;and takes into account that this state of emergency is linked to armed conflict in Northern Ireland, can we really anticipate there will be a motion terminating the national emergency in our lifetime?  When will there be a degree of stability in the North which will encourage whatever Government it may be to decide to terminate the state of national emergency?  What other meaning has the state of national emergency except to bring into being and continue in being the powers under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Bill?</P>
    <P>Are we clear about what we are deciding as to the duration of the Emergency Powers Bill?  I am in support of the argument that it should have a fixed duration of 12 months unless there is active Oireachtas participation in its extension, active Oireachtas participation in the criteria for extending it.  That involves assessment of how it is operated, assessment of the need for it, assessment of all sort of things.  The Oireachtas should be in on that assessment. It is not anything like as good a safeguard that it is the Executive that makes that assessment and that there can be a motion annulling the order as laid before the Oireachtas. We had a debate of that sort recently on the Prisons Rules.  There was an opportunity to air the situation and seek annulment, and it was defeated when it came to a vote.  But there was not an opportunity for the Oireachtas to hear the Minister for Justice give substantial reasons for bringing in the order and there would not be the option to hear substantial reasons for the Executive extending the order in this case.  The Government and the Minister would not have to come forward with the reasons for wanting the operative section&mdash;section 2 of the Emergency Powers Bill&mdash;to continue in effect.</P>
    <P>Because this Bill is linked with the emergency motion, I am afraid that the formula we are adopting is one of &mdash;in practice&mdash;continuance of this Emergency Powers Bill in full operation until the end of the state of emergency is declared by the Oireachtas. <Col N="441" /> We ought to face the stark reality of that and realise how much we are conceding in the Bill, which is a new departure in emergency legislation, and the fact that the Oireachtas will not participate actively unless this amendment is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that this legislation is directed at people and organisations who do not recognise the Oireachtas.  That being so, I would expect the Minister to be more amenable to representations made to him by people who recognise the Oireachtas.  The Minister talked in his reply about tough legislation. I can understand that, but I do not think he should be tough with the representations made to him in helping him out of an awkward situation. It is not fair and does not augur well for allaying the fears that exist in the minds of people who are not in favour of illegal organisations.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his reply spoke about a number of people who lost their employment in a hotel because of bombing.  He said he had read this in a newspaper.  I was intrigued that he took serious notice of what appeared in newspapers, because they have advocated that certain things should be done in regard to this Bill and the Minister has so far not responded to what he has read in the newspapers in that connection.  The excuse that was given was not the whole story.  It is only right to say that a good portion of the unemployment that was mentioned can be attributed to the last budget.  There is a great fear that there may be more people made redundant as a result of this declaration of emergency. This has appeared in the newspapers. We have been getting responses from abroad because of the declaration of the emergency.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision to oppose this amendment.  As I said at the outset, it will help to allay the fears of genuine people and not subversives. We should not be attaching any labels to people because they express their concern about civil liberties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The ingenuousness of <Col N="442" /> the Government is the most striking thing about this whole debate.  It appears that they came into the House originally not fully appreciating the enormity of the suggestions that they were putting to us here and in the other House.  They do not seem to have appreciated the structural changes in the whole process of representative democracy which they have brought about by this legislation, that is taking the three proposals together&mdash;the motion, the Emergency Powers Bill and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill.</P>
      <P>Having gone through a very traumatic experience in so far as they have come to realise that it was a monumental blunder in political terms, that they have alienated an enormous amount of support and frightened and worried people, it is possible that this may be the motivating factor in deciding that they do not want to go through it every year.  It still leaves these proposals as being very serious proposals, remarkable proposals from people who purport to be defending the whole democratic process.  Remember, whatever else is contained in the Bill&mdash; the extension of powers, the seven days, the imprisonment, the Army and all the other horrific measures which are proposed&mdash;this is nothing to do with what the security forces want.  This is simply a request that we, responsible Members of the Oireachtas, be given an opportunity to discuss this matter and help the Government to come to a decision as to whether these measures should be extended, whether they should be attenuated, whether they should be maintained as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not confuse the two things.  We are talking now as if there was an emergency in this House.  There is not.  There is an emergency outside. The Garda think there is an emergency; the Army think there is an emergency; the Government believe there is an emergency in relation to what is going on outside.  But in relation to this House and the whole parliamentary process there is no emergency at all.  We are simply asking <Col N="443" /> that we be allowed to discuss this at annual intervals.  That is not going to aid any subversive organisations or individuals who want to overthrow the State.  We are trying to protect the rights that the Oireachtas has.  Nobody could protest that this could jeopardise the security of the State.</P>
    <P>Is that the case that is being made by the Government, that, if we discuss this in this way each year, we are in some way jeopardising the safety or security of the State?  If so, they should say so, and that they want to attenuate the powers of the Oireachtas, as they now have in relation to the High Court and the Supreme Court. Are they intent on dismantling the whole process of parliamentary democracy of the State?  Senator Martin said that we are beginning a police state. They are evocative phrases.  Is this what is happening?  A Minister who says to us blandly that this can be discussed by a resolution and the Government will probably give us a guarantee. This is not a guarantee.  I am sure the Minister gives it meaning it in every sense, but he cannot insist in a year's time that time will be given for such a resolution.</P>
    <P>It is particularly tasteless for him to say that we could discuss these desperately serious proposals in Private Members' time.  He cannot be serious when he puts forward a proposal of that kind in relation to these measures. There is no doubt that it is we who are opposing the Government's attempt to dismantle this whole parliamentary process.  Nobody can say that it could have anything to do with what is going on outside.</P>
    <P>The case I am trying to make is that we have parliamentary democracy throughout the world in which fewer and fewer powers are permitted to the members of the various parliaments. We are frightened at the positive naivety of these proposals that have been brought before us, expecting that they would pass through the House as if they were irrelevant to the lifestyle of our people as we know it, particularly in relation to their civil rights and liberties before the law.  It is this tendency by the Government to underrate <Col N="444" /> the seriousness of what they are doing that is the most disturbing part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister one question? If he has answered the question already, I apologise for not being present to hear the answer.  It is a simple question which Senator Robinson asked last night.  Perhaps the Minister could help us.  The Minister said that it would be possible for the Director of Public Prosecutions to change what has gone on up to now, the process whereby persons who are not at present covered by the Trade Disputes Act would come under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  Could the Minister give us an undertaking now that he will make sure that this will not happen but that it cannot in law happen &mdash;that the Director of Public Prosecutions cannot take it upon himself to direct at any particular time that persons at present not covered by the Trade Disputes Act can be brought under this legislation?</P>

It was scheduled by an order in 1972 and was not raised by Senator Browne or anybody else for one very good reason: it did not affect anybody. I told Senator Browne that it was introduced to protect the homes and privacy of judges and their families, to protect those houses from picketing and abuse.  I gave an unqualified undertaking on behalf of myself and the Government to Senator Connolly that the provisions <Col N="445" /> of that section, as long as it remained a separate section, would not be used against trade unionists or unemployed people engaged in peaceful picketing or peaceful marching.

The Government could not give a direction, and never would, and that is why we appointed a Director of Public Prosecutions. We could not give a direction that the Garda were not to prosecute A for an offence but were to prosecute B.  I do not see anything wrong in the Minister for Justice giving a blanket indication to the Commissioner of the Garda that this machinery is not to be used in respect of trade unionists engaged in peaceful marches or peaceful picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of whether there was any link <Col N="446" /> between the resolution declaring the emergency and the Bill.  Of course, there is a connection between the two. One school of thought suggested that it would have been possible to introduce this Bill under the 1939 resolution. Another school of thought that that would not be possible, that the Supreme Court might rule that that was not in order.  The Government decided that the proper thing to do was to annul the resolution which could, and probably should have been annulled during the time of previous Governments and to bring in this resolution.</P>
    <P>I say with all sincerity that we all long for the day when that resolution can be annulled and when this legislation can be forgotten.  I do not accept the suggestion of Senator Robinson&mdash;and I do not think she is right, with all respect&mdash;that as long as the resolution is there this Bill will be renewed year after year by order.  That is not so.  It will only be renewed by a responsible Government as long as they feel there is necessity for it. Senator Robinson also made the case that we are trying to keep the Bill in force from year to year by order.  Of course, we can have the converse of that and say that we are conferring on either House of Oireachtas the right, by resolution, to discontinue the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat to the House and to the public, because some of these things are not understood, that a resolution of either House, a simple majority of either House will annul the order.  It takes the same vote to enact a Bill, the same number of people thinking the same way.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are supposed to oppose and they can engage in hardluck stories and can consider fantasy here and there, but the greatest guarantee that any democracy has against a malevolent or reckless government is the ballot box.  There will be a general election before March, 1978.  If the people think that this legislation is not right they will let us know then.  That is the one day when they can talk to us not through Senator Noel Browne or anybody else.  On that day they can talk direct to the <Col N="447" /> Government and tell them what they think about them.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We did not have to fix Donegal; it fixed itself.  If that were so, even after the next election there would always be an election in the offing.  Parliamentary parties are bound to keep their eyes on an election.  Maybe that is fraternising and far be it from me to be fraternising.  I can even understand the attitude being taken by the Opposition as an Opposition attitude but they are expressing unreal fears. In this Bill we, in either House of the Oireachtas, have the right to question the Government each year.  That cannot be denied.  In that respect we are treating this Bill as something above the ordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this was an ordinary Bill which <Col N="448" /> we did not look upon as taking unusual powers, there would be no provision for annulment each year.  It would simply go on the statute book as a part of our law and would remain there until some future Oireachtas revoked it.  We do recognise that it is something above the ordinary, that it is seeking powers which are not normal powers.  That is why we have written into this Bill the safeguard which enables both Houses to vet it and to call the Government to task on it each year.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Fianna Fáil want me to continue it by an order each year or whether they want me to introduce a new Bill.  I have given this matter plenty of consideration and discussion and I am satisfied that the machinery contained in the section as it stands is an adequate safeguard for any reasonable person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 2, line 44, to delete &ldquo;, or is in possession of information,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the possibility of a mere innocent witness being subject to the powers contained in this section.  It seems to me quite possible that this section, if it is read leaving out certain lines, would read like this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána (on production of his identification card, if demanded, <Col N="449" /> where he is not in uniform) may without warrant stop, search, question and arrest any person if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person ... is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information, relating to the commission or intended commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is not the intention that an innocent witness of a crime should be arrested and held in custody for seven days; nevertheless that is what the section says.  Intentions are quite irrelevant when we are dealing with legislation of this kind.  The position is that a person could be arrested, could be detained for seven days if he was in possession of information about a crime and it is not good enough to say that it would not happen, the Garda are reasonable people and so on.</P>
    <P>If a person were in possession of information, if he did possibly see something happening, a garda would be quite entitled to arrest him, take him into custody and keep/him there for seven days.  We are putting down this amendment to obviate that possibility. If the Minister wants to amend the section in some other way in order to get the same result without the possibility of what I have in mind, then if he indicates that he will bring in some other amendment on Report Stage I will be quite satisfied.  Certainly as the section stands it is capable of being abused.  It is capable of being interpreted in a way which would result in a perfectly innocent person being detained for seven days and for that reason the amendment is put down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The object or intention is not that some innocent witness who accidentally came across some information should be brought into custody and kept in custody for seven days.  That is not the intention.  That will not happen. The best way really to test a provision in an Act like this is to try to find out if there has ever been a similar position in any similar Act and if there has been such a provision to ask oneself, has it been abused, have innocent people been brought in and harassed under it?  I am in the fortunate position <Col N="450" /> of having a perfect precedent which shows that such a provision has been in operation for 37 years and no one has heard of it ever being abused. I will read for the benefit of the Seanad section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939:</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána (if he is not uniform on production of his identification card if demanded) may without warrant stop, search, interrogate, and arrest any person, or do any one or more of those things in respect of any person, whom he suspects of having committed or being about to commit or being or having been concerned in the commission of an offence under any section or subsection of this Act or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of this Act or whom he suspects of carrying a document relating to the commission or intended commission of any such offence as aforesaid or whom he suspects of being in possession of information relating to the commission or intended commission of any such offence as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>That is the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and it was enacted on the 14th June, 1939, and has been in force since.  It has been operated by Senator Ryan's party when in Government, it has been operated by inter-Party Governments and is now being operated by the National Coalition and there have been no abuses because police officers and gardaí behaved in a reasonable way.  That section now goes, or at least is being suspended for the duration of the present section, and with it goes section 52.  I put it to the House, and I have some considerable confidence that Senator Ryan, having put down the amendment in all good faith and having got my assurance that the intention behind the provisions in the section which are worrying them is to get at people with guilty information and not to get at innocent people, will accept the fact that an exactly similar provision has been on the statute book since 14th June, 1939, and that there is no evidence or complaint of any abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to make a long speech on this but the point raised by Senator Eoin Ryan is a very valid point and the Minister has not adverted to it in that the section he refers to, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, is part of the ordinary law of the land and it is subject to the strictures of the Constitution. It is permanent legislation.  That disposes of that point.  This is an entirely different matter.  It behoves the Oireachtas to be far stricter in its scrutiny of this measure because this is a measure on foot of the suspension of the Constitution for the purposes contained in this measure.  We were talking about section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act subject to the supervision of the Constitution relating only to detention for 48 hours.  That is one side.  What we are talking about now is detention for seven days without any constitutional supervision in regard to it, and police powers relating to such a situation of the suspension of Constitution.  In that situation of course it is the duty of every Member of the Oireachtas to address the Minister and the Government to the fact that every line of such a Bill must be scrutinised and parsed so that what the Executive get is the minimum they should get by reason of the very drastic and serious suspension of the Constitution involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is the very minimum to suggest, as we suggested in this amendment, the deletion of the words &ldquo;or is in possession of information&rdquo; because when the section is examined fully those six words in effect bring in the harmless onlooker and bring him within the ambit of police arrest without charge and subject to detention without charge for seven days.  Other than that, the section relates only to suspicion in the garda's mind as to the commission or the intention to commit an offence.  Other than those six words the section taken as a whole deals with an offender or a potential offender. The only words in it that we seek to have deleted widen the ambit of section 2 (1) to a very wide degree, indeed, to involve an onlooker who is in possession of information, a witness or harmless bystander who sees an offence being committed.  All we are <Col N="452" /> seeking to have deleted are the words &ldquo;or is in possession of information&rdquo;. That type of person, by reason of these six words can be brought within the ambit of police arrest without charge and is subject potentially to detention for seven days.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a practical man and he will appreciate that the plain meaning of those words is to widen the scope of the section to include the sort of person I was talking about.  We do not want any suspicion even in this House that we are seeking to include that sort of person in a Bill of this kind, and this is not just suspicion.  It is the hard reality of the language and its plain, blunt English.  The onlooker in possession of information, the person who sees an offence being committed, a harmless onlooker, witness, bystander, can be brought within the scope of this section.  This deletion, put forcibly by Senator E. Ryan, would make this section totally clean in that it would be quite clear that the section as a whole is dealing with arrest by the Garda of an offender or suspect offender or potential offender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister believes that an undertaking given to us has any real value.  I say that without any disrespect.  It is quite clear from the intervention of the last section and the undertaking which I am sure he as Minister for Justice would give that in present circumstances the persons not covered by the Trades Dispute Act, 1906, will not be involved under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875. However, it is quite obvious that powers of discretion rest with the Director of Public Prosecutions and, therefore, the undertaking which Ministers give here that they will forbid it to the extent which they have that power&mdash;as the Minister talks about the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions it seems to me rather anomalous that he should believe that he can override whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that point. This, of course, is the gravamen of the case which I am making, that he is not in a position to implement his good intentions, however well-intended they are.  All that matters to us is the law as it stands and the structures of the State as they stand. While the Minister may not wish or have intended that in relation to the individual in possession of information, in relation to the other point which he was trying to make that for the time being, until things hot up, this Bill is restricted only to what are known as the subversives of the Provo type, it is quite clear that can change and this Bill could become a very frightening one.  If there is a crime which is now scheduled, a forbidden picketing or something like that or any action taken under section 7 of the 1875 Act, people who saw the particular besetting act, picketing or whatever taking place, could be intimidated as persons with information and they then become subject to all the provisions of this legislation, the important difference being, of course, the denial of right of appeal to the Supreme Court and the daunting prospect to any individual of being taken by the Garda for a period of seven days.</P>
      <P>That is a very frightening prospect with the possibility of one finding oneself in the custody of men who are in the minority but who we know have in the past abused the authority and power which they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bystander, the person taking part in a march, protest or picket, or the person who watched a crime all come under this as individuals with information and, therefore, subject to the provision of denial of their constitutional rights and subjected to the various provisions of this Bill, including the one to which most of us took exception, being held <i>incommunicado.</i> If we were certain that access to lawyers, doctors, relatives and so on could be guaranteed at regular stated intervals during the seven days it might not be so terrifying a prospect. <Col N="454" /> I use the word &ldquo;terrifying&rdquo; advisedly. The possibilities in this situation are quite unlimited for persons who want to subject an individual to the sophisticated modern torture processes of hooding, white sound, sensory deprivation and so on.  Individuals having watched a crime committed, innocently of course, or taking part in one of these other scheduled offences which will be brought under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act could be put in fear of protest by the prospect of the provisions of this Bill.  The denial of Constitutional rights and the possibility of being subjected to the terrifying experience of being simply isolated for seven days, would be terrifying to some people.  Subjection to either the sophisticated or brutal types of torture becomes a very powerful deterrent against what up to now had been perfectly legitimate activities by trade unionists, workers, individuals, ordinary civilians.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside that, saying it is not at issue at the present time, it opens the possibility of an individual being used by the Garda.  I am talking now about the corrupted members of the Garda.  They are a minority, and we must all accept that there is such a minority in all our professions and trades, people capable of betraying the trust given to them within their responsibilities. There is always the danger of an individual like that being used, even framed by such people, to provide evidence which is not true evidence, which is simply the evidence of an individual so terrified that he will say anything.  This is the possibility as we have seen from our own experience of the recent disclosures in Strasbourg in the various torture cases.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us to sit here in this peaceful atmosphere but I have some experience of activities on the streets, agitations of one kind or another, protest marches, pickets and so on, and I have seen some dreadful things happening.  I have seen people beaten up by members of the Garda.  I have attempted to charge members of the Garda but unfortunately people <Col N="455" /> were too frightened and would not let me charge them for having violently dealt with one young student.  The decisions being taken here may be wrong because they are taken so far away from the action, because some people may not have a lot of experience of what can go on in a disturbed situation.  I would like to ask the Minister to try to reduce to the minimum the likelihood of abuses of the kind to which we are referring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes the deletion in line 44 of the words &ldquo;or is in possession of information&rdquo;. The point made with regard to this is that somebody with no sinister intention, with no criminal or subversive background, somebody who committed no offence of any kind, who was guilty of nothing but being present when some kind of misdemeanour took place, could, according to section 2 of the Bill, be taken and detained for seven days.  The amendment proposes that these words &ldquo;in possession of information&rdquo; should therefore be deleted.</P>
      <P>I wish to support that motion for various reasons, some of them already mentioned by Senators.  One of them is the humane reason that it is not impossible that somebody absolutely innocent could find himself in this horrific situation of being taken and incarcerated because he had been witness to something which was not in itself even remotely approaching a crime or a misdemeanour.  The words would not be considered sinister or ominous if we had not been consistently refused the kind of reassurances we looked for, of the kind I mentioned in my initial speech when I gave my assent to the state of national emergency.  That consent was provisional on certain remarks, and I refer to the Seanad Official Report, column 183 of 1st September, 1976:</P>
      <P>...will the people who are held for seven days be allowed have legal advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> Would this man who was deemed to be in possession of information be allowed legal advice?  We do not know.  The Bill certainly does not resolve that issue for us.  We are assured of course of the goodwill of the Government.  That is not enough.</P>
    <P>Will their relatives be told that they have been detained?</P>
    <P>Will the relatives of such a man, having been arrested on the grounds indicated, know that he has been detained?</P>
    <P>The third question I asked was:</P>
    <P>Will he be allowed medical inspection or will they, in fact, be held <i>incommunicado</i> for seven days in &ldquo;a place of convenience&rdquo;, as the phrase is, perhaps an unknown place.</P>
    <P>We have not been reassured with regard to that either.  In other words, in so far as the Bill is concerned, such a person who is deemed to be, in the opinion of a member of the Garda in possession of information, if he is taken in, is not allowed any of these rudimentary defences.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the integrity of the Garda.  I should like to add my voice to those of all the others who praised the Garda as a force.  My sincere opinion of them is that they are an excellent police force, and I am not aware that they have committed any act dishonourable towards their cause.  The point about it is that we want them to remain so. As a citizen of the State I should like to be able to hold the Garda in the same regard in which I have always held them.  If the Garda are given this power, there is an implicit invitation, if not compulsion, to exercise that power, just as when in the other Bill, the Criminal Law Bill, sentences are raised there is almost a moral compulsion that sentences should be raised accordingly.</P>
    <P>Similarly when powers such as these are given to a police force there is of course the intention that these powers be used.  I do not want these powers granted in a blanket manner to the police for the sake of the police themselves and our relationship with them. The very benign relationship that exists between the Irish citizen and <Col N="457" /> the Garda at present could change very quickly and drastically if powers of this kind were even suspected of being exercised by them, especially in view of the fact that the Government have already refused the reasonable request that in order to make this legislation operative after the first 12 months the Oireachtas should say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to it.  In other words, against the background of the three conditions I have already referred to and the fact that the Act can be renewed by Government Order, that provision is of a kind I could not support.</P>
    <P>I find this disappointing because when I voted for the national emergency I was absolutely convinced that the Government would accept reasonable amendments.  I was astonished to see them being refused in the other House, one after another.  I was also astonished to see such ludicrous activity as that carried on by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in Washington, producing from a satchel a whole series of letters to an editor in an Irish newspaper.  I was appalled by such activity.  Still, I found it possible to come in today and vote for the Second Stage of this Bill in the belief that perhaps even at this eleventh hour the Government would see sense with regard to these reasonable and courteous requests for reassurances with regard to the items I mentioned.  Indeed, I would not be objecting to that phrase if the Minister had in the first place granted to the House the first amendment put forward by Senators Lenihan and Eoin Ryan.  In other words, if we knew that after a year we would be asked to say yea or nay to this legislation I might let is go that far.  As it stands, all the reasonable, civilised demands and requests that have been made have been rejected.  Therefore, I find myself in a position which is probably not unique but which I have not seen in the life of this Seanad&mdash;the position of voting for a measure on the First and Second Reading but being forced on Committee Stage to declare myself implacably opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I am quite convinced of Senator Martin's sincerity <Col N="458" /> in the attitude which he has adopted.  It is an attitude which takes some courage to adopt, and if the position were as argued by him, I could have a great deal of sympathy with it.  It seems to me his arguments are based on a degree of ignorance of the present position, which must be excused in a Senator who has not had any great experience in the House and who has not had occasion heretofore to do any research on this particular matter.  Senator Martin very properly pays a compliment to the Garda Síochána as an excellent police force. Then he makes the case, which could be a very effective case, that he wants them to continue to be like that. While he did not use the expression, I think the cliché that power corrupts was probably what was in his mind; he wanted the police force to remain an excellent one and that is the reason he did not want them to get these powers.  What Senator Martin did not know or apparently did not realise was that for the last 30-odd years the Garda Síochána have had precisely these powers.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the benign relations between the Garda and the public in regard to a power which they already have?  Let me emphasise this because it is important that a young Senator of the genuine and sincere concern of Senator Martin should be kept right on this.  It is an important matter.  This is not a debating society.  We are talking about State security.  We are talking about something which is of vital concern to this State and to every citizen in it. We are talking about an effort by this Government to enlarge the liberties of the people by destroying a criminal conspiracy aimed at destroying this State and the people.  That is what this is about.  It is not any theoretical discussion about niceties in a debating society fashion, and let us keep to it.</P>
      <P>It is all right to talk about spoiling the police by giving them powers but recognise the fact that they have those powers already and they have even greater powers in so far as information is concerned in section 2 of this Bill. Under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act they do not have to have reasonable grounds for their suspicion and they cannot be challenged about that.  Under this Bill in section 2 they have got to have positive suspicion, not a vague suspicion; they have to have that suspicion based on reasonable cause and they have to be able to go into court and satisfy a court in the event of a <i>habeas corpus</i> application being made that the person's detention is not unlawful because they have reasonable grounds for suspecting.</P>

      <P>The arrest of anyone is a subjective matter as far <Col N="460" /> as the person who is arrested is concerned. Those are the facts.  It is true that once it is proved that the arrest has been made in accordance with this section there can be no constitutional challenge to the validity of the law and the <i>habeas corpus</i> could not be granted on the grounds that this law is repugnant to the Constitution.  It is still necessary, if a <i>habeas corpus</i> application is made, that the court be satisfied that the arrest was lawful.  If the Garda made an arrest without having suspicion based on reasonable grounds, that would be an unlawful arrest.  A court would be constrained to grant an application for <i>habeas corpus</i>.  There is a constitutional obligation on the court, if an application is made, to inquire into it immediately.  There cannot be any delay about it.  Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could sympathise with the argument made by Senator Martin were it not for the fact that the Garda have these powers already and have powers which are greater because their suspicion need not be based on reasonable cause, and they do not have to show reasonable cause for their suspicion.  If that was the argument on which Senator Martin was relying I could go a long way with him were it not for that fact.  It seems to me implicit in this argument that there is an air of unreality which must subconsciously, not deliberately, be based on the idea that the Garda or a certain proportion of them are sadists and monsters who are going to use this legislation in a way which no democratic parliament or member of a government would be prepared to stand over.  I do not think that that is realistic.  They have had this power since 1939.  Senators are placing on record in this House their firm conviction that those powers have not been abused by the Garda.  Why should we suddenly assume that they are going to abuse them now?  Why should we assume, for the purpose of this debate, that a decent body of men or an excellent police force&mdash;to use Senator Martin's words&mdash;are suddenly going to be turned into a body of monsters because under this Bill they get a lesser power than they have already so far as arrest in respect of <Col N="461" /> information is concerned?  I say &ldquo;lesser&rdquo; and I say it deliberately, because they do not have to show reasonable grounds for suspicion under the 1939 Act.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson is an exception to many things.  I do not say that in a derogatory sense.  What would the procedure be?  The powers being given under section 2 are powers to stop, to search, to question and to arrest, to do any or all of those.  If the Garda are looking for information, is not the first thing they are going to do to question?  In the event of their having reasonable grounds for suspicion that a person has information and when he is questioned and refuses to give that information, is it not only then that the next step, which is the power of arrest, is put into operation? What is the information relating to? It is relating to offences which go to the very roots of the security of this <Col N="462" /> State, offences set out in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
      <P>We are talking about people usurping the functions of the Government. We are talking about people who, by force of arms, try to prevent the Government of this country functioning, or try to prevent the President of this country from carrying out his functions, or try to prevent any other Executive branch of Government&mdash; the judiciary, the Garda, the civil service or the Army&mdash;carrying out their functions by force of arms.  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about a person who has information and who is not prepared to disclose that information when questioned by the Garda.</P>
      <P>All right, it may be an innocent person, a person who happened to be a witness.  How far is that person innocent if he blatanly fails in his civic duty to volunteer that information to the Garda?  If he does not volunteer that information to the Garda and is questioned about it, is he still a lily-white pure innocent such as Senator Martin's heart beats for?  I doubt it. If that person is not innocent, what then is the most probable situation? What is this legislation directed against?  It is against the conspirator who is trying to bring down this State and to harm its people, the conspirator who has information, who has knowledge that people are acting, going to act or have acted to usurp the authority of the Government by force of arms or to do any of the other acts which are set out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, we have had a lot of enlightenment on this section as a result of Senator O'Higgins's remarks.  I am not sure of how to approach this because, first of all, we have had a contribution from the Minister which was to the effect that we need not worry about the possibility of any witness being affected by this section.  We have had the exact opposite from Senator O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>It is almost incredible that Senator O'Higgins would make the speech he did and try to avoid facing up to the reality of this Bill and this section, and not face up to the fact that what we are all talking about in this Bill is that detention which was two days is being extended to seven days.  The important matter is that; it has always been that.  It was necessary to have a declaration of a national emergency to increase the time for which a person could be detained from two days to five days.  That has been the objection to this Bill all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I put down dealt with the particular aspect of that and, in spite of the fact that every effort has been made to try to confuse the issue, that is still the kernel of our <Col N="465" /> objection to the Bill and that is still the kernel of this amendment.  If we object to the idea that a person who is believed to have committed an offence, which is the first category dealt with in section 2, may be arrested and put into custody by a garda who has reasonable cause to believe this person has committed a crime, it is ten times worse that a person who merely has information or was a witness to something could be kept in custody for seven days.  To say that because it is in the 1939 Act that there can be no objection to this section is utter nonsense because it was in the last section, in section 30.  The objection to it, just like the objection to every other aspect of this section, is that when a person had information, or was a witness, under the 1939 measure the maximum period for which he could be detained was 48 hours.  Now a witness of that kind can be detained for seven days.  That is what we are quoting and the fact that it was in the previous measure is not relevant at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could take an action if he was only detained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that there has to be a reasonable cause or that he must be suspected with reasonable cause may be of some slight help but, in fact, any member of the security forces who arrests anybody must have some kind of reasonable cause or must have some reason for doing so.  This is a theoretical advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not have to emphasise this fact but people will go on talking about this amendment as though the only thing in it was that there was a witness concerned and that because that was in the previous Bill, then it does not matter.  The fact is that a witness who could only be detained for two days can now be detained for seven days and it makes it ten times worse for a person who may not be guilty of anything, whatever about a person whom a guard has reason to believe committed a crime.  It is ten times worse if a person who is merely a witness is subject to these powers and subject to the possibility <Col N="466" /> of being detained for seven days. That is the kernel of this section, that is the kernel of this amendment and that is why we object to it.</P>
    <P>Now I am a little bit put off by what Senator O'Higgins has said because apparently Senator O'Higgins thinks that this is quite all right, that if a person has information then there is no reason why he should not be detained for seven days.  I got the impression from the Minister that I should not be worried because, of course, that was not the intention and that would never happen.  So I am not quite sure where I stand.</P>
    <P>This whole discussion brings us back to this kind of woolly thinking, this kind of loosely-worded section which can have various different meanings and it is not good enough to say, as the Minister has said, that this possible interpretation of the section would not be acted upon, that the Minister has no intention of allowing anybody to be arrested and kept in custody merely because he was a witness. It is not good enough, as the Minister for Justice has said, that he would issue directives and guidelines and so on to ensure that the powers were not abused in that kind of way.  That is quite simply not good enough.  The Bill should say exactly what is intended by the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas should know exactly what it intends the Bill to contain because the Minister, however good his intentions may be, will not be there forever and it is no good relying on what the Minister's good intentions are.</P>
    <P>The security forces are entitled to assume that the Oireachtas knew what they were doing, that the Oireachtas meant exactly what is in the Bill and the security forces are entitled to take advantage of this Bill as it stands at the present time.  If a guard has reason to believe that a person was in possession of information that might merely mean that somebody might have told him where an explosion took place or that this person was merely passing by on his bicycle. <Col N="467" /> On that basis, as the Bill stands at the moment, a guard would be entitled to arrest that person and keep him in custody because he is in possession of information, not in possession of information of something that was going to happen but information about something that has happened.  The security forces would be entitled to arrest him and keep him in custody merely because they had reason to believe that he was in the vicinity and that he might have seen something.</P>
    <P>Are we going to allow this Bill to go through and allow a situation where a perfectly innocent person, who was in the vicinity of something that happened and who might have information, can be detained for seven days?  Of course, it may never happen. Of course, it probably will never happen but the fact is that it may happen and, according to the Bill, it could happen.  It is no use talking about intentions or guidelines or anything else. That is the way the Bill reads.  That is the way the security forces are entitled to interpret it and if they are in a tough spot and badly need information and think somebody has it, they are entitled to take the section as it stands there and that means that they can arrest and detain somebody for seven days because they think he might have information.</P>
    <P>There is no use making long speeches about what we are up against in this country, terrorists and so on. We know all that.  We are all in agreement on that and the measure has now been passed and the Minister has his powers.  He does not have to worry any more.  The Bill is passed.  He has his powers.  What we are doing at the moment here at this stage, Committee Stage, is not trying to deprive the Minister of any real powers but trying to ensure that the Bill which goes through is a Bill that will only affect people who really are terrorists, who really have as the guards have reason to believe, committed a crime.  We are merely trying to ensure that some body who is innocent is not affected by the powers in this section.  As it stands at the moment, that is a distinct possibility and if the Minister says <Col N="468" /> that is not intended, then I think he should take such steps as are necessary by way of amendment.  He can either accept this amendment or introduce a more sophisticated one if he does not like this one, if he agrees that this is a possibility which should be catered for.  Of course, if the Minister or the Government take Senator O'Higgins's point of view that anybody who happens to have information is just as bad as the person who has committed the crime and they should all be thrown into jail for seven days, then that is a different matter altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some clarification from the Minister about the scope of section 2 so that I can consider the amendment being put forward.  I am still slightly confused about precisely what the power is and I think it is important that we do have some clarification on it. It provides that a member of the Garda Síochána can without warrant, stop, search, question and arrest any person.  Now the matter has been clarified.  I welcome the clarification that section 30 and section 52 are suspended so there cannot be the sort of questioning that the section 52 powers gave, the power of requisition where one had to answer the questions and the giving of either false or misleading information was in itself an offence.  I understand that power has been suspended and does not operate in relation to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other section that I can find where there is a somewhat analogous power is section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, which gives power to question a person found near the place of commission of a scheduled offence which, of course, would include all offences under the Offences Against <Col N="469" /> the State Act.  Section 2 of that Act provides that a member of the Garda may demand of the person his name and address and an account of his recent movements and, if the person fails or refuses to give the information or gives information that is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>So operating under that section of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, there is power to require an account of movements and there is a fine or imprisonment for false or misleading information. If one is acting under section 2 of the Emergency Powers Bill, as I now understand it, then there is power to question and I would welcome some clarification from the Minister on what is meant by &ldquo;question&rdquo; in that context.</P>
    <P>What are the powers of the Garda to question, in view of the fact that section 30 and, therefore, as a consequence, section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 are suspended and not in operation?  I had pointed out that the only other section which I could find under which the Garda have power to question for an account of movements is section 2 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972 which states that where a member of the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is at or near the place of the commission of a scheduled offence or has committed a scheduled offence &mdash;which of course includes the whole of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>If the Garda can question but cannot question in the sense of section 52 of requisitions which the person must answer&mdash;give an account of his movements and the movements of another person and incur criminal penalties for failure to do so or for giving misleading information&mdash;what is meant by &ldquo;question&rdquo;?  If the Garda do question and the person remains silent, which is the normal principal against <Col N="470" /> self-incrimination, the right of an accused to remain silent, is it now the position that the Garda cannot further question under section 52, because that is suspended, but can detain for 48 hours and a further five days? Is that the scope of the situation?  If so, in the light of the amendment accepted and the suspension of sections 30 and 52, does this part of the section have much meaning if a person cannot be required to account for the movements of another person or give information during questioning and has the right to remain silent? I think it is relevant to understanding the scope of the section.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> There used to be a radio programme entitled &ldquo;What are they talking about?&rdquo;  I would like to get down to that very topic here at the moment. Section 2 of the Bill enables&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>A member of the Garda Síochána ...if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person has committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence...or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information, relating to the...intended commission of the offence.</P>
      <P>I put it to the House that all those things are linked.  We are dealing here with somebody who is a guilty person in connection with the thing and that we are not dealing with an innocent bystander or witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A member of the Garda Síochána may...without warrant stop, search, question and arrest any person, or do any one or more of those things in respect of any person, if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person has committed, is committing or is about to commit an offence under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act, or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information, relating <Col N="471" /> to the commission or intended commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>We specify the person there who is carrying an article or thing in relation to the offence.  He has the guilty article or thing connected with the offence on him.  Then we go on to deal with the person who has not got the article or thing connected with the offence but has the knowledge relating to the offence.  I put it to the House as a proposition that that is the meaning that any court would put on it.</P>
    <P>If a garda has that reasonable suspicion he can take that person in and that person's rights will be as they are today.  In fact, they will be more favourable to him than they are today because section 52 is gone.  That is the position as I see it.  I do not think that any reasonable person will disagree with me.</P>

There is no use saying to me, in regard to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, that it is 48 hours there and seven days here because I put it to any impartial person that the principle is the same and that is what is important.</P>
      <P>When Senator Lenihan last spoke on this matter he said that the difference between the 1939 Act and the Bill we are dealing with now is that the 1939 Act is a fixed piece of legislation. It is permanently on the Statute Books.</P>

I am reluctant to have to say this but I do not know if I heard Senator Browne correctly before the tea break.  If I did not, I stand subject to correction.  He indulged in a revolting tirade against the Garda. I believe that he let his imagination run riot.  He talked about sophisticated methods of torture that took place in China and said either directly or indirectly that the Garda are or were capable of carrying these out.  That is the impression that I got.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I said that was the impression I got. Senator Browne will correct me.  I hope the record will show that Senator Browne was not saying what I thought he was saying.  I want to reject it in its entirety, in common with the other Senators of this House who have spoken in very favourable terms of the Garda. I put it to this House that we are simply following a precedent that has stood the test of time for 37 years.  I am prepared to argue with anybody that my interpretation of subsection (2) is that one step follows the other: &ldquo;Has committed is committing, is about to commit, is carrying a document or thing connected with, or has information relating to...&rdquo;&mdash;this is all part and parcel of the train of guilty events.  These are the people we are trying to get at, the people we are trying to protect the citizens of this State against.</P>

      <P>Even if the Minister had not indulged in that piece of <Col N="473" /> offensive misrepresentation, I proposed to take up the reference made by Senator O'Higgins to this.  Those of us who have said that we believe that the main body of the Garda are honourable men doing a very difficult job as fairly as they can, left ourselves open to this misrepresentation. Then I dealt with the incident in which I was involved in relation to the dogs and the American Embassy.  I repeated that the vast majority of the gardaí that night behaved with exemplary patience and restraint.  It was a minority on that night who came in and behaved in a barbarous and unnecessarily violent way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said nothing before the tea break which could be interpreted as an attack on the Garda.  I have always been careful because I know so well the kind of misrepresentation that can take place on these occasions.  I invariably refer to the predominantly fair-minded attitude of the majority of the Garda and the fact that there are within all our professions, trades and occupations a minority who betray the standards which are observed by the others.  The Minister went on to introduce the classic or effectively felon-setting innuendo in his reference to China.  I was not referring to China at all.  I was referring to Belfast.  These are our own people.  What the Government pursued in Strasbourg were charges against an Irish police force.  These charges were justified at Strasbourg. This Government were so convinced <Col N="474" /> of the brutality of these Irishmen in the North of Ireland&mdash;to fellow Irishmen&mdash;that they are now deciding to pursue these charges further.  I do not agree with anybody who says that it is only possible for this kind of thing to happen in Belfast or China and not to happen in our own country.</P>
      <P>Last night I read a detailed statement made by a member of the legal profession in court in respect of abuses in the 48-hour rule, which the Minister for Justice said did not happen. He said we were exaggerating when we said it did happen.  I then read a statement of complaints made by this solicitor about the treatment meted out to him by members of the Garda when the young men were held.  These were the charges made.  As far as I know, they have not been investigated fully.  If they have been investigated fully, they have not been denied on behalf of the Garda.  If this has not been done, then I suggest that the Minister has failed in his duty to the Garda if he has allowed these charges to be made in open court, not by the people whom the Minister dismisses as suversives or fellow-travellers, but by a member of the legal profession.</P>
      <P>The sententious humbug in which the Minister indulges, and which is supported so ably by Senator O'Higgins, is to suggest these things cannot happen.  My contention is that they can happen.  The most disturbing part is that it is now possible to do these terrible things to an individual held in custody, and nobody can prove that these things have been done.  The Government and their supporters are asking for powers, which, if they must be given, should be given with safeguards.  That is what we are asking for.  Having had to concede the point of the seven days I am now asking for some objective authority to which individuals can appeal &mdash;some authority over the Garda in their new situation.</P>

      <P>I was replying to the charge made by the Minister and the Senator that the Garda are sadists and <Col N="475" /> monsters.  None of us said that the Garda are monsters.  That is a gross perversion of the truth.  The Senator has been here long enough.  Having lectured this young Senator in front of me for his age and inexperience, it cannot be said of Senator O'Higgins. He has been here a very long time and he knows that this kind of imputation against myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so easy to say. I am not fighting for my own preservation&mdash;I sincerely hope I shall never find myself in this position&mdash; but I feel it is our responsibility: we are all party to this legislation. This is the position that the average unfortunate German found himself in during the last war: if you do not speak out against these things because you yourself do not feel you will be subject to them, then to me you are being a moral coward and you are evading your responsibilities as a public representative.</P>
      <P>Of course, the simplest thing to do is to talk in laudable terms about the Army, the courts, solicitors and the Garda and everybody else.  We can all do that, but the difficult thing to do&mdash; and in my view the correct and honourable thing to do&mdash;is to draw attention to these ugly facts of life in any of our societies.  It is not a special Irish evil.  As we know, many countries in Europe and outside it use these methods for getting information when they are really frightened and need the information badly.  The British newspapers have supported what was done by the RUC.  The most allegedly responsible newspapers have supported what was done by the RUC.</P>

      <P>I must intervene here to say that I consider that the Senator has replied at adequate length to the point made by the Minister. I would ask him to turn his attention to the amendment which is before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share the Minister's contention when he read out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> ...or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of that Act, or if he suspects with reasonable cause that that person is carrying any document or other article or thing, or is in possession of information relating to the commission or intended commission of the offence.</P>
    <P>Another interpretation of that part of the section is this.  There can be a person who is carrying a document. There can be a person who is carrying a bomb or other article for carrying out an act of violence.  There can be a person in possession of information. Three different people.  The person in possession of information relating to the commission or intended commission of an offence&mdash;let us stay with the commission of the offence&mdash;is the person who saw the offence committed. That person has information relating to the commission of the offence, even though he is a completely innocent bystander.  There is nothing to rule out that as a reasonable &mdash;if we may use that very abused word&mdash;interpretation of that section. That then brings us to the new position we have of a Bill which was introduced not to create any new crime, which is an unusual thing in itself, but to extend the powers given to the police in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The point I was making earlier is that many people who are not subversives in the Minister's earlier sense, Provisionals and so on, but who could be considered to be subverting the power or authority of the State by interfering with or refusing to carry out an essential service&mdash;the various employees of the State services, power light, transport, health and so on&mdash; can be brought in under this kind of legislation.  This is now established. The Minister made it quite clear that he can make any declaration he wishes to the Director of Public Prosecutions but that the Director of Public Prosecutions can ignore his direction. Either he influences him or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are simply good intentions which can have no influence whatever on the way in which this law can be applied in future in relation to people who are not covered by the Trade Disputes Act.  In these circumstances we now have added the extraordinary position that a spectator to a crime committed can become a criminal under this legislation.  Having been designated as a person who has information, having watched the crime, he is then amenable to all the subsequent penalties involved in this Bill, particularly detention for seven days because the Garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>
