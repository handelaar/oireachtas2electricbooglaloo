      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance, therefore, with Standing Order No. 75, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad, and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question that the Bill be received for final consideration the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of a list of the amendments made by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of amendments were made to the Bill in the course of its passage through the Dáil.  Most of these amendments were, in fact, drafting amendments which did not materially alter the structure or effect of the Bill but introduced improvements of a desirable nature.  I think the best thing to do here is to go down through the list of amendments made by the Dáil and I will comment briefly on each item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item on the list refers to section 5, which deals with the making of regulations under the Act.  Subsection (4) of the section provided that all regulations made under the Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as they are <Col N="997" /> made and may be annulled by resolution of either House.  As it stood, the subsection did not take account of the fact that a draft of any regulation under section 76 must be actually approved by each House before it is made.  The effect of the amendment is to eliminate the necessity of laying before each House regulations which have already been approved in draft by each House.</P>
    <P>Items Nos. 2, 3, 7 and 10 are similar in that each one places a limit on the time available to the registrar to decide on certain matters.  Items Nos. 2, 3 and 10, respectively, place a limit of two months on the registrar in deciding whether to register an alteration of rules under section 12, a change of name under section 13 or whether to confirm, under section 27, a union of two or more societies or a transfer of the engagements of one society to another.  Item No. 7 places a six-month limit on the time available to the registrar to consider an application by a society for permission to advertise for funds.  A six-month limit was considered appropriate here since the registrar is statutorily bound under section 19 to take into account a large number of factors and, consequently, a shorter limit would be unreasonable. The proposal to place time limits of this nature on the registrar were put forward in the Dáil and I must admit that, in my opinion, they are practical improvements to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will remember that the prohibition on persons under the age of 21 to vote or to hold office in a society was questioned here during Committee Stage of the Bill.  The matter was raised in the other House and, although I have certain misgivings about adopting a piecemeal approach to this question of amending the age of majority rather than waiting to have it dealt with in a global manner in due course, I accepted the proposition that persons between the ages of 18 and 21 years should not be statutorily precluded from voting in a society.  As will be seen in items Nos. 4 and 12, sections 17 and 53 were amended to provide accordingly.  Because of the continuing incapacity of a minor to enter into a legal contract or, more <Col N="998" /> correctly, the ability of a person at any time to repudiate a contract to which he became party as a minor, I cannot accept that a person under 21 should be allowed to hold office in a society until such time as the overall question of reducing the age of majority to 18 years is determined.</P>
    <P>A new version of section 18 was inserted into the Bill by the Dáil because of some inadequacies of detail which became apparent in the previous draft.  In the main, however, the amended version does not differ from the previous draft.  The purpose of section 18 is to place restrictions on the commencement of business by a society by prohibiting it from accepting any funds until it has complied with certain requirements.  These requirements related mainly to the taking up of shares of a minimum prescribed value by the founder-members. As originally drafted, the section applied to societies established after 5th December, 1975, which was the date of publication of the Bill, and previously established societies which at that date had not commenced to carry on business.  It will be noted, however, that the reactivation of an old dormant society which had ceased to function could be used as a device effectively to circumvent these provisions and so the section was amended to meet this point.</P>
    <P>Another loophole which became apparent in the previous draft of section 18 was the provision whereby the terms applying to the founder-members' shares could not be more favourable than those applying to any other shares of that class in the society.  It could be argued, however, that the founder-members' shares constituted a class of their own and, therefore, this provision would lose its effectiveness. Accordingly the section was amended to provide that the terms applying to founder-members' shares should not be more favourable than the terms applying to any other shares in the society and a clear definition of the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;terms&rdquo; was included.  The section as it now stands also provides that it is the directors rather than the founders of an existing society, to which section 18 applies, who would be required to subscribe the shares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> A small consequential amendment was made to subsection (10) of section 20 to avoid inconsistencies arising between the phrases used in section 20 and section 18 as amended.  This appears as item No. 9 on the list of amendments.  All the other amendments appearing on the list&mdash;items Nos. 6, 8, 11, 13, 14 and 15&mdash;are all drafting amendments designed either to correct errors or to improve the previous text.  None of these in any way altered the effect of the provisions in which they occur.</P>
    <P>Item No. 6 amends section 19 (5) (b) by ensuring that where an application is made for permission to advertise the registrar will have to be satisfied that the requirements of section 20&mdash;the deposit with the Central Bank&mdash;and of section 18&mdash;founder-member shares&mdash; will be complied with.  In the Bill as passed by the Seanad, it would be possible for a society to avoid having to comply with the provisions of section 18.  This loophole has now been closed.</P>
    <P>Item No. 8 is a minor technical amendment to section 20 which does not in any way alter the effect of the original provision.  It will ensure that moneys deposited with the Central Bank by the societies will earn a rate of interest not less than that payable on similar deposits by the licensed banks.</P>
    <P>Item No. 11 is merely to correct an error in section 38.  Subsection (3) of that section provides that the registrar shall fix limits on investments in various types of securities.  The word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; is defined in section 2 (1) as meaning prescribed in regulations, that is in ministerial regulations.  The registrar is not empowered to make regulations.</P>
    <P>Items Nos. 13, 14 and 15 are again drafting amendments which have been made on the advice of the Attorney General's Office and do not affect the force of the provision.</P>

In that connection it is necessary for me to indicate that there is a typographical error in the list.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to apologise to the Cathaoirleach and to the Seanad for my late arrival here.  This was made absolutely unavoidable by Dáil business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and 15 together. Amendment No. 6, probably the most important amendment, deletes section 6 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad and the other amendments are consequential on this.  Section 6 was the section under which the Minister could direct the RTE Authority to rebroadcast other programme services. <Col N="1001" /> It gave rise, of course, to an extended debate in the Seanad when I initiated the Bill here.  It was an enabling provision intended to facilitate the introduction of open broadcasting and, in particular, the rebroadcasting of BBC 1, Northern Ireland, here.  This section was the subject of considerable discussion in the Seanad when the pros and cons for a second television channel controlled by RTE and for a rebroadcast BBC 1 were thoroughly aired.  I said in the Seanad that, if it were clearly demonstrated that the public preferred an RTE 2, I would recommend that solution to the Government. Subsequent to the Bill being considered in the Seanad a joint survey of public preferences regarding a choice of television programmes was commissioned by my Department and RTE in September, 1975.  This survey showed that over 60 per cent of the public preferred an RTE 2.  As a result of this survey the Government decided to entrust RTE with the task of providing the second television service, which meant that section 6 was no longer appropriate.  Consequent on the deletion of section 6, it is necessary to delete the references to rebroadcast programmes from sections 1, 3, 4, 7 and 13.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 7 and 15 refer.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are two technical amendments to section 4. This Bill as passed by the Seanad provided for the appointment of a broadcasting complaints commission not later than 1st March, 1976.  The expectation when the Bill was being drafted was that the new broadcasting legislation would be enacted well before that date.  The purpose of the revised date of 31st March, 1977, which is being inserted by amendment No. 3, is to provide adequate time for the appointment of the commission after the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;effusion&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; by amendment No. 4.  I am advised that the word &ldquo;effusion&rdquo; is imprecise in the context in which it is used in this subsection and that the word &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo; should be inserted instead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> Amendment No. 8, section 7, arose from comments made during the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil on this section.  The point was raised whether the mandatory period of 60 days for retention of recordings was long enough.  I reconsidered the matter in consultation with the RTE Authority. The result of these consultations is reflected in this amendment which provides that sound recordings of all programmes must be retained for 180 days rather than the 60 days provided for in the Bill as passed by the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are technical amendments which arose from comments made by Senator Yeats during the Report Stage debate on this section when the Bill was previously before this House.  The purpose of these amendments to subsection (3) of section 7 are to ensure that recordings made under the section could be retained for as long as the broadcasting complaints commission considered necessary to enable them to complete investigation of any particular programme.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11, section 8, also arose from comments made in this House by Senator Yeats, who had introduced a somewhat similar amendment. I indicated then that I had a certain sympathy with the intent behind the Senator's amendment and I was not prepared to accept it at that stage.  I had doubts about the need for it, but I was influenced primarily by advice I had at that time that the amendment as drafted was not acceptable from a legal point of view.  The matter was re-examined subsequently and I was advised that no objection need be raised on legal grounds to a similar amendment introduced in the Dáil.  The amendment which is before this House is in similar terms.  It is designed to make it clear that any additional functions assigned to RTE under section 8 would relate to activities subsidiary to RTE's statutory function of providing a national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>I should like here to express my appreciation of the work done by Senator Yeats and the painstaking attention he gave to the details of this <Col N="1003" /> Bill and a number of improvements in it which resulted from his attention.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 12, 13 and 14, which are technical amendments, are designed to provide covering statutory provision in section 9 for payment of net cable television licence fees to RTE in 1974 and 1975.  These fees were first introduced in April, 1974, and were paid to RTE under subhead L.2 of the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Section 9 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad provided for the payment to RTE of grants equivalent to the net receipts from wired broadcast relay licence fees, cable television, only from 1976 onwards.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 arose from comments made by Senator Horgan during the Committee and Report Stages.  The amendment is designed to make it clear that pre-censorship of programmes by the Minister under section 17 is not envisaged.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a comment on the Final Stage.  I understand from what the Minister has said that it is as a result of a survey commissioned by the Department that we have those amendments and that it has been the view of the Irish people that a second Irish channel is preferable to imposing on them BBC 1.  I am very heartened that this has been the outcome of the survey because I personally was ridiculed by the Minister at a meeting which we held in Listowel and which was attended by people from the North Kerry and West Limerick area.  I am very delighted that the stance that the Listowel people took at that, one of the first meetings which the Minister had held around the country &mdash;the &ldquo;Wanderly Wagon&rdquo; thing&mdash;was the stance which was supported finally by the rest of the Irish people.  I am delighted that we are to have the second Irish channel instead of having BBC 1 imposed upon us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not let those comments of Senator Uí Eachthéirn <Col N="1004" /> pass without saying something, because I think that the survey referred to on the controversy between BBC 1 and RTE 2 was most misleading and the results were doubly misleading. The survey was biased in the direction of RTE 2 in such a way that the result obtained was inevitable.  The questionnaire drawn up was most unfortunate in its content.  Many people were fooled by the type of question asked. It did not give a true result.  I come from an area where there is a fantastic demand for multi-channel television. If a referendum was held in that area I have no doubt that the BBC 1 proposal would win by at least ten to one.  I am glad that the Minister has shelved his proposals for the time being to put on the RTE 2 service.  I hope when the matter is resurrected&mdash; I hope it is resurrected shortly&mdash;that the majority of the people will get their way and will get a service that they want to see.</P>

      <P>I do not think, as one accustomed to dealing with mathematics and figures and so on, that I could leave the comments of the last speaker pass without refuting them absolutely.  The survey was commissioned and carried out in the accepted and best scientific sense available.  The results were conclusive and they reflected, as far as I am concerned, the overwhelming view of the Irish people that they should have an RTE 2 rather than having BBC 1 foisted on them.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator Deasy has said.  When the meeting was held at Listowel, which the Minister attended and which Senator Uí Eachthéirn refers to, it was carried by a very narrow margin. The vote was not carried out in a proper manner; it was with raised hands.  We then had the next meeting in Killarney for South Kerry and the voting was clear there, but still there were some people who were not satisfied. There was a house to house survey by the Killarney Chamber of Commerce and the result was overwhelmingly <Col N="1005" /> in favour of BBC.  That was the answer from South Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the points made in the debate.  Senator Uí Eachthéirn spoke about imposing a solution on the Irish people.  I should like to be absolutely clear that I at no time sought to impose anything on the Irish people, that I was scrupulously careful to try to find out what people wanted.  Some people thought I insisted too much on that, that I was prepared to give them things that they wanted which those people thought that they ought not have, even if they did want them.  The Senator said that I had ridiculed her at the discussion which took place at the time in Listowel.  It was certainly no intention of mine so to do, and if in any way I was personally offensive to her I should like to apologise for that.  I do not think I was.  I differed from her view and said so, as she would never hesitate to do with me, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Deasy criticised the survey and Senator Quinlan, on the other hand, said that it was a scientific survey.  I think there is a little to be said for both points of view.  The survey was scientifically weighted and indeed Senator Quinlan is better placed to comment on that than myself.  I see the point which Senator Deasy had in mind, which is of course that, if you like, a case for RTE 2 was presented to those who completed the survey.  This was in my opinion unavoidable in that people had to be told what is the proposition that is before us.  RTE 2 had to be allowed to describe what they had in mind.  A description of that kind is hard to disentangle from a case.  I see the objections of those who would dispute the survey, but unfortunately I do not see any better way of getting near the proposition of what people want.  Certainly, if in the teeth of the findings of a survey which I had agreed to commission jointly with RTE 2 I had insisted on going ahead with BBC 1, in that case I could have been accused with a considerable show <Col N="1006" /> of justification of seeking to impose a personal view on people generally.  I did not want to do that.</P>
    <P>As this point perhaps I might leave the amendments and say a final word about this Bill which is now concluding its protracted progress through the Oireachtas.  It began here in the Seanad and, apart from the signature, it finishes here in the Seanad.  I think it would be appropriate for me to express here my appreciation to the many Senators on both sides of the House who have contributed to this debate and made it a memorable discussion of broadcasting policy and problems and led also to a number of improvements in the Bill as originally drafted.</P>
    <P>In my introductory speech I mentioned that the Bill had two main functions.  The first was to clarify and establish the duties of the RTE Authority in fulfilling their task of providing a national broadcasting service in the light of developments experienced and new insights since the Authority were established.  The second main purpose of the Bill was to provide greater autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting services within clearly defined statutory restraints and obligations while at the same time improving public control in certain areas.</P>
    <P>As regards the first function, that is the clarification of the functions of the Authority, I am glad that the general principles laid down in the Bill in section 14 were generally welcomed. The statement of the general duties of the Authority in that section was considerably improved as a result of suggestions made in this House by various Senators, and I thank them for this.  I think we can be confident that the revised and expanded statement of the authority's duties now enshrined in the Bill will enable them to meet the changing needs of broadcasting over the next decade or so. Changes there will undoubtedly be in this country, as in the rest of the world, and I am confident that the Authority will respond to these and will continue to provide a broadcasting <Col N="1007" /> service which is responsible, relevant, stimulating and entertaining.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose of the Bill, that is to provide greater autonomy and freedom for the broadcasting service within clearly defined statutory restraints and obligations while at the same time improving public control in certain areas, I regard as the more important contribution to the theory of broadcasting, its relationships to the Oireachtas, to the Government of the day and the necessary public controls that any Government must exercise over this extremely influential medium.  The element of public control of broadcasting contained in the Bill, that is, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which will now be a statutory body, is also, I am confident, an important innovation.</P>
    <P>The increases in the autonomy and greater freedom of the authority are enshrined in sections 2, 3, 5, 15 and 17.  When the Bill is enacted it will be possible under section 2 to remove the Authority from office only by the Government for stated reasons and only if resolutions are passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas calling for their removal.  That contrasts with the present situation whereby until this Bill is passed the Authority can be removed at any time without justification or consultation of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this provision somehow involves a derogation by the Government from their responsibility. I do not share that view, nor do the Government share it.  I think future commentators on broadcasting matters will vindicate the importance of this provision in the light of the need in a democratic society for granting the maximum possible independence for the broadcasting services. For the first time, under section 3, the Authority will be statutorily entitled to express their own views on matters of broadcasting policy which are of public controversy or the subject of current public debate and which are being considered by the Government or the Minister of the day.  This, too, should give a new dimension to discussions <Col N="1008" /> of broadcasting policy in the future.</P>
    <P>The transfer from the Minister to the Authority under section 5 of power to appoint advisory committees is a further increment to their autonomy and, finally, under section 15, they will have greater flexibility in deciding on the hours of broadcasting and the times for broadcasting advertisements. The delimitation of the power by the Minister under section 17 to direct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting certain matters is possibly the most important extension of the Authority's autonomy.  It is only in the sensitive area of incitement to crime and preservation of the authority of the State that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have in future the power to restrict the Broadcasting Authority's freedom to determine what they would broadcast. Under the existing Act, of course, a Minister could literally instruct the Authority to refrain from broadcasting any matter of any description.  While it is inconceivable that a Minister would use this power improperly, our legislation should not confer such absolute power on any Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill adds a new dimension by establishing control by the Oireachtas in certain broadcasting matters.  I have already mentioned the fact that an Authority cannot be dismissed except by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There is the further very important control by the Oireachtas that a statutory order made by the Minister under section 17 directing the Authority not to broadcast a particular matter, which he must specify, must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. If the Oireachtas in their wisdom consider that the direction by the Minister should not have been made, they have the power to annul the order within 21 sitting days.</P>
    <P>I am most grateful to all of the Senators who contributed to the improvement of the Bill originally presented to this House.  I think my original statement that it can be fairly described as a Bill of moderate liberalisation <Col N="1009" /> is still a fair description of the amended Bill which has now been passed by this and the other House.  It will, I hope, contribute to a greater excellence in our broadcasting services in the future.  I thank you.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Salmon, Eel and Oyster Fishing Licences (Alteration of Licence Duties) Order, 1976,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 3rd day of December, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy) Michael Pat Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, enabled the licence duties in respect of salmon, eel and oyster fishing to be increased by order subject to a maximum increase of 100 per cent.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1976, removed this limit.  Any order altering the licence duties must under the Act of 1976 be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and the order cannot be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by both Houses.</P>
      <P>I now propose to increase salmon, eel and oyster fishing licence duties with effect from 1st January, 1977, as I indicated when the legislation removing the limit on the scale of duties was passing through the House.  The new rates are set out in the schedule to the order.</P>
      <P>The revenue from the proposed new licence duties will go to the boards of conservators to help them to meet the increasing costs of protection and conservation of our inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases proposed in respect of the duties on commercial fishing for salmon, and in particular the increase in the drift net licence duty, must be regarded as reasonable when one considers <Col N="1010" /> that most fishing licence duties have remained at the same level for many years and in the case of drift nets for over a century.</P>
    <P>Increases are also proposed in the various kinds of salmon rod licences and I would point out that the existing duties on these engines have not been altered since 1958.</P>
    <P>I also propose to increase the oyster fishing licence duty from £4 to £15. This duty was last altered to £4 in 1975 but it is considered that in view of the present value of the individual catches the proposed new rate is fully justified.</P>
    <P>In line with the increases proposed for the other fishing engines the order also provides for higher licence duties on eel fishing engines.  The present licence duties on these engines are very low indeed.</P>
    <P>While income from licence duties over the years has remained fairly static, the overall expenditure of boards of conservators has risen to the extent that the income of boards from licence duties now constitutes only about 8 per cent of their total running costs. The balance of these costs is, in the main, met by means of Exchequer grants, which have had to be raised significantly over the years to meet deficits of boards arising out of the expenditure involved in their operations on fishery protection and development. The amount of the Exchequer grant in 1976 was £390,000.  Having regard to the greatly increased value of salmon we feel that there is a sound case for the increased scales of licence duties that are now proposed.  Assuming that the same number of licences continue to be taken out, the total income from this source should reach approximately £152,000 in 1977 as compared with about £42,000 this year.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend to the House that a resolution be passed approving of the draft order.</P>

      <P>The drift-net licences are £3.  If the Senator will comment on whether he approves of the licences or otherwise, I will be able to give any information I have subsequently. I think it unusual after completing my opening statement to repeat these, but if the Chair rules that I should do so I will be only too glad to adhere to the ruling.  I mentioned that the drift-net licences will go from £3 to £50.</P>

These increases are relatively small in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too familiar with fishing.  I fully understand the need for providing more money for the boards of conservators because at present they have not got sufficient money to protect our fisheries.  Quite recently we had an incident in Tipperary, on the Suir, where whatever fish there were there for 20 miles were wiped out.  We have still received no explanation of the cause of that disaster.  The boards are entitled to more money but we do not agree that drift-net licences should be increased from £3 to £50.  That is going too far.  I understand that this will apply to every boat.  I understand also that there is a great difference in the size of boats and that this will seriously interfere with the small man.  There should be some kind of a graded scale.  A much fairer way of collecting money for the boards would be the imposition of a cash levy on the catch made.  That is all I have to say except to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that we are opposing that section as far as the increase in drift-net licences is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KitAhern" hpid="Cáit Uí Eachthéirn Cáit Uí Eachthéirn">
      <NameTxt>Cáit Uí Eachthéirn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I did not expect this Bill to be discussed <Col N="1012" /> today and I have not gone into the details.  First of all, I should like to know what are the views of the different boards of conservators throughout the country.  While the Parliamentary Secretary has said that the price of salmon has increased considerbly, I can tell him that unfortunately the quantity of salmon has decreased.  People who once might have been able to afford an increase from £3 to £50 for a drift-net licence are not in that category of the wealthy any more.  As Senator W. Ryan said, it will now become the domain of the wealthy whereas to date it has been a small man's industry.  In my area some people are completely dependent on fishing.  As Senator W. Ryan said there is also the problem of pollution: our rivers are practically denuded of their fish.  We need a national policy for the protection of our rivers.</P>
      <P>Local authorities no longer can afford the enormous cost.  It is beyond any local authority's power to put up the amount of money needed for treatment plants for raw sewage and so on entering our rivers.  It was all right 50 years ago when we did not have this problem.  There is also the industrialisation of our countryside. Account must be taken also of pesticides and insecticides, all of which go into our rivers and which minute by minute kill our fish stocks.  When there is a diminishing fish stock&mdash;for those whose livelihood it is and others for whom it is a pastime&mdash;this is no time to increase licences to this extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any reason to complain about the increases because salmon fishing is big business nowadays.  People who have a drift-net licence can earn many thousands of pounds in a season at present.  The old fee of £3 was really very little. I do not think they will complain about the fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything that lends itself to the better protection of the spawning rivers is to be recommended.  I presume that the finance gathered from these increased fees will go in that direction.  At this time of the year in particular, poaching is big business. Every step possible should be taken <Col N="1013" /> to wipe it out.  More than anything else poaching threatens our salmon stocks.  People have blamed the drift-netting at sea, but I do not believe that is a major cause of the decrease in the number of salmon being caught; rather it is the increase in poaching.  We read alarming reports in newspapers from time to time about the scale of this poaching in places like West Cork and Mayo, not alone the scale of it but the violence attached to it.  Numbers of bailiffs and water-keepers have been seriously assaulted.  I would like to see the numbers of bailiffs increased and their powers increased.  If this Bill goes some way in that direction, I welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>I remember the Parliamentary Secretary telling us here last year that he intended bringing in new legislation which would lead to the reconstruction of the boards of conservators and give water-keepers greater powers.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he hopes to bring in this legislation, as I feel it is long overdue.  The present system of the boards of conservators is antiquated and is not able to do justice to an industry which is thriving at present.  If we want to keep it thriving we must see that the agency which runs the protection service and the stocking service is streamlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced restrictions this year regarding the depth of salmon nets.  Some fishermen are not at all pleased, and with good reason, because the licence fee has increased and their catching powers have been greatly reduced.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has made exceptions in the northern part of the country, I think in the Donegal region, where people who traditionally fished with up to two miles of nets at sea were given special consideration in this direction.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give the same consideration to people who traditionally fished with deep nets on the south coast.  I refer specifically to people in the Lismore fishery area who used a particularly large mesh with the resultant greater depth of <Col N="1014" /> net.  Now, because they are using a smaller mesh net, the depth of net is to be curtailed.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make the same type of exception he made in Donegal, with regard to the length, to the depth along the Waterford coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest very strongly at the proposal to increase drift-net licence fees from £3 to £50.  Once again the National Coalition Government are introducing measures which will directly affect the economic life of a section of the small people of this country.  As each day goes by this is a section of the community most sought out by the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Deasy told us there is an income of several thousands of pounds from drift-net salmon licences. I do not know what the situation is in the south.  Certainly, in Donegal in the River Swilly, the River Foyle and around the coast the people who engage in this type of fishing with these licences are those who for most of the year are unemployed, people who for most of the year are in receipt of unemployment assistance, who lose that during this fishing period and who spend the greater part of the night fishing in this manner.  Indeed the stocks are such that for most of the time their efforts are unsuccessful.  Senator Deasy expressed concern about poaching.  I believe that this proposal will only accelerate poaching.  Many people who up to now may have applied for a licence will consider it financially impossible to take this gamble because the income from it in many cases, except for a week or two in the year, may not warrant it.  It will deter people from seeking licences at all and will certainly increase poaching.  I am absolutely certain that for the small people I have mentioned this will be a hardship.  An increase from £3 to £50 is much too much for them.  The effects can only be disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy) Michael Pat Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It rather amuses me to hear the statement of the last <Col N="1015" /> speaker about the hardship likely to be imposed on what he earlier implied was an unfortunate section of the community, the holders of drift-net licences.  The position, Sir, is that around our coast those who are fortunate enough under the regulations made by this House and Dáil Éireann to qualify for a drift-net licence are deemed to be an exceptionally fortunate and favoured section of the community.  We know from the figures available in our Department from year to year what the licences mean.  We know that the bulk of our salmon are taken by drift-net licences and that there is a good deal of, possibly in some instances, justifiable opposition to the extension of the drift-net system in this country.  To come back to the assertions made by the last speaker&mdash;if I may begin with him&mdash;he tells the Seanad that an increase of £3 to £50 will be disastrous. The number of licences issued here is about 1,000.  The income for 1976, even from the diminished stocks, is estimated at £5.3 million and that figure constitutes a sizeable percentage of our total fish catch, the subject of so many discussions here and abroad at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that estimate based on the same method as the estimate based on the Kilcummin pier, when a gentleman of the deputation told the Parliamentary Secretary that his income was £2,000 instead of £6,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as factual as we can get it in the Department.  It is based on the report submitted to my Department.  If there has been any variation it has been upwards.  So far as Senator Garrett's remark on the Kilcummin pier is concerned&mdash;which is not relevant to this discussion&mdash;the people who land fish on that pier, if there is a discrepancy, are to blame. If the Senator's assertion is right, they deliberately misrepresented their catches for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackGarrett" hpid="Mr. Garrett Mr. Garrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On that deputation the fishermen told the Parliamentary Secretary exactly what their catches were. The Parliamentary Secretary should <Col N="1016" /> have contradicted them then as he did me a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They told me that they deliberately depressed their catches in order to avoid payment of tax, possibly, in some cases and so that it would not interfere with their unemployment assistance in others.  We want honesty from people in making their reports on their catches.  We want accuracy so far as this particular species is concerned because it is to our advantage, so far as all types of fish are concerned, to get accurate figures.  If figures are depressed from Kilcummin pier, or from any other pier regarding salmon or any other species, it militates against the industry generally, because when we go along to the Minister for Finance or to the Government seeking additional funds for our fishery development, that is the possible case that would be argued against us, the value of the industry.</P>
      <P>While we are deeply concerned&mdash;at the declining quantity of our salmon takings from sea and rivers, we are mindful that it is a very valuable fish. We try to be as liberal as possible in making orders controlling the granting of licences of any kind.  That is reviewable from year to year.  But the main question raised here was the money one. I said in Dáil Éireann last week that this £3 for a drift-net licence was set down in 1848, 128 years ago.  I am not sure as to the value of £3 at that time but I would hazard a guess it was a significantly large sum.  I do not know what price salmon were fetching at that time but possibly it was a relatively small percentage of the price obtaining today.</P>
      <P>What do we find?  We find that the average price this year is £1.61 per 1b. A medium-size salmon can fetch £20 at 1976 price levels.  Surely those people who are fortunate enough to qualify for licences in the first place and who earn this £5.3 million will not hesitate to make the relatively small contribution I am asking this House to approve this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say here, as I said in Dáil Éireann earlier, that I have met a substantial number of licensed salmon fishermen, particularly drift-net men, <Col N="1017" /> and they were only too willing to make a contribution towards conservation, provision of hatcheries, the improvement of services generally. Therefore, I am knocking at an open door.  Many of these people came along.  They felt the fee they were paying for the licence was absolutely ridiculous.  They acknowledged that and wondered how they could make a contribution which would put more money in the kitty for the development of this industry.  I regard salmon fishing as a very important industry.</P>
    <P>A number of methods of collecting money were suggested.  Senator W. Ryan mentioned a levy per pound. Perhaps it is a fair way of collecting money, for those who catch the most will pay the most.  It is something I will bear in mind.  In the current year the Exchequer through our taxpayers gave £390,000 to boards of conservators. We have collected, by way of licences, £42,000.  If this order is approved by the Dáil and Seanad, that will be increased to £152,000, or a gross increase of £110,000, and that covers all types of licences.</P>
    <P>I do not want to labour the House on the drift-net licence question much longer.  This is what might be termed a narrow motion to increase licence fees announced by me earlier in Seanad Éireann.  If one could visualise a situation obtaining in which licences could be bought, I do not know what price they would fetch because every Member of this and the other House and of local authorities throughout the country are approached again and again to make representations for a licence for this man or that man. Many of these representations prove to be deserving cases.  But in cases that do not measure up to our criteria, or where they do, by virtue of the limitation on the numbers, they cannot be accommodated.  Therefore, I fully stand over the increases being sought here.  I have no doubt that those to whom they will apply will not hesitate to make the contributions demanded of them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ahern mentioned the declining numbers.  That is a source of worry to us.  The orders are made <Col N="1018" /> from year to year.  Our scientists think we are possibly adopting too liberal an attitude in drawing up the regulations embodied in the control of salmon for fishing orders.  That is a point we review from time to time. Mention was made also of pollution. That was dealt in this House on the last occasion we discussed the salmon fishing subject.  We are well aware of what harm pollution can do and steps are being taken, which I do not think it would be fair to the House to elaborate on today, to reduce the effects of pollution on our rivers.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy was worried about poaching, and rightly so.  I agree that there is a great deal of poaching all over the country so far as salmon is concerned.  I want to say here in Seanad Éireann that our Department will give every co-operation to the boards throughout the State to ensure that poaching will be arrested.  I cannot say it will be eliminated because I think that that is an impossibility.  We will try to achieve a substantial and sizeable reduction in poachers' activities all around our coast.  This Department do not condone illegal fishing of any kind.  We are particularly mindful of the damage being done by salmon poachers, particularly at this time of year&mdash;October, November and December&mdash;when the salmon move up the small rivers.  We know the devastation that can arise so far as our stocks are concerned when, from the information at our disposal, we know various methods used to remove these spawning fish from our rivers.  I can assure Senator Deasy that this is a question about which we are very worried and so also are the 15 boards of conservators and the two administrators.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy inquired also about new legislation.  I expect to have that here early in 1977.  The next question that arose was the mesh depths.  This order, limiting meshes to 30, was introduced in 1976, intended for the 1976 season.  Our advisers estimated it would result in a 10 per cent additional escapement of fish and that it was vital to have this kind of mesh depth if our salmon stocks were to survive.  We have to take conservation <Col N="1019" /> measures and that was one recommended. Everybody here is anxious and desirous that this valuable source of income to our salmon fishermen, and which constitutes a valuable source of national income, will continue to develop rather than decline, as is happening at present.  Naturally, with the decline, we have to take precautionary measures.  In 1975 we had a return of £3,014,000 for salmon sold in outside markets.  The implementation of that order limiting the mesh was deferred for 1976 in view of the widespread representations made, particularly from the southern coast.  It is not being deferred any longer.  I am aware that in Senator Deasy's area the fishermen are worried about it, as they are in my own area in south-west Cork.  The advice at my disposal is that it is necessary, that their worries are not too well founded.  Consequently it would be out of place for me, or for any other person holding this post, not to acknowledge the advice of our scientific officers and not to bring in a measure such as this particularly, as Senator Ahern mentioned earlier, at a time when our stocks are declining.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will agree that in the Ardmore/Youghal areas traditionally they fished a deeper net than elsewhere. This is the case that they are making: that they should be allowed a concession because they always had 30 meshes at five-and-a-half inches per mesh.  Now the traditional mesh is four inches, so they are being penalised by being reduced to 30 meshes. They were recently fishing 60 meshes at four inches a mesh.  All they want is to be given at least what they originally fished: the equivalent of 30 meshes at five-and-a-half inches a mesh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Deasy will agree that salmon stocks are declining.  If they are allowed to have their original mesh length, naturally it will mean that more salmon will not escape.  This measure is to provide escapement.  The case Senator Deasy put before the <Col N="1020" /> House was made on a number of occasions.  A deputation was received in the Department to discuss it.  In my area in south-west Cork I have had numerous salmon fishermen make the same type of case.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to uphold it, taking into account the general position of our salmon stocks.  The regulation must come into operation for the year 1977. As I mentioned already, we did defer it this current year in view of representations made that people had purchased meshes of particular depths in excess of 30.  We agreed to defer it but it was quite clear as far back as April of this year that there would be no further deferment.</P>
      <P>I recommend to Seanad Éireann the approval of this order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are told that under new agreements being reached within the European Community Irish fishermen in 1977 will be allowed increase their catch by 20 per cent and that by 1979 they will be allowed double their catch.  A number of fishermen have asked me what is the <Col N="1021" /> point in trying to increase one's catch by 20 per cent when one's present catch here is zero.  It will be an impossibility, in their view, to increase our national catch next year or to double it by 1979 because the stocks have been depleted to a degree which is not known generally.  The major source of our fishery catch in the last ten years has been herring, but our herring stocks are just about exhausted.</P>
      <P>I have been noting public representatives for the last couple of months shedding crocodile tears about the manner in which our fisheries have been almost wiped out.  Many of these people are considerably to blame for this situation because of their indifference down through the years. We, on the south coast, have seen the greatest series of poaching expeditions, of plundering, of raping, of pillaging of fishing grounds that has probably ever been seen in any part of Europe.  This has gone on with only a slight whimper now and again from public representatives and from the public at large.  Dunmore East was our major fishery port in the late sixties and early seventies.  At this time of the year one could expect the harbour there to be packed with up to 100 trawlers.  One could walk from one side of the harbour to the other across the decks of the boats which were jammed in the dock.  Today it presents a sorry sight.  There is hardly a box of herrings being landed in Dunmore at the moment when the season should be at its peak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that the Russians, the East Europeans and the Japanese are to blame for this situation.  This is largely erroneous.  The blame lies principally with a number of our partners in the Common Market, in particular the Dutch and also the French.  The blame lies partly with ourselves.  I will endeavour to explain the reasons why.  The herring stocks are almost exhausted at the moment but the damage was not done last year or the year before.  It was done in the late sixties and early seventies when hordes of Dutch trawlers&mdash;I suppose the word &ldquo;trawler&rdquo; is not the correct expression because they were ships, <Col N="1022" /> not trawlers: when we think of a trawler, we think of a boat in the 50-60 foot class, but these were steel-hulled ships of a 1,000 tons and more each&mdash;came right into our shores and swept everything before them.  In particular they ruined the spawning beds along the south coast.  At that time our naval fishery protection service was minimal.  We had merely one vessel in commission.  It is well known that the Dutch plotted the course of that protection vessel and when they knew it was in dry dock or when it was on the west coast they came in and did what they liked, and what they liked was to take everything before them whether the fish were large or small.</P>
    <P>I contend that it is a sin to allow the Dutch and the French to base their case for catches on quotas when those catches were taken illegally because the bulk of them were taken outside our limits and because the size of fish on which they are basing their quotas was below what should have been caught.  I am told the bulk of them were undersized.  That explains why this year and even last year there are little or no herring around our coasts.</P>
    <P>We know that the North Sea herring fisheries have been closed since 20th September last because they have been almost exhausted in the same manner. It is late now for people to begin lamenting this situation.  The damage has been done and all we can hope to do is to see that other stocks are not annihilated in the same way.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jerry Joyce is managing director of two herring processing plants in Rossaveal in Connemara.  He was hoping to export £1,500,000 worth of processed herring this year, but he will be lucky if the two plants stay open because in a recent edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Mr. Joyce is reported as stating that on the night of December 8th there were 150 Irish fishing boats off our coasts in search of herring and their total catch for the night was 21 tons, whereas the normal catch for this time of year would be about 1,000 tons. That figure illustrates graphically what has happened.  The herring have been wiped out.</P>
    <P>I would be incorrect if I laid all the <Col N="1023" /> blame on the Dutch and French.  I lay the bulk of the blame on them.  Irish fishermen have contributed to the decimation of the stocks.  They are to blame, but it is a little difficult to blame them too strongly because when our coasts and our limits should have been protected they were not protected. Our fishermen could not compete with the foreigners in and around the six-mile limit or the 12-mile limit region. To meet repayments on their boats they had very little option but to go right into inlets and bays where the fish were spawning and rake them off the bottom. That practice has contributed largely to the diminution of the herring stock. The spawning fish were killed in their billions.  When it is remembered that one herring lays an average of 30,000 eggs one can imagine the damage done by killing one spawning fish.</P>
    <P>It was a sequence of events apart from the Dutch and the French cleanup of stocks.  Our fishermen could not compete and had to kill the goose that laid the golden egg in order to pay their way.</P>
    <P>We should be a lot tougher in our negotiations with other fishing countries. The EEC common fishery policy is very unfair.  As far as this country is concerned, it is robbery. We are inclined to be too soft-hearted a race.  We are dealing with hardhearted individuals.  We should dig in our heels more.  At present, if our fishing industry is to survive, we must stop these other people from catching huge quantities of mackerel and sprat because these are the only two surface-swimming fish which are left in sufficient quantities to make it profitable for Irish fishermen to earn a living in the future.  It will take a number of years for our herring stock to recover even if they are not fished at all for a number of years.  They are at such a low level that it will take years for them to recover.  Other countries in the North Sea areas have imposed a complete ban on herring fishing.</P>
    <P>We had a fortune but we have lost it.  We have lost it largely because of our own indifference and incompetence. As well as allowing foreigners <Col N="1024" /> to catch our fish, we sold them what we caught ourselves for next to nothing.  In Dunmore 15 years ago, a cran of herring was normally sold for £2.  In 1965 or 1966, that price had risen to £4 or £5.  In the same period we were buying back that herring in processed form.  A cran of herring contains approximately 1,000 fish and if we take a price of £5 per cran, which was high at the time, the fisherman was getting less than 1p for each fish.  A person buying a processed herring in a shop would pay more than 20p.  Therefore, we lost out on the double.  What the foreigners were not taking from us by their trawlers, they were buying cheaply from us and selling back at a large profit.  That situation, pricewise, has improved but it is too late.  At present, in Dunmore, if anyone happens to catch a cran of herring&mdash;this is becoming a rarity&mdash;he will get £60 per cran but unfortunately the fish are not there.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, we must implement existing bye-laws to protect spawning grounds and, secondly, we must frame new laws to protect new spawning grounds and areas in which the young fish congregate after spawning.  There are many by-laws in existence to protect certain harbours and inlets but I have never known any of these bye-laws to be implemented. There are a number of spawning grounds for herring around our coasts and there are also some spawning grounds for plaice, sole and whiting. These are protected by bye-laws but they are cleaned out regularly by our own in-shore fleet.  This is a very short-sighted policy.  It is revolting to find public representatives shedding crocodile tears about something over which they had control but in respect of which they failed to exercise control.</P>
    <P>My solution to the present problem would be to adopt a much tougher attitude with our EEC partners.  First, I do not believe they have a right to barter in regard to our fishing grounds.  This is what the EEC are doing at the moment with Russia and Norway.  We are told that the Russians will be given certain rights <Col N="1025" /> within the 200-mile limit.  What will we get in return?  I venture to say, nothing.  The Russians hope to swop an area in the Barents Sea, where the French and British trawlers fish, for an area off our coasts.  Let the French and British swop their own areas and let us keep ours.  We should control the manner in which the other EEC members will fish our 200-mile zone. The Russians have no traditional rights whatever off our coasts.  They made their first appearance in the last two or three years.  The Bulgarians and the Roumanians have been told that they cannot come into our 200-mile zone after 1st January.  These two countries had exactly the same right as had the Russians, and that is nil, because they are all there approximately the same length of time.  The same can be said of the Poles, the East Germans and the Japanese.  None of them has fishing rights off our coasts. The only country which has any right off the Irish coast and who are not in the Common Market at present is Spain.  I understand they are to be treated with some courtesy and are to be allowed make some catches.</P>
    <P>The Russian catch at present is 650,000 tons in Community waters, that is, within a 200-mile limit.  At least half this catch is being obtained off the Irish coast.  Their catch of 325,000 tons a year for the past few years compares badly with our catch of 75,000 tons per annum.  The sooner they are put out and kept out the better.  If the British and French want to do business with the Russians, that is their business.</P>
    <P>In 1973, one of the first years when the Russians appeared in the Celtic Sea, they caught 63,000 tons of mackerel which was 17 times greater than the Irish catch of mackerel. Where will they go?  I do not know and I care less and that should be our attitude.  They have plenty of seas around their own country.  They have in operation a 200-mile limit which I am sure we would not be allowed to breach, not that we want to.  The Norwegians and the Icelanders also have a 200-mile limit.  There is very little room for people like the <Col N="1026" /> Russians, the Bulgarians and the Rumanians to fish except off our coasts.  I do not see why we should do a deal with the Russians.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that they will also fish around the Faroes, which are the property of the Danes, and that they will fish off Scotland, which is part of Britain.  But what will happen if, as is likely, the Faroes become an independent group of islands?  Greenland, which has been quoted as a Common Market area because it still belongs to the Danes may also become independent.  What will happen if there is devolution for Scotland?  It is quite likely that fishermen in Aberdeen, Peterhead and so on will say: &ldquo;We want a 200-mile limit and we will opt out of the Common Market if necessary&rdquo;.  It is unlikely but possible. Then the only common fishery waters in the EEC would be those off Ireland and Britain.  The British waters are very limited because they are mainly in the North Atlantic, which is bereft of fish at the moment, absolutely cleaned out.  Who was responsible for this but the Dutch, the Germans, the Danes and the French.  They denuded their own rivers of fish, too.  Unless we control these people and keep the third countries out, except for Spain, we are getting a bad deal.</P>
    <P>Under this motion we are declaring a 200-mile limit.  We should have complete control over all fishing within this limit.  We should regulate the size of the boats to fish within this limit and regulate the type of gear they use. Personnel of an Irish fishery protection vessel should have the right to board and inspect these boats at all times.  That is one way of controlling what is being caught.  It should also be possible for the Irish authorities to inspect at the ports the catches that these people land.  The evidence in the past has been that they catch every size of fish.  They have no regard for conservation.  The Dutch and French use such meshes that small fish cannot escape.  If the fish is too small and inedible they turn it into fishmeal or into cat or dog food.</P>
    <P>We should control conservation within the outer 150-mile band to the limit.  We should not give these people <Col N="1027" /> authority to use their own type of gear or equipment.  The seasons during which they may fish should also be controlled.  If we let them continue as they have been, we will have nothing left.  We know what a 12-mile limit is and what a 50-mile limit is, but unfortunately the poor fish are not so aware.  Whether they are under- or over-sized our partners will catch and kill them.  I am speaking on a rather depressing note, but I have seen the activities of these people.  I have seen the catches disappear on our own piers and harbours and I can see them dwindling even further if we do not act toughly and quickly.</P>
    <P>The Common Market fishery discussions have been conducted with great ability and authority by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He must get great credit for what he has done. He has been in a very difficult position fighting his corner against the other eight members of the Community. He has done this magnificently, but it has not been easy.  Our position has been improved by the retirement of M. Lardinois from the discussions.  His suggestions were infantile. He did not know what he was talking about or what conservation meant or how stocks should be preserved. The man who has taken his position M. Gundelach has shown some humanity and quite an understanding of our position.  I am confident that we will make better progress with M. Gundelach.</P>
    <P>We should hold out for a 50-mile limit and for complete control over the other 150 miles.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom, mar duine a chonaíonn cois na farraige, cúpla focail a rá ar an dtairiscint seo, sé sin an tOrdú um Dhlínse Mhuirí.  Tá a lán des na smaointe curtha ós ár gcomhair ag na daoine a labhair cheana agus freisin sa Dáil nuair a bhí Bille Príobháideach ós comhair na Dála.  Ach, mar sin féin, ní h-aon díobháil nó ní h-aon dochar cuid des na pointí a lua arís.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the motion which empowers the Government to make an <Col N="1028" /> order extending the exclusive fishing limits of this State if, as Senator Deasy said, it is to be of any help to the country or an improvement for the fishing industry.  The order extends the fishing limit to 200 miles.  Under the old order the fishing limit was 12 miles.  That was decided at the London Convention in 1964.  Since 1964 there have been several major changes.  The seas around our coast and around the British coast also, have been plundered by these factory ships which were referred to by many Senators yesterday.</P>
    <P>Everybody is perturbed about the rape of the sea, both here and in other areas.  That is the reason why there is the United Nations Conference at the moment on the Law of the Sea. From what I have read, I understand that most countries are agreed that there should be at least a 200-mile limit and that states with coastal waters have a special right to these waters.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the Dáil there was a Private Members' Bill asking for an exclusive 50-mile limit.  Some people protested that this could not possibly be done.  From my understanding of the Treaty of Accession there is nothing in it that could debar us from looking for a further 48 miles as an exclusive limit plus the 12 miles.</P>
    <P>Senator Deasy made the very valid point that not only should we have an exclusive 50-mile limit but should also have control of the 200-mile limit. That is something that may have to be debated further.  It is a pity that we did not agree to the 200-mile limit because we could have it as a bargaining card at the conference table when we are fighting to the death for a 50-mile exclusive limit.</P>
    <P>It is a completely new ball game and we wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs and anybody who is involved in these negotiations every luck.  We hope they will come out with a deal which we all so much expect.  It is said that the British Government are completely behind the stance we are taking.  I hope when the chips are down and we need their help, and when the Minister for Foreign Affairs needs their <Col N="1029" /> help, they will substantiate what they are now saying.</P>
    <P>On another motion today I referred to the decrease in the stocks of fish. This topic is of major concern not only to coastal states, or states with a coastline, but indeed to countries with no coastline.  If there is an invasion of a territory you expect the state invaded to take steps to defend its rights.  We are the custodians of the coastal waters and it is our duty, just as we would defend our territorial ground, for the sake of inland areas as well, to protect the coastal areas from being marauded and from being raped as is happening now.  Fish protein is probably one of the only unpolluted sources of protein, except vegetable protein, on the market today.  Our animal protein is completely ruined by antibiotics, force-feeding, and so on. It is our duty to protect for humanity this one great source of protein which is still unpolluted.</P>
    <P>Another point which should be made here is that, when we entered the European Community, it was admitted there was no policy on fisheries.  It is only now that policy is being evolved. We should be there, as Senator Deasy said, striking the hardest bargain possible because we are very scarce of wealth.  The only real wealth we have is our land.  The other wealth we have should be as much protected as our agricultural land, or our mineral wealth, or anything else.  Fair dues to the fishermen.  It was only when we saw the factory ships on the coasts of Kerry and Cork within eyesight, within viewing distance, with their glaring lights, that the fishermen became really perturbed.  They put the skids under different Governments to take action.  I hope what they are requesting, the 50-mile exclusive limit, will at least be achieved for them.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Senator Alexis FitzGerald was very humorous when he asked how did we come by this 50 miles? What process of elimination or sums did we do?  Why was it not 20 miles, 40 miles or something else?  I surmise that 50 miles is the distance which, at this stage, we will be able police.  I am sorry to say that when the Minister for Foreign Affairs was striking a <Col N="1030" /> very hard deal and making a very hard plea for this 50-mile limit, one Minister said it was amazing because we could hardly police the 12-mile limit we have. Maybe he was not too far out.  If it is a question of policing this 50-mile exclusive limit, everything possible should be done to give us the wherewithal to police it, to give us better patrolling boats, better equipment.  If we want it, and if we want to protect it, we must be given the wherewithal to protect it.</P>
    <P>I well remember when we were campaigning on entry to the EEC it was admitted, and it is still being admitted, even in what the Parliamentary Secretary said, that Ireland had a very special case.  We are the tiniest nation of the nine.  We have very little wealth.  The least they might leave us is the one raw material which has been underdeveloped up to the present day.  Having got this desperate shock from the other countries that there is a likelihood that this raw material may be taken from us, we should settle down seriously to develop the fishing industry as it should be developed. Day by day we are bringing in a raw material for which we pay dearly, and then exporting it and trying to sell it in different forms of manufactured goods.  I am glad something has happened to wake us up to the importance of this great wealth on our doorstep.</P>
    <P>I have already said how worried we have been on the coast of Kerry at seeing these factory ships.  One Senator said yesterday, and I think he was not far out, that something should be done to ban them from our waters.  I think it was Senator M.D. Higgins. Whilst we are on the subject of fisheries, we must also refer to the quota system.  There is no way in the world that any fair deal can be made by having a quota system.  You are not comparing like with like.  We have had currachs and other boats which were 20-footers, and a few years ago we got vessels which were slightly larger.  They are only small fry by comparison.  Even if they increased our quota by 100-fold.  We still would not be near hitting distance of one factory ship.  There is no point in codding <Col N="1031" /> us and telling us we can get a bigger quota, or a ten-fold or a 100-fold quota.  There is no comparison, and no basis on which there could be a proper adjustment and justice done to us.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to refer to pollution.  We have the Irish sean-fhocal &ldquo;Filleann an feall ar an bhfeallaire&rdquo; and I am greatly afraid this will happen to us here and that the way we have abused our waters and our rivers will rebound on ourselves. We have blackguarded our rivers and our seas by allowing raw sewage into them.  Nuclear waste is now being deposited.  We have no guarantee that one fine day this toxic poisonous matter that we have dumped into some parts of the sea will not surface.  We are told there is an 80 per cent guarantee that it will not surface, or disintegrate, or that something will not happen to it.  I do not think a guarantee of 80 per cent is good enough because we are the custodians for the next generation.  Maybe we are picking sticks to beat ourselves by in any way agreeing to depositing any of these things in our rivers or lakes.</P>
    <P>With the increase in population and the decline in protein it is only now that we are becoming really concerned about the purest type of protein still in the world.  We talked about the marauders and those waiting to pounce on our 200-mile limit.  I was very disturbed to read at lunchtime that Mr. O'Connor of the IFO stated that while Ireland was negotiating the threat to our fishing stocks was mounting drastically and by next January people will be ready to pounce on our shores. He gives facts.  Whether they are substantiated, I cannot say.  He said 40 Russian trawlers are infringing on our 12-mile limit off the Cork coast.  There are 20 Dutch distant water trawlers on our north-west coast.  British fishermen banned from Icelandic waters are seeking refuge in Irish fishing waters. German fishermen who will be banned from Soviet waters because of a unilaterally declared 200-mile limit by Russia will fish in Irish waters.  He proposed that Ireland should immediately declare a 50-mile fishing zone, <Col N="1032" /> keeping everybody else out by using Icelandic patrol tactics.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am saying, in different words, what Senator Deasy has already said.  I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs succeeds in getting at least the 50-mile exclusive limit.  I regret that, while we want the 200-mile limit, we did not play that card yet.  I regret that we did not keep it up our sleeves as a trump card in bargaining for the 50-mile exclusive limit.</P>
    <P>Níl a thuilleadh le rá agam nach ndúbhradh cheana féin anseo agus sa Dáil chomh maith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers I welcome this announcement by the Government of their intention in this order to extend our limits to 200 miles.  Probably in common with many other speakers and, perhaps, those moving the resolution, one regret might be that the announcement of this move did not come sooner.  It is quite a number of years now since the thought of having limits such as this was first mooted on the international scene.  Senator Aherne said such moves were not afoot at the time we signed the Treaty of Accession.  They most certainly were.  It was well-known that in certain parts of the world&mdash;notably in South America and in the Americas generally&mdash;there was talk of the introduction of a 200-mile limit in the case of certain countries.</P>
      <P>Bearing that in mind it is interesting to reflect on the eventual outcome of the negotiations we conducted at the time which led to the Treaty of Accession. It is incorrect to say that there was no special position as regards fisheries.  Of course there was.  A special clause was written into the Treaty to allow us to extend temporarily our unsatisfactory six-to 12-mile limits until 1982 as a special case.  In certain parts of the country they only extended to six miles.  Indeed, I wonder if those who negotiated, those short few years ago, such an unsatisfactory short term agreement on behalf of Irish fishermen, now feel that the agreement could be described as being in any way adequate for the needs of Irish fishermen or for Irish fish conservation measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is somewhat interesting to note <Col N="1033" /> that some of the people who are now apparently becoming rather vocal in their criticism of the negotiations being carried out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and others, in an effort to secure a realistic coastal band for this country, are the very people who negotiated the unsatisfactory position which obtains at present.  If we were left with the position they negotiated, after 1982 we would not have the benefit even of the inadequate six- to 12-mile limits which exist at present and ships from all Community countries would have the right to fish into our bays and right up to our headlands. It is an extraordinary state of affairs that the people who negotiated that position&mdash;let us hope through ineptitude or misunderstanding of the international situation and not because they were anxious to obtain a better deal for Irish agriculture&mdash;are critical of the attempts now being made to remedy that mess into which we were plunged at the time the Treaty of Accession was signed.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the extension of our international waters to a 200 mile limit was touched upon by many speakers, that is conservation. Unless definite and realistic steps are taken to provide conservation measures both in offshore and in-shore waters the countries of the world will find, in a very short space of time, that they will be without realistic fish stocks.  It is generally accepted also that, if conservation measures are introduced now and realistically policed, there is a continuing and rich harvest to be gleaned from the seas, and a potential food source which has not, possibly, as yet been realised to any degree.  There must be a cessation of the harmful and destructive methods of fishing used by some countries over the past number of years.  It is fair to say that, unless realistic and internationally negotiated conservation measures are implemented in the very near future, there will be no real fishing industry for anybody within the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that even the international bodies like the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission have consistently chosen to ignore or, to a <Col N="1034" /> large extent, to disregard the recommendations made to them by scientists in regard to fish conservation measures.  As a result of their ignoring the recommendations on herring in the Celtic Sea and the North Sea&mdash;recommendations made some years ago for a drastic reduction in the amount of herring caught in the North Sea&mdash;a total ban on herring catch in the North Sea will have to be imposed.  The North East Atlantic Fishery Commission, the body charged with implementing conservation control in that area, did not attend to the expert recommendations made to them.  Unless international bodies and national Governments are prepared to react strongly with conservation measures, we will be faced all over the world with a situation such as obtains in the North Sea at present.</P>
    <P>This is why I am less than happy with the proposals put forward some time ago by the European Community in regard to conservation control.  Recently when some of us went to Brussels to discuss this matter, they indicated that the North East Atlantic Fishery Commission had been remiss in their implementation of conservation control.  The solution being put forward as part of the package offered by the Community at that time was that only fish of a certain size and certain quantities of fish would be allowed to be caught by Community boats.  The system of monitoring these quotas and fish sizes was that checks would be carried out at the port of landing.  It was suggested that quotas should be based on historical performance.  I am sorry to say that our Community partners have been less than effective, whether deliberately or otherwise, in their conservation checks, in quota checks, and in the general control of landings at fishing ports throughout Community countries.  We cannot take it with any certainty that, if the quotas of fish size controls suggested are introduced, they will be implemented in any better or more effective way in continental landing places than they have been up to this.</P>
    <P>When Senators talk here about the rather small size of the Irish fleet and <Col N="1035" /> Irish boats in comparison with the long distance fleets of our continental partners, it is important to realise one very simple thing.  The reason we have boats which have largely fished inshore or in middle waters is very simple.  The fish have remained around our coast up to now.  Our Community partners and other countries, through harmful and destructive fishing policies, have absolutely fished out their inshore waters along the continental seaboard and for that reason and that reason alone they have had to build long-distance fleets.  There are no longer sufficient fish to support their fishing industries within their own inshore waters.  That is why they have now turned their attention and their fleets towards long-distance fishing and fishing of waters which by right and by tradition belong to other countries.  It is the very plundering of their own waters which has rendered them virtually barren at the present.</P>
    <P>This plundering of Irish waters by, I am sorry to say, our Community partners and others in recent years, has begun to have an adverse effect on fish catches in the Irish Sea.  The volume of herrings landed by Irish boats in the Celtic Sea area in 1970-71 was 19,000 tons.  By 1975-76 this had fallen to a figure of 6,500 tons, a drop of over 65 per cent.  Incidentally, in the same period, the total catch of herrings by the entire Irish fleet fell from 48,000 tons to 28,000 tons.  It is important to remember that, at the same time, the number of Irish boats of over 50 tons gross had risen from 100 to 170, and these are the boats that would be involved in herring fishing. With a vastly increased fleet, over a space of five years our herring landings dropped by some 65 per cent.</P>
    <P>As Senator Deasy outlined so very graphically, in the areas where herring congregate in the Celtic Sea, which are outside our 12-mile limit, over the same five-year period there has been the continual presence of boats from our Community partner countries and from other countries, boats designed to carry out fishing methods which were totally destructive and damaging <Col N="1036" /> to the spawning areas.  It is interesting to give examples of the sort of fishing carried out.  Perhaps the most harmful of all is the type of fishing which, in essence, scoops the fish from the botton of the sea.  Not only does it catch the fish, but it also removes the plankton, the foodstuffs, and the organic matter on which fish feed.  The fish stocks are entirely cleared from an area and also the feeding stuffs which enable other fish to replenish fish stocks.</P>
    <P>In the Celtic Sea and in the Irish Sea a large number of Dutch vessels and boats from other countries are carrying out what is known as stern-trawling. Effectively, this method of fishing amounts to putting a plough through the sea bed so that the very sea bed, which is the breeding ground and the area where feeding stuffs grow, is ploughed up and rendered barren. As Senator Deasy said, the people carrying out that policy are not mindful of conservation or interested in seeing those grounds restocked.  They have fleets capable of long distances and, once they have rendered one particular area barren, they will move on to somewhere else.  It is only when the seas have been rendered barren that at that too late stage their respective Governments will turn their attention to the area of conservation.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that, not only in the extension of our limits and in the creation of some form of exclusive coastal band, we should ensure that there is restocking, and a continuation of the stocks in the breeding and spawning grounds around our coasts and within our waters.  We should ensure that, either at Community level or by way of national legislation, there is a complete ban on wasteful and harmful methods of fishing such as I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Much talk has been bandied about regarding the difficulties of policing a 50-mile zone.  I do not believe those difficulties are as insuperable as has been represented.  With modern technology, the methods of policing large limits have changed very rapidly.  The attitude of naval fleets and fishing protection fleets, with the use of more complicated electronic equipment, has <Col N="1037" /> also changed completely.  One of the few good things in the Community proposals, as originally envisaged, was that the 200-mile limit, which would apply generally throughout EEC waters, would be policed against the presence of third-country fleets by way of satellite.  This is being done off the American coast at present.</P>
    <P>Satellites can detect large fleets of trawlers as they make their way from their country of origin towards the 200-mile limit of the country or group of countries involved.  By the time they arrive at the point of entry, one or two fishery protection vessels have been moved into position to intercept them at the point of entry.  It is childish to paint a picture of large fleets of gunboats and destroyers chasing around an imaginary 200-mile line.  That is unnecessary.  It is also unnecessary to think of their presence there for other reasons.  There are only certain areas in which the fishing grounds exist.  If we can identify these areas, they can be policed at most times, rather than talking about policing the extremities of the limits. It is important that the Government should consider a change in the law to allow this.  I realise it may involve international difficulties as well.</P>
    <P>There is also an important need to allow the use of aircraft and helicopters for detecting ships poaching within our waters.  Internationally, so far, the use of such aircraft has not been generally accepted.  It is interesting to remember that, within the past six months, a British aircraft successfully spotted and arrested an outside trawler.  The evidence was subsequently accepted in a British court and conviction and fines followed.  If we are to implement an effective inner coastal band or, indeed, achieve the effective policing of the other band, provision must be made for the use of aircraft and helicopters.  Their operators should be given powers of detection and arrest, and their evidence should be acceptable in Irish courts.  We should be urging, at international level, that evidence such as that should be accepted in courts generally in the matter of detection.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that we should <Col N="1038" /> examine the type of fines imposed on ships caught poaching in our waters. Much publicity has been given in recent times to what appeared to be very large fines imposed on several of the large factory ships caught within Irish waters.  It has always intrigued me about the arrest and charging of any alleged poachers that the case has always been heard at a special court. The special court has always been arranged immediately the ship was was brought into an Irish port, and the matter heard as expeditiously as possible and settled.</P>
    <P>One of the very few things which will hurt the operator of a long-distance trawler, with the very heavy outgoings obviously entailed, is to have his ship tied up for any lengthy period of time. If an Irish national is charged his case is not heard for some weeks or even months after the alleged offence has been committed.  I do not see why he should have to wait for that length of time when special courts are arranged to facilitate the early hearing of cases taken against trawler skippers who are alleged to have poached our waters.  As well as a more realistic fines system, there ought to be consideration of a penalty which would involve either the confiscation of the boat as well as its gear and catch or, perhaps more realistically, which would provide for the detention of the boat for periods of six, or nine, or 12 months before it would be released.</P>
    <P>Fines such as that which would seriously damage the viability of these very large and costly trawlers as an economic unit would be very effective deterrents against skippers who might consider entering within our waters.  At the present time the loss of catch and gear, and early hearing and decision in the case, are not, I believe, a sufficient deterrent to skippers.  If they happen to know of the presence of very rich fish stocks in an area they are prepared to take the chance.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to reflect that&mdash;I think it is in the Isle of Man&mdash;at the present time there is also even the possibility of jail sentences being imposed on the skipper and on the mate of a ship caught fishing within Isle of Man water.  That is one of the areas <Col N="1039" /> that should be considered, and there is a need for us to consider a revision of the legislation in regard to fines and deterrents.</P>

      <P>Yesterday evening Senator Browne suggested that 200-mile limit would not be very effective. He asked in relation to European countries what powers of arrest we might have if these countries should ignore the existence of the European Community.  The more important thing is that we as a sovereign State are extending our waters by 200 miles and they would be obliged to respect the laws of the State in question.  He seemed also to have forgotten that in the last few days the USSR itself has announced the extension of its limit to 200 miles also, and it is quite obvious that there is now a consensus opinion whereby international limits are going to be a standard 200-miles right throughout the world.  Perhaps the unilateral decision taken by some countries a few years ago has led to this sort of move and might now bring about an apparently more effective conclusion to the Law of the Sea Conference that has dragged on for the last few years than appeared likely prior to this.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I believe that allied to this extension of our limit to 200 miles there is a vital necessity for us to have imposed some inner exclusive coastal band to protect not only the livelihood of our fishermen but to protect our fishing stocks and to arrange for effective conservation methods in the spawning and breeding grounds within that 50-mile area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, a quota system such as was proposed by the Community is in my opinion unfair, firstly because I do not believe it would be effectively policed and implemented at landing ports within our Community partner countries.  It is unfair also to the only country within the Community which has been building up a fishing fleet and trying to build up its fishing catch over the last number of years at a time when those <Col N="1040" /> other EEC countries have seen their landings and their fleets scaling down gradually because of their over fishing of their own waters prior to that.  A quota system based on historical performance is bound to militate against the smaller country and against the country that is trying to expand its fleet and its fish catches.</P>
    <P>The continuance of the 12-mile limit, as was proposed by the Community also, I believe would be ineffective as far as this country is concerned.  Off the south-east coast at the time of the herring season these very large and harmful fishing methods will be used right to the very limit of our 12 miles.  Similarly throughout the Irish Sea which is quite a narrow channel and has a 12-mile limit on both the British and Irish sides, in the area of the Isle of Man or anywhere else at any time any night&mdash;possibly even to night&mdash;one can see that the centre of the Irish sea will look like O'Connell Street at Christmas time with a string of lights of French, Dutch and German trawlers fishing those areas.</P>
    <P>The need for an extension of a 12-mile limit, in so far as the fishermen on the eastern seaboard are concerned, is that the prawn beds and the areas of main prawn landing in the country exist, many of them, outside our existing 12-mile limit.  The harmful methods of fishing for prawn which have been carried out by the trawlers from other countries have meant that to a large extent a number of these prawn beds have been very badly damaged and a lot of the Irish boats have had to stop fishing prawns in an effort to allow the beds time to restock.  So for the eastern seaboard fishermen it is vitally important that the 12-mile limit should be extended very much so that the entire area of prawn feeding and spawning in the Irish sea is preserved.  It is very important from that point of view that this should be done.</P>
    <P>Of course I think&mdash;this was touched on by other Senators as well&mdash;that it is quite pointless for us to talk about introduction of effective conservation measures and to talk about the continuance of expansion of the Irish fishing <Col N="1041" /> fleet unless we take into account the fact that to get a real fishing industry going and to maximise the benefit that the fishing industry can bring to the national economy there is a vital and urgent need to provide a sufficient amount of on-shore back-up facilities for the fleet that they have not got at the present time, except in a small number of harbours.  There is a need to provide an efficient number of all-weather, all-states-of-the-tide harbours where fleets can come in and discharge and bunker in comfort and in safety. I know of too many ports around the country which are merely harbours of refuge, which are tidal harbours where fishermen have to wait for the tide to enter and have to leave again on the top of the tide to get out.  They are tied up for long periods as a result of having to operate out of these tidal harbours, many of which are already overcrowded.  Allied to any extension of our fishing limits there is a need for us to examine the Act which set up and designated five harbours as being State harbours and being the harbours in which most of the on-shore facilities would be based.  Time and the fishing industry and the ambition of Irish fishermen have passed by the effectiveness of the Act.</P>
    <P>There are now a number of harbours from which there are more trawlers and bigger trawlers fishing out than there were fishing out of these State harbours some few years ago.  I am thinking of two ports in particular; one is a State harbour into which a lot of money has been poured and from which 30 boats fish out at present.  The other is a harbour some 12 miles away out of which 23 boats are fishing, and eight others are on order.  But it is not a State harbour. Consequently it is not entitled to the same level of grants and the same amount of attention as the State harbour.  Neither is it under the direct control or maintenance of the Bord of Works which State harbours are.  The harbour authority responsible for it, because they do not receive sufficient harbour dues from it, are not interested in its maintenance.</P>
    <P>Consequently there is a real need to examine all the shore base facilities in <Col N="1042" /> the country if we want to make the best use of this extension of our limits. There is a need to designate a number of other harbours as State harbours. There is a need to say to our Community partners that if we are extending our limits to 200-miles it means that one quarter of the total new sea area which is being brought into the Community is being contributed by this country.  I think that is very important. One quarter of the entire 200-mile fishing limit around the EEC will be provided by the passing of this order today, and that one quarter is being provided by a country which has only one quarter of 1 per cent of the total population of the EEC.  That one quarter of these new fishing areas and sea areas is being provided by a country that has only two-thirds of 1 per cent of the entire gross national product of the EEC.</P>
    <P>If we are to provide that 25 per cent contribution to the extended areas of the Community countries we are entitled to say to them that we want from them in return quite a large capital contribution towards the development of our on-shore facilities and the proper building of all-weather harbours with facilities such as proper slips, proper boatyards and repair facilities and allied processing industries with chandleries and auction halls based in the ports.  There is also a need for us to ensure that there is a development of fair and open markets where the Irish fisherman can expect to get a realistic price for his catch and where he can expect and see that off-shore buyers are going to be brought in and where prices will be commensurate with the work and the risk and capital outlay involved.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before&mdash;not here, but in other places&mdash;of the very inefficient, to put it at its mildest form, the very inefficient way in which a small number of buyers in the main market in the country seem to be able to control the price of fish, not landed by them but landed at considerable risk and inconvenience by other people.  It is quite wrong, and it is wrong that the State agency involved withdrew itself from that market.  The market as it operates at present is discriminating against the <Col N="1043" /> fishermen and is not ensuring that they get a fair price for their fish.  It is certainly ensuring that some other people apparently do very well, but not ensuring that the fishermen get the deal they should be getting.  There is a need for State involvement to ensure that there are realistic market places where real market prices pertain.  There is a need for the State to develop to a further degree, although in this area I think the State has been pretty efficient, the amount of our fishing exports.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that at present as our waters exist there is no overall fishing surplus within Community waters. There is a very good living to be obtained by the dual implementation of proper conservation measures and the development of proper fleets and shore-based facilities.  There is not, to my mind, sufficient fish within the proposed new 200-mile EEC level to allow for access to a large degree of third countries.  Third countries are, of course, claiming traditional rights, some of which may have some justification but the majority of which, as Senator Deasy so ably outlined, have absolutely no justification on historical or other grounds.</P>
    <P>Of course there is the problem which the British have in Icelandic waters and the problem now that British and French fleets are going to have in the Barents Sea because of the announcement by the USSR of its intention to extend its limit to 200 miles.  If we are to provide one-quarter of the 200 miles sea area which the EEC intends to negotiate to some degree on <i>quid pro quo</i> bargaining position to allow some of the other Community countries to continue their traditional fishing in third-country waters, then we will have to insist that the strictest methods of conservation are imposed upon any third country with whom any agreement is entered into.  The agreement, first of all, should be on short term and should be on the basis of that third country phasing out its interest in the outer band of the EEC 200-mile limit.</P>
    <P>The agreement should also be negotiated on the basis that there will be strict conservation and quotas imposed <Col N="1044" /> and that there will be a right of boarding on the seas within those limits by fishery protection vessels operating on behalf of the Community which will check the size and type of fish landed by those third countries. I believe that that same type of control should be introduced, and this country should insist on that being introduced, on the ships of our EEC partners which will operate within the 200-mile limits off our shores.</P>
    <P>There is a very good and equitable case for us to make that as least as far as our EEC partnerships are concerned any fish which they take pursuant to any quota agreement or conservation control agreement within the outer part of our 200-mile limits should be landed at Irish ports.  It is fish taken from Irish waters, and I think that we are entitled to ask that those fish should be landed at Irish ports and put through Irish processing industries and that the Irish economy should have a direct spin-off benefit from them.  Alternatively, if that is not felt to be realistic because of the existing lack of on-shore facilities then I believe we are entitled to demand that this country should receive a toll on any fish taken within our 200-mile limit area and landed at ports in the country of origin of the ships concerned.  Otherwise by virtue of our making this order here today we should be allowing our partner countries to come in and take fish from waters which we should then own on the strict basis of the passing of this order today.  If other countries are to be allowed to take fishing interests in our waters we are entitled either to a toll payment on the quota fish they take out of our waters or to see that those fish are landed at our ports, with the spin-off benefits to the Irish economy and Irish employment.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disappointed to hear the melancholy tone of Senator Browne here yesterday evening talking about the dangers involved in fishing and the number of fatalities and the fact that our fishermen were fishing unnecessarily dangerously.  I do not think that this is in any way true. Fishing has always been a dangerous <Col N="1045" /> industry.  The men who go to sea know that it is dangerous.  They take on that danger and they do it gladly. They do it with ambition and many of them do it with a heritage and a tradition.  They do of course incur high risks and they are entitled to high rewards.  It is my view that Irish fishermen still believe that if an adequate inner coastal band is negotiated for them, if the outer band is properly patrolled and conservation methods and quotas imposed on our Community partners in those outer areas and if the third countries are made to phase themselves out, then there is a future for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that most of the new Irish boats that are on order in Irish boatyards at present vary in size from 65 to 80 feet.  The current tender price for a 65-foot boat in an Irish yard is between £290,000 and £310,000.  By the time it comes to completion with the price variation clause adjustment it means that a 65-foot boat costs £350,000.  There are a number of 80-foot boats on order for Irish ports at present.  An 80-foot steel boat is estimated to cost, by the time of its delivery, £1 million.  At present there are 23 boats fishing out of the village in which I live.  There are eight more on order.  Of that eight, two are 80-foot boats which will cost £1 million each.  The remaining six are 65-foot and will cost £350,000 each. A skipper is expected to put up 20 per cent of the cost of his boat and borrow the remainder and is expected to repay it over a relatively short period.  It is a very heavy investment and a very heavy burden for any young man to take on his shoulders.  Irish skippers and Irish fishermen are still prepared to do it, which I think proves that they still believe that there is a future in Irish fishing, and they want to see better support services from the agencies of the Government and from the community to enable them to develop their industry to the fullest.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to fish exports and the fact that I feel that in this area the State agency has been pretty effective.  The figure for exports in 1963 was £1.7 million.  By 1975 it had risen to £13.6 million and represented <Col N="1046" /> 1.51 per cent of our total exports.  Of the Community countries, only Denmark, which as we know relies heavily on fishing as one of its main industries, has a higher export percentage of fish as a percentage of its national exports.  Denmark exports 5.71 per cent.  Of the others Netherlands export 0.8 per cent, the UK 0.37 per cent, France 0.24, Germany 0.14, Belgium 0.14 and Italy 0.1 per cent.  From that it will be seen that while we have a relatively small catch, a relatively small landing, the percentage of our total exports which is represented by our fishing interests is quite high and is the second highest in the Community. It represents a realisation on the part of the Irish fishing interests that there is a future for them if they receive the support services and the help which I think they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I was a little taken aback to discover that the limits as determined in the appendix to the order are set out by way of co-ordinates.  I do not know many people in this House who have admiralty charts in their possession.  I happen to have, but I did not have time to check the co-ordinates and I doubt if many other people did.  It is a pity that the limits were not shown by way of map or illustration.  One of the areas which I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to refer to in replying is in the area of the Irish Sea.  In his opening remarks he referred to the fact that in certain cases the extension of the 200-mile limit would involve overlapping with neighbouring countries.  I understand that in the Irish Sea a mean line has been taken from the nearest points on each coast and the co-ordinates are given as representing the line involved. Parts of the Irish Sea are only 50 miles wide and they involve a number of offshore islands.  I would be interested to know whether the co-ordinates are being taken from the points off the islands or from the main points off the mainland.</P>
    <P>My main reason for asking this is that I want to know how the area we have already referred to and about which the Parliamentary Secretary intervened is being treated.  The Isle <Col N="1047" /> of Man is part of British waters and if the co-ordinates are to be taken as a mean line between the nearest point on the Isle of Man and the nearest point on the Irish mainland, it would make a great difference to what would happen in the Irish Sea.  If, instead, it is being taken from the Cumbrian coast behind the Isle of Man then, of course, a greater area would come within our control.  Therefore it is important, especially for our east coast fishing interests, that this point is dealt with in the reply.</P>
    <P>Finally, I find it very difficult to understand how certain people, including our Community partners, can appear to argue that the fish in the waters off our coast are not ours and that they are entitled to fish them.  By virtue of the Treaty of Accession and the fact that one country is not allowed to discriminate against the nationals of another, any foreigner from within the Community is quite entitled to come here and set up business. Indeed, any foreigner would be entitled to come to this country and fish out of an Irish port and he would be subject to the same regulations and the same laws as an Irish national. I wonder how Irish farmers would feel if a number of our Community partners arrived into Irish land which they did not own and began to farm it, adopting a scorched earth policy which left the earth barren and in such a condition that it was unworkable for crops and would not support stock.  This is what has happened in Irish waters because of the activities of our Community partners.  I do not see how, in equity or in fairness, that can be justified.  A fair analogy might be that Irish coal miners should be allowed to visit the valleys of the Ruhr and remove the coal on the basis that it is part of the Community area generally that because it is a natural resource they are entitled to their share of it as well.  The argument is obviously fallacious and I think it should be resisted to the greatest degree by our representatives.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as others have done, on the marvellous performance <Col N="1048" /> he has put up so far.  He is fighting, and it is important to emphasise this.  For a long time those of us who represent Government parties chose not to make this a political issue at home in Ireland.  We felt it was better that there should be a solidarity shown by political representatives from all parties in support of the Minister's fight to see an equitable deal worked out for Irish fishermen.  In the light of statements made recently by spokesmen on behalf of the Opposition, that line of solidarity appears to have been broken. If they choose to break it, then I think it is fair that they should remember that the Minister is fighting a rear-guard action to try to remedy an agreement negotiated by them.  As I said, whether it was negotiated by ineptitude or misunderstanding is open to question, but they negotiated an agreement whereby an ineffective six- to 12-mile limit was allowed as a special concession for this country up to 1982 and after that time the Community's boats would be entitled to fish within our bays and up to our headlands without let or hinderance.</P>
    <P>At this time the Minister is given the most difficult task of all: to try and change something that has already been decided and already negotiated. It is less than fair and less than honest of those who negotiated that bad agreement in the first place to endeavour now to represent him as not having the genuine interest of Irish fishermen at heart.  If he had not, the concessions we have got so far would not have been made available to us.  I believe that most members of the Oireachtas, and certainly the Irish public generally, are behind him in his fight. I feel this order being made here today should be the first of a number of changes in our laws relating to marine life, fishing interests, fishery protection and detection and fines and, most especially in the area of conservation.  I would hope that a broad change in all the laws governing the entire fishing interests and marine areas would take place within the next 12 to 18 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by thanking Senators for the good wishes which <Col N="1049" /> several of them expressed towards the Minister.  I agree very much with what Senator Boland said about him and his efforts and the situation in which he has been placed.  I do not want to harp too much on that for fear of doing anything to demolish the relatively uniform approach of both the Government and Opposition to which Senator Boland also referred.</P>
      <P>In particular I should like to thank Senator Uí Eachthéirn for her kind wishes to the Minister which I know, given the political possibilities in this matter for her party, was a generously intended sentiment which I will pass on to him.</P>
      <P>In the debate which I listened to yesterday I thought that the Senator who led for the Opposition, Senator Eoin Ryan, played the stakes up very high when he seemed to say&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;that if we did not get, in renegotiating the fisheries policy, exactly the regime which suited us in terms of an exclusive 50-mile zone, our whole membership of the EEC ought to be reconsidered. I do not want to say words that the Senator did not use but he certainly said that the question of our future membership was something that we should look at again.  If that is not brinkmanship, it is a deliberate statement of opinion by a very senior and responsible Senator in the Opposition party laying, to some extent or threatening to lay, our whole EEC membership with its enormous benefits, financial, economic, political, moral even, for our people, on the line if we do not succeed in reaching our uttermost demands in regard to this sector of our economy and our national life. That is a serious thing for Senator Ryan to say and, without any intention of making a special point out of it, I hope he will take some opportunity of making his position clear about that or, alternatively, of letting us know whether it is a point of view that is widely held in his party.  It certainly was repudiated by other Members of his party in the Dáil last night when I mentioned what I had heard a couple of hours earlier here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another line which Senator Ryan took, and which was echoed subsequently <Col N="1050" /> by Senator Killilea, was the line of admiration for the Icelanders. We naturally do not need to be pushed into admiration for a small people that have to fight their corner with minimal resources because their situation, for a lot of reasons, all too easily reminds us of our own.  Of course, the Icelanders, or anybody else who try to assert themselves against much stronger economies and political entities, will have our sympathy provided they keep within the ordinary laws of humanity&mdash;which of course the Icelanders did&mdash;and do not flagrantly ignore international law.  Of course they have our sympathy.</P>
    <P>At the same time it is not responsible to ignore the difference between the Icelandic situation and ours.  The Icelanders are not part of the European Economic Community of which we are members; they do not owe a duty to any partners, they are on their own.  I wish them the best of luck&mdash;I am sure everybody here does also&mdash;but they are on their own.  They make their own judgments in their own way about their own affairs&mdash;that is what independence is all about&mdash;and, to that extent, because we have qualified our independence willingly by entering the EEC we have subjected certain parts of our independence to the qualification that a Community of which we are an equal member will have a final say on them.  To that extent they are in a quite different situation.  Perhaps it is not badly intended but it is not responsible for Senators to hold up the Icelanders, as Senators W. Ryan and Killilea did, for emulation by us.</P>
    <P>We cannot take the line the Icelanders did, and the reason is that we owe a duty to partners who contribute, and have contributed enormous sums, in the spirit of the European Community, with the intention of achieving an even standard of prosperity everywhere. I do not need to remind Senators that these sums do not grow on trees but must come out of their own economies.  We expect them to continue contributing these sums until such time &mdash;it would appear not in the proximate future&mdash;when we will be as prosperous and as well able to look after ourselves as the best of them.  Naturally, we all <Col N="1051" /> hope on both sides of the House that that day will quickly come.  Common sense and experience tell us that it is not possible over-night to make a modern, highly industrialised, very quickly-growing and wealth-producing economy out of the sort of economy we have had for centuries.</P>
    <P>We shall have to look to our partners for support, understanding and sympathy for many years to come. That has been forthcoming.  In this instance we have come across the first really substantial difficulty&mdash;there have been other difficulties, of course, in the working out of the agricultural policy and elsewhere&mdash;where people must realise that a serious national asset is at stake.  We are being asked to give up something to which we feel we have a right.  We will not give it up if we can possibly avoid it.  As everybody here is aware, and as most Senators have been generous enough to say, the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, are doing their utmost.  If he is not doing that, I should like to have named the Deputy or Senator who would or could do more.  He is doing his utmost with the entire support of the Government to achieve that regime which the advice of the Irish fishermen's organisations and of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries regard as the minimum essential for the proper development of the Irish fishing industry, namely, a 50-mile exclusive band.</P>
    <P>As I told the House yesterday, if that measure has not been achieved by 1st January next it is the Government's intention, unilaterally, to apply measures&mdash;of which, naturally, I cannot give the House details&mdash;in so far as we are able to do so, which will have the effect of guaranteeing the future of the industry.  Those measures will be applied unilaterally. They will be taken in consultation with our partners.  Nonetheless, they will be measures deliberately intended to show that we are, to use an expression several Senators employed, digging our heels in, that we are serious about the minimum essential for the development of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> The issue has been somewhat confused&mdash;and I do not want to introduce any heat into what has been an extremely good and friendly debate by saying this&mdash;by representations of our legal situation in the Dáil, not here I confess, although I did notice a trace of it in what Senator Cáit Ahern said though I believe she did not intend it that way, representations which are simply not accurate.  It was said in the Dáil last night, during the Private Members' debate&mdash;and I am sure the same thing will be said again if anyone cares to listen to the resumption of that debate at 7 o'clock&mdash;that there is nothing to stop us from passing the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, at present before the Dáil, a Bill promoted by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Fisheries.  A second statement made last night and given wide publicity this morning&mdash;this is a point which Senator Ahern repeated&mdash;was that the British Government was behind this line.  The impressions which these two statements create are false.  It is true that we are a sovereign State and that there is no international policeman who will punish us or invoke sanctions against us for proclaiming, and, if we can do it, defending a 50-mile exclusive zone.  But our obligations under the Treaty of Rome and the Accession Treaty forbid us; that is what stops us.  If we want to get into a situation where, without breaking any law or falling foul of any regulation binding us, we can proclaim a unilateral 50-mile zone, we must leave the European Economic Community. There is no way out of that dilemma.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers who try to portray it as being an unreal dilemma are not being straightforward with the people they are talking to.  It is possible, of course, for an Opposition speaker to say&mdash;as I construe our legal obligations under the Treaty of Rome and the Accession Treaty&mdash;that we are perfectly free to do it because of this and that, because a new situation has arisen which invalidates any contractual obligations we entered into before those new circumstances arose.  It is possible to say that but, unfortunately it is not the law; that is not the international law of treaties <Col N="1053" /> either in common international law or in that as applied by the European Court, to whose findings on this matter our Supreme Court is subject.  Our Supreme Court, in interpreting a problem which arises on the construction of the Treaty of Rome, the Accession Treaty or matters of that kind must refer that question to the European Court for decision.</P>
    <P>The advice the Government have received&mdash;and I hope nobody in this or the other House will suspect the Government of concealing more favourable advice; I hope they will not be thought not to be making the best of advice which we got which was more favourable to ourselves; I hope nobody will have such an absurd suspicion&mdash;is that we are not free in law to take the step we were urged to take in the Dáil in terms of the Private Members' Bill debated there. Therefore newspaper statements, or Senators' or Deputies' opinions along the lines of that Bill and of what is being said in its defence are not accurate.  I do not say they are deliberately inaccurate or false, but they are misleading in their effect on the public and the Press, and do not facilitate the Minister's task in trying to ensure that the ostensible object behind that Bill will be achieved. They do not facilitate that one bit.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a special point of Senator Ahern's remark because I do not think she said it in any detail and I guess that she herself is a victim of the false impression I have described, that the British were behind the stance we are taking.  Of course, the British would also like an exclusive zone and, to that extent, there is a similarity of view.  If what Senator Ahern means is that the British are taking a line and are actually doing something which we are neglecting to do, that is not true.</P>
    <P>I heard it said last evening that the British have enacted a law which entitles them to draw exclusive fishery limits.  So they may have, but it does not get away from the question of whether they are legally free to do that having regard to their obligations <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EEC.  It does not get away from that question.  The Opposition <Col N="1054" /> ran away from that question when I put it to them, but it does not answer the question.  We have that very same ostensible paper power since 1964.  In the Maritime Jurisdiction Act of that year we gave ourselves the power to extend our exclusive limits to any distance.  That has been put up with subject to the Accession Treaty by which we laid on ourselves all the structure and system of the European Economic Community.  Merely to invoke that piece of paper in isolation answers no questions at all.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous to pretend or to imply that the British are intending to do something which we, out of sloth or abjectness, are neglecting to do. That is not so.  That is all in general I wanted to say about the exclusive 50-mile zone because it is not what is before us today, although I know most Senators have it in mind.</P>
    <P>What is before us today is the enactment in the form of a motion to approve a draft order of an exclusive limit of 200 miles <i>vis-à-vis</i> all countries other than the ones with which we are in partnership and other than countries with which we have other contractual obligations.  I think Spain is the only one.  I agree that it is in consequence of the fairly universal adoption of a 200-mile limit <i>vis-á-vis</i> the world in general that the problem has suddenly become acute here.  There may be some Senators who do not appreciate this but all of those who spoke do: the reason why the Minister is having, and will have, such cruel difficulty in extracting something like a 50-mile zone from the EEC partners is that the fishermen of the EEC partners are just at the juncture in their existence when they are least willing to concede such a thing.  This is just the moment at which they themselves are being pushed back by the operation in Iceland, Norway and the Faroes of this very measure, namely the 200-mile exclusive limit, unchallenged by any partnership arrangements.  British, German and Dutch fishermen are being pushed out of fishery grounds they have fished for hundreds of years.  I heard a lot of talking about looting, plundering and so on.  In the case of the individual <Col N="1055" /> fisherman who has grown up and spent his life doing this it is hard to tell him that something which nobody ever thought was unlawful before has suddenly become scandalous.  He is now being pushed out of these grounds. When he looks around to see what fishing grounds are left, naturally he is ten times more unwilling to give them up or to concede our exclusive claim than he would have been before the 200-mile limit ever arose.</P>
    <P>I hope this will be clearly understood. This is the feature which makes it particularly difficult, namely that we are seeking to establish this right at the very moment when our partners are most motivated not to concede it at the very moment when they are feeling the squeeze themselves.  They have been squeezed in the North Atlantic.  Now they feel it is the last straw that they should be squeezed in the mid-Atlantic as well, off the Irish coast.  That is a featural thing which I only mentioned.  I know that Senators who know umpteen times more about fishing than I do, know this very well. But there may be some Senators who may not have appreciated this aspect, so I thought I would mention it briefly.</P>
    <P>Nobody listening to this debate could fail to have been impressed by the horrifying descriptions of bad conservation, or non-conservation, of over-fishing, bad fishing methods, illegal fishing and of the necessity to apply now proper conservation measures.  Nobody could have been unimpressed by what we have heard from Senators who come from seaboard constituencies, if it is not out of order to refer to Senators coming from constituencies.  They have firsthand experience of these things and their description of how our waters or waters adjacent to what were our limits have been left, through the actions of others, were horrifying to me.  The Government are fully aware of this and these things are in the Minister's mind in the efforts he is making to achieve what we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>Two other matters arose out of Senator Boland's contribution.  I will deal with the lesser one first, the question <Col N="1056" /> of the co-ordinates in the Irish sea.  I took advice about this when the Senator spoke.  I understand the answer in regard to the Isle of Man is that the Isle of Man projects so little to the west of a line joining the mainland coast to the north with the coast of North Wales that it does not shove the midway line between Britain and Ireland much to the west.  It does not, in other words, make much difference to the appearance of this line.  In regard to the Senator's generral observations about the line, I said, when I spoke yesterday that while we do not expect our lines to coincide exactly with those drawn by the British or French&mdash;for reasons not material here&mdash;we hope that we will by negotiation arrive at mutually agreed and acceptable lines so that the degree of overlap, which there certainly will be, will be ultimately eliminated.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Senator wondering why the limits are defined by co-ordinates rather than by a map I guess the answer is&mdash;if the Senator wishes I will find out for him with more authority&mdash;that co-ordinates do not need a language, nor of course does a map, but they are something which can be plotted on any skipper's chart for himself.  It seems to me to be more likely to be a satisfactory way of doing it than to produce a map on which a line is drawn.  If the Senator is seriously interested in this, I will try and get him more exact information.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland, Senator Cáit Ahern, and I think another Senator, spoke about the problem of policing a very much extended limit.  This problem has been somewhat minimised. Of course, the Government will do their best, with the means available to them, to fulfil their duty of policing our territorial waters or waters over which we have a jurisdiction for fishery purposes.  I do not think it is right for anyone who is not fully aware of the problems of sea-patrolling to more or less dismiss as of no weight the matter of keeping these seas by force or by police methods free of marauders.  I did not expect to answer questions like this but my recollection is that the former Minister <Col N="1057" /> for Defence said that he would need another 11 seagoing, all-weather patrol ships effectively to control an extra 50-mile limit let alone a 200-mile one.  Senators may complain about the naval force being small.  It has never been at a greater strength in material or men, small though it is now.  Senators know the financial and organisational difficulties presented in an investment of that kind.  It is not just a question of buying or building that number of ships.  They have to be manned.  Shore and supply facilities and so on have to be provided for them.  It is a very serious and difficult task.  Nobody, I hope, will expect it to be performed overnight.  Of course, the Government are alive to its difficulties and to the duty of doing their best towards that end.</P>
    <P>On this topic of getting our Community partners to help us with policing, I know there is an idea that the Community might get to the point some day when we might have a common fisheries defence system, with common patrol ships and a common system of jurisdiction whereby a ship of any EEC nationality could arrest an outside marauder anywhere or even a partner ship which was breaking the law and have that ship tried, not necessarily in the flag state but anywhere in the EEC territory. That would be a very desirable development.  I was glad Senator Boland mentioned it, because it gives me an opportunity of putting this topic in the perspective of European opinion and of the kind of things which tend to be said about us on the Continent among the people to whom we look for support, to whose sympathy we look and whose understanding we expect when we ask for this or that concession.</P>
    <P>I was in Germany about eight weeks ago and happened to see a television programme about Ireland, which lasted for about half-an-hour or 40 minutes. It was an absolutely horrifyingly unflattering and hostile programme. Subsequently I telephoned the man who made it and gave out murder to him, but he did not promise to make another one to counteract it.  One of the things in it which was used in <Col N="1058" /> order to, as I believe, deliberately from his point of view&mdash;as a journalist he was just as much entitled to make an opinion about this as anybody else&mdash;certainly calculated to stir up German opinion against us, was a reference to this very thing.  The section of the programme ran somewhat along these lines: the Irish do not fish their own waters; they do not exploit them but they want German destroyers to come and do the policing for them.  That was the line the programme took.</P>
    <P>Every Senator here knows, even from listening to this debate, that dislike of, distrust or resentment of foreigners, even ones in this partnership with us, even those who are separated from us only by an hour or an hour-and-a-half flight, is so easily aroused.  Senators spoke here yesterday about the Dutch, Germans and the French as though they had been traditional enemies, instead of traditional friends.  Those were the kinds of terms in which they were spoken of.</P>
    <P>It is all too easy to develop that kind of feeling towards one's foreign neighbours even though they are people in the same partnership as you. We saw examples of how it can be done; we are seeing examples of it even in this context.  We feel we are in the right about this thing and, accordingly, anybody else, even though it might be of vital interest to some sectors of our neighbour's economy, must necessarily be in the wrong. Ordinary human weakness and the tendency to make rhetorical simple argument will soup up feeling.  That feeling can just as easily be souped up against us; we can just as easily be the victims of it.  The example I have given is a very strong one.  It is about the last thing anybody might have thought of as being a likely target for a hostile programme.</P>
    <P>We might have been more easily thought of by the fact that we are individually <i>per capita</i> the highest of the Nine partner states; <i>per capita</i> the Irish citizen gets more from the EEC than anybody else.  It might have been thought that the programme would, say, speak about the effects <Col N="1059" /> of the benefits in other ways.  But this was the little point concentrated on &mdash;that we would not fish the water ourselves; that we had not done so, we had left them largely unexploited but now expected German destroyers to come and keep the waters clear of outsiders.  That is the kind of thing which I thought I should just mention to the House because it is a severe warning to us, except in this instance we are at the receiving end, of how bad feeling can be stirred up in a small way by a matter of this kind which does not, on the face of it, seem capable of so doing.</P>
    <P>I thank the House again for a very good debate.  I recommend the Motion.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 11 are related.  Their purpose is simply to provide an Irish title for the Wildlife Advisory Council to be established under section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> Amendments Nos. 2, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 55 and 56 are related and I will deal with them together.  The purpose of Amendment's Nos. 2, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17 is to provide that, in addition to notifying the planning authority, the Minister shall also notify An Bord Pleanála of the establishment of specially protected areas such as nature reserves and refuges for fauna. Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 provide that the board be notified of any regulations made, varied or revoked by the Minister regarding access to or use of such areas.  Amendment No. 3 is an obvious technical amendment necessitated by the enactment of the 1976 Planning Act.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4, 41, 43 and 44 are related and I will deal with them together.  Their purpose is to provide that the business of taxidermy, which can provide a potential outlet for private collections of rare or threatened species of wildlife, will be conducted under licence granted by the Minister in the same way as other wildlife dealings such as the sale of game.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are related and I will deal with them together. They are essentially drafting amendments in order to make it absolutely clear that the orders which the Minister may revoke or amend under section 8 do not include voluntary land purchase orders made under section 55 or court orders referred to in sections 75, 76, 77 and 78.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 is to clarify that the requirement that orders made by the Minister must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas does not extend to an order bringing the Act or part of the Act into operation or to voluntary land purchase orders made under section 55.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is no more than a change of word in order to give flexibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 9, following further consultation with the Department of Finance, it was agreed that subsection (4) of section 11 imposed an unnecessary obligation on the Minister in the performance of his functions and should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 is necessary to take account of the amendment of <Col N="1061" /> Parts III, IV and V of the 1963 Local Government (Planning and Development) Act by the 1976 Act of the same title, and of the planning appeal functions to be vested in An Bord Pleanála under the 1976 Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is to cater for subsequent amendments of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Amendment No. 18 is to make provision for licensing a person to do reasonable acts which are neither scientific nor educational but which could interfere with or alter the habitat of protected flora, though not to any significant extent, for example, taking sand or gravel from a habitat of flora without damaging or disturbing the habitat to any appreciable extent.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is necessary in order to take account of import restrictions imposed by section 52.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 20 is made necessary by the recent enactment of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976.  Section 40 (b) of that Act amendment section 46 (i) of the 1963 Planning Act, referred to in section 21 (8).</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 24 are related and I will deal with them together.  The purpose of Amendment No. 21 is to exempt from the prohibition in section 22 (4) the disturbance or unintentional injuring or killing of a protected wild bird in the course of ornithology.  Amendment No. 24 provides a consequential safeguard against any abuse of this exception.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22, 28 and 37 are related and I will take them together.  The basic amendment is Amendment No. 37 which exempts from the prohibition in subsection (1) of section 32 acts which are lawful under other statutes.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 28 are purely drafting amendments being made for consistency with the wording of amendment No. 37.  Amendments No. 23 and 26 are cognate and I will take them together.  They are mere drafting amendments to put beyond doubt that the wild birds in question are protected wild birds.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 25 and 30 are <Col N="1062" /> cognate and I will take them together. During the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad&mdash;Volume 83, No. 1, columns 47-50&mdash;Senator W. Ryan tabled amendments for the same basic purpose as these amendments.  He subsequently withdrew them and my predecessor undertook to introduce suitable amendments in the Dáil. These are the amendments now in question.  They are to meet a situation where there is sufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution for a hunting offence under section 22 or section 23 but it is not possible to establish with certainty where precisely the alleged offence was committed nor, consequently, the appropriate District Court district for jurisdiction purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the District Court rules, summary proceedings for offences under these sections in the circumstances of doubt to which I have referred could only be taken in the court area wherein the accused resides.  This could prove very inconvenient for witness in certain instances, and the effect of these amendments is that such proceedings could be taken in any District Court district.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 are cognate and I will deal with them together.  The purpose of amendment No. 27 is to exempt a person who disturbs or unintentionally injures or kills protected wild animals while he is engaged in zoological studies or other scientific pursuit.  Amendment No. 29 provides a consequential safeguard against any abuse of the exemption. Amendment No. 31 is just a minor drafting amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 32 and 34 are cognate and I will deal with them together.  Amendment No. 32 provides a necessary cross-reference to the renewal by the Minister of hunting licences under subsection (6).  Amendment No. 34 provides that a person applying to the Minister for the renewal of a hunting licence must make a formal declaration of his qualifications in accordance with section 28 as if he were applying for a licence for the first time.  This is necessary to cover any change in circumstances in the meantime, for <Col N="1063" /> example, a change in the location of the area over which the applicant has secured shooting rights.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 33 and 35 are cognate and I will deal with them together.  Their purpose is to remove doubt as to the meaning of the endorsement on a firearm certificate for a shotgun issued to a resident sportsman.  The purpose of the endorsement is to transform the firearm certificate for the shotgun into a licence to hunt and kill, first of all specified game birds during an open season for such birds and, secondly, hares during an open season for hares, provided the open season order under section 25 permits of the killing of hares by shooting.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 is a technical amendment to delete the words &ldquo;trap gun&rdquo;.  Modern meaning and usage is such that the term &ldquo;spring gun&rdquo; comprehends a trap gun, whereas a trap gun is now generally understood to be the under-and-over type shotgun which would be an appropriate weapon for hunting game birds.  Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are cognate.  Their purpose is to extend the restrictions on burning growing vegetation near certain vulnerable areas to lands which are the subject of special management agreements made under section 18.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 40, 61 and 62 are cognate and I will deal with them together.  The purpose of these three amendments is to make clear that the offences in question in section 44 (4) and in section 70 (1) and (2) are summary offences.  Indictable offences are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Amendment No. 42 is a very fine technical amendment made to exempt the possession of a protected species of fauna by a person who had lawfully acquired it.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71 and 76 are related and I will deal with them together.  The purpose of these amendments is to clarify that wherever &ldquo;parts&rdquo; of fauna or flora or wild animals and plants are mentioned in the relevant sections, namely, sections 52, 53, 72, 73 and 75, it will extend to products of such <Col N="1064" /> fauna and flora, such as manufactured articles.  Amendment No. 53 is a minor drafting amendment.  Amendment No. 54 is to provide that regulations made by the Minister under section 59 in relation to lands held by any board which may be established under section 14 shall cease to have effect not only if the board is dissolved, but also if the board otherwise cease to hold the lands, for example, if they sell the lands.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 57, 59 and 60 are related and I will deal with them together.  Their basic purpose is to cover the powers of the Garda and authorised persons acting under warrant under section 73, as well as their powers under section 72.  Amendment No. 60 in addition extends parts of specimens of fauna or flora to include products of them, such as manufactured items.  Amendment No. 58 is self-explanatory and is a desirable drafting amendment.  Amendment No. 63 is a drafting amendment, the purpose of which is to remove an anomaly in section 71 by covering licences and permissions which have been granted or issued otherwise than under the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 68 and 74 are cognate and are purely drafting amendments necessary to correct faulty typographical layout of parts of sections 72 and 73 respectively.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 72 and 73 are cognate and I will take them together. They are really drafting amendments in order to clarify that the phrase &ldquo;if need be by force&rdquo; relates only to entering and searching premises under warrant and not to the other matters&mdash;the subject of sub-paragraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) of section 73 (2). Amendment No. 75 in its effect extends the stiffer penalty provisions of section 74 (2) to cover lands which are the subject of special management agreements made under section 18.  Amendment No. 77 is to correct an obvious printing error.  Amendment No. 78 is to remove a certain ambiguity of meaning in Article 15 of the Second Schedule.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for the earnest way in which they have approached and dealt with this Bill since it was introduced here.  Indeed, I might say that the extensive list of amendments made during the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad has considerably improved the Bill.  The enactment of this Bill will provide my Department with a most valuable and necessary statutory backing for their work in the field of wildlife conservation.  It is my earnest hope and wish that the new powers will in <Col N="1066" /> time make up any leeways that may have occurred in that sphere.</P>
      <P>The main principle which the Bill espouses is a reasonable balance between man's progress and impact on his environment and the conservation of our natural resources of wild fauna and flora.  For that reason I am confident that its provisions will find general acceptance and support.</P>
