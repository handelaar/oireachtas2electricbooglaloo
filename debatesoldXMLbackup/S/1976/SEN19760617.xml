      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That this House approves the following Order in draft: Redundancy Payments (Weekly Payments) Order, 1976, copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 11 June, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="416" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this order is to give effect to a decision of the Government that an unemployed person's after-tax income from benefits should not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings after tax that he had received prior to unemployment. This decision, announced by the Minister for Finance when introducing the budget on 28th January, 1976, derives from public concern that the cumulative benefits and concessions available through different Government Departments to unemployed persons has left them with disposable incomes which are sometimes as great as, or even in certain instances higher than, their disposable incomes while at work.</P>
      <P>This order concerns only redundancy weekly payments which are one of a number of benefits that an unemployed person may be entitled to receive.  The other benefits which when added with redundancy weekly payment shall not exceed that 85 per cent are unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, pay related benefit and any refund of income tax paid as a result of unemployment. However, if unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance by itself should exceed the 85 per cent, a person will receive only the unemployment benefit or assistance but without any diminution of it.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that in enacting the Social Welfare Bill, 1976, section 12, the Oireachtas has already provided the Minister for Social Welfare with the power to effect by regulations, in so far as pay related benefit is concerned, what this order will effect in so far as redundancy weekly payments are concerned, that is, to implement the Government's decision on the 85 per cent rule as outlined. I understand that the regulations under this Act that are necessary to implement the 85 per cent decision in respect of pay related benefit have been drafted, will shortly be made by the Minister for Social Welfare and duly laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary change in the redundancy payment scheme with which I am now concerned requires an amendment <Col N="417" /> of Schedule 1 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the provisions of which apply to weekly payments. While section 30 of the Act empowers the Minister for Labour to amend Schedule 1 by order, section 5 of the Act requires that a draft of such an order must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving of the draft passed by each House before the order is made.</P>
    <P>The operation of the arrangements governing redundancy weekly payments under the redundancy payments scheme is carried out on behalf of the Department of Labour by the employment offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  Under present arrangements payment of a redundancy weekly payment is subject to the rule that when combined with certain social welfare payments it must not exceed 100 per cent of normal weekly remuneration, namely, gross taxable weekly earnings, including regular bonuses and payments in kind, at the time of declaration of redundancy, or £48.08, whichever is the lesser.  If the aggregate exceeds such limit, then entitlement to a redundancy weekly payment is reduced to keep the aggregate at that limit.  It is now proposed in this draft order, in accordance with the Government's decision, to substitute a new limit of 85 per cent of net average weekly earnings, namely, net after-tax take home pay, or £50, whichever is the lesser.  Where redundancy weekly payments are combined with disability benefit or maternity allowance the existing arrangement will continue except that the £48.08 limit will become £50.  The exclusion of persons in receipt of disability benefit or maternity allowance, or persons on short time working, and persons whose entitlements have been determined before the operative date is unavoidable for practical administrative reasons, and the problems encountered in bringing such persons within the scope of the 85 per cent rule will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Persons who while in receipt of redundancy weekly payments reach pensionable age will as heretofore <Col N="418" /> remain entitled to the residue of these payments.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should add that the new 85 per cent limit will be applicable to those who become unemployed on or after 21st June, 1976, and who because they were not unemployed during the preceding 13 weeks submit a new claim.</P>

      <P>We are not opposing this order.  We are in agreement with it.  It is time an order of this kind was made.  The situation of the past six months has been ridiculous with people being able to obtain more money while not working than those who were working.  The people who were working felt very sore about this.  We are pleased that the order has now, even at this late stage, been introduced.  The only thing I cannot understand is that it will only apply to people who become redundant after 21st June.  That means there will be two sections.  Those who are redundant for the last year or more are not going to be affected by this Bill.  A person who is lucky enough to become redundant on 20th June is going to qualify for what he was getting all the time.  I feel that even at this late stage the Minister should look into this.  I believe anybody who becomes redundant should come under this order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised to find myself apparently concluding the contributions from the floor on this Bill.  I wish to make two specific points in relation to this particular draft order.  As the Minister has said, the net purpose of the order &mdash;and I do not oppose this purpose&mdash; is to provide that an unemployed person's after tax income from benefits should not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings after tax that he has received prior to becoming unemployed.  What I want to do is to draw the attention of the Minister, who is today deputising for the Minister for Labour, to two unacceptable anomalies at different ends of the <Col N="419" /> scale in relation to unemployment and unemployment benefits.</P>
      <P>The first relates to the end of the scale of retirement age.  It is my understanding that there is an anomaly in relation to an unemployed person who reaches the age of 65, the age where he can opt to benefit under the contributory pensions scheme.  He can continue to receive redundancy payments but he takes the decision that in fact he would like to retire and claim the contributory pension.  It seems to me that that person is at a severe disadvantage if he does so retire instead of continuing to receive payment under the redundancy payments scheme.  He will receive much less by opting for his retirement pension. It is my understanding that a number of people who are not advised of this put themselves in a very disadvantageous position and forego their redundancy payments which they would be entitled to until the age of 70.</P>
      <P>It may be that the proper way to meet this problem and to cope with it is to ensure that every person who at the age of 65 is faced with this decision and inadvisably may be deciding to retire and to claim the contributory pension should be advised that it is to his disadvantage to do so. Alternatively, it may be that we should provide that the person who decides to retire should not suffer this diminution.  It is an unfortunate anomaly. There are a number of people who have been caught by this who, by opting to retire, have placed themselves in a seriously disadvantaged position where they will only get what they are entitled to under the retirement scheme and will not continue to get the redundancy payments which they under the general redundancy legislation would be entitled to until the age of 70.</P>
      <P>That is the first anomaly and I think it does create hardship.  A person can inadvertently take a decision to retire and suffer the consequences of a substantial diminution in the amount that he would get from the State if he remained redundant.  I would be grateful for the Minister's response to that particular problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> The other anomaly is at the different end of the scale: the person starting off in Ireland who finds himself or herself unable to get a job and is therefore unemployed.  The anomaly is the position that the young female school leaver finds herself in.  I would like to ask the Minister when the Government intend to abolish Part II, section 10, subsection (3) (f) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, which discriminates against the young female school leaver?  It is absurd, unfair and quite out of line with our commitments at European Community level, with our commitments as a society to bring about a fair access to employment: and access to unemployment benefits.  There is blatant discrimination against &ldquo;spinsters or widows,&rdquo; in that the Act prohibits spinsters or widows of 18 and over from receiving unemployment assistance unless they have 26 social insurance stamps.  Their male counterparts are under no such constraints. In this order we are talking about the whole area of redundancy payments, what is recognised as the most serious problem facing our society&mdash;the problem of unemployment, the problem of providing jobs and expanding the employment sector over the next few years&mdash;and we must rule out anomalies at both ends of the scale, we must rule out the anomaly which will cause hardship to the ill-advised 65 year old who, perhaps encouraged to do so, decides to retire instead of continuing to receive redundancy payments until he is 70 and, therefore, only gets the pension under the Pension Contributions Scheme.  We must remove the anomaly at the beginning of the scale where an 18 year old girl find herself at a decided disadvantage in comparison to her 18 year old male counterpart.  I would be grateful for the Minister's reaction to these two anomalies, and I would hope for a firm intention to take action on both counts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the order is not being opposed.  I note what Senator Ryan says about the fact that the order applies only to people who are redundant after 21st June.  Of <Col N="421" /> course the introduction of any reform at any point in time creates temporary anomalies.  In this instance they are temporary because it is only during the period while people who have become redundant recently continue to draw redundancy pay that this anomaly can exist.  That period is a maximum period of two years in extreme cases.  In most cases it is very much shorter.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening statement, the Government are examining this question with a view to seeing whether it is practicable to bring the position in respect of people becoming redundant before 21st June into line with respect to those who are made redundant after that date.  The problem is a practical one.  It is a problem where there are a vast number of individual cases to be gone through. The process of identifying them and taking action is very laborious indeed and could be time consuming and, indeed, quite costly.  The matter is being examined and if it is found practical to eliminate this anomaly it will be done.  The Senator is quite right in identifying it as an anomaly but it is the kind of anomaly which arises when one introduces any reform whether it is going to benefit people or otherwise.  I would suggest that there will be temporary difficulties in the period immediately after its introduction.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson raises what she describes as two unacceptable anomalies. The second one is an anomaly and she is entitled to think it unacceptable, but she is not entitled to raise it under this particular motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but I am not sure that I am entitled to reply to it because, in fact, we are dealing here with redundancy.  The one thing which school leavers cannot be is redundant.  They are unemployed and they will find themselves in a very difficult position but it does not arise in relation to redundancy, which is a different matter from the social welfare code.  I fear there are many other anomalies in the social welfare code <Col N="422" /> also which could equally be raised and which need to be looked at but this is not one which I can deal with in this Bill because it is something which relates to the Department of Social Welfare.  Whatever I am doing here I am doing it on behalf of the Minister for Labour who, I should say, is away because he is chairman of the International Labour Organisation and is unable to be here today and so I am appearing on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The first point, however, is relevant to this motion but I cannot quite go along with what the Senator said, if I have understood it correctly.  The Senator's statement seemed to imply that people are entitled at 65 to opt to be redundant.  It may be that by an abuse involving collaboration between an employer and an employee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>They are redundant, not opting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator spoke in terms that implied there was an option.  If somebody is found redundant, say, at 64 and had been working for a long period of time and has 18 months redundancy pay to come, when he or she becomes 70 he or she can choose either a contributory pension which, by definition is payable to people not available for work, or can choose to continue to draw redundancy pay on the basis of being available for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would be very difficult to sustain is that people who are in receipt of a pension, a condition of which is, or the whole purpose of which is and arises from not being available for work, should be getting a payment which is designed to compensate them for the fact that though available for work they have not got work.  It is that I think which creates the problem. The two codes are of their nature different and are designed to deal with different situations.  I do not think a right of option here could possibly arise in the matter.  Nobody opts to be redundant or if they do opt to be redundant as a result of an abuse of collaboration with their employer, it is not the purpose of the State to facilitate this operation.  I <Col N="423" /> think that if somebody faces this situation, if they have to opt between continued redundancy payments and contributory pension and the two of these are designed to meet totally different situations, it is right that they should have to opt in that way.  If I have misunderstood the Senator or have not taken her point fully, I would be more than happy to concede to her to put her point further. But as I have understood her I find myself not in sympathy with her proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, as the Minister has kindly given me an opportunity to explain, I will outline the essence of what I regard as the unfairness to the individual and therefore the anomaly in the circumstances. It occurs where somebody is redundant and then comes to be 65 and is getting redundancy payments.  Then that person might decide to retire and therefore benefit from the contributory pension scheme, but would be dramatically worse off than the accumulation of what social benefits he would be entitled to plus weekly redundancy payments.  I think that there are people who do this.  Once they have benefited from the retirement pension scheme they are no longer redundant but retired. They then realise that they have made a mistake but they cannot go back on it.  It is the sort of problem that the Redundancy Tribunal considers from time to time.  Therefore, it is either something which should be very specifically brought to the attention of the particular individual or else it should be catered for in the actual legislation and implementation of redundancy policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people who retire are worse off and some dramatically worse off in the nature of the climate.  We have not yet reached the point where pensions, private or public, leave people as well off as when they were at work.  I think the Senator may have a point in that some people may be badly advised in this matter and may not realise that by postponing applying for and receiving their contributory pension, they <Col N="424" /> could continue to receive redundancy payments and when it is finished then get the pension.  I think that the Senator in raising this point, has usefully drawn attention not to an anomaly in the system but to, perhaps, a situation where individuals misunderstand their rights and may not in fact be receiving the full advantage of the rights to which they are entitled.  To that extent the Senator's intervention, I think, is very welcome.  It is giving publicity to this particular aspect of the problem.  It is important that people who come to that point should be advised that if they wish to continue to receive redundancy payment, they should postpone seeking the contributory pension until the redundancy payment runs out.  That, as I understand it&mdash;I am subject to correction here&mdash;is entirely proper.  Perhaps the raising of the matter here may help some people to avoid making a mistake. But it is not that there is an anomaly in the system.  It is that some people make mistakes in how they use the system.  Of course one of the problems of our very complex social welfare code to which we are trying to make some adjustments here is that its complexity often defeats the people who are the beneficiaries and this imposes the onus of any Government to try to simplify the system for that and many other reasons.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have to introduce such a complex order is a reflection of the complexity of the system as inherited which involves so many different elements which in the particular instances we are dealing with here can be accumulated to create an anomalous situation in which people are better off if they do not work. That is something to be avoided.  The purpose of this order is to achieve that.  But I think in the longer run we must look to a simplification of the whole system so that this kind of anomaly does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own personal view, which I simply offer as I am standing in here for the Minister, is that really what we should work for is a system of income supplementation and minimum income, regardless of the cause of lack of income.  Whether it is a case that <Col N="425" /> people who are paid too little or whether it is that people fall through some gap in the social welfare code or whether it is that people are retired or unemployed, the purpose of the system is that they should all be treated equally so that their income is supplemented in relation to their family responsibilities if it is inadequate. We have so many different systems, all accumulating, clashing with each other, overlapping, and involving anomalies.  This is part of a historical heritage: we have inherited it.  Over a period of what cannot be less than a number of years we must try to amend it and improve it and simplify it into a single system. But that is for the future.  For the moment we have to undertake this very technically complex adjustment designed to achieve a fair and equitable result.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1976 made on the 8th day of June, 1976, by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to approve the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1976.</P>
      <P>This order provides for a minor amendment in the existing Garda Síochána pensions orders in regard to the reckoning of service of members who were appointed to the force after the age of 27 and who had prior service reckonable as &ldquo;approved service&rdquo; for Garda pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Garda Pensions Order, 1925, members of the force are, in general, entitled to double each year of their approved service in the force after 20 years for superannuation purposes. An order made in 1950 provided that in the case of any member serving on 1st January, 1950, who was appointed <Col N="426" /> to the force after the age of 27, each year of service after his 47th birthday should be doubled when calculating his pension; a similar provision for calculating the member's retirement gratuity was made in the 1951 Pensions Order.  Over the years these provisions operated to the benefit of the members concerned.  It has happened, however, that about 15 members who joined the force after the age of 27, who had prior service reckonable as approved service for Garda purposes and who either retired before reaching the compulsory retirement age, or died while serving would have been entitled to more favourable superannuation payments if their service after 20 years had been doubled, rather than after their 47th birthdays.</P>
    <P>The order now before the House provides that in such cases, superannuation will be calculated on the basis of doubling service after 20 years.  The order is being made effective from 1st January, 1967, so as to cover all the cases affected.</P>
    <P>I commend the order for the approval of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is only right that the Minister should bring this before the House.  Seeing that only about 15 people are involved I do not think that it will receive any opposition so far as the House is concerned, apart from the fact that it is a matter of justice and giving to all people who serve in the forces their rights.  The Minister mentioned something about approved service that a person might have previous to joining the Garda. I am wondering if he has in mind people who would have served in the LDF or in the Defence Forces or people such as those.  Very often people have come into the Garda after the age of 27.  As we know, the Garda are a very efficient force.  We should not alone be fair to them but grateful for the service they have given us down through the years.  Certainly we would not stand for it on any side of the House if it was felt by <Col N="427" /> any member of the force that he was in any way curtailed or denied the just pensionable rights to which he would be entitled.</P>

It does, as I said in my introductory speech, remove an anomaly in respect of about 15 members who joined the force after the age of 27 and who had approved service in what was known as Taca Síochána or who had service in the civil service which is also reckonable.  But, generally speaking, service in the civil service or the Defence Forces is reckonable as approved service.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1940, authorise the holding of sweeps in aid of the Hospitals Trust Fund by sweepstake committees appointed by the governing bodies of hospitals and provide that the scheme for each sweep must be sanctioned by the Minister for Justice.  The Acts provide that the amount of the net receipts of any sweep which may be applied to the payment of expenses must not exceed 30 per cent or such lower percentage as the Minister for Justice when sanctioning the scheme for any sweepstake may determine.  They also provide that the balance of the net receipts after payment of expenses, prizes and stamp duty must be paid into the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hospitals Trust Fund is managed by the Hospitals Trust Board, a body appointed by the Minister for Health, and payments out of the fund are made to hospitals and nursing organisations on the directions of the Minister for Health.  Section 6 of the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, provides <Col N="428" /> that whenever the participating hospitals propose to hold a sweepstake, a sweepstake committee must prepare and submit to the Minister for Justice a scheme specifying, among other things, particulars of the prizes intended to be distributed, the date, place and manner of the draw, the price of tickets, the maximum amount which may be expended by way of commission, prizes or other remuneration in relation to the sale of tickets, the proportion of free tickets to be allotted as reward to sellers, the date on which the sale of tickets is to commence, and the name of the chartered accountant who is to audit the accounts relating to the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the expenses allowable to the promoters of sweepstakes held under the Public Hospitals Acts, 1933 to 1940, from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the net receipts and to increase from 20 per cent to 30 per cent the minimum amount of the net receipts of a sweepstake that must go to the Hospitals Trust Board and to the Exchequer by way of stamp duty.  The audited accounts of the sweepstakes held in the last two years indicate that the expenses of the promoters have exceeded 30 per cent of the net receipts and they have said that it is impossible for them to continue to run the sweepstakes within the limits of the expenses allowed by the Acts. The second provision in relation to the amount payable to the Hospitals Trust Board together with stamp duty merely gives statutory force to what has been sanctioned by me in the scheme for each sweepstake since October, 1975.</P>
    <P>Up to 1973 the amount spent on promoters expenses for each sweepstake was approximately 25 per cent of the net receipts.  Gradually through 1973 that percentage crept up almost to the statutory limit of 30 per cent. In the first sweep in 1974 the expenses amounted to 29.32 per cent and the promoters, Hospitals Trust (1940) Ltd. indicated that the figure could not continue to be contained within the limit of 30 per cent because of increasing cost of salaries, wages, <Col N="429" /> stationery, printing, postage and so on.  In 1974 the promoters sought an increase in the price of sweep tickets from £1 to £2 and an increase in the super prize from £200,000 to £400,000. These changes came into effect in relation to the Cambridgeshire, 1975, which was run in October, 1975, and in the meantime the actual expenses incurred in running sweepstakes in 1974 and in the first half of 1975 were in excess of 30 per cent of the net receipts.  Figures taken from the audited accounts show that the expenses in relation to the Cambridgeshire, 1974 were 32.46 per cent, the Sweeps Hurdle, 1974, 32.19 per cent, the Lincoln, 1975, 34.44 per cent and the Irish Sweeps Derby, 1975, 35.68 per cent.</P>
    <P>The expenses in excess of 30 per cent of the net receipts of these sweepstakes had to be borne by the promoters and this excess amounted to over £440,000 for the four sweeps. The promoters normally receive a fee for managing and organising a sweepstake but in the cases I have instanced where the expenses were in excess of 30 per cent this fee was not paid.  The Cambridgeshire, 1975, which was the first sweep where £2 was charged for a ticket and a super prize of £400,000 given showed an improvement and the expenses of that sweepstake were 30.05 per cent of the net receipts.  The audited accounts for the Irish Sweeps Hurdle, 1975, which is the latest sweep for which accounts are available, show that the expenses for that sweepstake came to 34.25 per cent of the net receipts.</P>
    <P>In the light of these figures the Government accept that the statutory 30 per cent limitation is no longer realistic.  The alternative to allowing the increase now sought is to see the sweeps go out of business with the consequent loss of direct employment to nearly a thousand people and a loss of a steady source of income to hospitals, as well as a loss of revenue in stamp duty.  The salaries, wages and State insurance of employees now runs in excess of £2 million a year while expenses on such things as stationery, printing, postage, advertising and so on all help to generate <Col N="430" /> employment and keep people in their jobs.  In the circumstances it seems reasonable to raise the statutory limitation on the amount that may be paid on expenses from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the net receipts and section 1, subsection (2) (a), of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 1, subsection (2) (c), proposes that the amount of the net receipts of a sweepstake that must go to the Hospitals Trust Board together with stamp duty shall be not less than 30 per cent.  This is to replace the present requirement that not less than 20 per cent of the net receipts must be so paid.  When approving the increase in the price of tickets from £1 to £2 and the increase in the super prize from £200,000 to £400,000, the Government made it a condition that this amount should be increased to a minimum of 30 per cent of the net receipts and accordingly the proposal in the Bill when enacted will, as I have mentioned already, do no more than give statutory force to an existing arrangement which has been provided for by me in the scheme for each sweepstake since the price of a ticket was increased to £2.  Senators might wish to know that the total amount paid to the Hospitals Trust Fund from sweepstakes up to and including the Irish Sweeps Hurdle, 1975, was over £82 million.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House accept this Bill.  It is only fair to say that we feel it is necessary in view of the increases that have taken place in practically every sphere.  It is therefore natural to expect that there would be an increase in the running costs of the sweepstakes.  Over the years the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes have contributed approximately £82 million to the benefit of our hospitals and nursing organisations.  This is a very laudable occupation in which to be engaged, helping in one way or another to alleviate the sufferings of our people including the aged, infirm, improving the conditions of those people who look after them, and also the standards of our hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the adverse criticism that <Col N="431" /> may have come from many sources over the years the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes have done a very efficient job in running the sweeps.  I am also concerned at the Minister saying that were this request not accepted, there would be a further loss of jobs for approximately 1,000 people.  We know that the people who work in the sweepstakes office do so in fairly good conditions and receive a decent remuneration.  In view of the number of people unemployed at present it would be a catastrophe to add another 1,000 people to that number.  Were a sweepstake so long in existence allowed to disappear now it would take many years to build it up again, not alone at home but abroad.  For those reasons I am in agreement with the Minister's proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel bound to say that, even though the whole sweepstake operation is one which is to a large extent abhorrent to me, I could not vote against this Bill in conscience because of the very substantial implications, particularly with regard to employment, mentioned by the Minister in his opening speech.  It could be said that if we refused to pass this Bill or something of that sort, the real blame for the subsequent unemployment would not rest on the Members of this House, or Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas generally, but on the promoters of the sweepstake fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might even be true.  It might be a nice political point to make. But, unfortunately, the difference would be academic to the people concerned who might very well lose their jobs and who would not be too concerned about the reason for having lost them.  I suspect that in very many cases these people are relatively unemployable elsewhere and that to this extent the employment quotient of the whole sweepstake operation is an important aspect of it.  I would go further and say that it is now perhaps the most important aspect of the sweepstake operation.  The whole sweepstake operation has, it seems to me, changed fairly rapidly over the decades in which it has been in operation.  I <Col N="432" /> mean to say, that its purpose has changed and the degree to which it is contributing to the welfare of the Irish health service and hospital system has also diminished.  It is almost undeniable that the proportion of the moneys now being spent on our health service which comes from the sweep is now very much smaller than it was when the Sweep started.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it is quite a long time ago since the Sweep started.  Circumstances were different then.  It seemed to be perhaps quite reasonable at the time to embark on this way of making money for the hospitals.  I would have preferred if a sweepstake was to be run to benefit the hospitals, that it should be wholly a publicly-run operation.  I am not necessarily in favour of a sweepstake at all.  But, if we are to have one, we should have a wholly public one rather than have this somewhat odd situation in which you have a committee appointed by the Minister for Health under an Act of this Parliament employing a private company to run the sweepstake for it.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that have caused this Bill to come before us are basically ones relating to the operation carried out by this private company.  One of the other things that has changed in the intervening period is that the Irish Sweepstake&mdash;which was, I suspect, for some time regarded as a rather unique experiment in raising funds for charity &mdash;has caused a growing amount of adverse comment in this country and abroad.  It is widely said that sale of tickets in some jurisdictions is illegal. We have the unhappy, to put it no more bluntly, situation of a committee established by an Act of this Parliament employing a company which is engaged in illegal acts in other jurisdictions. This is the company whose fortunes we are dealing with today to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>One of the other changes that has taken place is, as the Minister outlined in his speech, that the cost of running this operation has gone up to the most inordinate degree.  We are now in the situation in which we are going to have to allow for 40 per cent of the take to be payable in expenses. <Col N="433" /> In other words, we are going to have to allow four pounds to be spent to get in every five.  We seem to be very close to the point at which the viability of the whole operation must be open to question.  We have created, if you like, a huge edifice which is employing a substantial number of people, less and less contributing to the health services and more and more just paddling frantically to keep its own head above water.  This is exactly the kind of employment situation which trade unionists and others regard with considerable alarm because it is very volatile.  Even if there is a bale-out operation carried on this time, something worse could happen at a future date.  We may be only postponing the evil day in so far as the sweep is concerned.  While I am all in favour of postponing evil days from time to time, they have to be faced up to eventually.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to see a very substantial rethink of the whole sweepstake operation carried out by the Government.  I sympathise with the Minister in this.  He is in a position which is not of his own making and has had some very difficult decisions to take.  When he comes to wind up perhaps he would give us some indication of the total amount which is being paid in management and operation fees to the promoters of the sweepstake since its inception.  This would be useful information to have which could be set, to some extent anyway, against the money they have contributed to the hospitals fund.</P>
    <P>Some people have urged&mdash;and indeed I would add my voice to theirs &mdash;that there should be substantially more disclosure of the details of the whole sweep operation whether by parliamentary investigation or otherwise. Unfortunately, we are up against the problem here that any substantial degree of disclosure might affect the stock-in-trade of the sweepstake promoting company.  That is the information on which it bases its whole operation.  Like any private company this company has capital.  It has cash capital; it also has a knowhow capital, and informational capital.  No doubt there are good commercial <Col N="434" /> reasons why this informational capital should not be made public.  It might be alleged that if this were to happen the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of the Sweep might disappear.  However, one can equally make an argument that this exposes the whole weakness of the situation; it exposes the whole weakness of a private company running what is supposed to be basically a public enterprise.  There is a fundamental conflict here that the Government and perhaps the Minister for Health and the sweepstake committee themselves will eventually have to face up to.  At present under our legislation private companies such as this can publish very vestigial accounts.  There are new regulations coming into force under the EEC which may improve the situation, but I doubt if they will improve it enough.</P>
    <P>I see this Bill fundamentally as a holding operation.  I would like to think that it will promote, not just in this House but among the Irish public at large, a whole rethink of an operation that no longer serves the purpose for which it was established to any substantial degree and which is causing, if I may say so, substantial concern in other countries throughout the world and not least in Northern Ireland where they regard this method of financing the health service as repugnant to many of the values they claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support many of the constructive criticisms put forward by Senator Horgan of this particular method of raising funds for hospitals and for the health service in Ireland.  Indeed I found his criticisms very moderately and judiciously phrased, which may to some extent stem from moving from the Independent benches to the Government benches.  Yet, as he said, and it is very true, at a time of high unemployment and recession in Ireland, it is difficult to examine objectively any institution which employs nearly a thousand people in the country.  At the same time I think we must examine objectively the operation of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes. We must be aware that down the years there has been criticism, <Col N="435" /> both in this country and outside, of the operation of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes.  Some of this criticism has been ill-informed but there is an underlying element of disquiet and cause for concern.  We know that those journalists who have sought further information and who have investigated the operation of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes have not furthered their careers in doing so. Indeed, if anything, they have either changed their immediate employment or left the country entirely.</P>
      <P>It is necessary that we realise that the whole terms of reference have changed very dramatically since the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were founded.  First of all, the State involvement in health and welfare has expanded very considerably.  Secondly, we are now a mature country, with resources, with a capacity to generate income from the public sector so that we do not need the unique structure of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes which depends on the particular activity of a private company. Thirdly, I would agree with Senator Horgan that it is very questionable whether this form of activity is the right way to go about recycling money in the country for the benefit of hospitals.  It is very questionable indeed whether this is the way in which we should go about it.  The Sweep has become a national institution, but a national institution which has been severely criticised in other countries where it is at least arguable that it operates illegally, and it has been said by official sources in other countries that it does operate illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exact function of the brief Bill before us today is one that may only delay an objective and independent examination of the operation of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  Maybe we will have to wait until another Bill comes before us proposing that not more than 50 per cent of the income generated by the sweepstakes go to the expenses of running it.  Then perhaps people will say: &ldquo;Look, this is not tolerable; this is not possible; we must examine the whole structure and operation of the Irish Hospitals <Col N="436" /> Sweepstakes.&rdquo; That would be a great pity.  It is wrong to emphasise the employment picture at surface level and to say we cannot really examine the position because we may be endangering all or some of close to 1,000 jobs.  We must face the fact that the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes has an impact here which demands that, after the length of time that it is in operation, there be a full-scale, independent examination of its operation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister specifically for an undertaking that the Government will commission an independent, full-scale examination of the operation of the sweepstakes.  This would be good for the general morale of the country.  The independence of the inquiry should ensure its objectivity. The promoters of the sweepstakes might well welcome it because there have been some very serious half-formed allegations.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I would very much like to know much more about the administration of and more disclosure of details of accounts of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes in the context of an examination of whether this is the best way to employ 1,000 people and to generate an income which the Minister said in his opening remarks contributed down the years about £82 million to Irish hospitals. That is a recycling of income from the people of this country.  Are we doing it in the right way?  I certainly do not think so and I do not think one can argue seriously on the face of it that this is the way to go about it. We must not be bought off and diverted by the present economic difficulties.  The present economic recession and worry about jobs do not eliminate the importance of examining any body which has such a substantial impact in the State and of commissioning an objective study to examine its operations, its terms of reference, whether the conditions which led to its being set up still prevail on and whether this is the best way to achieve support for our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">

      <P>Just in case there be any confusion, may I say that the Labour Party are unreservedly supporting <Col N="437" /> the Bill in so far as increasing the organisation fees, if you like, are concerned?  But that does not mean that they have not got views about it. We have taken a realistic look at it on the basis of the employment content, the whole background of the hospitals sweepstakes over the 40 years they have been in existence, the fact that they have given employment to a certain category of worker who would not otherwise have found employment in the State over a very long period.  I do not want that last remark to be a reflection on the people who work in the hospitals sweepstakes.  I am speaking about a certain category of person who would not otherwise have found employment and it was a very good thing that there was employment of that nature for them.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party have followed exactly what was being put before us. We tried to examine it in the light of the present situation having regard to the fact that this is not the end, or that we are not saying that this is the end but that, on this occasion and for the purpose for which the Bill is introduced, we have no reservations about supporting the Bill, lest there be any confusion in that respect.</P>
      <P>In many cases anxiety may be caused when one sees administrative expenses reaching 40 per cent in an organisation that might be considered to be of a charitable nature, which of course it is not.  There is a belief in a lot of people's minds that because there is a Hospitals Trust Fund there is a heavy amount of charity involved in it.  Paying 40 per cent expenses for administrative purposes when one is dealing with some charitable organisation naturally would be resented, not only by me but by many others.  It is not a charity.  There are many complicated things to be dealt with and there are many problems.  What we are really saying is that on this occasion, because of the direct and indirect labour content and because the hospitals are getting a couple of million pounds a year which they cannot get from any other source at this time, we support this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Labour Party if they will support an inquiry. I will bear in mind Senator Robinson's words.  But that is not the issue before us today.  The issue before us is to let the House know the reasons we are supporting the Bill and the fact that we are doing so unreservedly. We have no reservations about that particular aspect of it That does not mean that we are merely following the leader or rowing in with any situation.  It does not mean that we have not had regard to a lot of points of view that exist around the country.</P>
      <P>Lastly, I would like to say that, as one of the major political parties, if we feel there is something wrong, rather than throwing out red herrings, generalised statements and so on, or making any accusations that we cannot stand over, through the democratic process it would be our duty to consider whether there are only circumstances we consider would warrant examination in the future, have them raised in that way but not by a broad, sweeping, general statement or by any innuendo.  After all none of us, even as politicians, likes to see something in the Press that we cannot hit back at or which leaves a tag on us even though there may be no foundation for it whatever.  If we raise it we will do so in the context of having it investigated in a proper way, if we decide after examination by the parliamentary party that that is the situation and that it warrants investigation.  Our function at present is to support this measure and we do so unreservedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can accept the present Bill but only as a holding measure.  I am very much in agreement with Senators Horgan and Robinson on this and the views they have expressed.  Undoubtedly the sweepstakes has contributed a great deal to our hospitals' development, perhaps more so in the thirties and forties than in later years.  Today the amount contributed is relatively insignificant compared with the total <Col N="439" /> hospital bill.  I know £2 million is £2 million but in the context of the bill, it means that we are more than justified now in having a relook at the whole operation and weighing up carefully all of the factors involved. I do know of the great deal of adverse publicity that the sweepstakes operations have generated in other countries&mdash;in the United States and in Canada, for instance.  The Minister gave the total of contributions for the 40 years as £82 million.  What has this been year by year during the past four to five years?  We should be a bit disturbed at seeing the level of expenses rising from 25 per cent up to 35 per cent and, facilitated by the Bill, up to 40 per cent.  That suggests that the expenses are increasing but perhaps the amount spent on prizes is too high.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the employment content involved but the whole type of operation or part of its energies might be directed into some other sphere. People like a little gamble or to take a little chance but the little chance in the past, and rightly so in the thirties and forties, was aimed at helping a very worthwhile cause&mdash;the hospitals. Today perhaps the little chance might have some element of helping the tourist industry, in other words that the prizes might not necessarily be cash.  Perhaps some type of package tourism encouragement, certainly from abroad, might fill the same bill. In other words, people involved can be utilised in this way.  It is high time that a cold, calm, dispassionate and critical look was taken at the whole operation.  I do not think that an independent inquiry is the ideal step to take at this stage.  Perhaps an interdepartmental inquiry into it would seem the most appropriate where you would have the balance brought about between the finance side and the contributions to revenue and to the hospitals and employment side.  This would give a type of balanced Government view on the happenings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we got that report saying that there would be other measures or other inquiries necessary something else could be undertaken at that stage. There would be no reason for regarding <Col N="440" /> the setting up of such an inquiry as any reflection on the present management or staff of the hospitals sweepstakes.  We recognise very much the good work they have done and the helping hand they gave to hospitals when that was needed but today the contribution on the hospital front is infinitesimal and above all the fact that this has been spread over voluntary and over public hospitals diminishes it still further because its real beginning was the necessity to help voluntary hospitals.  Today the necessity is help for voluntary hospitals. Public hospitals should be operated by way of public funds and not lotteries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their acceptance of the need for this Bill and I will endeavour to deal with the points that were raised in the course of the debate.  Senator Horgan expressed an abhorrence of the idea of sweepstakes.  I do not share his abhorrence for the idea as such nor do I quite understand it because a sweepstake is such a common form of lottery in many forms throughout the entire world and in many forms throughout this country that I do not see anything repugnant or wrong about it.  This particular operation has been the victim of what Senator Robinson described as half-formed allegations and indeed there is no doubt that it has been the victim of many unproven statements, allegations, smears and innuendoes.  The thinking of many people with regard to its operations has been conditioned by reason of the existence of these absurd half-formed allegations.  Senator Robinson, probably unwittingly, was guilty of one here when she remarked on the position of journalists who wrote about this particular operation and who, she said, found that their careers did not benefit and indeed some of them had departed from this country.  Again this was precisely the type of thing that she was criticising. That was a smear because the implication was that by virtue of writing about this operation they in some way did harm or damage to themselves or that somebody did them <Col N="441" /> harm.  That is precisely the sort of thing which this operation has had to suffer from for a great number of years.  We in Parliament have a particular duty not to allow ourselves to be conditioned by anything other than hard and precise facts and not to allow ourselves to make up our minds or to adopt an attitude or a stance that is based on the half truths and innuendoes or, as Senator Robinson says, the half-formed allegations.</P>
      <P>Senator Horgan says that a publicly-run organisation would be preferable to the present system whereby the Sweeps are run by a private company on behalf of what is a public committee, the Sweepstakes Committee.  Of course, what we are all inclined to overlook and forget is that the private company who run the Sweeps do so because they and they alone have the know-how to run the Sweeps.  A public company would not know how to run the Sweeps.  This particular know-how in this context is something of considerable commercial value and the people who own that thing of considerable commercial value naturally want to ensure that they profit out of it.  Any person who has something of peculiar commercial value is going to use it to profit commercially.  It is just not feasible to say that this operation could be run publicly or to assume that a public company or a public body or a committee or some other body would have the know-how to try out this operation.  They would not. The know-how is in the possession of the promoting company here and nobody else.  That is their commercial property.  I have no doubt, having regard to the realities of commercial life, that they are not prepared to give that property away.  No company having a valuable commercial asset is prepared to hand it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties which have caused this Bill to come before the House are not the making of the company. They are not due to the fact that the rate of expenses has risen.  The rate has risen because those expenses are subject to the inflationary pressures that are everywhere.  The principal reason why the Bill is necessary is that <Col N="442" /> the receipts have dropped and have dropped quite significantly in the last two years.  The last Sweep in which the receipts were more than £4 million was back in the Derby Sweep of 1973.  Since then they have been less than that figure and have been roughly running at £3,500,000 and in the Sweeps Hurdle, 1975, for the first time the receipts dropped below £3 million and when the expenses are expressed as a percentage of receipts and the receipts have dropped then the amount available for expenses is also dropping.  If the actual expenses that have to be met do have an inflationary element in them as these expenses here have&mdash;wages, advertising, postage and so on&mdash;quite obviously the two things combined are going to compound the adverse effect of the drop in receipts.  The reason this Bill is necessary is not because expenses have not been kept strictly under control but because the figure on which they are based has been dropping.  It is important to realise that.</P>
    <P>The promoters are paid by an organisation and management fee, being a percentage of the proceeds. The percentage is a sliding scale&mdash;6 per cent on the first £100,000, 5 per cent on the second £100,000 and thereafter 1¾ per cent, I understand that there was some publicity somewhere to the effect that it was 2 per cent.  It is 1¾ per cent.  This was a reduction which I suggested was proper some time ago when the price of the tickets was increased and this was acceptable to the promoters.  The overall percentage is roughly 2 per cent, perhaps slightly under or maybe a fraction over.  This is what it works out at.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan asked how much the promoters received by way of organisation and management fees since the inception of the Sweeps.  The total amount is £9,419,579.  That is up to the Sweeps Hurdle of 1975 and in the 45 years that the Sweep has been in existence that is an annual fee of something in excess of £200,000.  That is a large sum, but spread over 45 years on an annual basis I think it falls into reasonable perspective, particularly when we bear in mind that during <Col N="443" /> that time the Exchequer benefited to the extent of nearly £109 million. That was between payment to the hospitals and payment to the Exchequer by way of stamp duty.  Prizes amounted to £248 million and there were the expenses&mdash;wages, advertising, money spent in this country and which was collected abroad.</P>
    <P>I will take up a point here made by Senator Robinson.  This is not a recycling of internal funds because the vast majority of the funds dealt with in the sweepstakes comes from abroad and the money that was spent here since the beginning of the sweeps in wages and other expenses incurred in this country amounted to over £80 million.  These are all very substantial sums and, having regard to the scale of our economy, are not insignificant. Criticism was made of the comparatively small amount that is now being contributed to the hospitals.  In the last two years, the amount going to the hospitals, apart from the Exchequer, was £2,500,000 approximately.  In 1974 is was slightly over £2,500,000 and in 1975 slightly under £2,500,000.  In addition there was in excess of £500,000 paid by way of stamp duty, so that the total benefit to the country was over £3 million in each of those years.</P>
    <P>In terms of the total national budget that is not a large sum but in a time of budgetary constraint, when every penny has been watched carefully and there are many hands out for it and when we are subjected to calls to cut back taxation and at the same time increase public spending&mdash;and these calls are in the health area in particular &mdash;we cannot disregard the valuable contribution this makes to our health budget.  The operation which produces this is well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I hope that the sweeps will continue to be a viable operation but if the proceeds continue the trend displayed over the past number of sweeps, and particularly the trend displayed in the Sweeps Hurdle of 1975, where the receipts fell under £3 million for the first time, then the question of the viability of the operation must necessarily arise.  When the Government agreed to ask the Oireachtas <Col N="444" /> to increase the amount available for expenses to 40 per cent it was felt that, because the expenses up to now had crossed the 35 per cent level, a reasonable limit to put on it would be 40 per cent.  If they cross 40 per cent we must then look at the viability of the entire operation.  If it goes up to 50 per cent then quite clearly the amount remaining for the other purposes of the sweepstakes must bring into question seriously the viability of the whole operation.</P>
    <P>On the question of inquiries into the Sweep this ignores what I have said is a central fact: this is an operation by a private company who alone carry out this operation.  I have got certain information from this private company in order to judge the scale of their operations and to deal with some of these allegations that Senator Robinson refers to and I am also satisfied that any other information I want I can get and I can force its disclosure to me.  I would have no compunction in refusing to sanction any particular scheme for any particular sweep if that information were refused to me.</P>
    <P>That is as far as one can go in this particular area.  I do not think that a public inquiry would be proper for what is a private company.  There is inquiry and public auditing of the proceeds. These figures are published and are distributed to Members of the Oireachtas and are available for anyone who wishes to see them.  Therefore, they are not secret figures.  A lot of what has been said about the sweeps operation has, as Senator Robinson properly put it, on the basis of half-formed allegations and this in turn has led to a climate of distrust and of smear.  In the other House a Deputy indicated that he had been intimidated.  That will have to be fully investigated but it would appear from a report in one of today's papers that the intimidation consisted of a female employee of the company saying that she would like the Bill supported because her job was at stake.  This is an indication of how emotional people can be in regard to this particular operation and I have no doubt that Members of the Oireachtas <Col N="445" /> will be conscious of their obligation to be practical and realistic and, above all, not to give way to any temptation to repeat the innuendoes that have been made in regard to this company.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, I have the power to satisfy myself that its operations are <i>bona fide</i> and that its operations are conducted in accordance with the law of the land.  I will use that power in any way I deem necessary.  I do not think that this company should be put in any more different position from any other private company in the State that has commercial property of its own.  Until such time as the laws in relation to the disclosure of the affairs of private companies generally is changed I do not think we should suggest any particular change with regard to this company.  Its operations in so far as the operations of the sweepstakes are concerned are public knowledge. I think Senators will agree with me that, having regard to what I said, the contribution from this operation to the State, to the Exchequer and to the hospitals and by way of employment within the State has been very substantial over the years.  It is still of such grave significance as to justify its continuation and to justify this Bill.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time that this 40 per cent expenses for the sweepstakes was put into some sort of perspective.  The only form of perspective has been a perspective relating to the previous operation of the sweepstake which is limited to circumstances and we are now increasing in this section that figure from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.  This is not a 10 per cent increase, but a 33? per cent increase on the original figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I wanted to be unfair I would <Col N="446" /> contrast this 40 per cent collection costs with that of the Revenue Commissioners, whose collection costs run approximately at 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the total moneys they collect. Naturally, this is not comparable with the operations of the sweepstakes because the Revenue Commissioners are collecting moneys statutorily due by people to the State. When we talk about sweepstakes we are talking basically of the raising of money for charitable purposes.  This is what the whole operation is allegedly about.  We have the extraordinary situation now where we are paying 40 per cent of the total money to collect the remaining 60 per cent.  Any self-respecting charitable organisation that has collections and administration expenses of 40 per cent would in any other country of the world be laughed out of court.</P>
    <P>Organisations like Oxfam, War on Want and Concern have over long periods raised substantial amounts of money for charity without involving themselves in administration or collection expenses on anything remotely like the scale that we are now sanctioning in this Bill.  In fact, generally speaking with regard to charitable organisations, the keenest attention is paid to the ratio between collection and administration costs on the one hand and the total amount raised for charity on the other.  Heads have been known to roll in these organisations if the level rises too high.</P>
    <P>I am not familiar with the latest figure but I would be very surprised if the collection and administration expenses for organisations like Oxfam go above 10 per cent or 12 per cent. I know that six or seven years ago when I investigated the situation myself they were running at about 8 per cent.  On the face of it we are sanctioning an amount which is three to four times what it costs any other voluntary agency to collect money for charity.  Indeed, even when the ratio was 30 per cent the sweep&mdash;alone among charitable organisations&mdash;was perculiarly immune from the sort of criticism justifiably levelled at other charitable organisations when collection <Col N="447" /> or administration expenses rose above 7 per cent or 8 per cent.  We must ask why the Sweep, alone among charitable organisations, needs such a huge proportion of its money to be spent on collection and administration.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed to hear that the real reason for the Bill is because the receipts have dropped.  If receipts have dropped and if expenses are remaining at the same level, it says something very unhappy about the organisation.  It implies, perhaps, that people are being paid for doing nothing, that people are being paid whether or not they actually sell any tickets.  I suspect there are two main reasons why the expense ratio is so high: the practice of paying commission to the sellers of tickets and also perhaps the reasons relating to the illegalities which have been mentioned earlier on.  It is extraordinary that we have a situation in which a management fee is paid to people who on the face of it are not managing this charitable organisation even a third or a quarter as efficiently as many other charitable organisations.</P>
    <P>There is one particular point of detail which I should like the Minister to answer and that is in relation to subsection (b), which states that:</P>
    <P>Where payment is made to a person promoting such sweepstakes that payment shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be part of the expenses of holding such sweepstake.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking that &ldquo;a person&rdquo; in this subsection includes the limited company and does not refer to tax payments which might be made to persons other than the limited company which is, in fact, a promoting company?  If I am correct, perhaps (b) effectively refers to the organisation and management fee and the effect of the subsection is to ensure the organisation and management fee is to be computed within the 40 per, cent to which the figure is being allowed to increase.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that <Col N="448" /> payments under (b) do not include cash payments which may be made to individuals either inside or outside the jurisdiction simply for promoting such sweepstakes regardless of the degree to which such promotion produces cash returns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (b) to which Senator Horgan referred provides for the payment of an organisation and management fee and it must be contained within the limit.  When opening the debate I mentioned that, because the expenses had exceeded the 30 per cent up to now, the excess had to be provided by the promoters to the tune of £440,000, but in addition they also had to forfeit their organisation and management fee to the tune of approximately the same amount again.  It is in their interest to keep the expenses as low as possible because if they allow them to go beyond the limit they may find themselves (a) forfeiting the management fee and (b) having to put up an excess. Thus there is an incentive for them to keep the organisation and management fee down.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to say that the expenses are unduly or abnormally high with regard to a lottery.  It is wrong to compare the operation of the sweepstakes with Oxfam because they are two completely different operations. Oxfam appeal for contributions, appeal to people to send in donations on a voluntary basis.  The sweepstake is essentially a commercial operation selling tickets on a worldwide basis and the distribution, sale and collection involved is a very much more intricate matter than appealing for people to send in donations and accounting for them as they come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have the figures, and neither does Senator Horgan, as to what percentage of the Oxfam proceeds go in administration, but I am quite clear in my mind that there was considerable apprehension about some of these agencies in that too much was being spent on administration. This is a constant worry on the part of people contributing to these charities. They like to ensure that the last <Col N="449" /> penny possible of the contribution would go to the charity involved and not on expenses.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, in which is provided that one of the conditions that a lottery must comply with in its licence is that not more than 40 per cent of the gross proceeds shall be utilised for the expenses of the lottery. So, if you like, there was an acknowledgment back in 1956 that the ordinary run-of-the-mill lottery around the country had to get authority to spend up to 40 per cent of the proceeds on its expenses. Therefore, what is proposed in the Bill is not out of line with what is general experience and practice in the case of lotteries.  We must distinguish lotteries and sweepstakes as a means of raising charities from organisations such as Oxfam or Concern which are making a direct appeal to the public to send in money to them.</P>
    <P>In this context expenses are as follows, advertising, publicity, salaries, wages, State insurance&mdash;salaries there do not include the salaries of any of the promoters nor does it include any director's fees&mdash;stationery and printing, the latter being a very big item because the printing is of a very specialised type and some very skilled craftsmen are kept principally employed by reason of the work coming from the Sweep.  There is also distribution, postages and telephones&mdash;I think the Irish Hospitals Sweeps are the biggest customer the Post Office has in the country&mdash;rents, rates and insurance, upkeep of premises, travelling expenses, audits, accountancy and legal expenses, draw expenses, sundries and a proportion of expenses on office furniture and data processing which are shared with a proportion charged against the sweepstake.</P>
    <P>These are the ordinary expenses that any commercial company would incur in running its operations.  There is nothing in that to say that there is any room for extravagance or anything of that nature.  The expenses have been kept pretty well at a consistent figure. In fact they have been reduced.  In 1974 the expenses were £990,000; in 1975 <Col N="450" /> the expenses were brought down to £924,000.  That shows that economies must have been effected because the elements contributing to the expenses, such as wages, stationery, printing, postage, rent, rates, heating and so on have increased in the meantime.  If the total expenses have come down economies have had to be effected and are being effected continually.  This proves the point I am making that the real cause for the need to come before the House to seek a greater percentage is that receipts have been dropping.  When expenses are expressed as a percentage of a dropping figure, then the amount available for expenses must also drop. They have been inadequate, notwithstanding the fact that the actual expenses themselves are being very carefully watched.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 1 it seems to me that one of the two elements that we are concerned with is the survival of the sweepstakes as such.  Obviously one has to support the Bill, and the section with regard to the increase, in terms of the employment situation.  This situation has been mentioned before but it seems that perhaps the primary concern is that a lot of people will be out of work unless we support this measure. It is to that extent that I support it. What I am a bit disappointed in is that the amendment does not contain enough provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes.  I regret that section 1 does not contain provision for a far greater range of accountability with regard to the income of the sweepstakes.  There is a very large grey area which is not audited.  In other words, this is disquieting for all of us.  There is the whole area with regard to expenses, with regard to people buying tickets and so on, which is rather blurred in the public eye and around which there is a good deal of disquiet.  I would recommend to the Minister that in future there should be a far more comprehensive sense of accounting at the end of the day.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 1 I suppose it is not proper under this section to ask the question whether there has been any diplomatic overtures from foreign Governments about the basic illegality of the entire affair.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 27 to delete lines 40, 41 and 42 and substitute &ldquo;(1) The Registrar may, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, require a society to maintain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These four amendments are all designed to achieve the same effect. The effect is what has already been discussed on earlier Stages of this Bill. The effect is to give more power to the registrar and to diminish to some extent the power of the Minister or of the various Ministers.  I do not think there is any real or important power taken from the Minister, because in all important instances the Minister must be consulted.  What is important is that the registrar, who, after all, will be the person in day-to-day contact with the building societies, the person who in the course of time is going to build up expertise with regard to the needs and problems of building societies, should have the initiative in controlling societies and in introducing regulations and so on.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the purpose of these amendments is to give the registrar the initiative and to provide as in section 37 that in regard to the control of ratios between assets and liabilities it is he who will propose the requisitions, the controls, but of course he will have to consult the Minister and the Minister will have full power to discuss the matter with him.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the Minister takes a strong line and disapproves the suggestions made by the registrar then of course the registrar would not proceed. However, he would have the initiative in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important part of section 37 is, of course, subsection (1) and I am proposing in amendment No. 4 the words &ldquo;The Minister for Finance may after <Col N="454" /> consultation with the Minister&rdquo;&mdash;that is the Minister for Local Government &mdash;&ldquo;the Minister, the Registrar and the Central Bank, require a society to maintain&rdquo;&mdash;certain ratios.  That should read, &ldquo;The Registrar may after consultation with the Minister for Finance require the society to maintain&rdquo;&mdash;certain ratios.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about the advantages, disadvantages and merits of substituting &ldquo;the Registrar&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in subsection (1) it seems to me that there is certainly a very strong case to be made for substituting &ldquo;the Registrar&rdquo; in subsection (2) (b), because, although there may be certain principles involved under subsection (1), what is happening in subsection (2) (b) is merely an administrative act.  Having decided on the principles involved and what the ratios should be, then subsection (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A requisition under this section may be expressed to apply in relation to ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and then it goes on: &ldquo;all societies, specified classes or classes&rdquo; and so on. In my submission it is quite unnecessary for the Minister for Finance to be brought into this detailed implementation of a principle that has already been agreed upon.  Certainly in regard to subsection (2) (b), and (d) which is the subject of amendment No. 6 these are administrative functions which could be readily performed by the registrar.  It seems quite unnecessary to drag the Minister for Finance into each of these operations which could clearly be carried out by the registrar.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 refers to subsection (3):</P>
    <P>A requisition under this section shall have effect in accordance with its terms and may be varied or revoked by the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister, the Registrar and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Surely this is a situation where, the original requisitions having been discussed or decided upon in principle, if they have to be varied or revoked later on it is a matter that could be carried out by the registrar merely <Col N="455" /> after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Again this seems to be using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut, or whatever the phrase is, and it shows an extraordinary&mdash;obsession is perhaps too strong a word&mdash;an extraordinary determination to keep the various Ministers involved in even the most detailed action which is prescribed by this Bill.  Therefore, my reason for proposing these amendments is once again to ask the Minister to reconsider the unnecessarily complicated, unnecessarily top-level approach, not only in deciding the principles involved in this Bill, but in regard to even the implementation of the detailed work that is necessary as a result of decisions made at a higher level.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to accept all the amendments that have been put down here, but if he is not prepared to go the whole way with these I urge him at least to accept amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 which deal merely with the detailed implementation of decisions in principle made under section 37 (1).  I think that in practice what will happen is that the registrar will do nearly all the work, that he will take the initiative and will put forward the necessary amendments, and all the details of the requisitions and so on.  He is the person who will know what is going on, what is necessary, what amendments need to be made, and it is he in fact who is going to bring up the draft to the Minister and merely ask for his approval.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing here in effect is to face up to the facts of what is going to happen in due time, and to give the registrar the satisfaction and the status in this Bill of being responsible for and doing what in fact he will be doing when the Bill becomes an Act and is being implemented over the years.  I am quite certain that if this is accepted it will be a more commonsense and practical way of dealing with what is provided for under section 37 and that it can be done in this way without the Minister for Finance or the Minister losing any real control of the situation. He will always be able to step <Col N="456" /> in, but he will be stepping in when necessary and not being, in theory at any rate, involved in the day-to-day administration of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express agreement with the points made by Senator Eoin Ryan in relation to this and very briefly to state that implicit in what he says is that the spirit of this Bill and the spirit with which the Minister has accepted amendment after amendment up to now has leaned in the direction of setting up this office or registrar and, in a sense, of letting it take care of the whole operation of building societies while maintaining a top-level and overseeing sense of accountability on the part of the Minister.  That is why I find it a bit puzzling that over and over again in each of the sections the involvement of the Minister is constantly stressed.  Indeed, in this regard section 76 in a sense seems to contradict the entire spirit of the Bill because there is a sense in which the Minister is transferring these powers to the registrar and at the same time constantly involving himself in day-to-day operations.  Therefore it seems to me that the amendments suggested, Nos. 4, 5 and 6, would ease the situation and would tidy the Bill considerably, thereby inspiring confidence in the registrar and his office and in the building societies themselves while at the same time in no way prejudicing the overall authority of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I, too, express agreement with the views that have already been made?  The purpose of these amendments is to give more power to the registrar rather than less to the Minister.  These amendments cover that situation in as much as the Minister is still very much in control, but the day-to-day activity will be the responsibility of the registrar as he is naturally more familiar with what is suitable for the building societies and their subscribers.  I was somewhat encouraged by the fact that the Minister did say, in his speech to the Senate on the 25th February, 1976, at column 849, Vol. 83, of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is not the best thing to have a Minister looking over the <Col N="457" /> shoulders of what any society or organisation is doing.</P>
    <P>He also said under the same reference:</P>
    <P>In section 76 I am considering a proposal to give the initiative in relation to management controls to the registrar rather than to the Minister for either Local Government or Finance.</P>
    <P>Many times during Committee Stage and Second Stage we have stated our views regarding this and we are hoping that even at this late stage the Minister might be influenced by what we have to say.  I feel that there are too many Departments involved. Any detailed action that is required from the registrar and anything that needs to be done where it is necessary for the Minister to become involved is covered in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that Senators Hanafin and Martin were dealing more with section 76 than the one we are at present discussing.  Perhaps we could have a further discussion on that when we reach section 76, but that does not mean that I am going to change my mind.  I said at the start of the discussion in this House that I believe that when Bills come before the Seanad or the Dáil they should be fully discussed and any worthwhile amendments should be accepted from whichever side of the House they come.  This is the spirit in which this Bill has been put before the House and I hope that is appreciated by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Committee Stage there was a very lengthy discussion on the position of the registrar in relation to a number of sections, including section 37 with which we are now dealing. The purpose of section 37 is to enable the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Local Government, the registrar and the Central Bank, to require the societies to maintain specified ratios between assets and liabilities.  The power is similar to one contained in the Central Bank Act in so far as licensed banks are concerned.  It is a prudent <Col N="458" /> requirement for all financial institutions to maintain adequate ratios of this nature.  Most building societies maintain adequate ratios but this is not to say that there is not a need for the power in the Bill.  I would not like in discussion in this House a distinction between one side arguing in favour of what the building societies themselves want in the way of absolute control and the other side arguing in favour of a Bill which covers both sides because we do tend to forget that there are more people involved in this matter than those who run the building societies and who invest their money in them.  The people who borrow money are very much involved and so is the State.  Therefore, we would want to be very careful to ensure that there is a fair deal given to everybody, and that is why the matter is being dealt with as it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House seeks to transfer the power from the Minister for Finance to the registrar after consultation with the Minister for Finance leaving out any statutory requirement for consultation with the Minister for Local Government or the Central Bank.  The section was drafted quite deliberately in its present form for the following reasons.  Building societies are major financial institutions whose operations form a significant part of national financial business.  Furthermore, their operations are wholly in the area of private housing where they constitute the largest providers of house purchase finance.  Thus in devising ratios all aspects of the societies' activities would be taken into consideration. The Minister for Finance and the Central Bank would have regard to financial developments, the registrar would have regard to the exercise of his responsibilities for the orderly and proper regulation of building society business, and the Minister for Local Government would have an interest as the promoter of this legislation and as the Minister responsible for the housing programme.  The aim of the section was to ensure that a fair balance would be achieved; it is not considered that this would be the case <Col N="459" /> if we were to adopt the proposal in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of it all is that the enactment of the Bill will finally clear the way for the grant of trustee status on deposits with societies which will be able to meet the appropriate conditions.  This grant of trustee status will be made under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, and it is the Minister for Finance who exercises all the functions under that Act.  Among the basic requirements which the societies must meet in order to qualify for trustee status will be those related to liquidity and reserve ratios, and it is the Minister for Finance who will prescribe those ratios.  If the amendment were accepted there would be a duplication of controls in relation to ratios since the registrar would be specifying ratios for the purpose of section 37 and the Minister for Finance would be doing it for the purpose of trustee status.  For the foregoing reasons I could not agree to accept the proposed amendment of section 37.</P>

      <P>From the point of view of the building societies this Bill basically is a necessary one, because building societies are now so big and there are so many people concerned, as shareholders, depositors and so on, that it is a matter of public interest that they should be controlled, generally speaking, in the way that this Bill as drafted provides.  On the other hand, we must be very careful when we concede that it is necessary for building societies, which are private institutions and which were formed without any help from the State, to have certain controls imposed on them by the State and to restrict them in certain ways, that the State should not take more control than is necessary. This is why I put down amendments while agreeing with the Bill generally. It will certainly restrict the activities of the building societies.  It may restrict them in their perfectly legitimate commercial activities if the State takes too much control, or even if the State appears to take too much control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be said that the main difference between the sections which the <Col N="460" /> Minister has and the amendments which I am proposing, is that the Bill as it stands seems to be overloaded with Ministers, not merely one Minister but Ministers, Central Banks and so many different State bodies, breathing down the necks of the building societies and looking not only at the principles involved but looking at the minute details of how requisitions should be drafted and so on.  That is why I am suggesting that the registrar in this case should be the person who should take the initiative, implement the detailed drafting, amendment and so on of requisitions and that certainly he should do that after consultation with the Minister to ensure that what he is doing is in accordance with the principles of this Bill and with what the Minister thinks is appropriate in certain circumstances in regard to the principles.  But in regard to the detailed carrying out of the purposes of this Bill I think the emphasis should be on the registrar, the initiative should be the registrar's and there should be no suggestion that this is in any way interference from a political point of view. That aspect of it should be played down in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I am urging the Minister to do this not because I think the building societies should have it all their own way, not because they are the only people who should be considered&mdash;in fact it is quite clear that the Bill is necessary and we accept that &mdash;but because of the way in which it is proposed to be done.  I can do no more than urge the Minister to reconsider the matter between the time the Bill goes through all the Stages here and in the other House.  He should think again about the amendments that have been put down and consider whether he should not make some concessions in the direction of these amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> In page 28, lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;The Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;The Registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section is a less important one in the sense that the principles involved, the dangers involved, are not as great as in section 37.  Consequently, when I ask the Minister to do much the same thing in section 38, I think the arguments which I can put forward are even stronger than they were on the previous section.  The question of the control of ratios between assets and liabilities is a very important one.  It is one which needs expert advice and it is one in which certainly I can see that the Minister for Finance and the Minister would want to take a hand.  The question of investment of surplus funds is certainly a much less important one, in the sense that there is not as strong a case for the State to step in and tell the building societies how they may and may not invest their surplus funds.  Investment of funds is something which many hundreds of companies in this country have to do all the time.  Many thousands and thousands of individuals have to do it all the time and it is not unreasonable to expect that the building societies would be able to do this satisfactorily and have been doing it satisfactorily.  It is something in which it is debatable whether the State should feel it necessary to intervene at all.  Nevertheless, the case can be made for it and it may be that certain societies might be inclined to invest in something that could be considered speculative.  For these reasons I concede that a case certainly can be made for controlling the way in which surplus funds are invested.  But again, and even more so, it is the kind of thing which the registrar should be quite capable of doing without assistance, without the initiative of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>As section 38 stands, the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister and the Central Bank, may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest such a <Col N="462" /> proportion of its funds as are not immediately required by it for the purpose of the society.  What I am suggesting in this amendment is that the registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Finance should prescribe the investments which a society may make.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this is a relatively simple operation, something in which the registrar, in the course of time, at a very early stage would become expert.  Certainly, he should consult the Minister for Finance from time to time but generally it is a thing which he should be well able to do and it should not be necessary for the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank to go into conference every time they want to decide whether the building societies may or may not invest in a particular company, make a particular investment.  Again, it seems to be quite unnecessarily cumbersome, quite unnecessarily complicated and something which could easily be done by the registrar without consultation with the Minister from time to time.</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) of section 38 the registrar is given pride of place.  It is stated that the registrar, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank, may fix limits and so on.  He does at least get the top billing in this subsection and I think, although it is an isolated instance, it is a step in the right direction and one which the Minister should have followed in many other parts of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) and subsection (4) are purely administrative.  There is no principle involved.  It is a matter of forming a judgment as to whether certain investments are appropriate ones and something which the registrar would be fully capable of doing after consultation.  Again, from the point of view of the appearance of this Bill the Minister's proposals are unsatisfactory.  If it appears that every time a building society wants to invest money in a particular investment, the Minister, the Central Bank and the society must get into a huddle to decide whether they may do it or <Col N="463" /> not, it is not reasonable.  Surely this is a matter which should be dealt with by the registrar who, of course, will use his discretion in consulting the authorities from time to time where there is any doubt about the particular investment.  Again, whatever views the Minister may have expressed in regard to the amendments under section 37 where the principles and the decisions involved are perhaps more complex, more important than in the case, certainly in regard to the investment of surplus funds, I can see no reason for the topheavy combination meeting that is necessary before a simple operation of this kind is approved by the authorities.  Without any great optimism I would ask the Minister to consider whether these amendments under section 38 could not be accepted.  The Minister may have a view that it is better as it is but I do not think he can really feel that anything would be lost, that any real control would be lost, that any real damage to the depositors, to any member of the public would be done by accepting these amendments.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, from the point of view of how this will be administered, and in which the registrar will do the job and from the point of view of what the building societies must feel, and what the public must feel, if they go to the trouble of looking at this Bill and seeing that the building societies are not allowed to stir a finger to invest a couple of thousand pounds without consulting two or three Ministers and the Central Bank, it is unnecessarily topheavy.  It does not achieve any purpose.  I believe that the section would be a much better one if the Minister would accept the amendments as they have been put down.  I say that from the point of view of having a proper balance between controls that are necessary and not stifling all initiative and almost all action by the building societies.</P>

      <P>I was missing from the Committee Stage debate on this Bill.  I regretted that very much because I had wanted to participate in it.  I think it is possible <Col N="464" /> for me to incorporate comment on the proposed Report Stage amendment which is now being dealt with with my general comments which arise directly from this.</P>
      <P>We have a situation here in which we have had a highly successful movement with some of those elements in it which were permitted to exist because we did not have this code.  Therefore, it is very welcome as a code.  In looking at these amendments that Senator Ryan has been moving and bearing in mind what he said with regard to the amendments to the earlier sections of this part of the Bill, I must say that I have a very great deal of sympathy with his position and in saying that perhaps it is no harm to observe that I presume all Senators&mdash;certainly I have been&mdash; have been circulated with literature from the Building Societies' Association and very helpful commentaries by the highly respected secretary of that body.  Personally I am influenced and affected in my reaction to these amendments proposed in the names of Senators Lenihan and Ryan by the views expressed by that association.  I would like to say, because I think it is important to say, that this association is not to be seen in quite the same sense as the ordinary self-interested body which is like any public company engaged in making profit and you might be suspicious of its criticism of a particular section or its recommendation of an amendment.</P>
      <P>After all, the body which has expressed views which have at least inspired the amendment which is proposed at this Report Stage is a body which without dispute represents about 98 per cent of the building societies.  Perhaps that is the quantity of money which they look after.  Let us not get lost in detailed figures.  At any rate, whatever the figure is, it is 600 times what it was when this State was founded and I do not know how many other things are 600 times what they were then.  The secretary is a most respected figure, a chartered accountant of distinction and wisdom who would not express views with which he did not himself agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis of their argument <Col N="465" /> has always been that the Bill as proposed in general is good in so far as the roads that are required to be covered are going to be covered.  In general they are concerned that this successful movement might in any way be impeded by law which comes in to catch the delinquents by creating impediments to success.</P>
    <P>The Minister has properly said&mdash; indeed I said it myself on the Second Reading but the Minister is not expected to recollect that&mdash;that there were two interests involved in this whole matter, the interests of the depositors, the safety of their funds, and the interests of the borrowers of these funds, the purposes for which they need them.  I do not know whether behind the Building Societies' Association, with the success of their members, is an unnecessary fear of what they call political interference. They are not thinking at all of the Minister and the Minister knows that. They are thinking of the general opportunity of the State to come in and say: &ldquo;You cannot do this&rdquo; or &ldquo;You cannot do that&rdquo;.  There may be an unnecessary fear here, but it may prove to be a reality for them.</P>
    <P>The second element which makes me invite the Minister to consider carefully what is being said by Senator Ryan in a very reasonable speech is that the objection to too much formalisation of consultations and the involvement from the State's point of view and the Minister involved as a member of an Executive which is concerned to reduce the deficit.  The Minister must be concerned to prevent a proliferation of bureaucratic work.  The Minister must be concerned to see that too many people have not to be consulted to reach decisions that could be reached by one man.  Perhaps it is too much to have one man: he should be, as he is under the UK code, under the supervision of one authority.  It may not be as appropriate to this section as to the previous one, but I am not so satisfied that merely because of the provisions of the Central Bank Act the Central Bank have got to be involved in this.  Anyone who has had to deal with the Central Bank knows perfectly well that without having to get through <Col N="466" /> formal meetings which have to be carefully minuted and recorded by bureaucratic apparatus and exchanged from department to department, you can get the view of the Central Bank by taking up the telephone and finding out what they thing about it.  If it is thought of as a practical matter by the Minister for Finance who has to be the &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; as the Minister called him, I do not see how the registrar can be left totally unrestricted in relation to what they think about it.  If it is thought matters of this kind if there is to be any sort of control&mdash;and he is not so left as I understand the UK code&mdash;I do not see why the Minister for Finance will not find out what the Central Bank's thinking is when they are giving their reaction to the proposal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the trustee status matter, I do not find this convincing at all.  Who is controlling the Allied Irish Investment Bank?  For example, is the trustee status now in the Bank of Ireland?  Various other things are on the way to having trustee status and under the Charities Act many things have trustee status and it is good for the country that they have because they encourage Irish savings into investable funds.  I should have thought that there are enough general controls in the rest of this proposed legislation to ensure proper performance with rectitude, without creating impediments that would be felt by responsible people.  They are responsible people.  They would not be entrusted to look after the very substantial sums that are deposited with them if they were not and let me say to the Minister that in our present situation we may be concerned to see that all these institutions are given opportunities of involving themselves in investments that will be to the national advantage. I think they should be left free to make these decisions, as free as is possible under an overall structure that is designed to prevent the rogues. After all, the whole idea of the joint corporate company worked because it was a delegation of authority to the people who gather the funds and they used them&mdash;they were judged by the <Col N="467" /> market as to whether they were using them properly or not&mdash;and they got lost if they did not use them properly. In general over the years it was found that over this aspect or that of the particular problems that arose there had to be certain general controls. These general controls were spelled out in a very exact way to these people so that they could construe section this and subsection that and knew what they were entitled to do and were not entitled to do.  This is very important, and in general, while the Minister is not to be expected to be particularly persuaded by anything I may say, I would advise him on his way to Dáil Éireann to give thought to the sort of view I am expressing on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel somehow that while the two Senators who have spoken have been trying to be reasonable in their approach they have missed out some important points.  I would be as surprised as they if I saw two Ministers and the registrar parading up to the Central Bank every day in the week finding out whether or not it would be right that certain investments should be made. I am surprised that it has not been realised that this sort of thing would be dealt with under general resolutions. They would be told what type of investment they could make.  This would be done long beforehand and it would not be necessary, therefore, to do it more than once at the start and later if something might crop up in the normal way.  I think it is a little ridiculous to labour the point that it would mean numerous visits.  As regards Senator Fitzgerald's comments about the reasonable men who are perfectly reputable and able to handle large sums of money, of course they are, but the trouble is that, like politicians and those in any other walk of life, occasionally one comes along who does not live up to the standard and it is our job to ensure that if this happens&mdash;as it has happened before&mdash;he or she will not be able to do the things which we feel should not be done.  There would be no point in bringing in a Bill after <Col N="468" /> 103 years and leaving a gap wide open for somebody to walk through.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senator Ryan that on Committee Stage I already moved an amendment to deal with reservations expressed by him and by some other people on the Second Reading. The present position of the registrar <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank is the result and I would expect that amendment to meet their point.  I thought in fact that it was meeting most of the arguments which were expressed on Second Reading because Senator Ryan will remember that he did make most of those points on Second Reading.  I am still of the opinion that it has done that.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion of a special separate decision each time a society wants to invest surplus funds.  That would be an impossible way of conducting public business.  If the Senator will read it he will realise that it does not say that.  It says that there must be consultation but it does not say a consultation every time a suggestion is made.  Senator Ryan is too much a man of the world and a man of Finance not to understand that what is intended is that it will be dealt with in the way I am suggesting.  The intention is that the general guidelines will be laid down by the registrar from time to time.  We heard a lot of praise for the arrangements which operate in the United Kingdom when the Bill was in Second Reading and I might mention in this regard that in Britain societies investing surplus funds must do so in accordance with an order made by the registrar with the consent of the Treasury.  Here, the initiative is being given to the registrar.  So, it seems we would like to have it both ways.  I think that is not a good way to frame legislation.  If we think that Britain is so good and if we are giving even better than what Britain is giving, then I think it should be accepted as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thread running through amendments to sections 37 and 38 seems to be that action by the Minister for Finance would somehow have a malign influence on the societies.  I have already explained why the Minister for Finance figures in section 37.  Senator <Col N="469" /> FitzGerald said he was not prepared to accept that it was a good reason. He is entitled to disagree but I still think it is a good reason.  There is an equally valid reason for his position in section 38.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.  I did not intend to say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Senator did say it.  Sometimes people do not listen to what they are saying.  Under the 1874 and 1894 Acts, a society, if its rules so permitted, could only invest its surplus funds in trustee securities.  The range of authorised trustee securities is set out in section 1 of the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958 and in amending regulations made under that Act by the Minister for Finance.  Subsection (1) of section 38 of the Bill, instead of simply re-enacting the existing provisions, thereby limiting the societies as before, empowers the Minister for Finance, after he has consulted with the Minister for Local Government and the Central Bank, to prescribe the investments in which a society may invest its surplus funds.  The intention is that in addition to specifying trustee securities, the Minister for Finance will be able to give the societies greater freedom of investment of their surplus funds by specifying a wider range of securities, thus breaking away from total dependence on the list of trustee authorised investments.  It is felt that the present position, where the societies may invest only in trustee securities, unduly inhibits their freedom to invest to the best advantage of their members.</P>
      <P>It will be clear from what I have said that the purpose of subsection (1) is to liberalise rather than restrict the field of investment open to societies. It is particularly appropriate that the Minister for Finance, who is in closest touch with all the financial institutions and who will have the advice of the General Bank, should be the person nominated in the Bill to prescribe this field of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw particular attention to subsection (4).  Under this subsection, the Minister for Finance is empowered <Col N="470" /> with the consent of the Central Bank, to include Central Bank reserve bonds among the investments which he can specify under subsection (1).  The issue of these bonds is provided for in section 48 of the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Subsection 3 of that Act lays down that they may be issued only to licensed banks and may be disposed of only to another licensed bank or the Central Bank.  Generally the bonds are issued with a maturity of up to three years, which would make them very suitable for building societies.  Subsection 4 of the Bill, therefore, opens up another and significant area in which societies may invest with advantage to their members.</P>
    <P>It would be totally inappropriate to empower the registrar to specify this type of investment.  The powers conferred on the registrar are contained in subsection (3).  After consultation with the Ministers for Local Government, Finance and with the Central Bank he will fix the limits on the proproportion of the surplus funds held in the various types of investment. The object is to ensure the best balance in the portfolio of securities held by the societies within the confines of a list of securities which the Minister for Finance will have specified under subsection (1).  It may appear to the House that the powers conferred in this section under discussion are appropriate and there is absolutely no advantage to be gained &mdash;rather the reverse&mdash;by accepting the amendments proposed.  It would make the position stricter rather than the other way round.  Therefore I would suggest that Senator Ryan might, on reconsideration, be prepared to withdraw the amendments.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect I have to disagree with the Minister about the interpretation of subsection (1) of section 38.  The Minister says what is the intention.  Of course the road to the Supreme Court is paved with good intentions.  Whatever the intention was, my view is that subsection (1) of section 38 permits the Minister to go to every single society and say, in individual cases <Col N="471" /> what they may and may not invest in. It says that the Minister may prescribe the investments in which a society may invest such portion of its funds as are not immediately required by it for the purpose of the society.  That certainly means the Minister could, whether or not it is the intention.  It does mean that the Minister may say to one society: &ldquo;You can invest this particular&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>It could be particular kinds of societies in a particular situation.  It is conceivable, and I would hate to put dangerous thoughts into the head of the Minister for Finance or of the Minister for Local Government.  It could mean that the Minister could say: &ldquo;This particular society is too heavily invested in one way or the other and for them we are permitting this kind of investment but not for another one&rdquo;.  If it was intended to apply to all societies then it should have read &ldquo;may prescribe the investments in which societies may invest such portion of their funds&rdquo;.  But this subsection talks about a society.  It does seem to me that this could permit individual direction to individual societies as to what they could invest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is intended. There are two things&mdash;one, the general prescription which must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Secondly, it specifically says that if they are over subscribed in one or other the Minister might.  That would be one special occasion, which would not be occurring every day.  Special circumstances may arise and I mention this specifically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This point arises because <Col N="472" /> the Minister said that there would be no question of individual examination of societies and individual restrictions and approvals for societies. If that is permissible then it seems to me that I am not exaggerating in saying that this may be quite a frequent control, quite a frequent prescription by the Minister.  If it is merely a question of saying: &ldquo;The following companies are acceptable&rdquo; then I agree with the Minister that these kinds of lists would only be drawn up every year or two and that would not be quite so objectionable.  But, as the subsection reads, it does seem to me that the Minister may say different things to different societies, may consider what would be appropriate to every single society and, if that is going to happen, certainly it could be almost a day-to-day operation.  It is most unnecessary and inappropriate that building societies, who have been carrying on their activities by and large very successfully and efficiently over the years, should be subjected to that kind of control.  However, I am sure the Minister is not going to change his mind.</P>
      <P>To get back to a point which Senator FitzGerald made, from the Minister's point of view it is inadvisable to prescribe in virtually every subsection the kind of consultation and the people who must be consulted.  If the Minister for Finance wants to control what investments may be made he should be able to get advice and to consult people without necessarily having it in the Bill.  I am quite sure in certain circumstances he would consult the Central Bank, another Minister and so on.  But it is a great mistake to have specified in the Bill the people whom he must consult.  He may find himself at some time in the future in some kind of legal proceedings where he will run into a lot of trouble because he will not be able to prove that he did consult the Central Bank before issuing a direction, some kind of regulation or approving or disapproving a particular investment.</P>

When he is advising or when he is issuing this kind of prescription or restriction it should be left to his discretion whom he need consult without having it spelled out in the Bill.  If he wants to consult the Central Bank, let him do so.  It does not have to be specified in the Bill that he must do it. I am sure he will do it if it is necessary. That is something which is not really my concern and is not something which is going to worry the building societies.  It will be a bit of an irritation and an impediment for the Minister if he has in all cases to go around to the various people concerned and formally consult them, even though in many cases he will know the answer before he goes through that formality.</P>

It is going to be a minor headache for the Minister and not for the building societies.  To that extent it is going to be of concern to the public generally&mdash;that all this statutory consultation with all these people, which in many cases will not really be necessary, is going to lead to waste of time, delays, and that will not be in the interests of any of the people concerned in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 45, line 51, after &ldquo;may,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on the recommendation of the Registrar and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendments for which Senator Lenihan and I are responsible are endeavouring to give more power to the registrar.  This time it is the Minister for Local Government who is involved rather than the Minister for Finance.  The intention of amendment No. 12 is to give the registrar initiative, to say that the Minister may make regulations&mdash;because there is a difficulty there about making regulations&mdash;and that the Minister may, on the recommendation of the registrar, make certain regulations. This is a matter where, in fact, this is what will be done.  The registrar, almost certainly, is the person who will consider what is necessary in regard to the management of societies. The registrar is going to be in touch with the problems, with the needs, and he will draft these regulations. For the various reasons to which I have already referred, the way it should be done is that the registrar should draft the regulations and bring them forward as a recommendation. Of course, the Minister then will have power of approval, will consult the Minister for Finance if he thinks it necessary&mdash;of course under this section he will have to do it&mdash;and then the regulations will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will in no way lose control of the situation and there is no question of any regulation being put through with which he does not agree.  To get back to a fear that has been expressed, possibly one without foundation, the fear that the Minister, not the present but any Minister, may make a regulation which has a political short-term value and possibly may be something that the Minister of that time will feel of great importance but, from the long-term interest of the building societies, would not be really a valid or good one.  This leaves the initiative in the hands of the registrar and he will be the person who will bring forward the suggestions.  This is the proper way, <Col N="475" /> the more objective way to leave the drafting of regulations to the registrar but allows the Minister, if he does not approve of the regulations, to say he does not approve and send the registrar back to make further recommendations.</P>
    <P>This is a better way to approach this.  It is a less heavy-handed way of approaching it and is one which will give better results.  It will be less objectionable to the building societies and from the public point of view will lessen the impression that the building societies are under pressure, are constantly being dictated to by the various Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 13 the Minister has provided for consultation with the registrar and the Building Societies' Advisory Committee.  Certainly this is a step in the right direction.  Although I would prefer the wording as in amendment No. 12, the inclusion of the Building Societies' Advisory Committee, if combined with the wording in amendment No. 12, would be a very good combination of amendments No. 12 and 13.</P>

      <P>In the course of my Second Reading speech I mentioned that I would consider sympathetically any amendments to the Bill.  Following discussions with the societies, I tabled a very large number of amendments for Committee Stage and those were accepted.  I indicated at that stage that I would consider the question of amending section 76.  Accordingly, I tabled amendments Nos. 13 and 15.  In a spirit of compromise&mdash; in order to underline the fact that I am not at all at variance with the view that the registrar should be in a strong position&mdash;I am prepared to withdraw amendments Nos. 13 and 15 and accept amendments Nos. 12 and 14 in the names of Senators Lenihan and Ryan.  One is as good as the other.  If it makes the Senator any <Col N="476" /> happier that his is a better amendment&mdash;I am not prepared to say whether it is or not&mdash;I am prepared to withdraw mine.  I do not think it matters very much.  I think we are both trying to do the same thing. Therefore, I will withdraw amendments Nos. 13 and 15.</P>

      <P>As regards amendment No. 13, I think that would be an improvement but I do not see any reason why the Minister should withdraw amendment No. 15.  Regulations are going to be made whether they are on the initiative of the registrar or the Minister and I think these regulations should be made.  After all, if the Minister concedes that the regulations he makes could be mistaken and need the attention of this House, I am sure he will not disagree with the possibility that the registrar might make a mistake too.</P>

But I would ask him not to remove it entirely but to leave in the part which provides for consultation with the Building Societies' Advisory Committee. The wording of the subsection then would be that the Minister may, on the recommendation of the registrar and after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Building Societies' Advisory Committee, make such regulations, and so on.  If that could be accepted, I would be as happy as I have been at any stage in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This I understand.  The Minister will probably find he has some influence in the House.  There is a reference here to <Col N="478" /> the Building Societies' Advisory Committee which forced me, having been away for the Committee Stage, to look at it.  It has popped up in section 96.  In so far as we are now considering the incorporation of the performance of a statutory function, the Minister may have a look at section 96 because in that section it is said that the committee may advise the Minister.  But under amendment No. 13 it has to consult with him.  It may advise him in general but it is obliged to consult with him under his own amendment to section 76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;must&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it does not; maybe it must not.  In so far as we are looking at a proposed statutory function which would only arise if it is &ldquo;must&rdquo;, subsection (3) of section 96 says the committee shall consist of various people, not more than nine.  I notice they are all representative of different bodies.  One body whom we are all supposed to know&mdash; we in this House know who they are&mdash; is the Irish Building Societies' Association. But, come the year 2000, or the year the Minister and I will be debating the next amendment to this Bill, who will know what was the Irish Building Societies' Association?  It would seem to me that if a representative of that body is to be given a duty of participating in a statutory function it ought to have some definition somewhere.  They must not consist of more than nine people.  They are all to be representative.  There is to be one representative from the Department of Local Government, another from the Department of Finance&mdash;that is two; thirdly, the registrar; fourthly, the Central Bank; fifthly, the Irish Building Societies' Association and then it says that such other bodies as he may from time to time consider appropriate.  That is to say, presumably the Minister is now limited to considering, &ldquo;as appropriate&rdquo;, because all have to be representatives of only four more bodies and each of those must be representative.  It is an oddly-composed section.  If the Minister is serious about giving this gumless <Col N="479" /> animal some teeth, perhaps he would have another look at it overall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAMartin" hpid="Dr. Martin Dr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this series of amendments has been interesting in the sense that the Minister has offered the concession and the Opposition have asked for the amalgamation of two amendments at the same time.  It is very difficult to know who is going to out-do the other in terms of generosity.  It draws attention to whether or not the section itself is necessary at all.  It seems to me that, in terms of these amendments, what they are doing is limiting the powers of the Minister within the section; in other words, giving a far larger profile and function to the registrar and the Building Societies Advisory Committee. Obviously, the purpose of the amendments is to limit the powers of the Minister in the matter.  Having consulted does one have to take the advice of these officers?  That is one aspect that strikes me.  If not, you are back in the position of having a section of the Bill which is, in itself, a Bill.  In other words, the power which the Minister retains, if he does not have to take the advice having had the consultation, is such, in a way, as to set at naught all the very generous concessions that he has already made in one amendment after another.  He is almost like a man who decides to disarm himself and very graciously hands in his shotgun, his air pistol and Indian clubs while retaining a machine-gun under the floorboards.  It seems to me that if he does not have to accept the advice, after consultation here, he has a section which would allow him to set at naught all the concessions he has already made.  I would urge the Minister to look again at this section between now and the time the Bill goes to the Dáil.  I wonder whether that section is necessary at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>This amendment is in regard to the amount and purpose of loans.  Section 77 (1) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Whenever the Minister considers it expedient, in the interests of the orderly and proper regulation of building sociey business and having regard to the demand for loans for house purchase, he may, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Registrar, make regulations in relation to the purposes and amounts of loans by societies.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting there is almost the same as amendment No. 12, that it should read that he may, on the recommendation of the registrar and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations.  The arguments I used in regard to amendment No. 12 are exactly the same here. Even if the Minister saw it a little bit objectionable, he was prepared to agree to the change in section 76.  I was hoping he might do the same with regard to this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This, of course, is an Executive function.  Therefore, it is in an entirely different category from the other.  Perhaps this has passed unnoticed by Senator Eoin Ryan.  Section 77 empowers the Minister, in certain circumstances, to control the amount and purpose of loans made by societies.  It is not envisaged that these controls should be a permanent feature.  Where, for instance, the funds available for loans exceed the demand, there will, of course, be no need for this type of control.  But circumstances could arise where control would be necessary.  The controls are spelled out in detail in subsection (2) of section 77:</P>
      <P>(a)  the maximum amount of a loan that a society may make;</P>
      <P>(b)  the purposes for which loans may or may not be made by a society; and</P>
      <P>(c)  the maximum amount that a society may lend to a body corporate and the total amount of such loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exercise of these powers by the Minister would, in no conceivable circumstances, have the dire consequence which Senator Lenihan forecast in the course of a lengthy contribution <Col N="482" /> during the Committee Stage debate.  These controls were operated by the Minister for Local Government all the time the special subsidy was being paid, with no dire consequences whatever.  The building societies were quite happy with the operation of it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the controls, if and when put into operation, would be related to the demand for loans for house purchase.  The Minister for Local Government is the person charged with the responsibility for organising finance for all the sections of the housing programme.  He is the person who has, not alone the responsibility but also the information regarding the expected output of the various sources of finance contributing to the total of the resources on which the housing programme depends at any given time.  It is clearly reasonable to propose that he is the person who should make the regulations under the Section.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Lenihan and Senator Eoin Ryan would ensure that regulations about the amounts and purposes of loans could be made only on the recommendation of the registrar.  The registrar could not be expected to be in a position, in making recommendations, to have the full picture as regards housing. The section as it stands provides that the regulation will be made by the Minister for Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance after consultation with the registrar.  I have already referred to the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government in relation to the provision of finance for housing.  The Minister for Finance has responsibility for the supply of funds for all services including housing and so it is natural that his consent be obtained in making regulations under the section.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for consultation with the registrar because of his responsibility for securing the orderly and proper regulation of building societies business.  In addition, the registrar would be in constant touch with the societies, would be able to identify the pattern of their lending and would be in a position to advise <Col N="483" /> on the likely effect which any proposed regulations relating to loans would have on other aspects of building societies' business.  Throughout the Bill the aim has been to achieve a reasonable balance in the level of the controls proposed and I am sure that the Members of the House are in agreement that this will be achieved and that the arrangements which will operate under the section as it stands will provide this balance and secure that the interests of all concerned will be taken into account if and when regulations are made.  For these reasons I must oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a stronger case to be made for retaining this than there was in some of the earlier sections and although I am not convinced that the amendment would not improve the section nevertheless I think the Minister has a stronger case and I do not propose to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 46, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where regulations are proposed to be made under this section, a draft of the proposed regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to introduce the same provision for section 77 as now exists for section 76, that is to provide that where regulations are proposed a draft of the regulations should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  If it is agreed that regulations under section 76 should be laid before both Houses the arguments for doing the same under section 77 are equally valid and I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="484" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking the submission to each House of the Oireachtas of draft regulations is provided for only where the matter contained in the regulations is of special public importance or where the regulations would have the effect of altering a provision in existing legislation where, for instance, amounts, percentages or periods of time specified in legislation, may be altered in regulations. In such circumstances it would be normal to seek the approval of each House for the draft of such regulations as they would have the same effect as an amendment to the Act itself.  In the case of regulations made under section 77 no such situation would arise.  The section sets out precisely the powers being conferred on the Minister for Local Government and the contents of the regulations would be a matter of detail rather than of principle.  May I say at this point that in proposing that draft regulations under section 76 be submitted I was conscious of the fact that such regulations would be so framed that they would last for many years.  Regulations under section 77 would be concerned only with the amounts and purposes of loans. While the special subsidy was being paid to these societies there was a requirement that all loans should be for housing purposes and the maximum amount of a loan was varied from time to time.  The amount had to be varied in the light of the demand for loans, the cost of housing and the effect of inflation.  In a short space of 30 months the controls exercised were altered about six times to meet changing circumstances and in many instances to meet representations from the societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I do not visualise that regulations under this section would be a permanent feature.  On the contrary, regulations would be made only in the circumstances set out in subsection (1).  However, as those circumstances arise it would be quite unworkable to have to present a draft to each House providing perhaps for a minor amendment, the effect of which might be merely to make an adjustment to compensate for a rise in the cost of living.  No <Col N="485" /> question of principle would be involved. It would be quite unwarranted to have to take up the time of both Houses every three or four months to seek approval for the making of minor changes in regulations.  The making of regulations is in itself a reasonably slow process.  If, in addition, it became necessary to submit drafts of amending legislations to each House of the Oireachtas the process would become too inflexible and might even work to the disadvantage of societies if they happened to require an urgent review of the positions. Accordingly I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what the Minister has said in reply to this is valid.  But I do not agree that it is not a matter of principle.  It could be a matter of principle.  This gives the Minister very wide power to decide the purposes and amounts of loans by societies and although this will probably be always used in a perfectly legitimate way and in a manner to which there could be no objection whatever, it seems to provide a way in which a Minister could direct the building societies in a very positive way, a way which while in their interest might not be in the interest of their depositors and so on, and might not be in the public interest.  This seems to give the Minister a very great power which he is going to exercise without the Houses of the Oireachtas being ever aware of what is in these regulations.</P>

      <P>Looking through the amendments proposed by Senator Ryan and supported by other Senators there would appear to be concern expressed in Senator Ryan's amendments, which voiced I would think the concern of the Building Societies' Association that there might be a possible conflict of interests between the Minister's position in regard to the building societies' interests.  I think that the Minister will be the first to agree that the building societies should have freedom to operate their societies in the best possible way in the interests of both their <Col N="487" /> depositors and their borrowers and I would like to think that that indeed is the purpose of the Bill and at the same time it will safeguard the depositor and the borrower against rogue societies.</P>
      <P>I should like to make just one comment here.  In section 96 the Minister refers to certain organisations which may be consulted in connection with the proposed building societies advisory committee and he refers specifically to the Irish Building Societies' Association and such other bodies that he may from time to time consider appropriate.  The Minister is aware that although the building societies association generally voices the feelings of the building societies' industry, it does not represent all the building societies in the country; in fact it is a very confined association. I would like to think that smaller societies and, perhaps, new societies would find some place for consultation within the ambit of this Bill as they have an important part to play in the building societies' interest as well as the larger societies and I hope that the Minister will keep this in mind when he is setting up the building societies advisory committee.  I would like to reiterate this because the Minister would be the last person who would like to see any restriction both on the development of the society or even the starting up of societies.  It is essential in this business as with any other business that there should be effective and efficient competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill was to up-date legislation in the best interests of all concerned.  That is not alone the two bodies referred to by Senator Russell, but a number of other interests, and it is the object of the Bill to ensure that this matter is regularised.  It improves the position for the interests concerned including the building societies.  The association represents 98 per cent of the assets but only five of the 28 societies are registered.  That is a rather peculiar position and I would not at this stage suggest what bodies should make up the other four which are not mentioned. We would have to ensure that <Col N="488" /> the right ones are represented because it would look a bit odd if the building societies with 98 per cent of the assets had one representative and the remainder with only 2 per cent also had a representative.  In such circumstances somebody might consider it better to be outside.  I would not like to give any guarantee on that part of it except to say that there will be representatives of organisations who will have in mind how best the societies should be operated.  I would like finally to thank the House for the speedy and reasonable way in which they have allowed this Bill to go through.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;shall within the period of three months from the date of receipt of the appeal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>According to section 18 the board may serve notice but this is rather vague.  There should be a time limit and I am suggesting that the time limit should be three months.  My reason for suggesting that the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is vague is that some objector could come to the board with a case which they might consider to be good with the result that the planning application might be held up.  Therefore it would be best to suggest a specific date, perhaps three months or, should the Minister so wish, a month or even six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan's comment makes my argument.  The purpose of the section is to enable the board to deal expeditiously with appeals which are vexatious or where the appeal of any party is subjected to an unnecessarily delayed decision either through failure to submit <Col N="489" /> grounds for an appeal or through delay in reply to correspondence.  The section provides that the board may serve a notice in such a case stating that after a specified day the appeal will be decided whether or not permission from the delaying party has been received.  We are all aware of the delay on decisions.  Even local authorities have delayed sending in certain information with the consequential results that appeals have been unnecessarily delayed.  The provision as drafted is discretionary and flexible and it is left to the board to decide whether, and if so, a notice should be served in any particular case.  The amendment would make it mandatory on the board to serve a section 18 notice within three months of the receipt of the appeal.  Such a provision would serve no useful purpose and would only weaken the section as there could be circumstances where the delay might only arise after a period of three months had elapsed, where a request for further information was not replied to.</P>
      <P>There could also be cases of vexatious appeals where it might be appropriate to serve a notice very soon after the appeal is received.  I prefer to leave it to the discretion of the board to decide whether a particular reference or appeal is vexatious or is being unduly delayed.  It would not be logical to set a time limit within which you could serve a notice.  We must assume that the board will act in a reasonable way and that they will be in the best position to assess when the serving of an notice would be appropriate.  I know what Senator Ryan is getting at and I appreciate the point he made, but I believe that as it is, the section enables the board to deal with it far more quickly and will prevent somebody dragging along appeals which are annoying to everybody, both to the person who is waiting for the result as well as to the board and others.  Therefore, I would ask Senator Ryan to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I was asked by our local planning authority to table this amendment.

If the Minister were to accept my amendment it would mean that the only people who could object would be the planning authority.  This would be cutting out private individuals altogether, something I would not be in favour of. Granted, those people in the case of Schering Plow should not have objected but there might be another person who might have a genuine objection and if I were to pursue this, he would not have that right, so I withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Not build.  The exemption at the moment is the construction, excavation, extension, alteration or replacement of any store, barn, byre, shed, glasshouse, pen, sty, silo or other structure on land not less than 30 feet from any public road or from the site of any road improvement works or new road, carrying out the construction of which is an objective of any development plan.</P>
      <P>No such structures are to be used for any purpose other than the purpose of agriculture or forestry and no such structure for the housing of pigs or poultry or the making of silage shall be situated within 100 feet of any dwelling-house, save with the consent of the owner and occupier thereof.  That is one provision which is not adhered to. And no such structure within 100 yards of any public road shall exceed 21 feet in height above ground level.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (1) (a) of the 1963 Act reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development consisting of the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry (including afforestation), and development consisting of the use for any of these purposes of any building <Col N="492" /> occupied together with land so used:</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to repeal that part of section 4 (1) (a) which exempts from planning control development consisting of the use for the purpose of agriculture or forestry of existing buildings occupied together with land used for such purposes. The objective in putting down this amendment may be to secure that farm buildings are not erected without planning permission.  On Second Stage I indicated that in my view erection of the larger type of farm buildings used for intensive farming such as pigs and poultry breeding should be brought under planning control.  Such buildings make a public health nuisance and also create the risk of water pollution.  An amendment to the Act is not, however, necessary or appropriate to achieve this control.  This specific provision exempting such structures is contained in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and in the Development Regulations, 1967.  As I indicated on Second Stage, an amendment of these regulations in relation to the larger type of farm buildings used for the housing of livestock has been agreed in principle and the details are now under discussion with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The amendment would mean that use for agriculture or forestry purposes of any land or existing building not at present used for such purposes would require planning permission.  This would not be warranted.  I am sure it is not what the Senator meant to achieve and in the circumstances I ask that the amendment be withdrawn. I agree with him that there have been abuses and we propose to deal with these abuses.  Discussion has taken place with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in this regard. They are just as much interested in this matter as we are because, as they appreciate, it is not the good farmer who does those things, it is the farmer who does not care about anybody not even himself.  Some of the things he does make it appear that he is not very much interested in his own welfare.  Discussions are taking <Col N="493" /> place and we will have regulations which will meet most of the points which the Senator wishes to have dealt with.  If he has any specific point which may be overlooked perhaps he will let me know and we will see if we might deal with it.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with this amendment tabled by Senator Ryan because I think this is one aspect of the 1963 Act which has been very unsatisfactory in rural Ireland.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or anybody else can make all the regulations they like but if any landowner, or farmer, can put up a building within 30 feet of a public road and say that he is doing that for the purpose of housing agricultural produce, cattle, pigs and so on, he is exempt but, as Senator Ryan mentioned, if he wants to get a grant he can apply for permission and get an exemption from the planning office.</P>

      <P>This has led to many difficulties in rural areas.  You can have quite a nice house and somebody can buy a ranch which is opposite your house and in a couple of weeks time you find a silo has been erected, maybe with 100 cattle, and you know what the value of your house is then. This kind of thing has been happening all over the country.  It is wrong that anyone should be allowed to put up buildings and be exempt from the Planning Act.  We should have learned from the mistakes of the 1963 Act and I am sorry that something more specific has not been done in this Act in relation to that.  We have a situation down in our own constituency that the Minister is aware of and they are exempt and we know what the people in the area suffer as a result of that building.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Minister has said I am prepared to withdraw the amendment but I am in complete agreement with Senator Fitzgerald.  The building that I am mostly interested in is the silo pit.  I am a farmer and I suppose I should not be talking against the farming community but the greatest abuse of the planning legislation is in relation to silo pits.  People are erecting these at the required distance from the road but that is not good enough.  We know the smell that can come from a silo pit.  I know one case of where a silo pit was erected within 50 yards of the road between Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir which is the main Limerick/Waterford road.  It is an eyesore. I am very sorry that we are not stricter as far as silo pits go.  The Minister referred to the specification of 30 feet.  This refers to height but no silo pit is higher than five or six feet anyway. I hope that, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, some steps will be taken to rectify this situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a small point on section 40 and it relates to something that I said on Second <Col N="495" /> Reading.  It seems that the definition of the reasons whereby a local authority can make a special amenity area order would exclude the sort of thing I was talking about on Second Stage&mdash;for example, a townscape which might not be regarded as having outstanding natural beauty in the sense that it is manmade, would not have any special recreational value and whose relevance to nature conservation would be nonexistent really.  The point I was making at that time, and I would like to repeat it now, is whether or not the Minister would be prepared to consider the possibility of making such orders for areas which are not purely scenic areas and in particular to make it possible for planning authorities to carry out preservational orders in such a way that demolition in particular will not be exempt.  We have this big problem with demolition not being exempt. Developers who want to knock down a house are free to do so and then can hold a revolver to the head of the planning authority with regard to what they want to put up in its place, irrespective of whether the thing that was demolished was of any value or not.  We should have some form of legislation or regulation whereby planning authorities can say in relation to whole areas that no demolition will take place in this area without their prior consent.  I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to consider adding to the section another subsection which would have this effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a particular reason why this is not feasible and the reason is that a special amenity area so declared is declared without compensation. If an urban area was included it could create a tremendous problem.  There is another way in which local authorities can list houses and I do not mean list B.  If they want to list the street and they want it preserved, they should not just put it on list B, which in effect is not a protection.  If it is list A, that puts it in a different position altogether, but in this it would not be feasible to include it here because it would simply mean that it would put an intolerable burden on the local <Col N="496" /> authority.  This section would not be the way to deal with it.  I can understand the point and we looked at it very carefully.  Senator Horgan raised it on Second Reading but it is not possible to cover it.  It can be covered another way by the local authorities themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When I replied to the Seanad debate on the Second Stage of the Bill on 7th April last, I referred to difficulties which had arisen in relation to particular development proposals for which planning permission had been granted on appeal subject to the most stringent environmental and other conditions.  Senator W. Ryan will appreciate that what I am talking about is prompted by Schering Plow.  I made it clear that so far as I was concerned anybody who is dissatisfied with an appeal decision is entitled to go to the High Court to seek to have the decision quashed if he has reasonable grounds for so doing, but I expressed the view that a person should not be entitled to obstruct the developer by threatening to take High Court action at some future date.  I therefore indicated that I was seriously considering whether it would be possible to have a provision under which there would be a limit on the period within which High Court action could be taken.</P>
      <P>Under section 82 (3) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, which is being replaced by a provision of section 42 of the Bill, an appeal lies to the High Court on a question of law which arises on any appeal.  Such an appeal to the High Court must be taken within three months after the giving of the decision of such longer period as the High Court may in any particular case allow.  Apart altogether from this provision, the general law entitles a person at any time to apply to the High Court for an order of <i>certiorari</i> or a declaratory order seeking to have a special appeal decision quashed, and there is no time limit on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to deprive anybody of the right to apply to the High Court seeking to have an appeal decision quashed in a case where that person considers that there are grounds for so doing, but it is only reasonable that if a person wishes to exercise this right he should initiate the proceedings within a reasonable time.  It is only fair that there should be some provision to ensure that all objections to a development can be brought to a speedy end.  For this reason I have <Col N="498" /> put down an amendment which in effect involves a reasonable regulation of the right of access to the courts to question a decision made either by a planning authority on an application for permission or by the Minister or the board in an appeals case.  There are precedents for this type of provision both in English law and in our law, such as the provision of the Housing Act, 1966, dealing with the confirmation of compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>I have given a considerable amount of thought to the period which should be allowed under the proposed new provision for the initiation of proceedings in the High Court.  In the interests of bringing a case to finality and enabling a worth-while development to go ahead as quickly as possible I would like to provide for quite a short period. However, I think we must recognise that people who may have a legitimate grievance will need time to consult their legal advisers and to weigh up the pros and cons of proceedings in the courts.  Moreover, if we were to provide for an unduly short period, there could perhaps be a danger that the entire provision might be found to be unconstitutional in that it would represent an unreasonable interference with the right of access to the High Court.  In all the circumstances I have been advised that a two-month period would be appropriate, and I have had the amendment drafted accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should, of course, point out that, even if we succeed in establishing a fairly limited period for applying to the High Court in a case where the validity of a permission is being challenged, a considerable delay could still result before the case could come to a hearing or judgment could be delivered.  I am advised that nothing can be done about this by way of further amendment.  It would not be appropriate to attempt to regulate court procedure in the Bill.  I might mention however that once proceedings are initiated in the High Court a developer will have some remedy because if there is unreasonable delay on the part of the person who instituted the proceedings an application can be made to the court for an order either directing <Col N="499" /> that the statement of claim and so on should be lodged quickly or alternatively striking out the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The type of case about which I am particularly concerned is where a person does not actually institute proceedings but threatens to do so if and when a development commences.  I am satisfied that the proposed amendment of the 1963 Act will at least prevent this type of situation arising in the future and accordingly I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>The amendments themselves are largely self-explanatory.  The first proposes that the existing section 82 (3) should be redrafted to confine it to cases where points of law may arise on appeal and cases may need to be referred to the High Court either by the Minister or by the board.</P>
    <P>A new subsection (3A) is being inserted to avoid the type of limitation about which I have been speaking in the case of proceedings designed to challenge the validity of a planning decision.</P>
    <P>The second amendment of section 42 is purely consequential and takes account of the redrafting of section 82 (3) which is affected by the first amendment.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the Minister has tabled this amendment, because it has worried us quite a lot down Tipperary way that a person could just make a threat to take High Court action and that the people concerned, the people bringing industry in, were afraid to make any further move.  This could hang on for maybe 12 months, and of course by the end of that time the industry was gone.  In this case they will have to have an appeal lodged in the High Court within two months.  We know, of course, that the High Court can move very slowly and the hearing might be 12 months after that, but that is not the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government.  If an appeal has to be lodged with the High Court within two months we are getting somewhere.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P>In page 35, between lines 53 and 54, to insert the following section before section 44:</P>
    <P>44. &mdash;Section 42 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, as amended by sections 86 and 91 of the Principal Act, shall be construed and have effect as if or such extended period as may at any time be agreed in writing between that authority and the person proposing to execute the work' and &lsquo;or such extended period, as may be appropriate,&rsquo; were inserted therein after &lsquo;within two months&rsquo; and &lsquo;such two months&rsquo;, respectively.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 91 of the 1963 Act amends section 42 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, so as to extend from one to two months the period within which a planning authority must give a decision on whether any building work is in conformity with the building regulations.  The preparation of such regulations is now at an advanced stage.  It is likely that in some cases, through no fault of their own, the planning authority may not be in a position to give a fully considered decision on applications within the prescribed time due&mdash;for instance, because of the complexity of the project or delay on the part of the applicant in furnishing necessary supplementary information in good time.  It seems reasonable therefore in the interest of both the planning authority and the applicant that there should be some provision for the extension of the time allowed for dealing with applications.  The most acceptable <Col N="501" /> way of providing for such extension would be to amend the existing law by providing that the time limit may be extended to the extent that the person proposing to carry out the building work agrees in writing.  The amendment therefore proposes to insert a new section into the Bill which amends the 1878 Act to allow such an extension to be agreed.  The concept of extending the time limit by agreement with the applicant is already given effect to in section 87 (6) of the 1963 Act which deals with the relaxation of building regulations.  Section 39 (f) of the Bill contains a similar provision relating to applications for planning permission.</P>

      <P>I wish to express the hope that this Bill will be brought into force as quickly as possible, because it is one of tremendous importance. A commission are to be appointed and they should be enabled to get on with their work and there should be no undue delay in passing the Bill.</P>

      <P>While it is fair to say that there is no one more anxious <Col N="502" /> than I am to see the Bill becoming law there will be a delay, whether we like it or not, of, I would say, up to six months before the Planning Board will be finally in existence.  I was very anxious to get it through because there are many things to be done.  I assure the House, that as soon as I can I will have this Bill made law and bring the new regulations into operation.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for the way in which they have dealt with the Bill here today and indeed when it was previously before the House.  When the Bill finally becomes law there will be a big improvement in our planning law.  I think it only fair to say that, with all its warts, the 1963 Bill was a good one and, while we found many things wrong with it over the years, it was a good Bill and this one, I hope, will bring it up to date.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  Because he found it necessary to put down amendments, and rightly so, the Bill will have to be referred back to the Dáil and I would appreciate it very much if this could be done before the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>I would like to have that done but any amendments take time to frame.  There is no point at all in putting down an amendment unless it is properly framed and while I will do my best, I would not like to promise it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 23rd June, 1976.</P>
