      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, the National Training Fund Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; No. 2, Appropriation Bill, 2000 &ndash; all Stages, with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 30 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 20 minutes; No. 3, earlier signature motion on the Appropriation Bill, 2000, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of No. 2; No. 4, not to be taken before 4 p.m., the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes. Senators may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of Christmas and in consideration of the great night had by all the Members opposite last night, the Order of Business is agreeable to us. I want to raise one point with the Leader because it is only fair that people should know that we are sitting next week. We have no objection to sitting Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the week after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;but we would like to know in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise another serious point. The Leader will recall that the week before last I raised the issue of people being released from prison for unsupervised weekends, and we are all aware of the sad case that occurred in Galway as a result of that policy. I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be brought into the House to explain the basis on which people are released from prison unsupervised, particularly in light of what happened this weekend in respect of the McCabe case. As far as I am <Col N="1502" /> concerned, those people are murderers, yet the three of them were released during that period. One of them was in a pub until 1 a.m. That is not good enough. Obviously he was not supervised, or else the supervisor was in the pub with him. It is atrocious that these three people could be released unsupervised. They do not come under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement so I cannot understand the reason they were released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have some reservations about the Order of Business. In view of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is coming into the House to take the National Stud Bill, could we spend some time after that discussing the BSE crisis? I was very disturbed by what Deputy O'Malley said in the other House yesterday. In view of his comments and those of Commissioner Fischler about ground water, perhaps we could spend a little more time discussing that issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Science into the House as soon as possible in the next session to discuss the serious decline in the number of second level students taking honours physics and chemistry, and indeed higher mathematics? Much of our current prosperity is built on graduates in science and technology and there is a gradual drift away from these subjects, which is serious.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that I thought I had been given promises that they would take place in this session, is it too much to hope that we would have debates on the Environmental Protection Agency report? Senator Quill, in particular, raised this matter previously. Do we have to wait until the next Inspector of Mental Hospitals' report arrives on our desks before we bother debating this year's report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reservations about the Order of Business in that it is the same type of business we always seem to do at the end of a session where we try to put through three important Bills in one day. That is not the way to go about our business. I congratulate the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands on her decision to bid for James Joyce's Circe episode in <i>Ulysses</i>. I am delighted the National Library has been authorised to bid in Christies of New York and, I hope, we will purchase it because we have virtually nothing of James Joyce's work in Ireland. That entire heritage has been lost to this country and let us hope that at last we will get some of his original manuscripts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the teachers' pay claim and the dispute which escalated today, with pickets extended to community colleges and comprehensive schools. After eight days of industrial action the Minister for Education and Science has not come to this House to discuss the dispute. The <Col N="1503" /> situation is getting out of hand. All we have heard from the Minister is that he would dock pay for work that did not have to be done by teachers, which is very provocative. He also gave teachers a lecture on morality. This is not good enough. We need discussion and a forum. This House also needs to know what the Minister for Education and Science is thinking. There is now a window of opportunity and it would worthwhile discussing the matter before the Christmas recess. The Minister should come into the House to hear what we have to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday several Senators sought a debate on the quality of drinking water. I would like time to be provided in the near future to discuss with the Minister for Health and Children the issue of public health as it relates not only to water but also to food. As Senator Henry said, the details revealed yesterday by Deputy O'Malley in the other House about the practices in a meat plant in Limerick which culled depopulated herds with BSE and also killed meat for the home market are alarming. I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on these issues as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that unfettered time be provided for the debate on the National Stud (Amendment) Bill. There may only be a limited number of Members who wish to contribute to the debate and I ask the Leader to exercise a certain discretion in regard to the time provided for it.</P>
      <P>I support the points made by the acting leader of the Fine Gael group on compassionate or temporary release. It is a joke that one individual convicted of murder was apparently found after hours in a licensed premises, while the other individual was off in another direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer on this matter so far has not been satisfactory. I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I also ask him to provide time early in the next session for a debate on the Courts Service Strategic Plan, 2000-2003. Many Members have comments to make on this plan and we want to hear the views of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I previously requested the allocation of time for a debate on the role of An Bord Pleanála and I ask the Leader to provide this early in the new year. The reason I raise this issue again is that guidelines have been issued on the new planning legislation and the brief of An Bord Pleanála in relation to many of the issues covered by them will have to be changed. Now that the legislation has been enacted we are in a position to see how accountable An Bord Pleanála is in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the item raised by the Fine Gael acting leader, there is unease among the Garda and the wider public about the regime of temporary unsupervised release of some categories of prisoners whom we all believed were not covered by the Agreement. I am concerned about the conflict and contradictions in terms of the Minister's past commitments and statements on the matter. Will the Leader outline the basis on which these releases are granted? Can we have a definitive statement on the matter?</P>
      <P>We have no difficulty about the proposals for next week but would like to know today what the arrangements are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Costello's amendment to the Order of Business, maybe for differ<Col N="1505" /> ent reasons. It is incredible that a Member on the Government side would say that we would have a muzzled debate on the teachers' strike. This is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct &ndash; I never said we would have a muzzled debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The Senator said we would not have a debate. That is what is called muzzling freedom of speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I have several questions for him. Can we please have a debate on the teachers' strike and ensure that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats do not muzzle the debate on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>He will be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader say which Ministers will be present today? I ask him in future to tell us in advance which Ministers will take the legislation we are debating. This is not an unreasonable request. Yesterday complicated legislation was taken by an inappropriate Minister and went through virtually on the nod. Will the Leader say on the Order of Business today the Ministers who will take each item?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate RTE on its &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on alcohol abuse which was shown last night. During the weekend in Dublin <Col N="1506" /> 70% of ambulances collect drunks off the street, while 40% of hospital accident and emergency services are taken up treating drunks. These are shocking statistics.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the biggest problem facing us and I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on alcohol abuse and homelessness, which are related problems. I appeal to fathers and mothers to take the scrantas out of their eyes and look at what their children are doing in universities. I also appeal to schools to get a copy of this programme and show it to students. University students are the professionals and fathers and mothers of tomorrow. What kind of society will we have if something is not done about this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="ËMr. Ryan ËMr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what Senator Farrell said, but not necessarily the emotion of it. There is a huge case for a code of practice on the presence of the drinks industry in third level institutions. In every college in the third level sector there is a full-time promoter working for the breweries. This is a serious issue. I am far more concerned about alcohol and young people than I ever would be about the drug scares that float around all the time. Alcohol does far more damage to more people than drugs will ever do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished but not surprised that Fianna Fáil does not want us to debate the teachers' strike. It is always their wish that we should not debate anything that would embarrass them. I suppose that is understandable.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing that we have not debated in this House our biggest industrial relations problem. This dispute is far more widespread, threatening and potentially damaging than the taxi strike which only caused us great inconvenience. If the teachers' dispute rolls on indefinitely it will cause enormous harm. We should talk about it now when it is urgent and important.</P>
      <P>About four weeks ago the Leader told me that the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, would be withdrawn but it is still on the Order Paper. I realise that I am becoming repetitious but it is because one cannot get a precise answer that I must keep asking what is happening to it. I have said before that this is not a trivial matter. This country needs this fundamental infrastructure far more than the roads system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to add to his list of issues to be debated in the new year the question of public transport provision outside Dublin. I have no dis<Col N="1507" /> pute with investment in public transport in Dublin. However, there are areas in the country which within six years will be of the same magnitude as the Dublin of ten years ago. We can either go through the whole range of public transport problems again or talk about it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider taking all Stages of the National Stud (Amendment) Bill today. Of course we would accept an unfettered debate. It would be desirable to take all Stages today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to respond favourably to the requests made by Senators Gibbons and Henry to debate the food crisis today. I know it is only a week since we did so but there have been many developments of serious proportions.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry made a good suggestion that while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development is here today for our debate on the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, and I assume on the basis of Senator Ross's request that he will be present, he should spend some time discussing the beef crisis in the food industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask him about something that happened at the Nice Summit and Ireland's decision to become part of the European rapid reaction force. I am concerned, along with many others, about our future role not so much in a military alliance but in a crisis resolution context. There is already talk among our European partners about using nuclear weapons and missiles in the theatre of conflict resolution in Europe. This country has a very strong view about the use of missiles and nuclear weapons. I am concerned that we might be drawn into an area and used in a context that is unacceptable to the vast majority of Irish people. In that context it might be useful if the Minister came here at the start of the new year to clarify precisely what Ireland's obligations will be as part of the rapid reaction force.</P>

      <P>I ask for a debate on education. It is very important that we do this soon. I am very concerned that the Minister for Education and <Col N="1508" /> Science is debating this issue over the airwaves. It is very important that both sides of the dispute meet.</P>
      <P>No one has mentioned the students, those who are caught in the middle and are very distressed. I ask that this dispute be resolved and that students should be able to look forward to going back to their studies next term without fear of disruption before their very important exams in the summer. Both sides should think of the plight of students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on An Bord Pleanála. I appreciate the point has been made that it should be in a broad context. I want the Leader to know it is vitally important that we debate it in the context of the rural renewal scheme for the counties of the west under a Government led policy decision. The decisions made by An Bord Pleanála in recent times are in conflict with Government policy. A debate here would help us to iron out any difficulties.</P>
      <P>With regard to temporary release from prisons, I support the call that parole boards should be set up. I understand that the relevant Minister supports this measure and that he is taking steps to set them up. As regards temporary release generally, during the term of the last Government two gardaí from my area took a prisoner from Ballinasloe to Dublin and he was home before them. They stopped for a meal on the way home.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the new President-elect of the United <Col N="1509" /> States, George W. Bush. He is to be the successor to one of the best US Presidents as far as Ireland is concerned, Bill Clinton. I wish the new President-elect well. We will give him all of our support as we have always done. I hope he follows in the footsteps of his predecessor, President Clinton, and that the United State will continue to be fully committed to peace in Ireland. I also hope he will help to further peace as President Clinton has done.</P>
      <P>On behalf of us all I thank President Clinton for another historic day in Belfast yesterday. It was a milestone. I watched it on television last night and it gave me great hope for the future and what we can achieve. This island can move forward with technological advances and the help of the United States, a country which has been magnificent during the Clinton years.</P>
      <P>This morning Senator Coogan and other Members mentioned their serious concern about the short temporary release of prisoners connected to the murder of Jerry McCabe. I listened to what the Senators said and I will convey their comments to the relevant Minister. I know there are serious concerns about the temporary release programme but temporary releases happen from time to time. It is regrettable that they are not appreciated in the spirit in which they are granted.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry called for a debate on education and I will arrange it. Senators Costello, Ormonde, Ross, Ryan, Keogh, and Tom Hayes expressed their concern about the teachers' strike taking place today. As I have said here many times on the Order of Business, until they all get around a table and start negotiating, progress will not happen. As Senator Ormonde said, the Minister has extended an invitation to meet the union and it has accepted it. I hope a solution to the problem will be speedily reached because at the end of the day students will suffer. We acknowledge and respect the great work of all teachers through the years and we also acknowledge the great changes that have taken place in Ireland have been aided by the standard of education for pupils.</P>

    <Title>National Training Fund Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish the national training fund. The fund will support a range of training initiatives aimed at the employed and those seeking to enter or return to employment. The establishment of the fund is part of a wider strategy for the promotion of human resource development in response to the social and competitiveness challenges now facing us. We are living in the midst of a period of unprecedented economic growth. We are experiencing the positive effects of reformed public finances, increased competition and a pro-enterprise environment, a successful and focused industrial policy, low taxation and long-run investment in initial education and vocational training. Globally, we have experienced growing and increasingly diverse trade and a dispersal of the factors of production. We have seen the growth of the knowledge economy and the shift from &ldquo;bricks to clicks&rdquo;, as it has been called. We have witnessed the growth and consolidation of the European Union as a trading block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we have been fortunate to experience the confluence of these two rivers of change <Col N="1513" />&ndash; national and global. The steps we have taken to put our own house in order have allowed us to gain enormously from globalisation and the knowledge economy. This is why we attract 27% of all US greenfield investment in Europe. It is why we are the largest exporter of software globally and it is why young, dynamic Irish companies are now beginning to penetrate the technology powerhouse of the US.</P>
    <P>Change has fostered prosperity, but that very prosperity and the change which fuelled it bring new challenges and new uncertainties. We are now at the point of full employment when viewed in classical economic terms. We are also on the cusp of a significant change in demographics, where the numbers of new entrants to the labour force will fall from 27,000 this year to under 12,000 by 2008. Concurrently, we will be faced with significant labour and skills requirements to service the expanding economy and address infrastructural deficits. Notwithstanding current labour market tightness, we need to treat the concept of full employment very cautiously indeed. We must not be complacent and feel that we have solved the unemployment problem. We must strive not just to cut unemployment, but to grow our employment rate also.</P>
    <P>As far as unemployment, and indeed underemployment, is concerned, we still have 52,000 people who are short-term unemployed. We also have 28,000 people who are long-term unemployed. In addition to these people, who indicated that they are unemployed in response to the labour force survey, we also have a significant group of some 80,000 people who are marginally attached to the workforce. These people could benefit from work, given the right combination of circumstances and opportunity. In all, this represents a large number of people who could benefit from work.</P>
    <P>There are also significant numbers of people with disabilities who want to work. My Department has fully embraced its responsibilities for the training and employment of such people. Both the national training fund and the Exchequer will provide the resources to ensure that people with disabilities are given the opportunity, means and skills to secure work. As well as people who are unemployed, we also have a large number of women who remain outside the labour force. By comparison to the best performers among our EU counterparts, our female employment rate of 51.4% is lagging behind. The rate in Denmark is in excess of 70%. In many cases, women need to equip themselves with specific skills in order to find jobs. Again, training is the key.</P>
    <P>Many people find themselves in unemployment because of structural changes in the economy which devalue their existing skills set. People who left the education system early with marginal skills in the first place are demonstrably the most vulnerable in times of economic downturn. The quality of the training programmes we offer can <Col N="1514" /> be a critical determining factor in helping people back into employment.</P>
    <P>The national development plan involves investment of £23 billion in infrastructural projects. Having the necessary levels of craft skills and craftspersons is a key success factor underpinning the national development plan. The apprenticeship system plays an essential role here and will be an important component of the national training fund.</P>
    <P>Enterprises will be increasingly dependent on the existing workforce and its ability to adapt to technological and competitive changes. This is an inevitable consequence of our high employment rate and demographic change factors. It is a positive sign that enterprises themselves are already recognising this. The 1997 White Paper on Human Resource Development indicated that</P>
    <P>spending on training by Irish firms was 1.5% of payroll costs. A recent survey of firms conducted by IBEC suggests that this has increased to 3%.</P>
    <P>The survey revealed some significant improvements, but some continuing weaknesses also. For example, 45% of the companies surveyed had a specific budget for training and the average number of training days was five per annum. As against this, 40% of companies did not have a specific training budget, suggesting that training was pursued on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis. The remaining 5% of companies identified no spend on training at all. These data suggest that the picture on enterprise training is changing. There is increased commitment among firms, but there are still significant numbers of firms whose approach to training is <i>ad hoc</i>, and a smaller number of firms who simply do not train at all. It is also clear that firms find the costs of training too high and that the market in supply of training may not be sufficiently developed. Policy, and the structures through which it is delivered, needs to respond to these issues.</P>
    <P>Today, almost 900,000 people work in the commercial services sector. This number has grown by almost 250,000 since 1990. Growth in international services has been particularly impressive, rising from 11,000 in 1990 to 49,000 by 1999. Manufacturing remains critically important and is continuing to prosper. However, our manufacturing base is changing significantly. This can be seen by the fact that the high-tech sector, including chemicals, engineering and IT, grew by 42,123 jobs from 1990 to 1999. Lower technology sectors, such as textiles, clothing and furniture, by contrast lost almost 11,000 jobs. Our approach to training needs to reflect these changing trends.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to partnership. We have worked hard with the social partners since we came into Government to develop the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and to ensure that the partnership process remains capable of coping with the changing economic and social environment. The creation of the national training fund is the foundation stone for a new approach to training policy and enterprise training in particular. Our overall commitment to part<Col N="1515" /> nership has applied to the development of the fund. In January this year, my Department issued a discussion document on enterprise training, which addressed a wide range of topics, including apprenticeship, the respective roles of FÁS and Enterprise Ireland, and the question of the relevance and appropriateness of continuing with the statutorily defined industrial training committees.</P>
    <P>Since issuing the document, officials of my Department have engaged in wide-ranging consultation with the stakeholders in training. These consultations have involved regular contacts with FÁS, Enterprise Ireland, IBEC, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, Skillnets and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. My Department has also met with delegations from each of the industrial training committees. The overwhelming view that emerged from these discussions was that both employer and employee representatives want to explore new approaches to human resource development. They want flexible structures. They want a greater focus on certification and the development of certification models appropriate to enterprise. They want to work with the State to develop lifelong learning and, in particular, more flexible and easier access to the education and training system.</P>
    <P>All the stakeholders have welcomed the dialogue which has been initiated. They want to be sure, however, that a structure is put in place for the continuation of the approach. In that regard the Bill provides for consultation with employer and employee representatives in respect of the fund. I envisage this consultation taking place via the national training advisory committee which I intend to establish early in the new year.</P>
    <P>With policy consultation, my Department has worked with the social partners to develop practical new initiatives in training. The Skillnets initiative is an excellent example of this. It gives enterprises an opportunity to collaborate in identifying and addressing their shared training needs. Moreover, by pooling resources and group purchasing solutions to common training problems, the costs of accessing training can be reduced for individual network members. Skillnets has been enthusiastically welcomed and 60 projects are now in operation or getting under way.</P>
    <P>The overall environment is changing dramatically and so is our approach to human resource development. Set against those changes, our statutory framework as embodied in the Industrial Training Act, 1967, is outmoded. It is based on the concept of designating sectors, establishing statutory industrial training committees to oversee training in these sectors and imposing sectoral levies to fund that training. This framework is increasingly at odds with the developments I have described. It is too rigid. It ignores intersectoral and value chain linkages, which are increasingly important to competitiveness, and it creates an artificial distinction between firm specific and sector specific assist<Col N="1516" /> ance. It is too focused on manufacturing to the detriment of the services sector. In terms of finance, the system of sectoral and apprenticeship levies reflects many of these flaws and does not provide an appropriate funding base for training. We, therefore, need new funding mechanisms and new structures, which must be flexible, responsive and client friendly. The Bill provides an essential statutory underpinning for this new approach.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the principal features of the Bill. Its main purpose is to establish the national training fund and consequent national training levy. The fund will finance a range of schemes aimed at raising the skills of those in employment; providing training for those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment and providing information on existing and likely future skills needs in the economy.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the payment by employers of a levy equivalent to 0.7% of the reckonable earnings of employees insured for the purposes of social welfare legislation under Class A, with the exception of community employment participants, and Class H employments. There will be no additional financial imposition on employers as the cost of the levy will be offset by a comparable cut in employers PRSI contributions. This cut will be effected by a ministerial order which will be brought forward by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to coincide with the introduction of the national training fund levy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment of the national training fund. The fund will operate a current account and an investment account. Any moneys which are not required to meet current expenditure will be transferred to the investment account and may be transferred back to the current account as required. The Bill will thus provide a ring-fenced source of funds for training. This section also provides for the Exchequer to make contributions to the fund, if required.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the imposition of the national training fund levy on employers in respect of relevant employees. Section 4 provides that the rate of the levy payable by the employer will be 0.7% of the reckonable earnings of relevant employees, subject to the ceilings which apply for payment of employers PRSI contributions and certain exemptions. This section also provides for the payment by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs of a sum of £120 million from the social insurance fund to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for 2000 to take account of the fact that those training schemes falling within the ambit of the fund's purposes have already been subvented by the Exchequer this year. The section also provides for funds from the former levy grant schemes which are now held by FÁS to be transferred to the national training fund.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the collection of the levy. The sums collected will be transferred to the social insurance fund in the first instance and <Col N="1517" /> from there to the national training fund. Section 6 provides that the Revenue Commissioners may supply information regarding reckonable earnings of persons in respect of whom the levy is payable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the basis for making payments from the fund. It provides for payments to be made from the fund for schemes meeting the purposes I have described. The section also provides that a wide range of schemes may be subvented by the fund. As regards the selection of schemes to be funded, this will be determined by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I described a number of key areas such as apprenticeship, skills training for unemployed persons and those outside the labour force, in-company training and lifelong learning which need concerted and sustained attention. All these areas will fall within the ambit of the national training fund. The moneys to be allocated to particular schemes will be determined with the consent of the Minister for Finance in tandem with the annual Estimates process. This is essential given that many of the organisations subvented by the fund will also be in receipt of Exchequer funding. I have also provided in the section for consultation with representatives of employers and employees in relation to the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for penalties for specified offences under the Bill. Section 9 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and the entire Industrial Training (Apprenticeship Levy) Act, 1994. The principal items covered are the repeal of the statutory provisions covering the former apprenticeship and sectoral levies which were suspended in 2000 in anticipation of the introduction of the national training fund levy and those providing for the establishment and operation of the statutory industrial training committees which were integrally linked to the sectoral levy grant schemes. The remaining sections are standard provisions.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of the competitiveness game are now well established. Increasingly, the issue is not about whether we are in the right ball park, but rather how skilfully we play the game. Our match fitness depends on the quality of our human resources and the developmental opportunities we can offer our people, whether they are entering the labour market for the first time, seeking to return to work or change career, or simply to advance within their chosen occupation.</P>
    <P>We have made enormous strides at the level of competitiveness and social inclusion. We have achieved this in large part through investing in skills, especially in the initial education and training area. We need to take a broader approach, one which looks to the future and ensures the skills base we have built is maintained and upgraded to meet the challenges to come. The National Training Fund Bill and the policy approach I have outlined provide for precisely such an approach. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1518" />
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and, with a few possible exceptions, the Bill, which provides for the establishment of a national training fund and an associated levy as announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2000. At this juncture in our development as a nation, the issue of training and retraining is of crucial importance to our future and the lives of so many of our citizens who, for one reason or other, are finding that it is not always possible to remain in the same employment for an entire working life.</P>
      <P>The fund is intended to finance a range of schemes aimed at raising the skills of those in employment and providing training for those who wish to acquire skills for the purposes of taking up employment. I take it that the latter is intended to cover those transferring from one employment to another and those who, through force of necessity, need other employment because of displacement arising from companies going into liquidation or other reasons.</P>
      <P>Increasingly, training and upskilling of the workforce is of fundamental importance. It is incumbent on us to have all the proper structures in place to meet the needs of all such persons as well as those of the unemployed who need to be brought back into the workforce at the earliest opportunity. We must also ensure those in jobs with short-term viability are not overlooked and have access to proper facilities for retraining to enable them to return to the workforce quickly. We all appreciate the need for a concerted and focused approach across the economy to industrial training.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that manufacturing remains critically important. This area will present a serious challenge in the future. In focusing on manufacturing there is a necessity to ensure a balance in terms of providing people with the necessary manufacturing and service skills. When dealing with human resources we must not lose sight of the need to ensure a good quality of life. We must focus not only on the companies and their requirements but also on individuals to find out how they can best benefit from additional training and investment in this area. We must not consider things solely from the point of view of enterprise but ensure that people have the necessary skills to take up employment and that the employment is secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of our economic success has been due to our well educated workforce and the talented people who are available to take up employment opportunities. However, labour shortages are a great threat to our continued success in many areas. Firms are reporting vacancy rates of approximately 10% across all grades, the highest being in the IT sector where the vacancy rate is approximately 15%. This clearly points to the need to improve our capacity to upgrade the skills of people in the workforce and to enable people who are temporarily displaced quickly to relocate within the workforce. We should also do more to bring home our educated emigrants who could <Col N="1519" /> take up employment in areas where shortages have arisen.</P>
    <P>The greatest barrier to our emigrants is the inability to purchase a new home when relocating. If we are serious about attracting people back to this country, more will have to be done to assist them in relocating. I recently encountered the case of an eminent individual from the Munster area who has worked successfully in Canada for a few years and wanted to relocate to Ireland. Suitable well paid positions are available and have been recently advertised by some health boards. This man lives in comfortable accommodation in Canada but when he contacted me he discovered to his shock and horror how much house prices in Ireland had increased. It is a sad situation. Much as he and his family would like to relocate here, they are financially precluded from doing so. More attention will have to be paid to this problem. The Government hopes that the Bacon reports and its recent decisions will improve the situation, but that improvement has not yet occurred.</P>
    <P>The Chamber of Commerce of Ireland's recent survey highlighting the fact that 56% of companies have no staff training budget must give rise to serious concern. Employers must become more conscious of the importance of investing in the development of their workforces' skills, an important area to have been overlooked. No doubt many employers are looking to this fund to provide that investment. Employers must be prepared to invest in their employees and to develop human resources skills. A determined effort is required to ensure that they buy into this programme.</P>
    <P>Sadly, 25% of our population have poor literacy skills. The Tánaiste spoke about shifting from bricks to clicks, but unfortunately a large proportion of the population will find it difficult to make such a transition in terms of basic reading or computer skills. Low levels of literacy undoubtedly affect performance and unless tackled will continue to hamper our economic productivity.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill is a source of concern. It proposes the abolition of many of the existing training arrangements, particularly the statutory industrial training committees. It is believed that this has fundamental implications for the construction industry at a time when Government Ministers are expressing concern about the capacity of the industry to deliver the national development plan. Major training programmes developed by CITC may be jeopardised. Will the Minister clarify if I am interpreting the section correctly or if I have been misinformed? I have been advised that, following wide consultation, the Construction Industry Federation and construction trade unions are deeply concerned with these developments.</P>
    <P>Given that concern, I intend to put down two amendments to the Bill. One will provide that funds which are committed to existing training <Col N="1520" /> programmes should be held within FÁS and funds required for sectoral training plans where they exist should be ring fenced in the new training fund arrangements. The second will provide that a construction industry training committee will continue to advise the board of FÁS and will retain its structure and partnership nature.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note there will be no additional cost to employers in regard to the levy and that there will be a cut in employers' PRSI contributions. On the Order of Business yesterday I raised the abolition of the ceiling on PRSI contributions provided for in the budget. I understand this is a trade off for corporation tax provisions. Since professionals and professional partnerships do not pay corporation tax, this measure will have a serious effect on recruitment and investment in those areas. I hope the Government will redress that problem in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Tánaiste use the phrase &ldquo;client friendly&rdquo; in regard to the delivery of the schemes and services envisaged in the Bill. Despite the reduction in the number of unemployed, our hearts must go out to people who lose their jobs as a result of companies going into liquidation, particularly people who have worked for the same company for up to 25 years. Suddenly they find that the job they believed to be secure is not secure and that they are obliged to sign on for their weekly benefit.</P>
    <P>Many of them have reported to me that the service is anything but client friendly, particularly in the capital city. These people have been dedicated workers and are imbued with the work ethic. They want to get back into employment but they encounter difficulty in securing retraining. The jobs they lost are no longer available and they cannot get something similar. They might have been in the business for up to 30 years but still feel they have a contribution to make. They want to work and I hope this measure will do something for them. However, I am not sure that it will. How can we improve the flow of information through the employment exchanges to assist these people? At present all they are given are gruff, curt messages when they visit these offices. That is not good enough for the State sector.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response to this debate. We will see what amendments will have to be tabled for tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. Everybody agrees that training and development are most important for the continued success of our economy. Our greatest asset which attracted many businesses to Ireland and contributed to that success is our workforce. We will continue to invest in and develop that workforce. If not, we will be unable to make the grade in the global economy and meet the competitive challenges that face us each day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister addressed a number of important issues. She is well aware of the challenges facing organisations with regard to training. The main <Col N="1521" /> factor is the cost of training. Many people think this involves just the £200 to £400 for the cost of the day's training. In fact it is the cost to the company of allowing the employee to be available for training on that day, the cost of additional cover to ensure the person's job is done and the cost of lost opportunities as a result of people being absent from the workforce during the training period. This has not been recognised in the past by agencies which have provided funding and support to companies which continue to train employees. The real cost of training must be borne in mind when we consider ways of encouraging companies to avail of schemes which may be funded through this measure.</P>
    <P>Training must be practical. Many training courses are up in the air and are not properly evaluated and no practical steps are taken to ensure that the lessons learned during training are put into practice when people return to the workforce. When schemes are being devised, an evaluation and certification process should be built into them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Skillnets initiative which operates throughout the country. The north Mayo Skillnets has identified training needs for all companies in the area, pooled resources and purchased suitable training in bulk for employees in these companies. The Organisation for Women in Business is also benefiting from the Skillnets programme, as are many chambers of commerce throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There has been a long-standing focus on the manufacturing industry in this country and, for many years, there was an unwillingness to deal with the provision of services with the result that we ignored the sector at our peril. I hope the move towards a more client-friendly and flexible training approach will allow those in the service industry to apply to the fund and benefit from it. Technology is changing on a daily basis and it is very important that we retain our competitive advantage to ensure that people keep pace with technological developments.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about unemployment. There are 52,000 short-term unemployed people and 28,000 long-term unemployed people on the live register. One of the greatest challenges facing us is what to do with people who have been out of work for a long time. Such people may feel they are unable to return to the workforce because it might not meet their requirements in terms of salaries, benefits for their families and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployed people require a particular type of training. Before training commences, issues such as confidence building and personal development must be addressed. Companies should be encouraged to take on people who might not initially meet their criteria or who might not be deemed the most &ldquo;desirable&rdquo; type of employee, people who have had difficulties finding work, people from disadvantaged areas or people who may have criminal records and have gone through the probation system. It is very <Col N="1522" /> important that companies are supported if they take a chance in recruiting these people. The fast-track information technology programme, which targeted a range of people in disadvantaged areas, has been very successful in Dublin. Long-term unemployed people have acquired skills which make them very valuable employees capable of commanding large salaries which they previously never imagined they could.</P>
    <P>There must be a one-to-one focus in regard to the training of long-term unemployed people, and the current numbers would allow us to do that. Any agency which is given responsibility for this training, be it FÁS or otherwise, must adopt a supporting and mentoring role. Sending 26 people on a course with a &ldquo;let them make it or break it&rdquo; attitude will not suffice. Training should be followed up on a weekly or daily basis to help people to get through the difficulties they may encounter in the job seeking process. When they encounter problems or disappointments, they should be encouraged to try again.</P>
    <P>The issue of retraining is very important. People do not like change. They are accustomed to doing their jobs in a particular way and find it difficult to adopt new approaches. Initiatives which address the barriers to retraining prior to the commencement of training are very important. Women have had difficulty accessing training for many years. If they want to get on to a FÁS course, they must be on the live register. That barrier must be removed. Women who choose to return to work, having stayed at home to care for their families, must have their confidence and self-esteem restored.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need for flexibility in training and development. Community employment schemes have fulfilled a very important practical and social role in the area of employment. Many people who participate in community employment schemes may not be able to access full-time employment for a myriad of reasons, some of which may relate to their home circumstances. Community employment schemes offer people the opportunity to go out to work for 20 hours per week. Their working hours are generally flexible and the work they do is valuable. We must recognise that community employment schemes are not just about taking people off the live register. They are about giving something back to society and providing people with a mechanism to do that. Although community employment schemes do not represent the way forward, it is important that any future schemes would be based on the community employment scheme model.</P>
    <P>FÁS runs an excellent return to work course throughout the country which offers people an opportunity to return to work on a part-time basis and gain work experience. Many people subsequently move straight into permanent mainstream employment, sometimes on a part-time basis. These courses are particularly suited to women.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> The Minister referred to disability and the need to convince employers that they have a responsibility to work with people with disabilities and to create environments in which such people can work. That would allow people a certain independence in that they would not be dependent on the State for financial support but could earn their own income.</P>
    <P>We also talked about the importance of craft skills, particularly in the context of the national development plan, and the money being invested in our infrastructural development. It is necessary to work on the perception of apprenticeship schemes, crafts and similar skilling to ensure people understand it is as important to qualify as a carpenter, plumber, painter, plasterer or bricklayer as to qualify in IT or engineering. Both parts of the employment spectrum must work together.</P>
    <P>It is important that the process we put in place to allow people access funding should be as unbureaucratic as possible. I have gone through the process of trying to apply for grant aid for training and development courses. The first thing requested on the application form is a training plan. People say they must draw up the training plan before getting access to funding, but this may take up to six months resulting in the application form not being completed and the people not receiving training. One of the greatest difficulties I have found in the past is the bureaucracy and form filling, particularly for small organisations. SMEs will sustain our growth and they have no time to waste on filling forms. They must be able to access money and draw it down as quickly as possible with the least amount of bureaucracy. Our challenge is to put something together, be it a questionnaire type form or whatever, so people are encouraged to access the information.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said she will set up an advisory committee and the list of people she mentioned in terms of consultations is very impressive, including ICTU, IBEC, FÁS, Enterprise Ireland and the chamber of commerce. The one area left out seem to be professionals. It is important that a member of the Irish Institute of Training and Development, the professional body for those involved in the training profession, be nominated to the advisory committee. One of the great things about training and development is the commitment of those involved in the provision of such services. We can only benefit from having their advice in relation to putting together a training and development fund.</P>
    <P>Certification is very important. We should continue to identify ways in which we can develop certification models which are recognised throughout Europe and the world. One fine example of this is the European computer driving licence. When it was launched four and a half years ago nobody knew what it was, but now people have certificates in their offices and course <Col N="1524" /> notes on their desks. Many people have undertaken the training programme. It is very important to identify certification models which are relevant and recognisable within the EU and globally.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill is before us and am hopeful it will pass all Stages by tomorrow. It is very worthwhile and I commend the Minister on her fine work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Ryan. I welcome the Bill and the Minister. I welcome her words, particularly her reference to the &ldquo;challenge of growth&rdquo; as the world has changed dramatically in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste said the 1967 Act is outdated and outmoded, a comment I welcome. All of us, particularly those of us who are employers, recognise the need to invest in training as it pays to do so. Just ten years ago my company opened a shop in Lucan and we had 4,000 applicants for 100 jobs. We had a huge task in selecting 100 people and turning down 3,900 others. Just a couple of months ago we opened a shop in Waterford and had to realise that if we were going to get people to work for us we had to make the job attractive not only in terms of pay, but in terms of a future and a career. This is where training becomes so important.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words of caution and a few words pertaining to opportunity. I had the task of chairing the committee on the leaving certificate applied programme for a number of years and I realised the number of people being left behind in terms of education. We have set a target of 90% of those at school completing their education, which recognises that one in ten will be left behind. We are only achieving a figure of 80%, so two in ten are being left behind. That is why this is an opportunity for those left behind, and the words of the Tánaiste are correct in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about what are perceived as the sexy, attractive, modern jobs, the clicks as against the bricks referred to by the Tánaiste. Senator Cox gave a very good example, through the jobs she has created through ICE, of what can be done by small rather than large businesses. I wish to touch on the other skills which have been undeveloped in the past as they were neither modern nor attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the committee on the leaving certificate applied I took the example of a supermarket manager. Very often they would not have a good leaving certificate and did not pass the academic subjects. If we focus on one particular intelligence, namely that used in communication, the traditional way of judging people and their ability was measuring their ability to communicate in written form only. However, the communication necessary for a supermarket manager, perhaps employing 200 or 300 people with 20,000 <Col N="1525" /> customers and 10,000 products, is largely oral. The amount of written communication is comparatively small. Yet our traditional training and education did not develop oral communication and did not recognise it as a skill. Therefore, very often people failed early in their education and were made feel they were failures. Howard Gardiner talks about seven kinds of intelligence, which are often not recognised in traditional training and education. When a person recognises they have an ability and intelligence which was not previously recognised they grow in confidence.</P>
    <P>Of course, as the Tánaiste said, we need new developments in terms of &ldquo;bricks to clicks&rdquo;, but we will always need the older skills. In my business we will need butchers and bakers and we should not leave them behind. That is why Skillsnet is doing such a good job. We must ensure we do not forget some of the traditional, dull, boring skills and talents which might be regarded as unadventerous.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to one other change which relates to more opportunity, namely, the changes occurring in lifestyles and how we live and develop. Dr. David Robinson, who was in charge of the school of horticulture in Kinsealy, told me that five or six years ago they were approached by a person who wanted to learn and be taught how to develop grass for golf courses. The college asked if this was part of their job and if they should be trying to develop grasses for golf courses. At the highest level they considered whether this was something they should do. Dr. Robinson told me that now 80% of those who attend courses concentrate on horticulture for gardening, including flower gardening, lawns and golf courses. This was not previously regarded as something they should be doing but as something they should turn away from.</P>
    <P>The whole area of food safety involves skill because jobs in kitchens and catering are blossoming and developing so much. Skills in that area are needed and this is an area of training that did not exist some years ago or, if it did, was not regarded as such. I spoke recently to Dr. Patrick Wall who reminded us of the Food Safety Authority and of the need for the skills that exist.</P>
    <P>I read what the Minister said here about enterprise, and my understanding of enterprise is slightly different. My point here is that I do not believe there is a general understanding in the area of training of the need to please the market and get customers to return, of the importance of customers and that, whatever individuals do, they are dependent on customers. This applies not just to business but to every other area. As chairman of a hospital board, I tried to get the hospital to stop referring to patients and to refer to customers instead. There was a reluctance to do that, but hospitals do not succeed unless they recognise that they have customers. I dare say that if teachers cease to recognise that their students are <Col N="1526" /> their customers, they will cease to be needed and they will lose business to somewhere else. Jobs that used to be secure are no longer secure. I remember quoting that there was no concern that did not rely on trying to get the customer to come back again. The only challenge to that was that it was unlikely that the undertaker's customers would come back, but even that did not stand up because the customer is not the deceased but the family of the deceased.</P>
    <P>So I urge that much more attention be given to the marketplace and to the need to recognise that businesses do not stay in existence unless they manage to please their customers. I have been in the grocery business for 40 years and I know of 20 supermarket grocery businesses that have gone out of business, six because they ran short of money and 14 because they ran short of customers. In the training for every single task we must get the message across that staying in business depends on pleasing customers, whether worldwide or across the road in Ireland, because no matter where in the world a business is located it is in competition with businesses in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>On the question of disability, we must not lose confidence and say that somebody who is disabled is unlikely to be suitable for a job. It is possible to find them jobs. In the context of people who did the leaving certificate applied, I found that there were jobs which required the skills they acquired. I remember reading that in Israel it was discovered that there was no part of its land that could not grow some tree so that when it was decided to develop a forestry it was possible to find trees that would grow in almost every part of the country, even the most barren desert. We must search for opportunities for those who have been left behind by society, particularly the disabled.</P>
    <P>A recent advertisement depicted someone who was not disabled looking for a job. He was given the detail in Braille and said he could not read it. Then the same man was shown when he was about to get on a bus only to be told that it was for wheelchairs only. The whole concept was to get it across to us what it is like to be disabled. However, the point I am making is that it is possible to find jobs. Just as the Israelis found trees that would grow on any land, we can find jobs that will fit almost every disability. Our task &ndash; it is mentioned in the Bill but I want to give it prominence &ndash; is to create confidence that jobs can be created for almost every disability. That needs commitment and dedication, and it needs a belief that we can actually achieve it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity it affords. I particularly recognise that it is a change from the 1967 Act, a change about which Senator Coghlan spoke. Every business, when it starts, believes its people are its best asset and investing in people will show a return. This Bill recognises <Col N="1527" /> that and encourages every organisation, not just commercial ones, to invest in training because it will pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is welcome. It is always welcome to find imagination in play and that we are beginning to respond to the way we are because there is great inertia in much of the State sector, which seems still transfixed by the problems of the 1980s and has not yet adjusted to the realities. The Minister referred to what classical economists would call full employment. I have a very simple view. I regard full employment as a situation where there is nobody in the jobs market who cannot get a job that pays them a reasonable wage. We are not quite there yet and there is fairly good evidence that there is still a large sector of society where the minimum wage is the going rate. That suggests that there is a significant residue of underemployment, if not actual unemployment.</P>
      <P>I want to sound a note of caution and probably provoke Senator Cox in the process, but it would not be the first time. We need to be wary of a culture of corporate welfare in our society. One of the great undiscussed topics in the United States is the scale of breaks, supports etc. for the corporate sector, none of which is evaluated in terms of the contribution they make to what they are allegedly helping. I have no problem with fostering an enterprise culture, provided what we get is real enterprise, not simply a tolerance of a fairly vulgar kind of accumulation of wealth. I understand an enterprise culture to mean a culture which fosters and encourages imagination, creativity and genuine risk taking. To classify as entrepreneurs people who have made money and have used it to invest in property is to turn the concept on its head. People who have an idea in the area the Minister classified as high tech &ndash; chemicals, computers, IT and areas like that &ndash; and turn a good idea into a commercial reality are of course genuine entrepreneurs. However, we should be very careful not to confuse the two because if we do we are likely to devalue the concept of enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a delicious irony in this Bill. The idea of raising a levy from employers to fund training to ensure that those whom the market would leave out of the jobs market can reinsert themselves into the market is a wonderfully interventionist concept, and to the degree that it is that, it is a classical act of labour market intervention of the well-honed Scandinavian variety which has been so successful in the countries of northern Europe. It is a classic example of the need to get away from the idea that growth and development are synonymous. What we can do with growth is what gives us development, and what we do not do with growth can seriously hinder development. <i>Per capita</i> GDP has been mis<Col N="1528" /> takenly used by commentators and sometimes even by political figures to mean the same thing as standard of living or standard of life, but it is not so.<i> Per capita </i>GDP is a necessary condition for a good quality of life but it is not the same thing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the country which perhaps would be regarded as putting the heaviest emphasis on intervention through taxation, policy and a chapter of rights is Sweden. In terms of its taxation system, the fact that almost 90% of its workforce is unionised and that the workforce has considerable co-determination rights in terms of industrial development would be regarded by many in this country as anathema and undermining our global competitiveness, although I have some difficulties with the concept of national competitiveness. There are perfectly respectable economists in the world, among them Paul Krugman from MIT, who said that the idea of national competitiveness is a nonsense, and to a degree I agree with him.</P>
    <P>What is interesting in terms of the whole idea of the global marketplace and mobile direct investment is that we have been very successful at attracting foreign direct investment. It represented 20% of our gross domestic product in 1999 but we are not the most successful at attracting foreign direct investment. The most successful country at attracting foreign direct investment in 1999 was Sweden, which attracted foreign direct investment equivalent to 25%, or $65 billion, of its gross domestic product. The reason the figures do not look so big if they are done quickly is that Sweden also engages in a lot of overseas investment.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that policies like this, as is stated here, are interventionist on behalf of people whose skills are deficient, and therefore they are welcome, but we have to remember that this is an intervention on behalf of those people. The fact that this intervention provides a service to industry is subsidiary to that. It may well be that the greater proportion of the investment should go not to the people whom industry would most enthusiastically wish for because of their high quality skills, but to the people who are most marginalised because of life tragedies, handicap or whatever. We have to continue to focus on that. This legislation is about training people to enable them to have a fuller life. It is not about filling gaps in the labour market. That is not an unimportant issue but at this stage of the country's development, the most fundamental requirement is to make the current prosperity a part of everybody's life, particularly the 15% to 20% of our population who have seen very little of it. Many of those are among the unemployed, poorly skilled and insecure and, therefore, the working out of this proposal will be important.</P>
    <P>There are issues to do with training that we seem to be reluctant to deal with. I am thinking <Col N="1529" /> in particular of the extraordinarily inadequate level of in-service training available to the teaching profession. It is poorly funded and the Department of Education and Science's simple way of dealing with the issue is to give people days off to compensate them for the time they spend training during their holidays whereas it would be much simpler to pay people to do this training and not leave gaps in the timetable as a consequence of retraining. Training is very limited. In my own sector, the technological sector of third level education, there is virtually no training for the people who teach in that sector of education. The people arrive on a Friday or a Monday, they are presented with a timetable and they start teaching.</P>
    <P>There are limited opportunities for skills renewal within the third level sector of education. Universities have a tradition of sabbaticals but that tradition does not exist in the sector of education in which I am involved. Anything one learns is largely self-taught. My acquaintance with information technology is entirely self-taught and the gaps in that probably show up from time to time.</P>
    <P>The American Board of Engineering and Training &ndash; ABET &ndash; has produced a new set of criteria for evaluating engineering courses in American universities. ABET identified three requirements for an engineer. The first is knowledge, the second is skill and the third is a correct set of values and attitudes. Our training programmes, whether they are for craft or high level technological skills, should not neglect any of those three requirements. People must have knowledge and skill but they must also have the values and attitudes that will enable them to relearn and to do the sort of things about which Senator Quinn spoke. They need to have an attitude to customers whether they be in education or in the provision of plumbing services, which is based on the idea that what one is actually doing is providing a service. If any of those three is to be left out, there will be people in the world who are inadequately trained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this legislation which again is indicative of the economic progress this country has been making. The main thrust of the Bill, as outlined by the Minister and a number of speakers, is to ensure that a sum of money will be set aside for education and training leading to job opportunities and that this money, which is an important element of the Bill, will be ring-fenced to ensure that there is a continuing source of resources for an area which has been severely under-resourced. Indeed, all of the reports that emanated from various Departments and working groups in the area of skills and labour shortages pointed to the lack of resources. The Bill goes a long way towards addressing that lack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> It is important to put in context exactly where we are now. The ESRI medium-term review forecasts the economy growing at 5.1% on average from now until the year 2005 and that employment in real terms will grow at the rate of 2.1%. These figures indicate that it will increase by 176,000 and that the overall participation rate, keeping in mind the projected growth figures, will have to increase from the current 58.9% to 61% by the year 2005 to match the forecast employment expansion figures.</P>
    <P>It is interesting in the context of the ESRI medium-term forecasts and in light of all the discussions about immigration policy and Ireland becoming a multi-cultural society and various Government Ministers, not least the Tánaiste, encouraging people from other countries to apply for both short-term and long-term work permits here, that all that would be required to meet these forecasts would be a very modest increase in worker participation from that figure of 58.9%. In other words, a 2% increase in participation rates in the employment sector in Ireland could address the employment needs to the year 2005. If these figures are exceeded, and on the basis of the growth rates Ireland has been experiencing over the past number of years that is possible, one then has to look at a higher participation rate but even if the growth rate increased by an extra 1% or 2% to 6% or possibly 7%, the participation rates would increase proportionately by another 1% or 2%, which is not unachievable.</P>
    <P>I am highlighting these figures because we sometimes get lost in a fog of statistics and concerns expressed by employers and other groups that somehow Ireland's economic miracle cannot or will not be sustained without large scale immigration, but the figures point to a different interpretation. They show that if there are specific measures targeted at specific groups in this country, in the short term at least we would be able to live with the expected growth figures as forecast by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>This brings me to an issue which arises in the context of my membership of the National Economic and Social Forum, of which Senator Cox is also a member. I have with me the forum's latest report, Report No. 19, Alleviating Labour Shortages, which I am sure the Minister and her colleagues have burned the midnight oil poring over. The labour shortages group toiled long and hard with our social partners for nine months to produce this report. In fairness to them, Departments take the forum's recommendations seriously and I hope they will look at the detail of this report. I wish to allude to some of its recommendations on the issue we are debating.</P>
    <P>The least skilled, which is what the legislation is primarily about, obviously need the benefits of this fund. This category includes the approximately 76,000 people who are long-term unemployed. I support the statement in the report that <Col N="1531" /> the challenge is to ensure that priority is given to addressing the education and training needs of the least skilled, regardless of their current employment or social status. It goes on to say that the second complementary approach is to make work pay at the lower end of the labour market through the development of a number of recommendations, such as a minimum wage, targeted tax relief, in-work benefits and other welfare to work policies.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Finance who indicated that, notwithstanding the initiatives included in the budget, he will increase the amount of take-home pay at the lower end of the scale in the next budget, which will result in yet another significant cohort of the lower paid being taken out of the tax net. However, this noble aspiration must be balanced with the possibility that for some people this might become a disincentive to work. The devil is in the detail, so to speak, in trying to reconcile those two areas.</P>
    <P>Anecdotal and statistical evidence will back up the assertion that the overwhelming majority of people who are unemployed wish to return to the workforce and are looking for a job. If one needed proof of this one has only to read the excellent series of reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlighted the plight of individuals who are trying to find work. This is a salutary reminder to those who think that the long-term unemployed are lazy or not interested in finding work in our booming economy. The simple fact is that there is a variety of reasons people who are long-term unemployed or out of work for a period of time are unable to find work.</P>
    <P>The story about the gentleman from County Cavan who has had 40-50 interviews is a typical example of what is happening throughout the Border counties and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt's county. It is not that the work is not there; it is there but if one is far removed from it and does not have public transport, then one cannot find a job. Is it seriously suggested that a person who lives 20 miles from the nearest growth centre where there are jobs but no public transport should take a taxi to and from work? What is a person who lives in one of the least populated areas in the west, north-west and Border counties, where there is a high proportion of the unemployed and no complementary jobs, to do? Is it being inferred that a secret protocol written by the Government suggests we all should move to Dublin and the east coast? This is not the case as the Government is committed to decentralisation not only in terms of State jobs but also in its industrial strategy. The reality of Objective One bears this out.</P>
    <P>There are very real problems in my constituency and in the least populated areas. These problems have not been adequately addressed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and <Col N="1532" /> Employment which has taken a global view of the issue and looked at the figures nationally. I know from discussions with officials on the forum that there is a belated acknowledgment that there is a need to be more targeted and focused when addressing issues relating to long-term unemployment. These issues include rural transport initiatives, the provision of jobs within a certain catchment area which allow them to work and up-skilling of the people in those areas where there have not been job opportunities traditionally so that they can adapt. The Department must keep in mind those issues as they relate to rural Ireland. There is a need to refocus policies to address those who live and work in areas of severe disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister looks at those areas outlined in the forum's Report No. 19, Alleviating Labour Shortages, as they relate to her Department and act on its recommendations. These recommendations were arrived at following a consensus approach by the social partners and parliamentary representatives over a period of nine months. We worked as a team and believe that this report will go some way to addressing the skills shortages.</P>
    <P>I ask the Department to back off from terminating community employment schemes in rural areas where people in the 40-60 age group do not have the job opportunities being talked about at national level. The Department must recognise that there are two Irelands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of grave concern that a covert attempt is being made to terminate community employment schemes even though there may be no jobs available. What will happen to a farmer who is trying to keep his farm going and working on a community employment scheme, which in the main is about urban enhancement and improving towns and villages, when he has to come off the scheme? If he cannot find a job he will go back on the dole and sit in his house in isolation, loneliness and semi-misery and have no incentive to get up in the morning to look at a bleak landscape. It is time Dublin officials realised that there are two Irelands and acknowledged the other Ireland to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I almost clapped when Senator Mooney referred to the need for the Department to be careful about cancelling community employment schemes. These schemes are important not only in rural areas but also in urban areas. In addition to the employment given, we must remember that most of the people employed under community employment schemes have a good local knowledge and they frequently make a contribution to the scheme <Col N="1533" /> which someone from outside the area may not be able to make.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and am delighted at the interest in this debate which deals with one of the most important issues facing us. There is a huge need for people to upgrade their skills. We are in a time of lifelong learning and regardless of what field one is in, one will have to spend a good deal of time learning new techniques, languages and ways of managing and dealing with new technology. It is important for us all to recognise that the training we received in our 20s does not mean we can stop learning; rather we must keep enhancing our skills.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Cox refer to the need to encourage women to re-enter the workforce and to provide retraining for them. There is a huge demand for women returnees. This is why I get rather depressed when I see a division between women who are in the workplace and those at home because these situations are interchangeable at budget time. A woman can spend part of her life in the home and the rest of her time in the workforce. If women are like me then they will spend a great deal of their lives in both places. The work issue should not divide women. It is most important that we encourage all women to upgrade their skills no matter where they live.</P>
      <P>I am the president of Cherish and I want to address the issue of single mothers. FÁS, teachers in the VEC and various health board officials have done incredible work. They have been most helpful in encouraging single mothers to upgrade their skills and to join the workforce.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many Members have seen the interesting report called Towards a Fairer Future for Women in Education and Employment. This report was produced following a conference on the NOW strand of the European Social Fund in Scotland earlier this year. It contains a very interesting paper on the different levels of employment of single mothers in Scotland and France. The heading of the paper is Benefits, Scroungers or Victims of Social Exclusion? Working Lone Mothers, a Comparative Study Between France and Scotland. It is very interesting that only 15% of lone mothers work in paid employment in Scotland and it is as much as 85% in France. Only 11% of lone mothers in France depend solely on benefits. That is incredible. It becomes more understandable when you look at the different policies in the United Kingdom and France regarding children and families. I cannot give the figures for Ireland because we do not have them. I wonder is the situation better here than in Scotland. I doubt that it is. The figures suggest that there are far fewer lone mothers than married mothers in the workforce. It is quite incredible to think that the women who need money the most to secure the future of their children cannot get out to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> For the past number of years Cherish, with the support of Dublin VEC and what used to be called the Eastern Health Board, has run computer courses for single mothers. I cannot describe its success. Our courses cater for between ten and 12 mothers at one time. One of the important things about these courses is that these young mothers can avail of our crèche facilities.</P>
    <P>The lack of child care facilities prohibits women from going into the workforce. I was one of the people who was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not do more for this area in the budget. I know he will introduce crèche facilities for civil servants. This measure is very welcome. He also gave financial support for crèches. I was very disappointed that tax relief was not given for employing people who work in child care or on receipts for children left in a crèche. In France there is total tax relief given on this expenditure. Single mothers can only get £50 of their child care bill taken into account here. When they want to go on a course they cannot get child care for £50. We should not be too specific on these areas, especially when we are trying to encourage people to join training courses. If a woman pays her mother £30 per week to mind her child then it is essential to get on a training course. Unfortunately, there is no relief for this expense.</P>
    <P>Many courses are full-time and this is another difficulty. We should promote part-time courses for women. Perhaps it would be easier for men to attend such courses. They would also suit long-term unemployed people. We should not underestimate the strain of trying to get back into training or work full-time when you have not been used to a formal timetable for many years. It is important to give people credit for good time keeping and I have always tried to do this on the courses run by Cherish.</P>
    <P>Transport is another problem for people on training courses. Senator Mooney mentioned the cost of rural transport but urban transport is also very dear. We should examine this issue. For the duration of a training course people should be given travel passes. The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, will introduce the integrated ticketing system. It would not be as difficult as we think to introduce a scheme for people on training courses.</P>
    <P>We need to remove everything that makes it difficult for people to avail of training courses. FÁS is going further to find people who, at one stage, would not have been considered for training courses. It is getting hold of these people and it encourages them to take up courses. This move has been most important. A very large number of single mothers and the long-term unemployed think of themselves as having failed in many ways. They think they have failed society and themselves. One of the important aspects of these <Col N="1535" /> courses, and Senator Cox mentioned this as well, is to give people confidence and help them get back in the workforce. That is where we want them to be but we also need them to be there nowadays.</P>
    <P>I would have liked the taxation threshold raised to the minimum income level in the budget so that it appeared worthwhile for people to go back to work. It is interesting in the French survey I quoted that even though they have the most generous benefits for women who stay at home, a very high proportion of them are in work. A salary is provided for a certain number of years and additional benefits are provided if a woman has four or more children. Their benefits are good yet people still have opportunities to get into the workforce and child care facilities are available. On site crèches are very important to women with very young children and they help women to join the workforce.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the importance of encouraging people with various disabilities. Disability can be seen and unseen. I am delighted the Equality Agency has been set up and that equality legislation has been introduced. This must mean that people with disabilities will have a better chance of being involved in the workforce and training schemes. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, to the House. I also welcome the provisions of this Bill. It is a timely measure. It is an excellent idea that a certain sum of money will be ring-fenced for training and done in perpetuity. The sum mentioned is 0.7% of reckonable income of every worker here.</P>
      <P>This Bill is timely because there is a glaring need for training off-the-job for such people as the 27,000 long-term unemployed. If we are to have any kind of equality of opportunity here there is a grave need to direct training at that cohort of people. A sizeable proportion of women could do with the training mentioned by Senator Cox and vocational training. She mentioned training in self-confidence and social skills. These courses would improve their talents and potential, enable them to develop their potential and bring them into the workforce.</P>
      <P>There are people with disability who have enormous potential and a great deal to offer. They could be put in a position to offer that if they were given the relevant training. Former prisoners, particularly people who served prison sentences when they were very young, go out in the world with a remarkably low level of preparedness to earn a living or take their place in society. Everyone needs on-the-job training, not just those in the categories I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently attended a talk on what the world <Col N="1536" /> will be like 20 years hence and the speaker said that 20% of the jobs that will be on offer then have not yet been invented. The only way we can even attempt to educate and train people for jobs that have not been invented is to provide good, basic education and training and, above all, cultivate the will in them to be lifelong learners so that they will constantly update and upgrade their skills. It is critically important that that is built into our education system from infancy so that children are taught how to become the architects of their own learning and that learning is a lifelong pursuit so that they are open to learning new skills and techniques at any time during their lives.</P>
    <P>Modern employers seek people who have a range of skills that were not greatly valued when I entered the labour market a long time ago. They must have a good standard of education, the capacity to be decision makers, the ability to collaborate with colleagues in a team environment and be able to think on their feet. Those skills need to be built into the education system and training programmes <i>ab initio</i>. It is a different world now.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that 20% of the jobs have not yet been invented. When I finished my training to be a primary school teacher it was the practice the night before one left college to throw all one's books into the River Shannon. That was the end of one's learning because one knew it all. Times have changed and that is now the beginning of people's learning. That is the attitude that must be incorporated into the thinking of both employers and employees.</P>
    <P>Overseas employers have a much more open attitude to providing good on-the-job training than indigenous employers and that must be rectified. We must begin to preach the philosophy of lifelong learning and to recognise education as more that just a vehicle to pass on a body of knowledge. The education system must, as Senator Ryan said, pass on skills and values to students so that in the post-school world they have the attitude and approach to make things happen and get things done, can be the architects of their own training and have a spirit of enterprise and entrepreneurship.</P>
    <P>I regret that was not always a feature of the education system. It is so heavily State examinations-based that it does not always train young people to evaluate their progress and reflect on their own learning. It is a great pity that such evaluation is done through State examinations. Young people from the outset must develop the mentality to evaluate their progress and learning mechanisms. That is the only way they will be prepared for the world where 20% of jobs have not yet been invented.</P>
    <P>We are living in the world of obsolescence and jobs will also be obsolescent. There is great potential for developing employment oppor<Col N="1537" /> tunities. The film industry is underdeveloped for a number of reasons. The primary reason is that sufficient technicians, backroom people, cameramen and so on have not been trained. We are natural storytellers and, therefore, we are good at scriptwriting, although some training is involved in translating the written word on to the film screen. Ireland has certain raw materials which would enable it to become a major player in the world of film production, but training programmes and facilities for those involved in the technical aspect of the film process are sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>The conditions where women can go to work in larger numbers have not been fully created. I agree with everything that has been said in this regard but it is not enough to make financial provision because other provisions must be made in parallel. Our attitude to the workplace must change. A great deal of work in the new economy can take place in the home. A city crippled by congestion, in which people travel to work, school, shops and businesses at the same time, should seek to explore and exploit that opportunity.</P>
    <P>We must explore the possibilities of enabling women to work at home and-or to work part-time to facilitate those who want to strike a decent balance between looking after their children and homes and engaging in economic activity. The provision of career breaks, part-time work and other flexibilities is related to attitude. Sometimes employers are afraid to let go. A certain security attaches to retaining a person in a position who held the same position ten years previously. However, we must get over the insecurity which breeds such an attitude. That is related to training employers to recognise these new possibilities.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to put up the money, although it is a major initial step. Providing investment so that there is no direct cost to the employer is a huge bonus, but more needs to be done. The mindset of certain employers who do not recognise the value of human resources or the value of providing ongoing on-the-job training to their employees must change. I hope that will happen in a more accelerated manner when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, in which I took an interest from the time it was published. For many years I have worked with the unemployed, those who are not capable of being contained in the classroom and those who have dropped out of the education system. A national training fund to support a range of training schemes is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is experiencing major economic growth and is on the verge of full employment. Increased resources are available and skills have improved, yet, according to the Minister, there are still 52,000 short-<Col N="1538" /> term unemployed, 28,000 long-term unemployed and 60,000 people marginally attached to the workforce. The phrase &ldquo;marginally attached&rdquo; concerns me because it must be asked if they are employed or unemployed. I could speak at length about this sector because it comprises young people, about whom I will speak more than about the adult population, who never make it in the classroom, who always fall behind, who do not want to be in school, who are not academically inclined and who do not fit into a classroom structure. They often get lost in the process and they should be identified early on and given training of some type in any apprenticeships which may be suited to their natural environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about early intervention and that is the key. It should not be too difficult to identify the people concerned. We are nearly at full employment. I was working in the system when there was colossal unemployment and, as a career guidance counsellor, I was well able to identify them in my school and was well able to link up with FÁS and employers to determine how best to find courses for these young people and steer them in the direction where square pegs would be put into square holes and not into round holes.</P>
    <P>There are sufficient opportunities for each young person to work and to achieve his or her full potential. It should not be difficult to identify those most in need and steer them in the right direction. It does not always concern money but involves targeting the schemes which will work. I am more concerned about the implementation of the measures. The concept is excellent but it is a question of how it will be implemented in the day to day running of schemes.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the role of FÁS in this. One area which was always a major concern of mine was apprenticeship schemes. No matter what system has been introduced, it has not worked very well. Employers do not want to release young trainees back to the training schools, be they FÁS, vocational schools or whatever education course they undergo as their off the job education. Employers often cannot release them because they have no one to replace them. I would like this to be streamlined.</P>
    <P>The national fund is a golden opportunity to allow us to say to employers that it will not cost them money to release apprentices. Streamlining the apprenticeship scheme in that way would be a worthwhile project to undertake. The fund also offers an opportunity to tap into the resource of the many young females and the many adult females between 45 and 64; the Minister also referred to that.</P>
    <P>This is a new approach and scheme of initiatives which will help identify those who have not found themselves. How to help them find themselves is a role which will be shared between two institutions. One is lifelong learning through the education system, a concept which has been <Col N="1539" /> incorporated in the White Paper on adult education launched some time ago. This is a golden opportunity to examine possibilities for the adult population which has become unemployed and needs changes in skills to obtain employment again. Opportunities exist through the adult education system, the vocational schools and the technical colleges which do superb work in reskilling people who find themselves made redundant.</P>
    <P>A very important point is how we go about bringing those people back into the marketable world because their confidence is destroyed if they are made redundant. Their confidence takes a nosedive to the extent that they are not able to cope with re-entering the workforce. It is more than training them in a skill; it also involves training them as people.</P>
    <P>There is a role in this for careers guidance people who perhaps are not in the education world but who could link in with FÁS which I know has opened its doors to employ careers guidance people. These are people who know how to deal with personalities and do not just give guidance. It is a type of counselling service. It is a case of knowing how to empathise with people who find themselves in the position where they are not employable. Careers guidance counsellors have the necessary skills to bring them into the system. It is a matter of telling them what courses suit them and knowing how to design a course when one knows one's population.</P>
    <P>Several issues are involved in this which must be taken into account if this fund is to operate properly. It is a great idea. There is a target, the numbers are small and it should be possible to identify that target and find the right professionals who will pinpoint the people who are unemployed or who are not capable of being educated and who need training. It is then a question of putting the right courses together, the content of which must also match the type of people. Otherwise, good money will be thrown after bad.</P>
    <P>Many issues are involved which, when the concept of the training fund is being implemented, I hope will be taken into account so that the money invested will be well spent. Those who are marginally attached or long-term or short-term unemployed will each require a different type of course or training scheme and it will then be a case of identifying what they are good at. They might be very good at a specific craft and it is a question of identifying that for them so that they will do the right type of course which will give them the motivation and incentive to re-enter the marketplace. If we do that, we will have used the taxpayers' money very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate. I have found it very helpful and the Bill has been <Col N="1540" /> warmly welcomed across party lines. I welcome the support of the House, and the views Senators put forward reflect the shared concern that we must do more to promote training, upskilling and human resource development generally. I wish to refer to some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan referred to vacancy rates. While outside the direct scope of the Bill, my Department is making concerted efforts to improve skills supplies from overseas, as the Senator will be aware. I refer to the Jobs Ireland campaign operated by FÁS which targets specific skills and locations where people may be interested in relocating to Ireland. The Senator will be aware of the various parts of the world the FÁS personnel have visited. I visited one such area in Birmingham recently and the interest was enormous. It is a good idea.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, we continuously monitor the scheme and it is correct we should do so in the context of the vacancies. People often make the point that we must ensure the concerns of those on the unemployment list are met and that the issues raised by Senator Ormonde and others are catered for by the agencies. That is a valid point. In excess of 16,000 work permits have been issued this year to fill identified skills gaps. In addition, the expert group on future skills needs continues to research our future skills requirements.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan also referred to a preventative approach and I support that. He mentioned the case of unemployed people interfacing with the training system via the social welfare system. Under European employment guidelines, there is close co-ordination between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Young people and adults who have been unemployed for more than six months and nine months, respectively, are referred to FÁS where they are interviewed to establish their development needs. They are then offered job interviews, training or other employment opportunities. This approach has contributed significantly to the reduction in unemployment. Senator Ormonde also referred to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry was mentioned in the context of the decision to dissolve the existing industrial training committees. This issue was raised with me yesterday when I attended a CIF review of health and safety. My Department is working intensively with the construction industry under the aegis of the expert group on future skills needs. A sub-group chaired by my Department is looking at future apprenticeship requirements and the need for professional and technical skills. The issue of apprenticeship training was referred to in particular by Senator Ormonde. There is no doubt that this is the best way forward. I am convinced that we need to be focused and get it right. The construction industry is a case in point. The Department proposes to review <Col N="1541" /> the existing scheme funded by the surplus levies during 2001. There is no threat to schemes which can demonstrate their effectiveness. That will be our approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox mentioned the issue of bureaucracy and the difficulties encountered by small firms in developing training plans. While we are receptive to their concerns, equally we need to ensure grant aid leads to a significant shift in the attitude of enterprises to training. The ultimate goal of all grant aid is to ensure firms reach the point where they no longer need or want grant aid. One of the areas we are anxious to develop significantly is the provision of assistance for companies to identify their training needs and plans to address them. An excellent way for firms to move forward in this area is to apply the excellence through people standards operated by FÁS. We intend to develop significantly excellence through people in the context of the national training fund. It is a scheme on which I have worked closely with FÁS and one I strongly commend.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned corporate welfare. The Minister spoke extensively in the Dáil on the need to eliminate rent seeking and lay down guidelines which will apply to grant aid under the national training fund. My comments on Senator Cox's intervention reflect this.</P>
    <P>Senators Ormonde and Ryan raised the question of social inclusion. There will be a strong focus on tackling social exclusion through upskilling. There will be a balance in the activities of the fund in terms of training for those in employment and those outside the labour force.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the comments of Senator Quinn on the importance of change. He referred to the lack of focus on communication skills, for example. He also spoke about food safety. Skills such as these are being addressed through Skillnets. It is by funding initiatives such as this under the national training fund that we can ensure all skills required in the economy are addressed. The Senator also correctly highlighted the importance of customers. The approach taken by the Department in opening dialogue with customers on training policy is an indication of our seriousness in this area. We will continue this approach through the proposed advisory committee. The Senator also mentioned the need to provide employment opportunities for people with disabilities. I acknowledge his commitment to people with disabilities and the role he has played in providing employment opportunities for them. We will focus strongly in coming months on this issue to which many Members of the other House referred in detail during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned regional disparities. There are significant regional disparities in the unemployment rate. The overall development of regional policy is very important. The accelerated development of the national spatial strategy <Col N="1542" /> will be of assistance in this regard. In terms of industrial policy, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are making much more intensive efforts to attract and support projects in the BMW region &ndash; the recent jobs announcement for Longford is a good example of this. The Department will look closely at the NESF report on labour shortages. The Department was represented on the group which oversaw its production.</P>
    <P>Senators Cox and Ormonde, among others, referred to the need to provide return to work courses for women and, in particular, access to FÁS training courses. It is no longer necessary for women to be on the live register to avail of such courses. I understand, however, that the number of training places generally available varies from region to region and priority may be given in some areas to those on the live register. FÁS is working to provide for greater flexibility of attendance at training courses. This should facilitate greater participation by women.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Quill, tomorrow I will introduce new legislation, which has been a long time in preparation, on part-time work. It has been the subject of considerable consultation with the social partners. I strongly support her view and that of Senator Ormonde on lifelong learning. As a former teacher, I fully concur with the view that learning to learn is perhaps the most valuable skill of all. Senator Ormonde also raised the issue of apprenticeship training. She referred in particular to the role of FÁS and the urgent need to focus on the requirement for apprenticeships in the economy. This matter can be dealt with under the national training fund.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate for their support for this legislation. We can now proceed to the next Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is traditionally one of the last items of legislation which the House debates before the Christmas recess. Its core purpose is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply of services, <Col N="1543" /> both current and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill appropriates to the various services listed in the Schedule for the year ending 31 December 2000 the net sum of £16,864,443,000. The total amount comprises the original net Estimates of £16,374,866,000 as approved by the Dáil last June and net Supplementary Estimates totalling £489,577,000 which have been approved by the Dáil in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts amounting to £1,789,557,000 as appropriations-in-aid of the services listed in the Schedule. The Estimates and Supplementary Estimates which are included in the Schedule have been approved by the Dáil and the Bill seeks to give them formal legal effect.</P>
      <P>The debate on the Bill also provides an opportunity to review the budgetary and economic position and, in particular, our economic performance in 2000 when we continued to experience strong economic growth and buoyant public finances. GNP growth in real terms for 2000 is estimated at 8.6%, somewhat higher than the 6.3% originally forecast this time last year. A number of factors have contributed to this strong performance, including a strong international economy, the falling value of the euro and buoyant domestic demand conditions. Economic growth has averaged about 8% since 1993. For the year as a whole, employment is expected to increase by 74,000. This is an increase of 4.5% compared to 1999. In response to the exceptional demand for labour, unemployment is now at an historic low, 3.7% for November compared to an average of 5.5% for 1999.</P>
      <P>Our exceptional economic performance continues to transform our public finances with yet another general Government surplus expected this year of 4.7% of GDP. Furthermore, the general Government debt to GDP ratio continues to fall rapidly and is now projected to fall to 39% for the year 2000. In 1997, this figure was 65%.</P>
      <P>While the economy is in good shape, inflation presents a problem. Last summer the Government introduced measures to address domestically generated inflation and on budget day the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, announced further specific measures. Latest figures show that the Government's measures to control inflation, which has been fueled mainly by external factors, are having an impact. The current published forecast is for inflation to average 5.5% for 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation is estimated to fall in 2001, with an average rate of 4.5% now expected for next year. These forecasts assume that the adverse effects of this year's oil prices and interest rates and of the declining euro will unwind through 2001. These <Col N="1544" /> projections also assume pay moderation within the social partnership framework over the period.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the economy is strong. Real growth in GNP is forecast to slow from an estimated 8.6% this year to an average rate of 6% in 2001 to 2003. Employment growth is expected to moderate from 3.5% in 2000 to an annual average of 2.5% over the period to 2003. Continued significant budgetary surpluses are anticipated in 2001 and beyond, with the debt GDP ratio falling to 24% by 2003. At least 1% of GNP will continue to be allocated to the national pension reserve fund. The amount of the fund already stands at over £5 billion.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, set out some core strategic objectives for this year's budget. The measures he announced will manage the economy to secure our continued success, improve our quality of life, promote a fairer society and reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform. This Government has ensured that its policies continue the disciplined approach to budgetary policy which has contributed to Ireland's exceptional economic performance. To sustain this performance, we must continue with a prudent approach to the public finances in line with the stability and growth pact and within a budgetary framework which enables us to maintain competitiveness. This involves adherence to and implementation of the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the implementation of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>The partnership approach has underpinned the success of the economy since 1987. In a consensus based approach to wage determination covering both the public and private sectors, successive multi-annual agreements have sought to improve the competitiveness of the economy through partnership. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness focuses on the continued competitiveness of Ireland in a global economy and the need for a flexible, dynamic and well educated workforce. It aims to further enhance living standards and reduce social exclusion on a basis that will prove sustainable over the longer term.</P>
    <P>The programme is dynamic and flexible. This has already been tested by the response of the Government and the other social partners who worked within the framework of the new agreement to deal with the difficulties arising from the recent higher than anticipated inflation rate.</P>
    <P>In my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for children, I wish to take this opportunity to mention the recent budgetary measures in relation to children. Recently I published our first national children's strategy which represents a significant advance in the priority afforded to children in public policy. Building on this Government's commitment to the welfare of our children, the measures announced in this year's budget are the largest ever package of sup<Col N="1545" /> ports for children and their parents. It is, in fact, the first children's budget in the history of the State. These measures include significant increases in child benefit rates &ndash; the first step in a three year programme, additional supports for foster parents, including the increase of up to 180% in the allowance payable to foster parents who play a vital role providing a home and support to vulnerable children and the extension of both paid and unpaid maternity and adoptive leave periods.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government has also put in place a wide range of measures to increase the supply of child care places. The national development plan includes £250 million for child care and a further £40 million has recently been added to this. A number of changes to tax law were introduced in recent years to encourage the increased supply of child care facilities. Discussions will take place with employers' bodies on how the rules for existing schemes might be modified to increase the provision of child care facilities at a reasonable tax cost to the Exchequer. We are introducing a major Civil Service child care initiative. A total of £10 million in capital will be provided to allow for 15 Civil Service crèches throughout Ireland over the next two years. It is the Government's intention that these policies, together with those priorities outlined in the national children's strategy, will accelerate the move towards the elimination of child poverty in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will now briefly outline some of the detail of the Appropriation Bill before the House. Section 1 &ndash;  appropriation grants &ndash; gives statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for the supply services, non-capital and capital, including all Supplementary Estimates which were approved by the Dáil since the last Appropriation Act. The Dáil approved the original 2000 net Estimates for departmental expenditure which totalled £16,375 million on 27 June 2000. Since then, the Dáil has approved a number of Supplementary Estimates for various Departments which in total amount to £489 million.</P>
    <P>This extra amount brings the total grant for supply services expenditure in 2000 to £16,864 million. Section 1(1) of the Bill appropriates this total amount of £16,864 million to the various supply services or Departments as listed in the Schedule. In addition, section 1(2) provides for the application of a total amount of £1,789 million in departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the grants for the supply services listed in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I will outline briefly the main factors which have given rise to the additional expenditure and the requirement for the Supplementary Estimates this year. Four Departments accounted for £468 million or 95% of the total Supplementary Estimate of £489 million. The main factors giving rise <Col N="1546" /> to the extra allocations in these areas are as follows.</P>
    <P>An extra net allocation of £192.5 million was granted to the Department of Education and Science. Of this, £88.8 million was needed to cover an expected shortfall in EU receipts in 2000, £37.5 million was granted for early payment of capitation grants to schools, £27.4 million was for additional pension costs, £17 million was provided for additional capital for schools and £10.3 million was for teacher and child care assistant costs. This additional allocation brings the total net 2000 Estimate for the Department to £3,258 million.</P>
    <P>Net additional funds of £121 million were approved for the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Of this, £80 million was provided to accommodate an increase in expenditure which arose because of better than anticipated progress in major road improvements projects together with higher costs. A further £45 million was granted for the water and sewerage services programme, an extra £30 million is being provided to address the funding requirements of local authorities and an additional £23 million is being provided to cover the cost of accommodating asylum seekers. The excesses were partially offset by a £50 million underspend in the local authority and social housing programme due to delays in the regeneration of Ballymun project and savings of £10.6 million due to a slower than anticipated start to the village and urban renewal operational programme under the NDP. This extra funding brings this Department's total net 2000 Estimate to £1,762 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children was granted an additional net £111.5 million. Of this, £46 million was allocated to cover the cost of various pay deals, £41 million was provided for the demand led drug schemes, a further £22 million was needed to cover GMS payments, an extra £21 million was provided to fund PRSI and superannuation costs and £18 million was required for hepatitis C High Court awards payments. These additional costs were partly offset by buoyancy from the health contributions to the Vote. The total net 2000 Estimate for the Department of Health and Children was £3,638 million.</P>
    <P>Net additional funds of £43.2 million were granted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform mainly to provide funding for the buy-out option of the private financing element of the contract for the new Midlands Prison in Portlaoise. This extra allocation brings the total net 2000 Estimate for this Department to £1,058 million.</P>
    <P>The other main spending area in 2000 was the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs where the total net Estimate was £2,877 million.</P>
    <P>I will deal finally with section 2 of the Bill. Article 17.1.2º of the Constitution requires that <Col N="1547" /> the financial resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that financial year, that is by 31 December 2000 in the case of the financial resolutions passed on budget night, 6 December. However, Article 17.1.2º also allows for the 31 December deadline to be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of 2000. This section makes provision for this deferment to be invoked.</P>
    <P>This provision of this section of the Appropriation Bill will maintain the normal statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law, namely, 84 days for completion of the Second Stage and four months for enactment of the Finance Bill. Identical provisions were included in the 1998 and 1999 Appropriation Acts.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the House, I would say that while we can all be proud of our continuing prosperity, this prosperity brings its own challenges. In facing these challenges, the Government remains committed to ensuring that all sections of society receive a fair share of our increasing national prosperity. The necessary resources will be applied to improving priority public services which will enhance the quality of life and living standards of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for a very comprehensive speech on the state of the nation. The Appropriation Bill gives statutory effect to moneys approved under the departmental Estimates for the current year. The sum provided is just under £17 billion, a staggering figure. The Bill appropriates this sum to the various services listed in the Schedule.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Government in regard to the excellent financial returns for the year. We have enjoyed extraordinary growth over the past seven years. The Minister for Finance informed us on budget day that he expected this growth to continue but that it would slow down somewhat from the estimated 8.6% in GNP terms this year to an average of 6% by 2003.</P>
      <P>A number of factors underpin the economic progress made in recent years, most notably social partnership and a favourable tax regime, particularly for foreign industrialists. This tax regime, which has been in place for many years, is one of the main attractions for foreign industry. I compliment the Taoiseach on defending our right at Nice to set our own rates of tax. The loss of that power would have had a tremendous effect on our future economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is the envy of most European nations due to our economic growth and falling unemployment figures. Inflation is the real difficulty we face in the coming years. Last year the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, when addressing the House on the Appropriation Bill, stated that prices had <Col N="1548" /> remained under control and that inflation was expected to average 1.6% for the year, significantly less than the 2% projected at the start of the year. Unfortunately, that forecast has not held true and inflation is now running at 7%. Few people can question the difficulties posed by inflation in the economy. The fact that the increase in the rate of inflation over the past 12 months was not anticipated resulted in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness failing to deliver real wage increases. Trade unions were, therefore, forced to renegotiate the PPF.</P>
    <P>The Government is in no doubt about the fact that the recent increase in inflation is a serious challenge to the future growth of our economy. The Minister for Finance introduced an anti-inflation package on budget day which he hopes will result in inflation averaging in the region of 4.5% for 2001. The Government has delivered on the promised income tax reductions and has cut the rates of indirect tax such as excise and VAT. The latter measure will help to reduce inflation but I am concerned that the reduction of the top rate of tax will result in the economy overheating and will lead to a further increase in inflation.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the third prong of the Government's attack on inflation is implemented as soon as possible, namely, encouraging people to save rather than spend. I sincerely hope the Minister will introduce an attractive saving product in the Finance Bill. Young people have the greatest amount of disposable income and they should be encouraged to save their money. I watched a programme on RTÉ last night about how some young people spend their money foolishly, and I found it disappointing and depressing. Young people feel they have to spend their money because they do not see it having any real value in the long term.</P>
    <P>Our economic growth has resulted in higher consumer spending, as evidenced by the number of new cars on our roads. Up to October this year, more than 100,000 new vehicles were registered in Dublin. While the numbers of cars on our roads have increased over the past five years, the available road space has remained the same, leading to congestion and delays. We seem to be very slow to put in place infrastructure to deal with this problem. The port tunnel is long overdue, the Coombe bypass, with which the Minister will be familiar from her time on the city council, has yet to commence and the eastern bypass is urgently needed. Will we ever see the Luas system, which was announced with great fanfare over four years ago? The introduction of the quality bus corridors is a very slow process, although the corridors are very successful where they have been introduced &ndash; there has been a 150% increase in the number of passengers using buses on the Stillorgan bus corridor.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to money underspent by various Departments. She cited the example of <Col N="1549" /> money which Dublin Corporation did not spend in regard to the Ballymun project. This is not a sign of dereliction of duty on the part of the corporation. The project has been delayed because of the number of appeals made. It is disappointing to see people opposing essential developments of this nature.</P>
    <P>Our economic growth has also resulted in increasing house prices and labour shortages. House prices in Dublin have more than doubled in the past four years. While they have stabilised somewhat in recent months, they are still much too high, especially for young people who are seeking to purchase their first house or apartment.</P>
    <P>The labour shortage is particularly evident in our hospitals. I am a member of a number of hospital boards which have sent executive staff to the Philippines to recruit nurses. I do not know what will happen when that well in the Philippines dries up.</P>
    <P>The same problem is beginning to raise its ugly head in the catering industry. Two years ago the Eastern Regional Health Authority, of which I am a member, built a very attractive nursing home in Dalkey, in the Minister's constituency, which remained closed until recently. Initially there were difficulties recruiting doctors, which were resolved. Then there were difficulties recruiting nurses, which we also resolved. However, we still could not open as we could not get catering staff. We must address the labour shortage which is a feature of our prosperity.</P>
    <P>We are experiencing problems at this time of tremendous economic growth which we did not experience in the 1980s during recession. We have long waiting lists for our hospitals, which was not a problem in the 1980s. Most frightening is the number of homeless in society. It is frightening to see the number of people sleeping rough in our cities; this did not happen in the 1980s when there was less economic growth. I am worried by the number of young people sleeping rough in the capital city. I know the Minister of State has a special interest in this and I welcome the provision made in the budget for the homeless which I hope will go some way towards solving the problem. Homelessness is a very complicated issue and money does not really solve the problem. Recently I was encouraged to hear 30 additional places would be provided for homeless people between December and January.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the very important role she has played in relation to children. We are all heartened by the provisions made in the budget for children. Children's allowances have been increased and, more importantly, there is a huge increase in the money made available for fostering children, with the provision of £200 per week. No child should now be left without a home given that tremendous <Col N="1550" /> increase, and I congratulate the Minister in that regard.</P>
    <P>All Governments have contributed to achieving our economic progress. I would like the Minister of State to convey to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, my sincere thanks for the presentation he made to each Member. It was initially introduced last year as a millennium presentation, and I am delighted the Minister has continued the gesture. It is very striking and we are most grateful.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and her staff a very happy Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Doyle in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to the House. I compliment Senator Doyle on his very objective analysis of the Appropriation Bill and of the performance of the Government in economic terms. It is very refreshing to hear such comments from across the floor, and for credit to be given where it is due.</P>
      <P>We are living in a fortunate time. We are giving statutory effect to an Estimate of £17 billion to run the State for a year, an extraordinary amount of money. When we look at what is involved the real positive elements in the economy can be seen.</P>
      <P>Not so long ago the House passed legislation which allowed a fund of £5 billion to be set up to pay for pensions over the next 50 years. Who would have thought such legislation would be necessary or of value 15 or even ten years ago? We could not contemplate such legislation as we did not have the necessary finances. We also passed legislation last week allowing the NTMA to deal with credits under the social insurance fund, amounting this year to £630 million. Not so many years ago the budget had to supplement the social insurance fund to the tune of £1,000 million. We have turned the corner in terms of economic performance and the budgetary measures in recent times, particularly this year, have succeeded in a very positive way in creating social inclusion and having that wealth distributed on a reasonably equal basis among citizens.</P>
      <P>It is right that it should be so as we would not have reached this position had it not been for the partnership agreements which we have had over a long number of years and which have been the cornerstone of success. Without such agreements we would not be applauding ourselves at this time. All those who were party to the agreements &ndash; the Government, trade unions, farmers and business &ndash; can feel justly proud of their involvement. The success of the social partnership has resulted in the large budgetary surplus and its redistribution is desirable and due to the citizens, and we must compliment the Government in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has responsibility for children and has a very proud record after a very <Col N="1551" /> short time in office. Nobody could say that the budget has not identified two very important areas which to some extent have lagged behind, namely, child care and the elderly. This was a most caring budget. I worked in the health services for 20 years and I know many pensioners put off going to their GP to get a prescription because of the cost and the fact that other expenses may not be met by them. That is no longer the case for anybody over 70 years of age. This provision is the most advanced social measure since Donogh O'Malley decided second level education should be made available free to all, and the Government and the Minister deserve credit. Those to whom I have spoken since the budget have repeatedly referred to this provision and I believe it will be talked about in years to come as one of the real steps forward in terms of looking after those who were the founders and original builders of the State, and those people are thankful.</P>
    <P>Our tax regime is the envy of many other states in the EU. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government generally are to be complimented on protecting the national interest by not allowing any change in our tax regime, which is helpful in bringing in major US investment. I have repeated over many years that Europe has only two English speaking nations, this country and our next door neighbour, the island of England, Scotland and Wales, and that the US will obviously look to English speaking nations in which to invest. This is no reflection on the rest of Europe, and it is very important that Ireland and its neighbours have a good working relationship given that Europe will expand and, since it cannot expand out into the Atlantic, it will expand towards the Ural Mountains. In the future, therefore, the interests of these two islands must synchronise more and more.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to see that at the Nice Summit that relationship gelled, and gelled in the interests of this country, when Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, Prime Ministers of two neighbouring friendly nations, put their heads together and put the interests of Ireland first and that the 12.5% corporation tax regime that we have was protected and is not on the agenda for discussion in the future. That was the most important strategic economic decision of this year after the budget.</P>
    <P>Let me mention an area of policy that I believe should take priority. My colleague, Senator Joe Doyle, mentioned that 74,000 extra people will be employed here this year. That is a major step forward. However, it creates its own problems, particularly in the city of Dublin. The Government's decision to divide the country into areas with Objective One status and areas of transition was very important. Its implementation on the ground should now be further fuelled by a con<Col N="1552" /> centrated effort to develop the regions, particularly those with Objective One status, over the next five or six years. Many of the ongoing problems in this city could be relieved if the strategic policy of moving industry to the regions was implemented. In the last three or four weeks three decisions have been taken that would support that &ndash; a major announcement of jobs in the Cavan area, a major announcement of jobs in the Carrick-on-Shannon area and, only two days ago, a major announcement of jobs in the Longford area. I hope this policy continues and that in implementing Government policy on this matter IDA Ireland will encourage and promote locations in the Border, midland and western regions. There is plenty of scope and less congestion. In this modern era of technology and communications these locations are as suitable as any in Dublin. If I have one message for the Minister it is to urge that the decision to divide the country into areas with Objective One status and areas of transition be implemented in a practical way by locating industry in the region in question, and that when decentralisation of Departments and sections of Departments takes place, that will also be concentrated in that region.</P>
    <P>As a country that has benefited greatly from US investment &ndash; we have listened to President Bill Clinton and compliment him on his involvement here over the last eight years &ndash; we must be conscious that the United States will have a new President. We await his pronouncements regarding foreign policy and investment. It is of vital interest to us that the <i>status quo</i> be maintained and that the encouragement we have had over the past eight years continues. I wish the new President well. Let us hope he will continue the outward approach to investment and that he will continue to see Ireland as a location in which to put down a stake in the context of involvement in the European Union and the Single Market. That has been the hallmark of American industrial policy over the past number of years and we have benefited greatly from it. I have already mentioned the circumstances that allow that type of development to take place here. Irrespective of that, however, American presidential and government policy on Capitol Hill will play a part in our affairs. Let us hope that the Bush regime casts a friendly eye on this nation during its term of office.</P>
    <P>Let me turn to the question of inflation. Last year's predictions regarding inflation were not borne out, but it must be recognised that it is now decreasing and is expected to be at 4.5% over the next 12 months. An analysis of the past 12 months would highlight a number of events that no Minister could have predicted, except perhaps by looking into a crystal ball. The first was that the euro fell lower than most commentators expected. It was generally expected that the euro would trade favourably with the dollar and the <Col N="1553" /> yen. That did not happen. There was a slippage of maybe 20%, and that had knock-on effects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It had benefits too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It had benefits in particular industries which were exporting into the British market&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>And the American market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the US market. However, there were disadvantages for companies which were importing, and we have industries that import from the UK and from the US. Some 27-28% of our trade is still with the UK.</P>
      <P>To return to the analysis of inflation, it could not have been predicted that oil prices would rise to the level they did. That is a volatile situation at any time because the oil producing regions are volatile and it is not possible to predict what oil prices will be.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance contributed to inflation as well. He put an extra 50p on a packet of cigarettes and that added almost 1% to the rate of inflation. However, that was done for a good reason &ndash; to support the public health policy. In this budget measures have been taken to decrease inflation, in particular in relation to transport costs, which are of vital importance in the control of inflation. The Minister has taken an all round approach to economic activity that will also contribute. Outside influences can and do contribute to inflation, but the measures introduced in the budget should contribute to a decrease in inflation. Let us hope that will happen during the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance who, to some extent, has borne a heavy load in that there may have been a perception that he was dogmatic and uncaring, and that he did not listen to people. I do not know of any group that made a budget submission to the Minister which felt it was not listened to or that some of what it wanted was not implemented. People are now looking at the Minister in a different light because he has a sound economic policy and he believes in partnership, equality and sharing the country's wealth. I acknowledge that the comments of my colleague on the opposite side of the House, who, like myself, has been a Member for the past three years, were objective and complimentary to the Minister on his approach to the country's finances.</P>
      <P>As a people we have unloaded the burdens of colonialism, the begging bowl, debt and immigration. They are all a watershed in so far as they are no longer part of the country's agenda. This House can be proud of that and it is appropriate to compliment the Government on the healthy state of our economy and the safe pair of hands that are in charge of our finances.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to the House for <Col N="1554" /> what is an interesting discussion. We are living in times of unprecedented economic growth &ndash; 8% is the figure used &ndash; and every day we see the changes that growth has brought about. I am reading a book about growing up in west Tipperary. The Minister may be interested in it because it is written by a fellow county person of hers, a man who grew up in Tipperary and then came to Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I am bringing the book to the notice of the Minister is that it illustrates the way we have progressed as a country. It tells the story of a young man growing up in those times, the poverty people endured, particularly in rural areas, and the enormous wealth that now exists in the countryside. The book was written by Larry Power of Coolnagun, near Donohill, a person known to the Minister, and I think it is entitled <i>Over the Half Door.</i> It is certainly a great read.</P>
      <P>Many issues were referred to in the Minister's contribution. I do not wish to be negative about something that is extremely positive, but last week's budget was striking in that there was little or no reference to agriculture. Everybody knows that we are in the middle of a BSE crisis, one which will cost much more than people know. The cost of this crisis cannot be counted, yet it was extraordinary that the budget, which was welcomed by many people, made no mention of compensation for those affected by this crisis. That issue needs to be addressed on two fronts. There should be compensation for farmers but also for the consumers.</P>
      <P>A proper marketing policy should be put in place for consumers. In a discussion here on the BSE crisis during the past week I said that consumers have doubts about what they are getting, but I am sure that the meat on sale in butcher stalls and shops throughout the country is the best in the world. We produce the finest beef in the world but there is concern among consumers in that regard. The agencies responsible should have got an extra allocation to market our products, particularly on the home market, because of that concern. Young people are wondering if it is safe to eat meat. The housewife is concerned also.</P>
      <P>We are in the middle of a crisis but, I hope, it may be over at the end of a two year period. We are positive in many ways and we are not afraid to tackle these crises. Many measures are being put in place but there is an urgent need to educate consumers in relation to the safety of beef.</P>

      <P>The last time we had a BSE crisis a compensation package was put in place. At that time the Government provided a certain amount of money, which was matched by Europe. It is time to reinstate that package which resulted in grants, negotiated four years ago, which are still being paid. It is time the Government put in place a proper compensation package for these people because the losses they are enduring are huge and they will have devastating effects on some people. I am aware of people in my constituency who are losing thousands of pounds at a time of year when payments are due. The ACC Bank and others are looking for their payments but because of the fall in cattle prices, these people will not be able to meet those demands.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to other issues and I was particularly interested in her comments about the Department of the Environment and Local Government. At the Estimates meeting of our county council I was struck by the enormous sum of money available for national roads. A new road proposed from Cork to Dublin will pass through my county. The figures involved were extraordinary, but as rural councillors we were very vocal because of the small amount of funding available for county roads.</P>
      <P>Senators Finneran and Joe Doyle referred to the increase in the number of cars on our roads. There is a huge increase in the number of cars on our roads and the old county roads structure in place in rural constituencies is unable to stand up to today's needs. It is time for a major investment in that structure. Some years ago the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, put in place a four or five year plan. That was effective in its own way but there is a need for a plan for those small country roads which have been forgotten. At the present rate of progress, it will take 30 years to get around to resurfacing some of the roads in my county in particular.</P>
      <P>Given the effects of the huge increase in traffic in rural areas on the tourism and agricultural industries, it is time country roads were restored, thereby giving the people of those areas the feeling that they are also being catered for. We hear about the huge amount of funding allocated for national roads. Money is available and I support the Government's proposals in regard to roads. However, we cannot forget rural areas and the need to allocate funding for these roads to county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An issue of major concern to my county council over recent years is funding for flood relief. Everyone is aware of the major flooding problem in Clonmel. Efforts are being made to tackle this problem, but there are other areas which also need assistance, for example, Burncourt. Some weeks before the writ was moved for the June by-<Col N="1556" /> election, flooding in Burncourt destroyed roads and farms. However, when the county council applied to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for assistance, it was told to take the funding out of its own resources. In effect, this meant taking funding from the budgets for other areas. Given the problem of flash flooding, we need a fund which can be drawn down by local authorities during times of need. Some years ago flooding in Hollyford caused more than £1 million in damage and the county council had to borrow funding from the Estimates, which costed us back four or five years. There is a strong argument for the setting up of a special fund for flood relief.</P>
    <P>I support the points made by Senator Finneran about the regions. Like any good politician, he referred to the need for Border and midland counties to be included in the Government's decentralisation programme. I represent a constituency which has not been included in the decentralisation programme. The Minister of State is an up and coming politician and I plead with her not to forget her home county, particularly the southern part, in the discussions on decentralisation. Given the benefits to counties which have been included in the programme, I plead with the Government to include south Tipperary in the next round of decentralisation. There should be a policy of encouraging private sector companies to move to the regions. My area is well located and there are many advantages to living and working there.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues to which I could refer but the most pressing problem is the number of people on the housing list. I am aware of the Minister of State's interest in child care and the need to look after the most vulnerable people in society. I appeal to the Government to do all it can to enable more people to be housed. The scheme of housing aid for the elderly has a great track record and is one of the best schemes ever introduced. However, the number of applications is so large that the budget for the entire year is spent after only a few months. This has had an effect on the quality of life of many older people. The scheme should be extended to improve their quality of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This debate gives us an opportunity to look at the state of the nation in terms of budgetary matters and our economic stability or otherwise. We are glad to be able to report another successful and prosperous year of financial achievement in the industrial sphere. Once again, the financial chest is over-flowing and there are loads of goodies to be distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 December last year the Minister for Finance estimated that the rate of inflation for 1999 would be 1.6%, which was a wonderful prediction. Senator Finneran said that nobody could predict the rate of inflation unless they looked into a crystal ball. I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was looking into a crystal ball <Col N="1557" /> but he did not see anything meaningful or logical. By that time the rate of inflation was already almost treble what it was for the previous month and by the end of January the rate was 4.8%. The estimated rate of inflation for the coming year is 4.5%, while the rate for this year is 5.5%, with the present rate running between 6% and 7%. The figures are so out of line with what the Minister for Finance said that we cannot accept any figure given to us. Anyone who comes into the House and says that the rate of inflation for 1999 will be 1.6% when it is going through the roof should not be allowed remain in office. I also question the advice on which he based his predictions.</P>
    <P>That was bad enough but the Minister then sold this figure to the trade union movement, IBEC and farmers, and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was negotiated on the basis of a low inflation rate. However, we ended up with an inflation rate which was considerably higher than the agreed increase in wages under the programme. The knock-on effect of this has been unprecedented industrial strife. The country is in turmoil because of strikes and industrial action. Even as we speak, teachers are picketing outside the gates. The Minister said that the 17,000 teachers who have rejected the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness cannot be spoken to meaningfully unless they negotiate under the banner they have already rejected, the PPF. How can they do this? There is a Mexican stand-off on this issue.</P>
    <P>I will not rehash all the strikes we have had this year but they started with the nurses and then moved on to the gardaí and all areas of transport &ndash; road, rail and air, where strikes are continuing on a regular basis. The reason is we could not control inflation and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was negotiated under false figures. We told the Minister that. I remember the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I telling him 12 months ago when the budget was being put together that he had skewed it in favour of the well off. We also told him that there would be a consumer binge which would be detrimental to us. When the well off get extra money they spend it on luxury goods which are produced abroad, particularly in non-euro land. When the poor get extra money they spend it on necessities which are produced at home. We buy most of our luxury goods from Britain, the United States and Japan. We must remember that 50% of our trade is with the European Union while the remainder is with sterling, dollar and yen countries. It is very expensive for us to purchase goods produced by those countries because the balance of the exchange rate is geared against us. There is a flow of money out of the country and this fuels inflation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has again produced a budget that is skewed in favour of the well off, people who will spend their surplus money on luxury goods not on necessities. Again, I predict that the proposed 4.5% inflation <Col N="1558" /> rise will be wide of the mark. It is a much higher figure than the 3.5% rise the Minister predicted last year; in fact it is double that now. This year he made a more realistic projection of 4.5% inflation for the coming year. I predict that the Minister will again be out of line with his prediction next year. He just pulls a figure out of the air. There are no measures in the budget that will stop the rise in inflation.</P>
    <P>We have a surplus and unprecedented wealth. We must decide how we can mould a good quality of life and provide a fair and just society where the benefits of our prosperity are evenly distributed. With regard to the state of the nation, we must take the opportunity to look at where we will be 12 months down the line and look forward to the next 12 months. We are still very much part of the economic and business miracle here. Each Government, including this one, has contributed to this boom. I give credit to the Government for the fact that we still have a stable economy. Inflation is a very worrying trend and it undermines the partnership which is so important to our continued prosperity.</P>
    <P>We are not sure any more whether we have a partnership. The private sector is breaking the partnership agreement left, right and centre. We have seen how it was broken by the gardaí and the nurses in the public sector. Teachers will not be satisfied without some consideration.</P>
    <P>We can see to what extent the agreement has been broken when we look at the section dealing with the health budget in the Appropriation Bill. On page 7, line 33, an extra £817 million was given to the Department of Health and Children by way of appropriation-in-aid for 2000. That was the highest sum given out and it was in breach of partnership arrangements in terms of salaries. If the Minister of State can give me information to the contrary, I would like to hear it.</P>
    <P>We should look at the level of inequality here at present. Since this Government came to power house prices and rent for private accommodation have doubled and homelessness has trebled. Last week homeless statistics were published in the newspapers. There are over 1,200 homeless in Dublin and they live in hostels, bed and breakfasts or rough. Over 100 of these people are children and they form part of the Minister of State's brief. The number of homeless is growing. I am a member of a local authority in Dublin and I know that it cannot house people. The waiting list for homeless people is as much as three years. It is a scandal that it takes between two and a half and three years for a homeless person to get accommodation from Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>A young couple seeking to buy a house will not buy it with one salary. Individualisation means that it will be harder to buy a house now. It is impossible for a young couple to buy a house now because of the huge increase in prices.</P>
    <P>We still have not seen the promised legislation on landlords and tenants. The relationship between landlords and their tenants is totally unbalanced. Landlords can evict tenants on a <Col N="1559" /> whim unless they have spent 20 years <i>in situ</i>. Why has no action been taken to solve this problem? These evicted tenants are going onto the homeless lists because they have no rights. Families and children are suffering. We need action on this issue.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's newspapers we saw the downside of the education system. Yesterday the Taoiseach also announced, with President Clinton present, how wonderful our education system was and said it was the major factor that attracted multinational hi-tech industry here. The downside of this is that there is a whole segment of society where education is very limited. The Lourdes Youth and Community Service located off Seán McDermott Street conducted a survey of 100 teenagers in the area and the results were printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday. They found that 90% of them had not completed their leaving certificte course, over 50% had not sat their junior certificate examination, 40% were on illegal drugs and 80% abused alcohol even though they were under the age limit of 18 years set for the consumption of alcohol. As many as 70% of 16 year olds had engaged in sexual activity. The people surveyed had a profile of very severe disadvantage. That is the downside of the education system. What are we doing about it? </P>
    <P>We have an excellent education system that serves 80% of our population where children are motivated, have good homes and a functional family. The remainder of the population need substantial resources, back-up and assistance that does not exist at present. Thousands of children are dropping out of the education system because there is no safety net or resources to keep them in it. These are the children who are reflected all the time in surveys.</P>
    <P>Child care comes under the remit of the Minister of State. She lauds the child care benefits given in the budget. I accept there have been substantial improvements. However, I have a serious problem with the improvements in two areas, child benefit and capital funding for the provision of child care facilities. Child benefit will pay for more food and clothing but it will do nothing for the provision of child care or education. Capital funding from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform assists in the provision of child care facilities but it does not cover running costs in terms of education input. A child minding facility is provided without any educational input.</P>
    <P>A national pre-school education system is lacking. IBEC and the business community are running the economy. They want mothers to come back into the workforce and they do not give a damn about what educational facilities are provided for children. As long as child minders are available to take care of children in crèches and so on, employers are happy. The budget and its predecessors did not address the child's needs and I would like the Minister of State to direct her attention to this. A gap has been created by <Col N="1560" /> a lack in the provision of pre-school educational facilities by the State.</P>
    <P>Vote 12 provides £735,000 for the secret service. A former Member of the House on one occasion asked whether that was a contradiction in terms. An appropriation-in-aid was not provided for it but I would love to know what the secret service does.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt it is a secret. If it is an Irish secret service, I bet there are a few leaks in it. The Minister of State will be aware of what the service does and how it spends its allocation.</P>
      <P>Vote 20 relates to the Garda and it provides for the payment of certain witnesses and payments for compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the local security force. To what extent are payments made to witnesses by the Garda? I presume people who give State's evidence and who might have been involved in criminal activity are covered under this provision. How much is expended by the Garda in pursuit of criminals and criminal activity?</P>
      <P>Ireland's infrastructure is in rag order and there has been no progress. The public transport system is grinding to a halt. Traffic congestion in Dublin is unbelievable. Luas seems no closer than ever to being constructed. We are not even sure what routes it will take through the city centre, whether it will go overground or underground or both in the city centre and whether there will be a link to the airport. Dublin Corporation is trying to process an application for rezoning of land to enable the construction of a line that is supposed to criss-cross the Sligo-Dublin line. We cannot obtain information on whether there will be a link to the airport and, therefore, do not know whether we should rezone the necessary land.</P>
      <P>The standard of the rail network is poor and dangerous. Trains travel more slowly now than they did 100 years ago. The nation's roads are in a poor condition. By-passes are constructed which create bottlenecks further down the road. When one travels along the N4 out of Dublin and goes through the Maynooth by-pass one encounters a major bottleneck for the next few miles where no overtaking is permitted. There are serious infrastructural problems with which we are apparently not coming to grips in a meaningful fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still waiting lists for every category of surgery in our hospitals and the queues are lengthening. Anybody who has been in the accident and emergency room of a hospital in recent times will be aware of the time one must wait to be treated and the level of service that is provided. Everybody must spend between ten and 12 hours in an accident and emergency room before they are treated. It is a scandal given the funding that is available but the problem is how the money is spent because the service has deteriorated. It is good Government to ensure the service is effective and people are treated. Nobody is more vulnerable than a sick person who needs <Col N="1561" /> surgery and needs to avail of hospital services when they are not in good health but they receive the worst service.</P>
    <P>It was petty that those who are on the national minimum wage were not taken out of the tax net. That would have been a great boost to people at the lower end of the salary scale. People who earn £144 or more per week are still taxed. Those who are on the minimum wage earning £176 per week are taxed on £30 of their income. It was recommended that those earning the minimum wage or less should have been taken out of the tax net and most commentators, including my own party, proposed that the tax free allowance threshold should have been increased to £200 per week to ensure a decent income for those at the lower end of the salary scale. Every penny they spend will go back into the economy and will not fuel inflation.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a great economy and I hope its growth continues. I am concerned that inflation could damage economic growth but an economy does not make a nation. We need to ensure the benefits of the economy are evenly distributed and we have yet to see that in any of the budgets presented by the Government. I am not sure whether the Government will present another budget but it is disappointing that there has not been better and greater distribution of the moneys that have accrued to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate for their balanced, objective comments and the stimulating discussion. The Bill gives us an opportunity not just to look back but also to look forward. It is a good opportunity at this time of the year to reflect on the success of the economy, the changes that have come about and the fact that it remains a challenge for all of us to ensure people's quality of life is improved and prosperity is evenly shared.</P>
      <P>A number of specific issues were raised. Senator Doyle referred to inflation difficulties but the latest figures demonstrate that measures taken by the Government are having an impact and it is expected inflation will fall this month and continue to fall next year. It is forecast to run at 4.5% next year. I hope Senator Costello does not quote me this time next year. While external factors had an influence this year, the changes in excise duties in the budget should have a positive effect on inflation.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators mentioned infrastructure and the Government is obviously committed to implementing the infrastructural programme set out in the national development plan which will address all infrastructural needs. A number of mechanisms are in place to ensure that the targets are met and, from the level of Cabinet sub-committee down, people are ensuring the key investment for the plan is properly delivered and that people can see real results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle referred to savings measures and the Minister for Finance referred <Col N="1562" /> in the budget to measures already taken by cutting taxes on capital accumulation and by incentivising pension savings, both through tax changes and by giving savers a greater choice and control over their nest-eggs. The rate of capital gains tax was cut which brought the yield to £600 million this year alone. The Minister has announced a number of specific savings measures relating to credit unions and life assurance. I am sure we all accept there needs to be promotion of the idea of saving for young people to ensure, for their own benefit, that they at least take an interest in saving.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes referred largely to agriculture and stated that farming was not mentioned in the budget. It was extensively dealt with under the areas of income tax and PRSI reductions for farmers, capital allowances for plant and machinery, stock relief, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax relief in the case of the acquisition of farmland under a compulsory purchase order, relief for site transfer and farmers' flat rate refund.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes also asked about flood relief. A Supplementary Estimate totalling £1.5 million was passed for the victims of flooding and that would obviously include people in Clonmel and south Tipperary because those areas were badly affected. That grant has been given to the Irish Red Cross Society to enable those identified as in need or hardship cases to have their money paid before Christmas.</P>
    <P>I am sure we all share the concern about the impact on the agriculture industry of the BSE crisis. I know my colleagues, the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance, are working jointly to see what response can be put in place for this crisis in light of the agreement reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 4 December to deal with BSE and its impact on the beef market. It is not clear yet what exact effect this will have on the Exchequer but I will certainly pass Senator Hayes's comments to the Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello and Joe Doyle referred to housing. It is important to note that £1 billion will be spent next year on local authority, social and affordable housing. Output has increased by 20% since 1997, there were 46,500 housing starts last year and average house prices for the third quarter of this year are well down.</P>
    <P>People specifically asked about homelessness, which is a concern of mine, especially youth homelessness. I was delighted that an extra £5 million had been allocated in the budget for youth homelessness. That is on top of the money already allocated for capital expenditure to ensure emergency accommodation is available. I note that in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area two new centres are opening for young people, including the Meath Hospital. I have been assured by the authority that it is ready to open and it will provide extra beds for young people who need them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> Our aim as a society must be to ensure children do not end up on the streets and that the money is targeted towards ensuring early intervention, protection and family support. An extra £2 million has been allocated to ensure young people do not have to leave their homes and live on the streets. We will tackle that in two ways, by providing emergency accommodation and ensuring young people are reintegrated with their families. This remains a major concern of mine and is something on which we are working, not just on the capital side but also in ensuring money is made available to provide support services.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about the health Estimate and indicated that he believed much of it had gone on pay. In my opening address I outlined some of the expenditure but it will be seen that a great deal of the money will go on hepatitis C compensation payments, on various inquiries such as the organ retention and haemophiliac inquiries, the winter initiative, demand-led drugs schemes etc.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle referred to foster care. In our dealings with children, a child is best looked after by his or her family. Where that cannot happen, another family situation is the ideal. That is why I welcome the increase in allowances where, from July, foster parents of a child under 12 will be paid £200 per week and £220 for a child 12 years or older. This recognises the important role such families play in the child care system and developing supports for children.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about the secret service. One of our colleagues once said that the Irish secret service was one of the great oxymorons of our time. I am advised by the officials that, in keeping with the fact that it is a secret service, traditionally its activities are not made known. The Senator asked about witnesses. Witnesses' expenses were £850,000 and the witness security programme was £650,000. Unfortunately, I do not have a breakdown of the exact components of that, but that is the general breakdown.</P>
    <P>On child care, the specific elements of the national development plan are not just for capital expenditure. The breakdown of that funding refers to after school care, staffing &ndash; grants for staffing were announced today &ndash; developmental work and the guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children. Although a great deal of emphasis has been placed on staff ratios and space, the first regulation and guideline is for an inspection to be carried out on the type of developmental work and its quality. That is the direction in which we must go to ensure services are provided for children. A great deal of the money is geared towards community facilities and ensuring that those in need receive assistance at an early stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the Lourdes Youth and Community Services report featured in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday. It amuses me that it has already been released given that I have been <Col N="1564" /> invited to launch it tomorrow. I suspect they do not want my presence tomorrow.</P>
    <P>An extra 176,000 people have been taken out of the tax net in the past three years. Although minimum wage earners are not out of the net, they pay less than £1 per week in tax, given that they only pay tax on the difference between their total earnings and that part of it outside the tax net. Real progress has been made. The success of the economy has been reflected in the partnership deals and in the structures which exist to allow us to co-operate.</P>
    <P>I hope, in that context, the ASTI can see the progress that can be made. As a former secondary school teacher, I am obviously concerned about the effect this is having on the school community, especially young people. The initial concerns of the ASTI were about the benchmarking process. That has led to a development where a quarter of any agreed increases will be paid from December 2001. That might give the ASTI an opportunity to enter the benchmarking process to see how progress can be made in the interests and spirit of partnership. As is evidenced by the figures, we cannot afford to let that partnership go. The future of society depends on our working together to ensure that the development of the economy and the projections for it can lead to a good quality of life for everyone.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes spoke about growing up in west Tipperary and the developments which have taken place there. I hope, as someone who grew up in north Tipperary, the Kickham idea of the welcome and friendship of the homes of Tipperary will never change, irrespective of the wealth we obtain.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;<Col N="1565" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to debate in the Seanad my legislative proposals for the National Stud Company in the National Stud (Amendment) Bill, 2000, and the state of the thoroughbred horse breeding and racing industries generally. There was a useful debate on the Bill in the Dáil. There was strong cross-party support for the improvements we are proposing in the way in which the stud is expected to operate. It is now a strong and vibrant company and I have every confidence that the growth it has sustained over recent years will continue and its excellent performance in all its fields of activity will be maintained.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil, Deputies Dukes, Power and Wall from Kildare took a particular interest in the Bill and no doubt that will be the case with Senators from Kildare. That is not surprising given their proximity to the stud. They recounted some of the local history of the place, the top class stallions that have stood at Tully over the years, the pride the local people take in it and the esteem in which it is held. They also commented favourably on the Japanese Gardens and the new St. Fiachra's Garden and their importance from the point of view of tourism.</P>
      <P>Three amendments were made to the Bill on Committee Stage. The main amendment related to the removal of any ministerial role in the decisions to be made in the future on how the proceeds from the sale of any part of the stud land would be used. Essentially, there was full agreement that the stud should be allowed to operate on a commercial basis and the board of the stud company should decide how the revenue will be used. We also agreed to increase the share capital and the limits on borrowing powers from the original proposals of £25 million and £20 million respectively to £30 million in respect of each. I will discuss these in more detail later.</P>
      <P>I will now discuss the general state of the equine industry and where it is going. The horse industry has over the past few years gone through a momentous period of significant change. This is true of many industries and is probably caused chiefly by the unprecedented growth in the economy, the increase in disposable income and the radical improvements in the availability and use of leisure time in people's lives coupled with the modernisation of lifestyles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This change created great opportunities for businesses in the service, leisure and tourism sectors. This is where the breeding, training and racing of horses and greyhounds are most active, and progress and prosperity in these areas have significant benefits for the producers of the basic products, that is, good quality horses and greyhounds. Three State bodies play leading and important roles in these sectors &ndash; the National Stud, the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon. All three have, through the efforts of commercially-minded and business orientated chairmen and boards, not only seized the opportunities that were there but, with vision, pushed <Col N="1566" /> these sectors beyond all apparent barriers to place them at the cutting edge for the future.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown its strong commitment to these sectors by the provision of an appropriate and much increased level of investment funding for the State bodies concerned. However, that was not all. Critically, and at important stages over the past few years, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and I have encouraged much needed change in the underlying organisational and financial structures underpinning these sectors. As a consequence of relatively recent developments, I intend to introduce in the near future new legislation governing the horseracing industry, probably the most significant ever in this area. This will represent the final phase in the restructuring of the way in which the horseracing industry is organised and funded, giving it a secure and permanent footing for the long-term future.</P>
    <P>The first initiative in this direction was the establishment of the IHA in 1994. The work it has done over the past six years represents a major step in the development of our horseracing industry. The results are obvious &ndash; increased prize money, better facilities at our racecourses and improved customer services, resulting in strong growth in the key economic indicators of the health of the business. The current level of attendances are 1.3 million for the horseracing industry and 750,000 for the greyhound industry, proof that improved facilities in these leisure industries attract people, especially young people. There is a total of approximately £150 million turnover in on-course bookmaker and tote betting on horseracing and up to £50 million on greyhound racing.</P>
    <P>However, continued and sustained development is essential to maintain and accelerate that growth. There is now full industry agreement on the way forward. I will put detailed proposals to Government shortly on the establishment of a new unified structure under a body to be called Horse Racing Ireland or HRI to replace the IHA and take over certain functions from the Turf Club. It is planned that this will facilitate securing for Irish racing the revenue coming from tax on off-course betting which currently goes to the Exchequer. This will in turn provide the level of investment required to stimulate the real growth potential of this important industry. I expect off-course betting in bookmakers' shops on the streets of our towns and cities to be close to £1 billion. For a relatively small country, that is a fair amount of punting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been an occasional net investor in the industry. I now turn to the National Stud. If there is one thing that has stood to Ireland in the horseracing industry, it is its ability to breed and train excellent world class racehorses. In this respect, the Irish National Stud <Col N="1567" /> is to the forefront of the industry so I am particularly glad to bring a Bill before the Seanad which will allow the National Stud to develop even further. It is a tremendous national asset from the viewpoint of the contribution it makes to horse breeding and the efforts of Irish breeders generally. It also contributes significantly to the international reputation of the Irish thoroughbred and to Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>Since its inception as a stud, Tully has been the nursery of so many world famous racehorses that its name is almost a household word, synonymous with all that is best in the thoroughbred. Many people will remember Lord Gayle, Crash Course, Sallust, Ahonoora and many more outstanding international thoroughbreds. For 2001, the Irish National Stud will have five stallions standing at Tully, including Indian Ridge, one of the top proven stallions in Europe and sire of Namid, the top rated sprinter in Europe this year. The other stallions are world champion three year old of 1998, Desert Prince, champion French miler, Ashkalani, and Priolo, the sire of champion miler Sendawar. Joining them will be the soon to be retired Indian Danehill, a group 1 winner in France.</P>
      <P>Ashkalani is at the stud through the co-operation and collaboration of the Aga Khan. It is the first time this has occurred in Ireland since the 1920s. It says much for the professionalism of the stud that the Aga Khan is co-operating with the stud by standing one of his outstanding stallions there. Ashkalani was the European champion miler.</P>
      <P>In addition to the stallions standing at the company's farms in Kildare, there are four national hunt stallions based around the country to facilitate national hunt breeders. Examples are proven sire Broken Hearted and the new addition, Rudimentary, which is owned by the stud in partnership with Anngrove Stud. This makes the stud's stallions more easily accessible to breeders throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The stud company, which showed profits of more than £400,000 in 1998 and more than £600,000 in 1999, is currently trading very well. A substantial profit is also predicted for this year. It is interesting to note that the total turnover generated from the company's stallions this year is more than £6 million of which in excess of £3.5 million is generated from foreign owned mares, reflecting the world class attractiveness of these stallions. More than half of the mares coming into the stud come from outside the country. On the stud's yearlings, this year turnover was almost £1 million at the recent yearling sales and included the top price for a filly sold in Ireland which was bred out of the stud's excellent brood mare, Sabaah.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year was a record year for tourism at the stud. The Japanese Gardens and the millennium project, St. Fiachra's Garden which opened in June 1999, were an outstanding success. It is expected that final numbers of visitors will be in <Col N="1568" /> excess of 145,000, 17,000 more than last year and almost 50% higher than two years ago. Another part of the Irish National Stud's function for some years now is its training course in horse breeding, of which it is justifiably proud. This most important course will continue in the future as it is regarded as one of the best training courses in the world and has a track record second to none. Graduates of the National Stud course are to be found throughout Ireland and the world.</P>
    <P>The horse museum, which houses the skeleton of Arkle, is another of the stud's attractions. I would like to see the museum being expanded because many people are interested in equine history, the source materials for which should be located in one centre. I cannot think of a location preferable to the National Stud.</P>
    <P>The history of the legislation governing the stud is that the National Stud Act, 1945, vested the National Stud Farm which covers more than 800 acres in County Kildare in the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. The Act provided for the establishment by the Minister of a limited company under the companies legislation to operate the stud farm and for the Minister to grant a licence to the stud company to use the land accordingly. It also provided for associated matters such as the share capital and borrowing limits of the company.</P>
    <P>The National Stud Act, 1976, amended the 1945 Act by, among other things, increasing the share capital to £5 million and the borrowing power of the company to £500,000. The 1993 amending legislation increased the share capital from £5 million to £10 million and the borrowing powers from £500,000 to £5 million.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to empower the Minister to vest the National Stud Farm in the stud company and to increase again the share capital and borrowing powers of the company. The total amount of share capital which can be issued in respect of the National Stud is currently limited to £10 million and, to date, the State has purchased almost all of the available share capital. The equity investment of recent years has been channelled into the purchase of top quality stallions or shares in such stallions. Together with other initiatives, the acquisition of these stallions has underpinned the stud's success and brought the company back from a loss making position in the early 1990s to a viable and profit making operation today. The stud will have to continue to purchase shares in more quality stallions over the coming years and, for that reason, it is proposed to increase the share capital of the company from £10 million to £30 million. I initially intended to increase the share capital to £25 million but it was agreed, following some debate in the Dáil, to increase it to £30 million instead as it was recognised that the value of bloodstock has increased so much in recent years that the higher provision of £30 million is easily justified. This year's winner of the Kentucky Derby changed hands for $70 million which is some indication of the kind of money at stake. Last year, the stud bought Desert Prince <Col N="1569" /> for the relatively modest sum of a couple of million pounds. This year, eight of the stallion's first foals were sold at auction, averaging a price of £100,000 each.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister means guineas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. The National Stud's borrowing powers are currently limited to £5 million and such borrowing is subject to the approval of both the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance. The price of top quality stallions in which the National Stud would be interested has increased substantially in recent years. When the stud becomes interested in a particular stallion, it is crucial in competing in a tough market place and to achieve purchase at the most reasonable price available, that the stud is able to move quickly in offering a price and completing a purchase. There will be occasions when the stud will want to purchase 100% of the shares of a stallion and subsequently seek investors to take up a proportion of those. Both of these manouevres would generally require substantial short-term borrowings and it is therefore proposed to increase the borrowing limit to £30 million. Again here I had originally intended to go with a somewhat lower limit of £20 million but for the same reasons advanced in relation to the possible need for a higher level of share capital, it was agreed in committee in the Dáil to raise this to £30 million.</P>
      <P>The National Stud currently holds the stud lands under licence from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. It is proposed to give the Minister the power to vest all or any part of the lands in the company to make it possible for the company itself, if circumstances require, to sell such vested land, subject to the consent of the Minister and to use the proceeds to buy suitable replacement land or otherwise develop some other aspect of the stud's activities. This is particularly relevant now because the Kildare byass will result in the separation of parts of the stud lands from the main farm, making those parts considerably less suitable for stud farming in the context of an integrated National Stud farm operation. It may then be desirable to sell the 50 or so acres cut-off by the bypass and buy other more suitable land adjacent to the main farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had intended that when such land sales were made the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance would decide in each case how the proceeds would be used and that some or all of such proceeds could go to the Exchequer in certain circumstances. However, following a very useful debate on this subject in the Dáil, I decided that this might represent an unnecessary restriction on the commercial operation of the business of the stud company, especially given that I have such confidence in the board and management of the stud. The relevant provision was removed by amendment on Com<Col N="1570" /> mittee Stage in the Dáil and replaced by a new subsection that gives the stud itself the right to decide how the proceeds from the sale of land should be used. The management may decide to buy replacement land or develop the stud and the company's other associated interests.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify one issue regarding section 2 of the Bill which deals with the whole vesting issue. A comment was made at the conclusion of the Report Stage debate in the Dáil which suggested that subsections (4) and (5) of section 2 were defunct as a result of an amendment passed on Committee Stage to subsection (3) of that section. This is not the case. These subsections relate to incidental provisions which may be contained in an order under section 2 vesting land in the stud company and the requirement to lay such orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. As these subsections relate to the orders referred to in subsection (1), which was not affected by the amendment, and are nowadays fairly standard qualifications to most ministerial orders being provided for in legislation, it is appropriate that they are used here and should remain part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under current legislation, the National Stud does not have the power to form subsidiary companies. The stud is now involved in what is effectively a separate business relating to its tourism activities and, from time to time, operates its search for and purchase of bloodstock separately from its main stud farm operations. Both of these businesses can be most efficiently operated from a VAT viewpoint, in particular, through subsidiary companies. It is now proposed to allow the stud to establish such companies, purchase shares in other companies and enter into joint ventures, subject to ministerial consent, in line with powers introduced some time ago for the IHA and Bord na gCon. In other words, the stud is to be allowed to operate as a commercial entity in competition with other studs throughout the country and the world.</P>
    <P>Under the 1945 Act, each director of the National Stud Company holds one share in the company. Five shares are held by ministerial nominees who are civil servants in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance with some responsibility or expertise in this area. The remaining shares are held by the Minister for Finance. To date, 9,975,374 shares have issued, of which the Minister for Finance holds 9,975,362. Under the present arrangement, new share certificates must issue and other documentation must be amended every time there are changes to the board of directors. As this is a very unwieldy operation, it is proposed to amend the Act to allow us to dispense with these procedures and to provide for the total share allocation to be held by the Minister for Finance and, if required, certain office holders in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a number of other technical changes of minor consequence dealing with <Col N="1571" /> the name of the company and its objectives which clarify the totality of the role and activities of the stud as it has evolved over the years. There is no direct charge on the Exchequer in these proposals. However, if and when the Minister for Finance opts to purchase some of the additional shares in the National Stud provided for in the Bill, there will be financial implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this very important Bill. The Minister reacted in a responsible way to some of the Opposition amendments in the other House. He saw the need for what was proposed and we are very pleased these amendments were accepted. Therefore, we will be supporting the Bill and I want to help in every way possible the speedy passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to read about the success of the National Stud which is no longer dependent on the taxpayer. It is very good that it is now making a profit. We should be very proud of the history of the National Stud. Through tougher times various Governments helped finance it and Kildare people and ourselves are very proud of its record. The horseracing industry has benefited as a result of that investment over a long period.</P>
      <P>The racing industry is very important to our country and it involves many people. Everybody has an interest in racing, be they older people who study form at home on a Saturday, young people who go for the social aspect or tourists. A huge amount of finance is generated by the industry and a huge amount of social activity surrounds horseracing, which is very welcome. It is good that so many people can benefit from the racing industry.</P>
      <P>I have often commented on the amount of racing coverage provided by RTÉ and have asked it to review its policy in this regard. There are great races, particularly at weekends, and given that older people cannot travel to meetings at Leopardstown, Fairyhouse etc., RTÉ should consider broadcasting much more racing. Many people cannot go to race meetings for various reasons and perhaps the Minister will recommend that RTÉ carry more racing for their benefit.</P>
      <P>Racing is now for everybody, something evident from the success of syndicates. Indeed the success of the grand alliance syndicate is an example, the secretary of which has just joined us. Syndicates are another reason many people can become involved in the racing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from an area which has had much success in the past. One notable success is Vincent O'Brien who has contributed hugely to the racing industry. He has retired from the business but has left an indelible mark on it. His contribution to the industry is probably the greatest of all time. At some stage we should honour that contribution in some way. I know the Minister raised the issue of a museum, and Vincent O'Brien <Col N="1572" /> should be part of it. The story of Vincent O'Brien should be told and it could be a huge tourist attraction as no figure is better known in the world of racing. He was born in Cork, which should help my argument that he be recognised in some way.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am inclined to be parochial and to raise issues concerning my constituency, but I wish to raise the future of Tipperary racecourse, an issue I have raised with the Minister on numerous occasions. The racecourse has been running into difficulty because it has lost certain fixtures, a major blow to a course which could host many more events. The reason for the cancellation of some events is the condition of the ground. The drainage of the racecourse is a major issue which has been ongoing for some time. I understand that in future proposals will be made to the racing authority to provide funding to help the racecourse company drain the track. The Minister, who has often attended race meetings there, knows the track is very good and has attracted a huge number of people over a long period. It would be a pity if the racing authority turned its back on the track. There is a feeling in the community, including the wider business community, that there is not the same commitment to the track as there is to others in the area. When the Minister is discussing racing with the people in authority, I ask him to remind them of the potential of Tipperary racecourse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister that I wish to progress it as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Kildare man and a near neighbour of the National Stud, I am delighted to have the opportunity to take part in the debate. I welcome the Minister and the provisions of the Bill. It should be viewed in the context of the explosion of interest in the bloodstock industry and the many positive changes achieved in recent times. I strongly agree with Senator Hayes that due to the effects of the booming economy we are seeing people who in the past could aspire at best to being regular racegoers becoming owners or part owners. The sport of kings is now accessible to many citizens. Great credit in that regard is due to the Government, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and the Minister for Finance, whose passion for the industry is well known. Indeed we can point to record investment by the current Government in the industry and massively improved management at most of our racecourses where the attitude is progressive and forward-looking. The racecourses and their facilities have been enormously improved and prize money has been increased. Generally a new sense of customer awareness has been established. After six years in existence, the IHA can be proud of its achievements in that the growth targets it set itself in its strategic plan have been surpassed. I wish we could say the same about every strategic plan that has been put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1573" /> Progressing from this, and as a result of the Minister's initiative and that of the Minister for Finance, we are shortly to have, as stated, the new HRI, Horse Racing Ireland, which I am sure will be a strong unifying force for the industry. With the substantial additional revenue from off-course betting, the new HRI will be a major force for securing the future of the industry and all those who are employed in it. Coming as I do from the thoroughbred county, I know how important that achievement is. Both Ministers are to be complimented on the manner in which they successfully concluded what were on many occasions quite difficult negotiations to this end. The industry is indebted to both.</P>
    <P>Since 1945 when the National Stud Act vested the 800 acres at Tully in Kildare in the Minister for Agriculture and then licensed the use of the lands to the new Irish National Stud Company, that company has fulfilled its remit in an admirable fashion. Like many companies, it has had its ups and downs, not least in the early 1990s when times were bad. It is today on a sound financial footing, having increased trading profits in the past few years and with expected further improvements in the financial situation for the year 2000. It has also loyally adhered to its purpose of promoting the breeding of top class bloodstock, with due regard to the making available of quality sires to the smaller breeders. That four top quality sires are now standing at different locations throughout the country is clear testimony to that fact.</P>
    <P>More than any other factor, the stud can attribute its success to the unrivalled commitment and dedication of the board and the staff. Living within a stone's throw of the stud, I know all the people who work there and have first-hand knowledge of their loyalty to the stud company. Stud managers over the years have demonstrated great skill and expertise in developing the stud and in promoting it on a local, national and international level. In this regard I refer to the tenure of Dr. Michael Osborne as manager of the stud, a man renowned in bloodstock circles. He will be remembered locally and nationally with particular admiration and fondness in relation to the work he did for the Irish National Stud Company. Great credit is due to the selfless commitment of the board members over the years, each of whom has brought their own expertise and wisdom to the process of governance of the stud. The Minister and his predecessors are particularly fortunate to have been able to recruit the services of people of the calibre of the current chairperson, Mrs. Chryss O'Reilly, and the former manager, Dr. David Shubotham. We are very much indebted to them for the commitment they have made to this State enterprise.</P>
    <P>In addition to the four stallions standing at locations around the country, we have five top class stallions who will stand at Tully during 2001, among them being Sean Coughlan's Indian Ridge, one of Europe's leading stallions, to which <Col N="1574" /> the Minister referred. Operating as it does in what is a hugely competitive market and with the need to acquire through purchase or share arrangements top quality breeding stock, the provisions of this Bill relating to share capital and borrowing powers are timely. The increased limits proposed in the Bill in both share capital and borrowing power, now set at £30 million in each case, will place our National Stud Company in a position to function more effectively in the marketplace. That is something we would all strongly support.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the proposal to allow the Minister to vest some or all of the lands in the National Stud Company, together with the provisions relating to the sale or acquisition of land. The Minister referred to the now famous, or perhaps infamous, Kildare bypass. The extent to which the development of that particular road and the stud have been interconnected in recent years is a story in itself. Suffice it to say that in attempting to minimise the effect of the new motorway as it crosses the stud lands, the design team and the county council decided to place the road in a deep cut with the ensuing controversy about the Curragh aquifer, the now famous Pollardstown Fen and, of course, the <i>Angistora vertiego</i>, the mollusc or snail, so much beloved by my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches. Upwards of 50 acres of stud land will be severed by the Kildare bypass.</P>
    <P>While having due regard to the need to facilitate the expansion of the operations of the Racing Apprentice Centre of Education, it is entirely proper that the remainder of the lands lying close to Kildare town should be rezoned. As these lands would, if zoned, realise a very substantial sum on the open market, I welcome the decision the Minister has made to leave decisions relating to the spending of such income to the board of the Irish National Stud Company, as would be the case in relation to any normal commercial venture. I would simply echo the hope the Minister expressed in his contribution that in acquiring replacement land, if that is what is decided, it will be in very close proximity to the current operation.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to conclude without mentioning the tourism aspect of the company's operation, because this a significant part of its overall operation. The package that is now the National Stud, the Japanese Gardens and the most recently established St. Fiachra's Gardens, is one of the most visited tourist attractions, pulling in about 150,000 in the current year and showing a 50% increase in its numbers in a period of two years. The stud, therefore, has been well justified in its investment in its tourist product having, as it does now, one of the country's top ten attractions at its very heart. I salute the work of the tourism manager there, Mr. Pat Mullarkey, who in recent years made the very difficult transition from farm manager to tourism manager, proving the adaptability of those of us who work <Col N="1575" /> in the agricultural sector. Working with a small corps of diligent staff he has achieved record levels of success.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before us. So positive and welcome are its provisions that I have noticed in the newspaper columns that others are claiming credit for it and ownership of it. That should not be the case. This is just one more initiative from a Minister who has served the bloodstock industry well. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House and welcome him. I am sure he realises that, despite the fact that my entire family has been ruined by horse breeding, I still have an interest in these very interesting and intelligent animals.</P>
      <P>The National Stud is a great credit to us. I agree that the tourist attractions which have been brought forward so well there in recent years should be hived off into a separate company, and it is good that this should be allowed. I hope the engineering problems at Pollardstown have now been resolved. This has been a serious difficulty not just for the snails but for the inhabitants of Dublin as well in the context of water.</P>
      <P>I am pleased with the success the stud has had in attracting international breeders with their mares to our very important stallions. However, stallion fees here are extraordinarily high, and this is causing a great crisis for smaller breeders who find that there are fewer and fewer stallions in fewer and fewer hands. I wonder whether the National Stud has a policy regarding smaller breeders. I would hate to see them squeezed out of the market because they have been of tremendous interest to people all over Ireland, and a source of income when things go well, which seems to be one time in every five. Does the Minister have a mission statement, which is the fashionable word now?</P>
      <P>In the context of the Pollardstown Fen again, and the extraordinary statement reported the other day in <i>The Irish Times</i> to have been made by Commissioner Fischler that BSE could be spread by excrement and could be spread in ground water, if the Commissioner does not have scientific evidence for this, I would have thought it should be refuted at once. I am not suggesting that horses are going to get it, but there are other animals there and it is important that statements like that should be immediately knocked on the head. I would not like to see another problem with the Pollardstown Fen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill and on <Col N="1576" /> the general racing industry. I welcome the Minister who, from his hands on approach and his appearances on the track, keeps an eye on the racing industry and the various matters related to it. As the Minister said, the National Stud, the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon come under his stewardship and are areas in which progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I want to take up a point raised in relation to the National Stud which brings to mind the issue of the Kildare bypass and the concern about the extension of the M50 at Leopardstown racecourse. There is a letter in <i>The Irish Field</i> of 9 December from Kevin Smith, president of the Racing Club of Ireland, which is headed &ldquo;Rally Round the Cause or Say Goodbye to Racing in Dublin&rdquo;. In that letter he states that with all that has happened in relation to the alignment of the roadway near Leopardstown, it appears definite that sprint racing and racing of two year olds will be a thing of the past, and possibly even the death-knell for racing in general.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to move the five or six furlong track in Leopardstown towards the centre where the stables, etc. are currently located. If people believe it is possible to redesign a course in such a way, they are not living in the real world. I am sure the Minister would agree with that because he would be aware of problems already experienced in Punchestown and in Doncaster. Designing a racecourse is not as simple as laying concrete or tarmacadam because land has to settle. What they are attempting to do at Leopardstown is totally reckless.</P>
      <P>An article appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on 10 December last by Michael Clower, the headline to which read: &ldquo;Leopardstown in Disarray over the M50&rdquo;. I am aware that the acting general manager, Tony Corcoran, is seeking an urgent meeting in relation to the way the design work on the roadway will affect Leopardstown. Not only will it be out of line with no sprint track, etc., but the fences, which some Members will know are just beyond the stands, will be affected also. When they start digging and laying this roadway there is a danger that the track will be flooded, which is a major concern. I ask the Minister to investigate that matter because as Peter McCarthy, chairman of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, stated:</P>
      <P>If Leopardstown were to close, it would be an absolute disaster. It is the only course left in the Dublin area and it would be hard to rebuild its great atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The track in Limerick is coming on stream and perhaps the Minister, when replying, could advise us as to the progress that has been made or when it will be opened. Perhaps there might be a suitable race there for the grand alliance horse, Artic Copper, which, hopefully, will be running over Christmas. I hope he does not have to contend with the roadway, as long as he can get over the <Col N="1577" /> jumps. On a more serious note, there is a major problem with Leopardstown and a decision should be made on what will happen because a race track that has been built up over many years cannot be moved. A race track cannot be made out of ordinary land.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that various problems have been resolved satisfactorily. The Minister, his officials and others are to be thanked for getting these matters sorted out. With the progress that was sought in relation to racing and the various bodies coming together there was a danger that the funding would not be allocated.</P>
    <P>There have been major improvements in regard to race tracks and facilities. Racing is a spectator sport and people have to be looked after. The days of throwing up any type of food and drink to them are gone. If people are paying reasonably good money to get into a racecourse, they want to be looked after. Other sports are getting their act together and racing has made a lot of strides in that area. I welcome the fact that some of the facilities have been improved.</P>
    <P>I compliment everybody in the National Stud on the work they have done through the years. I know some of them very well; they are related to me. The acquisition by the National Stud of Desert Prince and the fact that his first crop has achieved tremendous prices recently both in Kill, Newmarket, Goffs and Tattersalls is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I understand that my colleague, Deputy Dukes, proposed a number of amendments in the other House, which the Minister saw the wisdom of, in relation to increasing the borrowing limit, etc. It is important that the stud is able to build on its success. It has made some excellent purchases through the years and perhaps it could acquire a stallion even before his racing career has concluded. I am sure the Minister would support that in so far as it is possible.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is committed to this area and that he has the interests of the industry at heart. The entire industry &ndash; the stud farms, the racing game and the people who work in the yards &ndash; is an important employer. The success of Giant's Causeway, Istabraq and others has put Ireland on the map. Cheltenham, Kentucky, Vintage Crop in the Melbourne Cup, Sinnbar this year and other major races have all done much to promote the Irish thoroughbred. I know people who are coming here from Japan, Hong Kong and South America to buy some of the less fashionable horses but the more Irish thoroughbreds travel to these countries, the more that will benefit this country. Those of us who have a particular interest in racing like the sport for different reasons but as a spectator sport and a flag bearer for the country, I urge the Minister to take on board some of the points I have raised. I have pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1578" /> Walsh, to the House this evening and I welcome the legislation before us. It is part of a series of measures which has improved the industry. As a Member of this House for the past 11 years I can recall speaking on the 1993 Bill, where we did something similar to increase the capacity of the stud to operate commercially and be able to borrow the required moneys to allow it to operate in a competitive international environment. We have dealt with the Irish Horseracing Authority Bill and I know we will deal with Horse Racing Ireland.</P>
      <P>We have been fortunate that we have had continuity in terms of the Ministers we have had and their understanding of and support for the business, as well as their involvement in it. I am talking about Deputy Walsh, when he was previously Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Yates, when he was Minister and again back to the Minister, Deputy Walsh. We also have the critical support of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who lives in the area and who understands these issues. It is fortunate that we have had such people there. Very often in the past there was a misunderstanding about the industry and the people involved in it. In certain quarters there was a perception that it was somehow elitist, which, of course, it is not.</P>
      <P>Racing is one element of the industry but it is not the only element. It is a large industry both in terms of breeding and entertainment. I made this point in 1993 and it has taken a long time for it to filter through in terms of the promotion of racing and the provision of facilities to encourage people and families to go to race meetings. Last year when I visited Fairyhouse I was very taken with the fact that the tote hall was heated. If people involved in the horseracing business were told 15 years ago that the bar or tote hall on a racecourse would be heated they would have laughed heartily. There was almost a belief among the management of racecourses that there should not really be the facilities and comfort people expect and to which they are entitled. If such facilities are not provided, people will go elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill accepts the important reality that the breeding industry is a big money business. The Minister said that the winner of the Kentucky Derby costs $70 million. One could quote many similar examples. If this stud is to be a flagship for the industry it must have the resources to compete in the market and represent Ireland effectively at the highest level within the industry. It is about creating and maintaining an image of excellence. This is a significant image as it is the only one many people have of Ireland. This is the image of Ireland which is projected in Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada and other countries where there is bloodstock and racing. The survey conducted by the thoroughbred development company established in County Kildare confirmed that the dominant <Col N="1579" /> image of County Kildare is of thoroughbreds and horses. This is why the company has created the thoroughbred county.</P>
    <P>Given that this is a big money industry, increasing the thresholds for the share capital and borrowings is important. The Fine Gael press office was somewhat disingenuous in its press release which quotes Deputy Dukes as saying he had secured an increase in the company's share capital from £10 million to £30 million. The figure in the Bill is £25 million and the Minister can take credit for at least half of the money. Deputy Dukes cannot take credit for it all. He also said he had secured agreement to increase the company's borrowing limit from £5 million to £30 million. The figure in the Bill is £20 million. It is correct that the limits were increased but it is disingenuous to issue press releases which make claims which are not strictly true. The amount was increased in 1993 from £500,000 to £5 million. This shows how far we have come over the past eight years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ability of the stud to create subsidiary companies. This is important in the context of the Japanese Gardens and St. Fiachra's Garden. I attended the opening of St. Fiachra's Garden which has the capacity to do what the Japanese Gardens did in terms of attracting visitors to the stud. Martin Hallinan who designed the garden and the people associated with it deserve much credit. It is different from the Japanese Gardens and complements the tourism product.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments on the number of tourists. The tourism turn-over is high but the figure of £78,000 for revenue generated is less than one would expect. This is an aspect that should be looked at. The stud and farm generated £645,000 in 1999, which was up on the figure for the previous year. I note that the Exchequer, in its munificence, gave it back £23,000 by way of over paid tax; it must be a compliant taxpayer in addition to all its other attributes.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the case made by the Minister for the equine museum. Last year I brought an American visitor to the National Stud. The part which fascinated him most was the Arkle skeleton and the associated displays. There is huge potential in this area as part of the overall tourism package and I agree with the Minister that it should be expanded. The revenue generated from the disposal of the land could be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The RACE school, which is associated with the stud, does a good job but I would like to see the educational aspect developed. A third level course on equine science is run in Limerick but some young people come into the industry at a lower level. We are all aware of how stable lads were treated. Happily that era is ending, which is as it should be. There is a capacity to improve the ethos and experise within the industry. The question of a farrier course also arises in this con<Col N="1580" /> text. This was dealt with during the debate in the other House.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live there know that God blessed County Kildare with the limestone soil, grass and climate to create the resource that is the bloodstock industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any chance he would throw a drop on the footballers to give them that vital bit of edge?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be another deity at work in the case of the footballers. We are getting there but we have a bit further to go. However, we have achieved more than we did in the past.</P>
      <P>To put the importance of the industry to County Kildare into context, KELT, the Leader company, commissioned a study which revealed some surprising facts which might not be readily appreciated. One is that the bloodstock industry is much more important to County Kildare in employment terms than farming. This is not something one would readily think of. In 1975 there were 5,600 farmers in the county and this had decreased to 3,300 by 1991. Obviously this figure has decreased further with the developments which have taken place since. There are approximately 4,000 jobs in agriculture. The study carried out by the Kildare Horse Development Company showed there were 5,500 direct jobs in the equine industry and 10,000 in associated industries and services. There are 162 stud farms in the county, covering 22,000 acres, and a quarter of the national population of brood mares. In 1998 more than 1,000 horses, almost a quarter of the national figure, were trained there. One can see from these figures how hugely significant the industry is to the welfare of the county.</P>
      <P>During the debate in the Dáil, Deputies congratulated John Oxx and His Highness the Aga Khan on their marvellous achievement with Sinndar and Ted Walsh for his achievements during the year. People in County Kildare were very proud of these achievements and it is only right that Ted Walsh has been chosen as Kildare Man of the Year.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes made an important point I wish to take up. Following the Olympic Games there was much laudatory comment on the RTE coverage. The Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe is the equine equivalent of the Olympic Games and it was terrible that we had to watch the race on BBC2. This race is the pinnacle of excellence, yet RTE did not cover it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naas and Punchestown have done a tremendous job in improving facilities and making it comfortable for people to go to race meetings. During wet days we no longer get bogged down in the carpark at Punchestown. We can move around in comfort. Dermot Cox and the other people involved in Punchestown deserve a great deal of credit because they started the ball rolling. They <Col N="1581" /> could not have done this without Government assistance. Naas racecourse also received assistance. The atmosphere at Punchestown has been transformed and it can compete with the best. It is the Cheltenham of Ireland. The comparison is somewhat invidious because huge numbers go to Cheltenham, but it is a genuine comparison. It competes effectively and we can be proud of what has happened there.</P>
    <P>The sixth Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies reported in March 1990 and made recommendations. I am glad quite a few of those recommendations have been adopted. Others may still merit examination.</P>
    <P>Earlier I talked about the education aspect. The report recommended that the National Stud should expand its role and become an academy that would develop the skills and expertise of those already working in the sector. It also mentioned the development of the equine tourism package, of which St. Fiachra's Gardens is part.</P>
    <P>The committee mentioned the museum which the Minister referred to earlier. It also mentioned setting up a body to implement its proposals. I am not sure if that is necessary because the board of the National Stud has done an excellent job. We are fortunate to have Mrs. Chryss O'Reilly as its chairman. She has been instrumental in bringing some of the very good stallions we mentioned earlier to the stud. She has provided huge support to the stud and her work should be recognised. Her predecessor, Dr. David Schubotham, did immense work. It is significant that one of the submissions to the fifth Oireachtas joint committee was made by Mr. John Oxx, then chairman of the stud.  </P>
    <P>I remember saying on the last occasion we discussed this issue that it was spectacular to lose money on 1,000 acres of prime Kildare farmland. The reasons for this were that the stud had to pay a hefty rental fee and the rest of the money was invested in bloodstock. Running a stud is not as simple as farming. The stud's record over the years in terms of the revenue it has generated is impressive. There have been hiccups along the way, with two years of great losses. We can, however, take great satisfaction from the way successive boards have managed the stud's affairs.</P>
    <P>In 1915 Colonel Hall-Walker decided to hand the stud over to the Government of the day. He wanted to augment the skills and expertise that were necessary for the creation of military cavalry horses. It is extraordinary that the British controlled this property until 1945 when the National Stud Bill was enacted. They rented it to the Irish State during the 1920s and the stud company was formed in 1946. I do not know if Colonel Hall-Walker knew what he was getting into when he made his original bequest to the State.</P>
    <P>I noted at the time Mr. Oxx made his contribution in 1998 he said that the National Stud could not afford the luxury of a flagship stallion. That was said in the context of the sale of Ahonoora for £7 million. At the time it was stated that the stud could not justify keeping a horse <Col N="1582" /> worth that much. Thankfully, our economic circumstances have changed to such a degree that the State would not want to get its grubby paws on £7 million or on the several millions of pounds that will be generated from the sale of the land.</P>
    <P>A happy outcome from all this is that Ahonoora begot Indian Ridge in 1985. Thank God the stud kept Ahonoora for two extra years and Indian Ridge stands at the National Stud. The contribution Seán Coughlan has made in that regard was referred to by Senator Ó Fearghail.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people involved in the governance of the stud. I also congratulate its manger, Mr. John Clarke, and the staff. We should not forget that the stud injects about £1 million into the economy of Kildare in terms of wages. Senator Ó Fearghail referred to the Kildare bypass. The Minister has enough confidence in the stud's board and management to ensure that the money is used to develop it without putting caveats on it.</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said about sections 2(4) and 2(5), that they do not impose the restriction suggested on Report Stage in the Dáil. It will, however, make operating the stud problematic in the future, particularly with regard to the lands between the motorway and Kildare town. Senator Ó Fearghail's suggestion that this land be considered for building purposes is the only realistic course of action. We all know of cases where it has become almost impossible, if not impossible, to operate a working stud which is surrounded by urban development. Looking further down the road, if the motorway is built through that part of Kildare, there must be question marks about the capacity of the stud to continue to operate. The Japanese Gardens, St. Fiachra's Gardens and some of the lands around the stud and its buildings can be retained. The operation of a stud farm has become extremely difficult. I do not know where we will find 900 acres of prime agricultural land within five miles of Kildare. Some consideration will have to be given to this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of Horse Racing Ireland. Again, we are back to money and the need for it. We want the industry to thrive and develop. We also want owners, trainers and everyone involved in the industry to be able to make a living. The HRI will provide a unified system of developing, financing and administering the sport and the industry.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to a unique event. Earlier someone spoke about the grand alliance syndicate. On 11 October in a very unique cross-party gesture a press release was issued expressing strong support for the innovative proposals put forward by the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development and Finance for the future administration of funding for racing. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development had an unprecedented impact on the Houses when he got three Cabinet Ministers, one Minister of State and many <Col N="1583" /> Deputies and Senators from various parties to support his initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be congratulated on securing such unique cross-party support.</P>
      <P>It was extraordinary to see people protesting outside the Turf Club at the Curragh. No one expected to see it. However, it demonstrated the feeling within the industry. That does not take away from the contribution made by the Turf Club to racing, and the Minister would not suggest that it does so. In terms of stewarding services, for a long time the Turf Club has tried to ensure proper racing standards, and this has been acknowledged. It is time we moved forward on this issue. The Minister was correct to do what he did and I applaud him for his initiative. I am sure we will have an opportunity to debate this matter in greater detail when the legislation comes back to us.</P>
      <P>The national hunt is another aspect of the stud's operations that could be expanded. This is my favourite aspect of the stud. There are four stallions based around the country. Perhaps more could be done in this area. I want to know how the non-thoroughbred industry can be developed. I am aware that the National Stud cannot cope with every aspect, but we should focus more on the national hunt.</P>
      <P>The issue of foal levies was raised in the other House. I agree with some of the comments made in that regard. Syndication is a very important aspect of the stud's work. It would allow the stud to stand some of the best stallions.</P>
      <P>Privatisation was mentioned in several of the earlier reports of the committee. The stud is not a proper vehicle for privatisation. I am enthusiastic about privatisation in general but the stud can fulfil its objectives best, as defined in the original 1945 Act, by remaining in State ownership. The late Tom Coleman, a farmer from Meath, said the road to ruin was fast women, slow horses and fattening cattle. I have experienced two of these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have heard me say this in the House previously. Fattening cattle is one of the recipes on the road to ruin as are slow horses. Hopefully, with the benefit of the Minister's expertise, his support for the industry and the input of the National Stud the horses will run a little faster and the horse I brought to Tipperary racetrack on one memorable occasion might be able to run around the course a little faster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> It is totally unsatisfactory that if one is a small owner who brings a horse to a racetrack anywhere, one cannot park one's car in comfort, obtain a race card when one passes through the turnstile and grab a bite to eat or have a cup of tea. That is minimal and on the memorable occasion I rushed from my home to see the race in Tipperary, a man in a white coat in the car park told me I could not enter. I had a pass to get through the gate but there was no race card. Perhaps the racecourse owners might give a little credence to the input of the small owner to the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I listened with interest to the debate and my two colleagues from Kildare and you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, expressed their concerns about the happenings at the National Stud and at racecourses. I want to impress on the Minister that we breed good horses in west Cork and in Cork generally. There are good enthusiasts there. Ms Donegan from my home town of Bandon performed with excellence at the Sydney Olympics on a horse called Don't Step Back. A second horse, Customer Line, bred in Bandon by Mr. and Mrs. Tim Horgan and ridden by David O'Connor, equally excelled.</P>
      <P>Horseracing enthusiasts, especially those in Kildare, must be offered assistance. There are problems in Kildare as a result of bypasses, the destruction of property and a dearth of land for car parking and so on. Perhaps Denis McCarthy from Clonakilty who owns a farm near Leopardstown could be consulted, but in the absence of agreement we will facilitate the entire industry in Cork. We have no problem providing the 800 acres of good limestone land required and we will facilitate the Minister in every way to ensure the industry grows.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister because he has been open and receptive in regard to ideas and amendments. He steered the industry well in 1993 and between 1998 and today and I look forward to more legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. J. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators for their excellent, positive and knowledgeable contributions. I doubt there is a House of Parliament in any democracy that could have such an informed discussion on the equine industry. It is fitting because the industry covers a range of activities which involve approximately 25,000 people, including those working in training and breeding establishments, bookmakers and at racecourses. There is hardly a town or village in Ireland which does not have a connection with a thoroughbred or non-thoroughbred. I am enthused by the support for the National Stud and the Irish horse generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation relates to the marketplace and one needs to be at the upper end of the market. Increasing borrowing and share capital are needed. The National Stud has helped to promote <Col N="1585" /> and sustain the image of the thoroughbred racehorse as well as Irish racing generally on the world stage.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of Sinndar's unique achievement of winning the Epsom Derby, the Irish Derby and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Sinndar was bred at Giltown, County Kildare, trained by a Kildare man, John Oxx, and ridden by a Kildare resident, Johnny Murtagh, although he hails from Meath originally. It was a shame that RTÉ did not broadcast all three races because the Irish flag was flown before an international audience. Ireland reached the pinnacle of excellence in horse racing. We have few enough international brand leaders in any industry but the Irish horse is one.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the bypass of Kildare town cuts through the Curragh. However, following the positive discussion in the Dáil, the stud will be allowed to acquire additional alternative land to further develop its activities such as its tourism-related activities, including the museum.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes was supportive and I appreciate a number of points he made about the stud, the racing industry and Tipperary racecourse, in particular. Additional money will be allocated to the new body, Horseracing Ireland, and its role will be to ensure it is distributed properly and various racecourses are upgraded. We will ensure not alone that they are good courses but the facilities will be improved. I recall attending a racecourse a number of years ago which had no heating. We tried to light a superser gas heater but after a while we realised there was no cylinder in it. Thankfully that day is gone and nice facilities are available now.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail referred to the projects in the IHA's strategic plan, which have been surpassed. A number of Senators complimented the board and management of the IHA, including Dr. Michael Osborne, John Clarke, manager, Chryss O'Reilly, chairman and her predecessor, David Shubotham. Chryss O'Reilly, for example, has an encyclopaedic knowledge of pedigrees and blood lines worldwide and she has used her excellent contacts to acquire valuable animals for the stud. She is a unique asset to the horseracing industry and to the stud and we are fortunate that she gives of her time as chairperson of the board of the stud.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the cost of fees. Generally the cost is at an economic level. Fees for national hunt horses are set below commercial rates to help people. Horses from the stud are strategically located at different stud farms around Ireland. Senator Dardis and others stated that national hunt racing should be promoted and not given a lesser role in the industry. Most people prefer national hunt racing to flat racing. It is important that the greater number of people who follow national hunt racing are supported.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you expressed concern about Leopardstown racecourse. I will take that up with the board of the racecourse because it <Col N="1586" /> has tremendous facilities and it would be a shame if the view of the track was distorted.</P>
    <P>As regards Limerick, perhaps it would help if there were good agronomists there because the problem is that clover has grown there at a tremendous rate and the grass growth is not very good. They have not been able to race there as soon as they would like. It is hoped to hold the inaugural meeting there next spring if it does not rain continuously until then.</P>
    <P>The grand alliance was mentioned. The Leas-Chathaoirleach is the kingpin of that, and I wish it well. I noted the Leas-Chathaoirleach did not indicate the likely outcome of the race.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

      <P>I might have a private word with him to see if a little modest investment might be worthwhile during the Christmas meeting. I wish the alliance luck because it resulted in the unique cross-party support we received during the debate on the future structures for horseracing.</P>
      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach also mentioned horses such as Giant's Causeway. It is unique in this commercial world that horses such as Giant's Causeway, Montjeu, Sinndar and the world's premier horse, last year, Daylami, have been stood in a small country such as Ireland. We have the world's best blood lines, and I express appreciation to stud managers for that.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned the RACE school and a number of the other activities in Kildare. Early next year we will be allowed construct a master farriery adjacent to the RACE school which has produced many outstanding jockeys, including Johnny Murtagh. It is amazing there is a shortage of blacksmiths in a country such as Ireland. Farriery skills are scarce throughout the world and blacksmiths are well remunerated. Were it not for objections to the farriery school last year, it would be in place now. We have eventually obtained planning permission and I will provide the money for it in the next development programme. That will come through next year and the farriery school will be provided.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis made some interesting remarks about the history of the stud and Colonel Hall-Walker. Many people believe that only the ports stayed in British control until 1939 when places such as Castletownbere and others were handed over. The Irish National Stud stayed in British control a little longer, up to the mid-1940s. It was handed over in 1943 and the legislation covering it was introduced and passed in 1946. I made the point in the other House that the National Stud was bequeathed to the State in the same year as I was born. Deputy Dukes, uncharitably and, I hope, facetiously, said that Kildare got a better bargain.</P>
