      <P>I have to announce that the following Members have been elected to fill the casual vacancies in the membership of the Seanad to which the resolution of Seanad Éireann on 20 April 2000 has reference:</P>
      <P>Industrial and Commercial Panel, Oireachtas Sub-Panel: Jim Glennon.</P>
      <P>Agricultural Panel, Oireachtas Sub-Panel: Seán Ó Fearghail.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Senators Glennon and Ó Fearghail were introduced to the Cathaoirleach and then took their seats.</i>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil, and as Leader of Seanad Éireann, it is a great honour and pleasure to welcome two new Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Glennon's family has a history in local affairs and politics for many years in north County Dublin and Skerries.  I also welcome the Senator as a distinguished sportsman who has achieved great success.  In becoming a Member of this House he brings great honour to his family, to Skerries and to north County Dublin and we look forward to his contributions on behalf of his people, his party and his constituency.</P>
      <P>Senator Seán Ó Fearghail from south County Kildare is no stranger to Members of Seanad Éireann.  He has been a most courteous, decent and hard working local authority member for many years and has been helpful to all Members in the processing of legislation.  The Senator has worked tirelessly on Kildare County Council and I wish him well.  He brings great honour to his wife, his family, his parish and the people of Kildare who will be proud they have another voice in the House, in addition to that of Senator Dardis.</P>
      <P>On behalf of all Members, I wholeheartedly welcome the Senators and look forward to their contributions on legislation over the coming years.</P>

      <P>I join the Leader in welcoming Senators Glennon and Ó Fearghail.  On behalf of Fine Gael I offer them our heartiest and warmest congratulations on their election last week.  Senator Ó Fearghail is already a public representative.  I do not think Senator Glennon is a public representative but I may be corrected on that point.  It is always a great honour to be elected to the Oireachtas and to be part of the law-making body of one's country.  Whether one's career goes up or down afterwards, it is always a memory to be treasured and of which to be proud.  I wish the Senators every success and good luck.  May they have many long and happy years in the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Senators I welcome Senators Glennon and Ó Fearghail to the House.  Their election was a great surprise as we knew the contest was going to be hard fought.  However, we are pleased to have them in the House and I am sure they will greatly assist their colleagues on the Government side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I wish to be associated with the words of welcome expressed and to congratulate the Senators on their election.  Senator Glennon was a distinguished sportsman who played for Ireland.  Senator Ó Fearghail is a distinguished local politician.  I am sure they will make their mark in this House and in national politics.  I wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the leaders in welcoming Senators Ó Fearghail and Glennon.  I have known Senator Ó Fearghail for a long time as we share the same local electoral area in Kildare County Council.  The Senator is a hard working and effective county councillor.  He is leader of the Fianna Fáil group on the council, has been a distinguished chairman of the council and is one of the best councillors.  The elections are in the past and I wish him well and assure him of my co-operation, and that of other Members, in his efforts in the House.</P>
      <P>I also welcome Senator Glennon.  The Senator and I rubbed shoulders in the past when I had the whistle and he was in the second row. If he can look after himself nearly as well in here as he did in the Irish second row, he will be very well qualified.  I would not accuse him of indulging in off the ball tactics.  He would not do that.  We are pleased to see him here.  It is a proud day for the newly elected Senators and we wish them well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody involved, including the returning officer and her staff, for the most efficient manner in which they conducted affairs on Friday night at the count.  I also thank my Leader, Senator Cassidy, and all his colleagues for the tremendous support they gave me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come into politics at a time when there is a degree of cynicism about it generally and its various institutions.  All I can say to the House on <Col N="963" /> my first day is that I will strive my utmost to work with colleagues on all sides to uphold the fine traditions of democracy in this country, which are under attack from all sides at present.  I look forward to working with the Chair and other Members of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>

      <P>Having spent a fairly long apprenticeship in local government over the past 15 years, it is a particular privilege to have been elected by my colleagues to serve a tenure of office in Seanad Éireann.  I very much look forward to the time I will spend here working with colleagues on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I have a particular memory at this moment of the late Senator Paddy McGowan whose passing created the vacancy I was elected to fill.  Today I think of him in particular and members of his family.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to appoint a speech teacher to the staff of St. Mary's school for deaf girls in Cabra.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 3, No. 2 and No. 22, motion No. 23.  No. 3, the Aviation Regulation Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, will be taken today; No. 2, Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, will be taken today; No. 22, motion No. 23, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us.  I raise with the Leader an issue of urgent public importance, that of yet another attack on two elderly people living in a remote area and the obvious inadequacy of policing in such areas.   We are all aware that the level of policing throughout the countryside is inadequate due to changes in Garda deployment patterns in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few months ago there was the horrendous case involving a person, whom some of us knew, in Ballygar in County Galway and in recent days there was another attack on two elderly brothers in County Meath.  Will the Leader agree to a <Col N="964" /> debate on rural policing, including the deployment of Garda resources in rural areas, and the security of elderly people living alone in remote areas who are vulnerable?  I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into this House to explain what action he and the Garda Commissioner are taking to address this problem.  The horrendous outrages that have occurred in recent years do not appear to have elicited a response in terms of  Garda activity or the deployment of gardaí in a manner that would assist in increasing the security of elderly people living alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is also agreeable to us.  We share the concerns expressed by Senator Connor.  Perhaps the Leader will contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and arrange a debate on that matter.</P>
      <P>I bring to the attention of the Leader the concern expressed in the print media in particular about a doctor who was struck off the British Medical Register who can come here and practise as a pharmacist.</P>
      <P>Changes to the medical practitioners Act, the pharmacy Act and, indeed, new Acts have been promised for some time.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children how far work on these Acts has progressed, given that they have been under consideration for at least a decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the remarks of Senator Connor in respect of attacks on the elderly.  I also request that the Minister be invited to the House at the earliest possible date.  The recent brutal attack which led to the death of an elderly man is only one of many which have taken place.  The victim support group has given a figure of 1,400 attacks on the elderly in 1999.  The number of murders has increased from ten in 1997 to 21 last year, an increase of over 100%.  The increase in violent crime is at its&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pre-empt the debate which has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely explaining why I want the Leader to invite the Minister to this House. The increase in violent crime is at its highest level in the history of the State.  There is a crisis and the Minister has not said a word about it.  He has spoken about other types of crime but has not said a word about violent crime in rural or urban areas.  We should have an urgent debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise concerns an item discussed last week which is still on the Order Paper, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000.  A strike is taking place in the Taoiseach's constituency where a multinational firm, Aldi, has refused trade union recognition and has sacked five workers because they joined or stated their intention of joining a union. If this legislation were expedited this <Col N="965" /> multinational company, which is German based and gives trade union rights to its employees in Germany, would have to negotiate.  The earliest this matter can be expedited the better.  Will the Leader indicate when the Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken and if it will get through the Houses before the summer recess?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend my support to colleagues on the other side regarding the horrific attack over the weekend on the elderly.  Coupled with that is the attempt to close down rural post offices and banks. It is time to have a rethink in that area. I heard the Minister say this morning that the elderly are storing their money at home rather than depositing it in the local village or whatever.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the outflow of white collar workers from the Civil Service into business orientated types of work. If I put on my other hat as a career guidance person, we need people who have a natural aptitude for the Civil Service. I am concerned that those leaving school will be lured by the financial rewards rather than opting to exercise their ability and aptitude for the type of administration which the Civil Service offers.   Given that the leaving certificate examination has commenced, this is an appropriate time to debate this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue which I think the House should debate.  We should look at the system of electing people in by-elections to this House. It is quite extraordinary that this has become a self-perpetuating body.  I am not sure the general public realise that, in the case of by-elections, Members are elected simply by Senators and Deputies casting their votes and electing people who are acceptable to us.  Neither the general public nor the nominating bodies have any say.  While this is no reflection on the candidates, it means that, in effect, the results are predestined.  It means that the Government always gets its people elected.  We know who will be elected and there is no contest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>By-elections to the Seanad are governed by legislation.  If a vacancy occurs on the nominating body sub-panel the nominating bodies have a say in who the candidates are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about nominating.  I am saying that the election is predestined because of the people who have votes.  I know about the nominating bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> We ought to examine this particular system.  It requires legislation of course and legislation is what this House is concerned with.  There was no chance that any other candidates were going to win these elections because they were <Col N="966" /> predestined. There was no chance that any Independent&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no chance of an Independent or a Fine Gael candidate being elected.  We ought to have a serious by-election where we consult far more widely&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation is something with which this House concerns itself from time to time.  I have now finished and I know that you, a Chathaoirligh, will not allow any further debate on the matter. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the recent statement by the British Prime Minister apologising to the Guildford Four.  It is welcome certainly, albeit late.  It is a small recognition of the great injustice done to those four people.  It is true to say that it is never too late to do the right thing.</P>
      <P> I support strongly the call for a debate on rural policing.  I happened to know Paddy Logan who worked in my local parish many years ago when I was a young lad.  He was an absolute gentleman.</P>
      <P> In recent weeks my attention has been drawn to the practice of stealing small pedigree dogs and reselling them at car boot sales.  The only way to discontinue this practice is for nobody to buy dogs in such locations.  One could well be buying back one's own pet.  Perhaps we can raise the matter when the Minister attends the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Connor in seeking an early debate on the recent spate of crimes in rural areas.  Last week I attended a Women's Aid conference and learned that 54 women have died as a result of domestic violence since 1996.  It is a shocking statistic and the Minister should attend the House so that we can work collectively on ways of reducing levels of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Leader to the figures published today by the Central Statistics Office, which show that over the last 12 months practically 100,000 new jobs were created.  I congratulate the Government and everyone involved in that regard.  May I also remind the Government, however, that there are 40,000 long-<Col N="967" /> term unemployed people who have not been touched by the success story of the Celtic tiger economy?  The massive cost of supporting unemployment in the past has been reduced.  Can we, however, find a way to divert the even larger amounts required to help those who have been excluded from our economic success and who have not been able to succeed?  Instead of congratulating ourselves and boasting about the employment figures we should do something about the long-term unemployed who have been left behind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader, for the third time, if he will ascertain for me and for adult education providers if and when the White Paper on adult education will be published. Will it be available before the summer recess? Programmes are now being formulated by adult education providers.  There is a vacuum and people would like to know where they stand.  It would be appreciated if the Leader found out from the relevant Minister if the White Paper on adult education will be published before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on security for the elderly but I would like to widen it to include the closure of post offices and banks in rural areas.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the funding he has allocated to security and alarm systems for the elderly.  This is a marvellous achievement which is being operated through local communities.  However, I urge that when cases come to court judges deal with them and apply the full rigours of the law.  It is time that the do-gooder system of psychiatric tests is abolished and that these people are made pay for the crimes they commit.  It is scandalous that they are getting away with them and are out in a week or a fortnight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>They should be imprisoned and made to pay for their crimes.  The laws are there but the judges and our do-gooder society seem to be going soft.  It is time the kid gloves came off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about people whom the Celtic tiger economy has left behind.  I wish to speak about those who have never seen it and to whom it remains an exotic and unknown species, the homeless.  When I raised this matter last week, I did not realise it was the tip of the iceberg.  The Leader has promised a debate but I ask him to expedite it because the problem is escalating.  The closure of two hostels is nothing compared to what I have discovered since.  This is a huge problem.  As I said before, we are becoming like Calcutta without the heat.  It is time the matter was addressed in a serious manner.</P>

      <P>We have had two Bacon reports which, sadly, were not a panacea and the housing crisis worsens by the day.  We have now been promised a third Bacon report.  Will the Leader inform us when this report will be available, its contents, or at least its highlights and if, when announced, it will be adopted as Government policy?  It is unfair that Members should have to rely on leaks which may or may not be accurate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Health and Children the need for an urgent review of rehabilitation services nationally?  Young victims of traffic accidents in my area and throughout the country are unable to get beds in the rehabilitation centre in Dún Laoghaire because it does not have the staff or facilities to provide the services needed.  This is a national disgrace which needs to be tackled immediately.</P>

      <P>I would like a debate on the startling heart disease statistics, particularly given the launch this month of a healthy eating campaign.  It is unacceptable that we have the highest rate of cardiac arrest and heart failure in the EU.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Connor, Henry, Costello, Ormonde, Glynn and Jackman called for a debate on the vicious attack that took place on two elderly men in Castlejordan over the weekend.  As Senator Glynn said, they are neighbours of ours and it is regrettable this happened.  The beating up of people in their senior years is despicable.  I will allow time for a debate on rural policing.  That would be very worthwhile and all Members could contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong views on the changing society that is emerging with the Celtic tiger.  It is mind-boggling at times to try to understand why these things are happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join the call by Senators for banks and post offices to be kept available to people in rural areas.  The Government should look at that and <Col N="969" /> we will debate it in the House in the presence of the Minister.  I will pass Senator Henry's strong views on the doctor who was struck off the medical register to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello inquired when the Industrial Relations Bill, 2000, will return to the House. I am pleased to inform the House this will occur next Tuesday, 13 June.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on white collar workers leaving the Civil Service for the private sector. I will try to facilitate that debate.  Last Thursday we had a debate on the economy.  We might have a debate on that issue before the end of the session if possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross wants us to look at the selection of candidates in Seanad by-elections and general elections. I know this issue is being examined at present, including the Independent benches. I will return to the House when I have further progress to report.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Ridge welcomed the news of the 100,000 new jobs, which is due to the success of the Government's policies over the past 12 months. I understand that the biggest fall is in long-term unemployment. We can debate that in the House and I would value the contributions of the very many Senators who are creating employment. That would be a very worthwhile debate, due to the success of the economy, and I will allow time for it.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator McDonagh's views to the Minister and make inquiries regarding the White Paper on education. In reply to Senator Ridge, I have given an undertaking that we will have a debate on homelessness. I am discussing it with her party leader and it will definitely take place in this session.</P>
    <P> I will pass Senator Hayes's views to the Minister and see how we can meet his request.  Senator Coghlan wants a debate on the third Bacon report.  It has not been published yet&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Regulator' means chairperson of the Commission;".</P>
      <P>This Bill is about regulation and its objective is to introduce regulations and to appoint a regulator.  However, the word "regulator" is not mentioned in the Bill even though its title is the Aviation Regulation Bill.  On Committee Stage, the Minister explained in detail what was involved with regard to the commission and the equal status of its members.  The chairman was there simply to bring order to the management of the commission's affairs and how it does business.</P>
      <P>However, there is a need for a more simple or recognisable term in the Bill.  While I appreciate that the chairman will bring order to the commission's daily management in terms of the people who will meet with the commission to make their cases, it is always simpler to address an issue to one individual rather than to a group.  I am introducing the term in the interests of simplicity for the consumer.  I hope the Minister will see her way to making it simpler to approach the commission, particularly in the context of passengers and users of the airports having recourse to the commission.  The amendment might be of some assistance in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 reads, "The Minister may give such general policy directions to the Commission as he or she considers appropriate.".  My amendment No. 10 seeks to be more specific and give some focus and direction to the general policy directions referred to in the Bill.  The Minister in her amendment referred to one policy direction, including directions in respect of the contribution of airports to the regions in which they are located.  I support her amendment which is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other areas to which I referred are also valuable.  Paragraph (<i>a</i>) reads, "to foster a strong and competitive Irish airline industry by provid<Col N="973" /> ing enough airport capacity".  My amendment seeks to look at the impact of the aviation industry on the environment, to make the best use of existing facilities, to encourage the use and development of regional airports, which the Minister has taken on board, and to ensure the highest standards of safety in accordance with internationally accepted rules and standards.  These are all areas that are desirable.  My amendment seeks to indicate the categories with which the Minister will deal when considering policy matters she might consider appropriate to the commission rather than simply dealing with general policy directions.</P>
    <P> I welcome amendment No. 9 and perhaps the Minister will refer to the other amendments.  The issue of the environment is not the Minister's brief but perhaps she will discuss it, together with the other issues, with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Perhaps the issues specified could be considered appropriate matters to be considered in the context of making policy decisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the general essence of the amendment I tabled on the previous occasion in relation to the significance of the regions when giving directions to the commission in deciding what direction to take.  I appreciate that the Minister has introduced this amendment.  She has not taken my amendment on board directly but the basic substance of it is now included.  Perhaps for semantic purposes there is a little variation of the wording.  It might not be seen as kosher to take a verbatim amendment from the Opposition.  I appreciate the slight change in the wording, although the substance of the amendments is similar.  This is a very important subsection, given the manner in which airports affect the economic development of a region in terms of technology, manufacturing and tourism. Shannon Airport in particular has played a hugely significant role in the development of the mid-west and, hopefully, will continue to do so in future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment on Report Stage, which corresponds with my amendment No. 29. I appreciate that she was open to the arguments put forward during the debate and has agreed to include such provision in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 13, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>)he or she or any member of his or her household is considering or in the process of acquiring land or property to which such a matter relates.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment again as it concerns a very serious matter. It relates to a conflict of interest and it is extremely important where a member of the commission, the staff of the commission or a member of their household is in the process of acquiring land or property to which such a matter relates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I raise this from experience as a public representative on a local authority where matters can be considered in relation to properties of which people who are not necessarily the registered owners intend to become the registered owners if a certain occurrence or development takes place. Where people are actively pursuing the acquisition of property while parallel to that another development is being proposed or processed, under the law as it stands there is no conflict of interest but in reality there is. While one can say that there is no conflict of interest because the individual concerned is not the registered owner of the property, in reality he or she will become the registered owner if a certain development proceeds. In such a case there is an onus on those involved to declare their interest in the property.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to include the paragraph proposed in the Bill. The matter has arisen in other areas and may arise in this instance. The Minister would avoid any such conflict of interest by accepting the amendment. Given her long experience of public life at local and national level she appreciates where I am coming from and the value of what is being said about the need to include the paragraph proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment which is valuable. On Committee Stage the Minister said it would be very difficult to tie down an amendment which contains the words, &ldquo;a member of the household is considering&rdquo;. An amendment containing the words &ldquo;is in the process of acquiring land or property&rdquo; is, however, much more specific. A person who has initiated a process of acquisition stands to benefit from a decision that may be taken by the commission. Unless it is covered elsewhere in the Bill to our satisfaction it appears the matter has been overlooked by the Minister. In providing for the disclosure of interests it is proper to provide for the disclosure of interests that are in the process of being acquired. I urge the Minister to consider accepting this worthwhile amendment.</P>

I have direct experience of this matter. On making further inquiries the bland answer was that at the time the person concerned was not the registered owner of the land. Technically speaking, at the time the person involved did not have an interest in the land and did not have to declare an interest. However, that person was actively interested in promoting the land for a particular development and there was a conflict of interest. However, technically under the law there was no such conflict.</P>

      <P>This amendment, in conjunction with the earlier amendment on the regional remit and a later amendment, was the subject of most debate during the previous discussion on the Bill. This amendment is based on the debate in the House, as are amendments Nos. 34 and 36. This amendment is similar to those tabled by Senators Taylor-Quinn and O'Dowd. It is a matter of the unity of ownership of the airports and treating them as a group. I ask Senators to accept that amendment No. 18 is an attempt to mirror the thrust of amendments Nos. 34 and 36 and of the debate in the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment because this is one of the most important sections of the Bill, particularly regarding the operation of Irish airports. It is very important that freedom is given to the regulator to allow him or her to pull together the aggregate of all the airports so the company is in a position to impose the appropriate levy in the interests of sustainability and equitable development. This amendment will <Col N="978" /> strengthen the Bill. It enhances the role of the regulator and gives the regulator more discretion in terms of balanced judgments and determinations as to how airports proceed. I am delighted the Minister listened to the arguments put forward and commend her for introducing this amendment.</P>

We had a long debate regarding how long an amended determination remains in force. An amended determination remains in force until the end of the original five year period.

    <P>(<i>c</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(c)</i> above, the period of 28 days following the date of receipt of notice pursuant to <i>section 35(9)(a)</i> or the date of receipt of a request pursuant to <i> section 35(11)</i>; and</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) in respect of persons referred to in <i>subsection (2)(d) </i>above, the period of 28 days following the date of publication of the notice referred to in <i>section 35(9)(a).</i>(4) Notwithstanding an appeal under <i>subsection (1)</i> above by a person specified in <i>subsection (2)</i> and within the time specified in <i>subsection (3),</i> the appeal shall not affect the validity of the determination or amendment to a determination, and its operation unless, upon an application to the High Court, that Court suspends the determination or amendment to a determination until the appeal is determined or withdrawn.</P>
    <P>(5) The hearing by the High Court shall be a hearing on the merits of the case and the <Col N="983" /> parties shall be entitled to introduce all relevant matters whether or not those matters were presented to the Commission in relation to its determination, amendment or request.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was tabled on Committee Stage because of a strong belief in the need for an appeal process or a system under which air passengers or airport users can have a right of appeal. We discussed at length on Committee Stage a person's right to appeal a case to the High Court. People have a constitutional right to take a case to court and they should not be prohibited from doing so. The Minister made a strong argument that providing for such an appeal process would mean the courts would become the regulator. One could say that the courts could become the regulator or the adjudicator on every issue that arises. Surely people have a right of appeal. I appreciate that in many instances companies, rather than individual air passengers, may appeal under this legislation.</P>
    <P>A right to an appeal under the legislation applies only to a judicial review, which is a rare and unusual process. It is not used by many people and certainly not by those with limited finances. It is unsatisfactory to strictly confine the appeal mechanism available to a judicial review. It is necessary to have an appeal mechanism separate from a judicial review. What is proposed in this amendment may not be perfect. When the Minister takes this Bill in the Lower House, I hope she will be in a position to reconsider this matter. Seeking a judicial review is not as straightforward as one might think, rather it is a very expensive, lengthy and laborious process that can continue for years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a rarity. I know of another judicial review that was taken by a person in my constituency in relation to the Loran C mast on Loop Heap that continued for five years.</P>
      <P>Cases differ and companies could collapse during the process, not to mention individuals not having a right of appeal. A provision to provide such a right of appeal separate from a judicial review should be inserted in the Bill. This amendment may not be the answer. However, it highlights the need for an appeal system separate from a judicial review. One could proceed and provide for the insertion of this new section thereby providing people with a right of appeal to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People should not be prevented from taking a case to court. We all have that constitutional right, if we wish to avail of it. If one deems that there is a case to be heard one should have the freedom to take the case to court. Restricting the right of appeal to judicial review is not necessarily the correct measure. When the Minister takes the Bill in the other House she might arrange for a <Col N="984" /> group in her Department, a cross-departmental group or an independent group to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>If one is refused unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or a medical card, one has a right to appeal that decision. An individual right to such an appeal is probably different from a corporate right of appeal. We are not dealing only with companies here but air passengers and airport users in the broadest sense. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment or to give an assurance that she will accept the general thrust of the arguments put forward and reconsider this matter when the Bill goes to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with the proposal. If one cannot afford to pay one's water rates, one can appeal such a claim to the appropriate official in a county council. There is an appeal system in place for most measures, although I often wonder how successful people are in making appeals, particularly when an applicant is disallowed a medical card. Such appeals are supposed to be considered by the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, but I wonder if they are passed to the chief executive officer or whether the same administration deals with them.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as it stands, provides for three commissioners, robust consultation, the regulatory process options for a judicial review and after two years the regulator can intervene on his initiative or if an airline requests it. A basic thrust of decency underpinned the debate on Committee Stage. The Attorney General's office has said no to this proposal.</P>

      <P>In page 26, line 47, after &ldquo;regulations.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Such regulations shall not be made earlier than one month prior to the commencement of civil aviation operations at the relevant aerodrome.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this an important amendment. It is something most people would not notice and it would not appear relevant because what is being proposed here is an enabling section to the Bill which would allow the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Defence, to license and regulate a military airport, and Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, is the obvious one. Unfortunately the flight path of Baldonnel is in close proximity to the proposed 45,000 seat Eircom football stadium which is before South Dublin County Council for planning permission. The concern is that regulations could be made and a licence could be given now on a hypothetical basis that at some time in the future Baldonnel would become a commercial airport. These regulations might prescribe some matters in relation to aeronautical <Col N="986" /> safety standards at the aerodrome that might or might not be different from what is required for a military airport. The Air Corps at Baldonnel has stated there is no problem whatsoever with its flight paths in relation to the new Eircom park that is planned.</P>

      <P>&mdash;South Dublin County Council. Part of the objection was that it would interfere with the operations of the aerodrome. When the Air Corps made its submission it suggested that there were no problems with any of its activities in relation to the flight path. In respect of military matters, there was no problem, good, bad or indifferent. The Minister is proposing to enable herself and the Minister for Defence to make new regulations in respect of commercial activities in Baldonnel. This would happen obviously sometime in the future. The Minister for Defence could say to the Minister that he wished to see Baldonnel expanded and become a commercial airport and to have regulations put in place in regard to air safety standards or whatever, and the process would begin.</P>
      <P>While the planning permission is going through, the county council would have to wait and see whether it would have a prohibitive effect on the planning application. Obviously, if regulations were being discussed, it would have to wait for them. That would mean the stadium could not go ahead. The problem with the enabling legislation is that we could create a hypothetical situation where sometime in the future, Baldonnel might become a commercial airport. We do not know whether it will, but certainly a great deal of investment would be required before that would happen. It could not happen overnight, it may be years down the road. If the process of regulation began and the Minister for Defence was to seek it, it could mean that the planning application would be held up indeterminately.</P>
      <P>The focus of this amendment is that regulations should not be made earlier than one month prior to the commencement of operations, in other words that regulations cannot be made now on the hypothetical basis that at some future date the airport will become a commercial one.</P>

      <P>I formally second Senator Costello's amendment. The essence of what he said is wise. The differences between military and commercial aviation demands are considerable. Military aviation tactics and usage vary dramatically both in the type of aircraft used and the manoeuvres engaged in versus clear commercial activity. What Senator Costello said in regard to reducing the timeframe within which regulations can be made by the Department is highly commendable. We all know developments take place quickly and changing circumstances change the direction of situations overnight. To give directions at a time when nothing may happen for years, or even decades, would be unwise. What the Senator has said is commendable. If this were to proceed as it stands, it could restrict development in that part of Dublin and that would not be wise. The amendment deserves support.</P>

The Minister's intention is that this Bill should last a long time and that it will be secure. He put forward what he believes to be a problem if the changes occur and the Bill is not ready. I urge the Minister to reconsider whether there is some way in which she can put his mind at rest to overcome the problems he forecasts.</P>

However, the matter is outside my remit. The FAI is concerned that the Department of Defence will use section 46 &ndash; which amends the IAA Act to allow for the IAA to have civil jurisdiction over military aerodromes if the need arises &ndash; as a delaying tactic to oppose the FAI's plans to build a stadium at City West. They are concerned that any IAA role at Baldonnel would jeopardise their plans for the stadium. I think it only came in yesterday or the day before.</P>

      <P>It was in the last day or so, yes. The amendment is relatively new to me, although I can grasp the concept. I cannot accept it now but I will undertake to speak to the FAI to see if there is some way their fears can be allayed, even though the powers concerning that lie within the Department of Defence and the Minister for Defence. From what I can gather, the FAI sees in this section 46 a way of ensuring the right of the Department of Defence to underpin its already stated objection to the park. Is that correct?</P>

It is a pity that a Bill, which is trying to ensure that military airports can be developed on a commercial basis also, should be used to defeat the thrust of what is being done by the FAI. It can be invidious to raise the statements or actions of one Minister in the presence of another Minister in this House. However, if the Minister is prepared to speak to the FAI's chief executive, Mr. Bernard O'Byrne, to tease out the association's concerns about it, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

It is amazing what such a debate can achieve in providing knowledge to a Minister. I particularly liked the way in which people were prepared to meet one another half way if the idea was a good one. In tabling the Government amendments today, I tried to reflect the views of those who had tabled amendments earlier in the debate.</P>

I also thank her for the openness with which she has taken the legislation through the House. She was very open in debating the broad issues on Second Stage. Later, on Committee Stage, she accepted many amendments which is a credit to her and an example to her colleagues in Government. Suggestions coming from the Opposition are not necessarily always made just for the sake of opposition. I appreciate the fact that the Minister has accepted a number of amendments. I particularly commend her acceptance of two amendments, one which takes into consideration regional aspects when making assessments, and the other which takes into account the aggregate amount in assessing charges. A new section had to be created to deal with the latter amendment. Those amendments were influential in generally improving the Bill.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for agreeing to consider certain aspects of appeals and the possibility of conflicts of interest. It shows great openness and a maturity in politics that we could do with more of. I hope that people in Shannon in particular, and in Clare in general, will be pleased with what the Minister has done. We will make sure they are made aware of the fact that she came to the House with an open mind.</P>

I was delighted to share with my colleagues in putting forward views about amendments we felt were important. I am happy at the way the Minister dealt with Report Stage. She tried to accept views put forward in the best interests of what the regulator's office was set up to achieve. The Minister has set an important headline with this legislation, which I hope will be followed by many other Ministers.

      <P>In page 5, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) All nicotine replacement therapies shall be available from all commercial outlets selling cigarettes and tobacco.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We now realise that all cigarettes contain nicotine and are addictive. This amendment, which I am moving on behalf of Senator Avril Doyle, proposes that nicotine replacement therapies, which include forms of treatment other than patches, be sold where cigarettes and tobacco are available. These treatments would be an antidote to the risk to the health of those who buy tobacco and suffer from its consumption. They are sufferers because, as the Minister knows, illnesses associated with tobacco affect the heart and lungs, at great cost to the health care system. It is fair, just and sensible to have nicotine replacement therapies available from all commercial outlets selling cigarettes and tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable that nicotine replacement therapies should be available where nicotine products are available. If we are to be proactive in the fight against tobacco, which is the biggest killer in society in terms of legal drugs, it seems strange that we allow the sale and display of tobacco products in commercial outlets while not putting nicotine replacements by their side. The general medical services scheme, which was the subject of the first amendment, is the ideal way to do this by providing nicotine replacement therapy free of charge. Many of those on medical cards abuse cigarettes and tobacco to a greater extent than people in other parts of society. Nicotine replacement therapies should be promoted and nicotine products should not be displayed without giving people the opportunity to consider an alternative.</P>

      <P>This amendment would be a good one if there was any indication that nicotine replacement therapies really worked. In my experience, their success rate is not very high. However, there is a way around this. One must get them on prescription. If they were over the counter products, it would be reasonable. However, putting something on prescription which does not have a track record in dealing with tobacco addiction would not be right, fair or reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this issue on Second Stage and I <Col N="992" /> understand the concern and rationale behind the proposed amendment. However, there are reservations concerning public health in respect of the amendment. Nicotine replacement products were reclassified in 1996 from prescription only to over the counter sale in pharmacies. Because of the widespread effects of nicotine, particularly on the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, the gastro-intestinal system and on metabolism generally, I have been advised that the Irish Medicines Board and the Poisons Council may not easily agree to extend the availability of these products outside pharmacies, where the health implications for the patients seeking them would be considered. There is a question mark about making these products generally available because of their safety. We will keep the issue under continual review.</P>
      <P>If someone now tried to have a cigarette product licensed for general retail sale, they would find it difficult to get permission &ndash; I would argue they would not get permission. Basically, we are talking about a replacement therapy containing nicotine and we need to be careful about putting more nicotine products on the market, besides legalised cigarettes. We want to discontinue cigarette smoking and promote disincentives. The tobacco free policy group recognises the value of nicotine replacement therapy as one weapon in the battle against tobacco consumption. We will proceed on the basis of the recommendations of the Towards a Tobacco Free Society Group, which means developing nicotine replacement therapies in the context of the GMS while creating an intolerance in society towards tobacco smoking. I would need to consult with the IMB and the Poisons Council before we make an overnight decision on something which, in essence, is a medication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>The first amendment, which was considered out of order, stated that nicotine replacement therapy would be available free of charge under the general medical services scheme. The two amendments are related. The Minister said the Irish Medicines Board may have a problem with this. In an article in<i> The Irish Times </i>last week, Dr. Muiris Houston said proof that withdrawal from smoking can be attributed to nicotine is shown by the consistent finding that withdrawal symptoms are relieved by NRT but not by a placebo, that is, a patch that does not contain nicotine. NRT has been shown to double the chance that a smoker will be able to kick the habit. It is now available in a wide variety of formulations, from inhalers to patches.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Dr. Houston, have the Minister's advisers looked at whether there is a precedent in other countries for having nicotine replacement therapies on sale in commercial outlets for tobacco? I do not think we are the first at everything in this country, particularly in the area of smoking, which is a horrendously serious issue for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> The point he was making very cogently is that we cannot just walk away from the facts, particularly in light of the consistent number of new smokers. Today is the first day of the leaving and junior certificate examinations. We are told that over 50% of those sitting the junior certificate examination are smokers. We cannot walk away from those statistics. I know, as a teacher, that children were addicted when they came into my class at 12 and 13 years of age ten years ago. That is why I am so insistent on that point. If I understand the Minister correctly, the Irish Medicines Board is worried about the effects of&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We said last week on Second Stage that we have made the decision in principle, in that we agree, in principle, with the concept of making nicotine replacement therapies available to those on the GMS or the medical card scheme. The issue then is to decide the best way of doing that, what logistics have to be sorted out, the feasibility of doing it and the context in which it should be done &ndash; for example, whether it should be done in the context of cessation programmes. To that end, the advisory forum on cardiovascular strategy was asked to make recommendations to me on how best we could introduce nicotine replacement therapy on the medical card scheme. That is one issue. I have no difficulty with the article or the content of Dr. Houston's conclusions.</P>
      <P>The second issue relates to this amendment which, I understand, proposes making nicotine replacement therapies available in shops and all retail outlets, irrespective of any advice or whatever. It is in that context that the Irish Medicines Board could potentially have some concerns in terms of general public health issues which would arise from having nicotine replacement therapies available in a widespread fashion. All I am saying is that the issue needs far more careful consideration than simply deciding overnight to do it. The medical card would be by prescription, of course.</P>
      <P>There is evidence that better results are achieved if the nicotine replacement therapy is provided in the context of cessation programmes where, rather than just buying the stuff, one is counselled and so on.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) An approval may be such as to limit the use of a drug to treatment of a particular condition or conditions or to treatment of a particular class or classes of person and in this section &lsquo;approved' and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing this amendment because it is of the utmost importance to be in a position to respond in a flexible manner to the potential pharmaceutical needs of patients. While the Bill already goes some way in facilitating this approach, the amendment bolsters the Bill in this regard.</P>
      <P>In some cases, it may not be appropriate to make a product universally reimbursable. For example, an over the counter product with a very wide application may be used by the general public in circumstances that do not warrant the use of the product from a clinical point of view. If such a product is universally reimbursable, a consequent waste and lack of targeting can take place. The same product, however, may be of therapeutic necessity for patients with particular conditions. It is important to provide the flexibility to reimburse such products in these circumstances. In other words, a product may be necessary for a person with a particular condition and there should be flexibility in the legislation to allow the authorities to make a reimbursement in such cases.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment in regard to regulations, which is standard. It will strengthen the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 refers to the definition of &ldquo;supplier&rdquo;. The Bill at present defines &ldquo;supplier&rdquo; as a person who supplies drugs to community pharmacies. The amendment is a technical amendment to the definition of &ldquo;supplier&rdquo;, so that it also encompasses a person who supplies drugs to persons referred to in subsections (4) and (5). Persons referred to in subsection (4)(<i>a</i>) are doctors dispensing to medical card patients where there is no local community pharmacy, while persons referred to in subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) are persons approved by the Minister for the supply of non drug items. Subsection (5) refers to institutions providing a specialist service under the direct supervision of a medical consultant and <Col N="995" /> approved for the supply of drugs for the purposes of section 59 of the Health Act, 1970. It is a tightening up of the definition.</P>

      <P>It was introduced in 1996 and places obligations on community pharmacies which were not placed on them before. The idea was to provide for a review by the pharmacist of the medicine therapy of the patient, including screening and so on. The intention was to get pharmacists into the primary care area in a more proactive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator knows, there is a set of criteria by which health boards consider an application to set up a pharmacy. They make the initial decision, <Col N="996" /> in accordance with criteria that are published, on whether a pharmacy should be located in a particular area, given the size of the catchment area and so on. My understanding is that the decision can be appealed by the applicant if it is refused or by somebody else if it is granted. At the moment the appeals are heard by the Minister of the day. I was going to say later in the debate that I intend to put down an amendment on this issue when the Bill goes back to the other House. I do not think the Minister should be involved in the appeals process. In line with modern practice we should have an independent court of appeal, whether it is the District Court or another court. We are working on this with the draftsman's office at the moment so that, in essence, there will be an independent appeals forum to look at these issues.</P>
    <P>At present my officials make representations to me as Minister as to whether a pharmacy should be given sanction and I am not sure that a Minister should be involved with the minutiae of deciding where a pharmacy should go. In the first instance it is the health board which makes a decision based on criteria that have been established regarding catchment area, the public health needs of an area and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&ndash;The Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following sections for section 3:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;3A.&ndash;(1) Any person who sells, offers to sell, or makes available in relation to the sale of any other product, cigarettes or any other tobacco product to a person under the age of 18 years, whether for his or her own use or otherwise, or who sells to any person, acting on behalf of a person under the age of 18 years, any tobacco products, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) The owner, or any person in charge, of any machine for the sale of tobacco products who permits the machine to be <Col N="997" /> used for the sale of such products to a person under the age of 18 years shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    <P>(3) The owner, or any person in charge, of any machine for the sale of tobacco products who keeps the machine in place in any premises frequented by a person or persons under the age of 18 years shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    <P>(4) It shall be a defence for a person prosecuted under this section to establish that the person to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available, had upon request furnished to him or her a document, as specified in regulations made by the Minister for such purpose, verifying he or she to be 18 years of age or older, where it was reasonable to regard the documentation concerned as authentic and as applicable to the person to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available.</P>
    <P>(5) Where, in a prosecution for an offence under this section, it is alleged that the person in respect of whom the offence was committed is under the age of 18 years, and such person appears to the court to have been, at the date of the commission of the alleged offence, under the age of 18 years, such person shall for the purposes of this section be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been at that date under that age.</P>
    <P>(6) The Minister may, by regulations, specify the document or documents that may be relied upon pursuant to <i>subsection (4)</i> by a person against whom a prosecution is brought for an offence allegedly committed as specified in this section.</P>
    <P>3B.&ndash;(1) Any person who sells or offers to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in a retail outlet, shall at the point of sale exhibit in a prominent position notices warning of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the addictive and health dangers posed by cigarettes, and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the age restriction on sale and the vendor's obligation to ask for age verification.</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister shall, by regulations, specify the size of the notices specified in <i>subsection (1)</i> and the detail and print size of the information to be contained in them.</P>
    <P>(3) Any person who sells or offers to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in a retail outlet and who fails to comply with <Col N="998" /><i>subsection (1)</i> or <i>(2)</i> shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    <P>3C.&ndash;Any person who having been found guilty of an offence pursuant to <i>section 2</i> or<i> 3</i> of this Act is subsequently found guilty of a further offence under either of the aforesaid sections shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000 and/or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or as an alternative to the aforesaid term of imprisonment may be directed by the court to undertake community service pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983.'          &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we all made it clear how concerned we are with the high level of tobacco smoking, not just among young people but generally. The statistics on smoking among over half of the children sitting their junior certificate examination attributed to Dr. Des Carney, an oncologist at the Mater Hospital, are quite alarming. The fact that 90% of those who smoke start smoking before the age of 20 is also unbelievable.</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that fines are not always implemented, such as in the case of litter offences. The figure of £1,500 is too low and the amendment states:</P>
    <P>Any person who sells, offers to sell, or makes available in relation to the sale of any other product, cigarettes or any other tobacco product to a person under the age of 18 years, whether for his or her own use or otherwise, or who sells to any person, acting on behalf of a person under the age of 18 years, any tobacco products, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £2,500.</P>
    <P>The Minister said on Second Stage that it would not be possible to raise the level of the fine, but I have been told by a legal source that it is. Perhaps we can agree to differ on this, although the Minister should justify his argument that the amount cannot be raised. The offence is so grievous that £2,500 is low, considering the amount of money being made by racketeers and by those abusing young people in this manner &ndash; they know the contents of cigarettes and we know that cigarettes are being sold singly. It is easy for young people to have access to cigarettes and the fine I have suggested is the least amount that could be imposed.</P>
    <P>The same applies to someone in charge of a machine selling tobacco products. We stated last week that we hoped such machines would be out of reach of young people and that they would not be in areas where young people congregate. All these offences should carry a fine of £2,500. Subsection (4) of the amendment is important. It states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence for a person prosecuted under this section to establish that the person <Col N="999" /> to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available, had upon request furnished to him or her a document, as specified in regulations made by the Minister for such purpose, verifying he or she to be 18 years of age or older, where it was reasonable to regard the documentation concerned as authentic and as applicable to the person to whom the tobacco products were sold, offered for sale or made available.</P>
    <P>This is an important provision in the context of those who may say, &ldquo;The person said she was 18 and she offered me a forged ID card.&rdquo; Many people are taken in by how sophisticated young people can look &ndash; those of 14 or 15 can pass for 21 and they are adept at getting into nightclubs and at gaining access to liquor and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The identity card issue must be dealt with for once and for all. It is virtually impossible to police the matter. I know that in Limerick pupils in one school had quite a business going on forging identity cards for young people. They are full of imagination and creativity and we need a national identity card whereby the person selling tobacco can be protected. Young people are playing Molly bawn with proprietors, picking their times to buy cigarettes and drink, and there must be some protection for the person who is prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Another important subsection of the amendment states:</P>
    <P>Where, in a prosecution for an offence under this section, it is alleged that the person in respect of whom the offence was committed is under the age of 18 years, and such person appears to the court to have been, at the date of the commission of the alleged offence, under the age of 18 years, such person shall for the purposes of this section be presumed, until the contrary is proved, to have been at that date under that age.</P>
    <P>This is a very important point. The amendment goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, by regulations, specify the document or documents that may be relied upon pursuant to <i>subsection (4)</i> by a person against whom a prosecution is brought for an offence allegedly committed as specified in this section.</P>
    <P>This means that we will need to know what documents will be needed.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section also provides:</P>
    <P>Any person who sells or offers to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in a retail outlet, shall at the point of sale exhibit in a prominent position notices warning of&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) the addictive and health dangers posed by cigarettes,</P>
    <P>I know the Minister said on Second Stage that he intends pursuing this matter, but it is extremely important. When I was in Canada I researched <Col N="1000" /> their experiences in this regard, as they have gone through many advertising campaigns, some of which did not work. Some of the health warnings state that cigarettes can cause the arteries in one's brain to clog, causing strokes and some carry pictures of the human brain after a stroke. I know those are shock tactics, but young people &ndash; as we all do perhaps &ndash; think themselves immortal. The advertisements are not just for young people but are also aimed at those who say they are addicted and cannot get off cigarettes.</P>
    <P>There should be a health notice in a prominent position at the point of sale as well as a notice with the age restrictions and the vendor's obligation to ask for age verification. It should be there in black and white. The person is reminded of the onus on him or her, not just on the young people or adults who see cigarettes on sale. These advertisements are not just seen on television and in the newspapers, they are directed specifically at people.</P>
    <P>The amendment reads, &ldquo;The Minister shall, by regulations, specify the size of the notices. . . &rdquo;. There is no point having a notice stating that it is not legal to sell cigarettes to those under the age of 18. People ignore tiny &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; notices. There is a regression in this regard and people do not obey. At one time it was politically incorrect to smoke and some of us still believe this is the case. I was in a restaurant in Clare over the weekend where the menu included the wording, &ldquo;No tobacco smoking on these premises.&rdquo;  This allowed a potential customer the time to decide to go elsewhere. No smoking of any kind was allowed in this restaurant, yet it was full and was not losing customers as a result of the prohibition on smoking.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the Minister should specify the size of the notices and the detail and print size of the information to be contained in them. There should be policing of the premises to ensure those buying and selling cigarettes are aware of their responsibilities. The amendment proposes that any person who sells or offers to sell cigarettes or other tobacco products in a retail outlet and who fails to comply with subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding £2,500. This would drastically cut cigarette sales to young or old people. The amendment proposes that a person who has been found guilty, decides to ignore it and is subsequently found guilty of a further offence under either of the aforementioned sections shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000 and/or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, or as an alternative to the aforesaid term of imprisonment may be directed by the court to undertake community service pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>These amendments are not tabled lightly but on foot of the cavalier attitude of those who insist on breaking the law. This is a matter of life and death. Regardless of the Minister's statement last <Col N="1001" /> week that the Attorney General believes one cannot have fines of that nature, I consider them to be extremely lenient. Fortunately, I never smoked but I have friends who are addicted. I have taught children of 12 and 13 years of age, right up to the age of 18, whose lives can be planned out in relation to their health. The incidence of lung cancer in women now exceeds that of men. Nothing seems to entice young girls to give up smoking cigarettes. I am not sure whether this relates to body image or peer pressure. It is more than that &ndash; they are actually addicted and cannot fight the addiction.</P>
    <P>Given that this is such a serious issue, I believe the fines are too small. A penalty of six months imprisonment for recurring offences or community service is very small in relation to the death penalty being inflicted on young people who become addicted at such an early age and who do not have the common sense to make up their own minds. The parents of these young people probably smoke, they may be surrounded by cigarettes. I hope the Minister will do something about the fines to make them a more effective deterrent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. If Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Director General of the World Health Organisation, were here today she would be delighted to have a colleague such as Senator Jackman in her determination for a tobacco free world. I am aware the Minister is anxious about the numbers of young people taking up smoking and I am sure he was very alarmed by the report of the Southern Health Board which showed that a certain proportion of children as young as nine and ten years of age are smoking regularly. None of us believes the Minister is not concerned about the issue.</P>
      <P>The amendments are sensible because they stress what a serious offence this is. We all know that virtually every adult who smokes has tried to give up the habit. Therefore, it is absolutely essential for the tobacco companies to keep up the numbers of smokers and the recuitment drive for young smokers is essential. We must insist these tough regulations are obeyed. Senator Jackman is justified in seeking an increase in the fine and that a repeat offence should merit a bigger fine. Under the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, if under age drinkers are served, the judge who hears the case can shut down the pub, or part of the pub, off-licence or whatever for up to seven days. If there is a subsequent offence, the judge can shut down the pub for approximately six months. It would be worthwhile showing that repeat offences are even more serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that every effort is made to inform young people how seriously smoking affects their health. Senator Jackman's proposal that notices of a certain size should be put up in places where cigarettes are on sale is worthwhile because the notices on cigarette packets are of a certain size only. If there were something to counteract the extraordinarily successful advertis<Col N="1002" /> ing by tobacco manufacturers, it would do nothing but good.</P>
    <P>The number of young people smoking is extremely depressing. I spoke on Second Stage about attending a meeting in Trinity where approximately 50% of people, not just the national average of 30%, who should have had some notion of the associated health risks were sitting around smoking. I second Senator Jackman's efforts to try to have the health risks and dangers of addiction to smoking advertised in retail outlets. Those who begin smoking and drinking early are far more likely to become involved in illegal drugs. I am sure the Minister is weary from hearing this argument but I believe the Senator is trying to strengthen this section of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Jackman's amendment. Probably the best way to deal with the problem of under age smoking is to increase the cost of cigarettes. The Minister for Finance has a major role to play in this regard. Young people of nine or ten years of age will not have an enormous amount of money at their disposal, therefore if cigarettes are expensive, it will be difficult for them to afford them. It is alarming that a large number of people of that age are smoking. Obviously they are attracted to it as a result of the sexy advertising by the tobacco industry and peer pressure. After a number of years it becomes an addiction and these people are hooked on cigarettes. By the time they can pay for as many cigarettes as they wish to smoke, they find it difficult to give up the habit. This is a worrying development.</P>
      <P>The second issue covered by the amendment is the question of availability. The sale of cigarettes should not be permitted on any premises that are not supervised or in adjacent premises that are not supervised. Cigarettes should be kept behind the counter in public houses. Young people should not be in public houses in the first instance. If cigarettes are sold in hotels, they should be kept behind a counter which is supervised. They should not be in the foyer or any other public place. Unless there is adult supervision, those who frequent it, families and young people, will be able to get them. No locations for the sale of cigarettes should be provided which are not clearly supervised by adults.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cigarettes are far more dangerous than alcohol &ndash; they are the real killers in society. The penalties in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill are extremely severe and a public house which breaks the law will be closed for a period. There are certain conditions under which an appeal can be made, but closure for a period is mandatory. Not only that but it is mandatory that a public notice be put on the premises explaining why it was closed. Surely we should be taking as severe an approach to the sale of cigarettes to youngsters, something we are not doing. There are some tough measures in the Bill, but the legislation will easily allow young people to get tobacco and cigarettes. Currently, <Col N="1003" /> young people do not have the slightest difficulty in getting cigarettes. Until we become tough we will not make an impact.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the amendment includes the penalty of community service. Penalties in legislation should include an option of community service as an alternative to imprisonment and fines. I do not know when we last passed legislation which specified community service as one of the options which judges could consider. All legislation should now include community service as an option. Otherwise judges will go for the two options included in legislation, namely, a fine or imprisonment. We used to look at legislation in terms of gender proofing and we should now examine it in terms of providing the option of community service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Jackman's amendment which is very worthwhile and important. Everybody agrees that more must be done about cigarette smoking. The Government in its last budget took a very important step forward by increasing taxation on the sale of tobacco. We must be more hard line in following this in relation to fines. We must put the boot in if people are breaking the law in a way that results in the health of children being seriously affected. It is very important that the clearest possible signal is sent out and the best way to hit those breaking the law is to fine them, with an increasing scale of fines for repeat offences.</P>
      <P>From working with young people I am concerned about recreation facilities. Under age people are drinking and smoking in places of recreation for young people such as discos and so on, and this is a matter of concern for parents. The health of young people is seriously affected and we should take a harder line on tobacco. Our right to clean air is affected when people smoke. We should consider legislation forcing pubs and other places to have clean air through the provision of adequate and proper ventilation.</P>
      <P>I completely agree with what Senator Jackman said. The culture in Ireland is improving. Recently I was in Portugal and noticed that every second person, particularly young people, was smoking. At least things are not as bad as they are in Ireland, but we must continue our progress and be really tough on those who break the law, particularly those who sell tobacco to people who are under age. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has not been fully thought through. I agree that Senator Jackman's heart is in the right place, but increasing the fines will not solve the problem. Senator Costello said that such things as community service should be considered when penalties are being imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tobacconists require a licence to sell tobacco which could be taken from them temporarily or permanently, but illegal tobacco sellers have no <Col N="1004" /> licence. It is possible to buy illegal tobacco and cigarettes on the streets of Dublin, including Henry Street on a busy day. While the Revenue Commissioners are very active they have not managed to stamp out the illegal trade.</P>
    <P>We spoke about the amount of advertising undertaken by the tobacco industry. Some years ago the Department of Health and Children undertook an advertising campaign on the dangers of drugs, and every doctor and pharmacy got horrendous looking posters. However, they did not work. In my area the level of drug addiction increased.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will examine this section when he brings the Bill to the Dáil. There may be room for improvement by providing for a wider approach in the application of penalties for selling tobacco to underage people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions, including Senator Jackman who tabled the amendment. I think there is broad agreement in the House in terms of adopting as tough a position as possible in relation to the sale of tobacco, particularly to those who are under age.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an interim measure. On Second Stage I indicated we would bring in a very comprehensive Bill on tobacco in terms of its sale, fines and penalties, advertising, the manner in which it should be sold, the degree of prominence accorded tobacco products and disclosure of ingredients, etc. Therefore, we are looking at a much more comprehensive package for the autumn and issues such as vending machines will be addressed in that Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We will be here. Most general elections take four weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we allow the Bill through, at least we will have increased the age limit. The original fine prior to this legislation was £500 and we have increased it to £1,500 in line with legal advice I received from the Attorney General, as I previously advised the House. A maximum fine of £1,500 is constitutionally accepted as the maximum amount for conviction for a summary offence in a District Court, where these offences are tried by a judge only. A larger fine would require a change to the nature of the offence and necessitate a jury trial in a Circuit Court with senior counsel and full legal teams. The level of successful prosecutions is much lower in trials by jury in the Circuit Court. We need to tease out this issue between now and the autumn. I undertake to look seriously at the nature of the offence in the context of the new tobacco Bill to be introduced in the autumn. The penalties can also be looked at. I have no aversion, therefore, to introducing a higher fine. To do so we may have to change the way we do things. I will have no difficulty in looking at the areas of community service &ndash; a very good idea &ndash; and the removal of <Col N="1005" /> licences. I am not in disagreement, therefore, with the sentiments and views expressed.</P>
    <P>The issue of vending machines needs to be looked at. We need time during the summer to decide on what specifically needs to be done. Work is well advanced on the new tobacco Bill which clearly will be undermined if there is easy access to vending machines in terms of the sale of cigarettes to under age persons. We have to ensure complete supervision by the owner or else come up with an alternative to prevent the Bill, which will forbid the sale of cigarettes to those under the age of 18, being undermined. We must ensure we get it right. It will give us an opportunity to deal with many issues which cannot be dealt with in this interim measure.</P>

While I do not question the Minister's bona fides in relation to the new tobacco Bill, the issue of fines is pressing and one about which I feel strongly.

The necessary legislative changes recommended in its report collectively adopted by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Independents could have been brought into being since November to increase the level of the fine.</P>

      <P>It is a very valid point. Even with the best will in the world one could not do it. There is also the issue of what is the objective of the exercise in moving to a higher court. Do we want more or fewer convictions? We need to tease out these matters. We are talking about a difference of £1,000. Although I take the point which is being sincerely pressed, I am not sure how fundamental it is in the context of an interim Bill in the overall battle against tobacco. In the context of the wide range of penalties that could be applied, it makes sense to await the substantive Bill.</P>

    <Title>Waste Management: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to debate the issues involved in waste reduction, recycling, composting, incineration and gasification, with particular reference to any possible consequences to public health.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the Minister of State, I am shocked because the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion. The motion seeks to discuss waste reduction and does not condemn the Government's policy or ask it to do anything more than it would normally do. I sought the debate because I wish to be informed, as do many people whom I represent. The local authority in Galway will have to make a decision on the Connacht waste management plan in the coming weeks. That decision will involve a number of issues but the one that is causing the greatest controversy is incineration.</P>
      <P>The concept of incineration is frightening for people. The Minister may say that is ridiculous and that there is much hype attached to the issue. Nevertheless, I have to deal with people on the doorsteps. My colleague, Senator Walsh, has already faced the same issue. People are telling us how frightened they are about it. That fear might have been accelerated by a number of people with their own axes to grind. Some people involved in this controversy are against incineration and have their own agenda. There are even people who are making quite a nice living out of it travelling around the place. There are others who see it as a campaign opportunity on which to launch their political careers. These people represent a small minority, however. The majority is frightened by the thought of waste incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent surveys from Galway city show that more than 20,000 people signed petitions against incineration &ndash; I am sure the Minister has seen <Col N="1007" /><Col N="1008" /> the figures. One may say that people will sign anything if they are asked to do so by someone standing at the side of the street who frightens them by speaking about the worst aspects of incineration. I doubt, however, whether 20,000 people would sign a petition unless they were genuinely afraid. I sought this debate to discuss those very issues and get a balanced view, but I am surprised because at the very last moment the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion. I cannot understand why because we are seeking information and clarity.</P>
    <P>I have two files with me. One, a very thin one, is pro-incineration, containing claims that it is safe and that the dioxins produced are minimal. The other file is three times as thick and it contains evidence that incineration is dangerous. Included in that file is an Environmental Protection Agency report from the United States, which says that dioxins from incineration are carcinogenic, in other words, they cause cancer. I have no other proof of that and I do not know how this report was drawn up, but I assume the EPA in America is as qualified as the EPA here and that it did not lightly decide the dioxins are carcinogenic.</P>
    <P>One may argue that we are talking about old incinerators, ones that are being closed down, and that new ones that have minimised dioxin emissions are quite safe. One can quote figures, but one would have to be a scientist to understand some of them. There is no point going into them because the public and I would not have a clue what they mean. The emission of any carcinogenic substance, no matter how minimal, must be scientifically examined to decide whether it is too much and should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister of State to give me an informed viewpoint, based on scientific knowledge which is as up to date as possible, using the facilities of the Department. I hope I will then be able to make an informed decision on whether incineration is good or bad. When I balance incineration against the alternatives, I want to know if I make the right decision in voting for or against. I am reflecting the views of many local authority members the majority of whom, if a vote was cast now, would vote against incineration. My colleague, Senator Jackman, is a member of Limerick County Council which recently voted in favour of recycling and the other elements of their plan but decided to leave aside the question of incineration until it was proven to be safe. This is the view of local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to disbelieve that this Government supports incineration. I recently read a report in a national newspaper, where the Minister, responding to the American EPA report, said incineration is completely safe and he supports it 100%. Therefore, we must assume the Government supports incineration and that it will make a decision that will not adversely affect the health of the people. However, I must also <Col N="1009" /> assume that whatever decision I make is based on scientific fact.</P>
    <P>I condemn previous Governments, including one of which I was a member, for not recognising that waste and waste management would be one of the burning issues of the future. We are reactive, not proactive, in this area. We should have started recycling a long time ago but we are now starting very late. I do not believe in conspiracy theories but now that local authorities are faced with a decision which must be made quickly, it is better to allow them to do that rather than build it up until they have to make a decision and go one way or another. In the context of the Government's amendment, I do not believe it has ever attempted to look at recycling, reduction or composting. There has been no genuine commitment to the alternatives.</P>
    <P>There is a programme for 48% recycling in the future. I cannot see this happening in households where plastic bags are left outside containing a mix of every type of material. There is no attempt at separation or reduction. If there was a real attempt at reduction, supermarkets would not hand out plastic bags. They would demand that one had a bag made of jute or a natural recyclable material which could be reused until it wore out. Supermarkets give out plastic bags to hold products which are already wrapped or double wrapped in plastic &ndash; these bags are pushed at the customer left, right and centre. It is easy to say that customers can say no. However, they cannot because they have to carry the products somehow.</P>
    <P>We must go to the root of this and stop the production of plastic bags or change the nature of their manufacture. I have spoken about this before. I am aware of ongoing scientific experiments on biodegradable plastic bags, which will harmlessly re-enter the earth because when they are buried the heat generated underground is enough to melt them down. This is a possibility, but in the meantime we must be firm in our commitment to recycling. When I was growing up, the rattle of milk bottles was a lovely sound and one knew when the milkman had arrived, which was the only alarm clock in the house for some people. Now we have plastic cartons scattered around which take years to degrade, if they degrade. Why do we not tell milk producers that we want to return to glass bottles? If we are to make a commitment to recycling, we should be honest about doing it. We should do it 100% and impose restrictions, in the same way as we do for litter. We should not rush into incineration because it is the last chance saloon.</P>
    <P>Incineration will fail to be accepted by the public. I received a letter from my local chamber of commerce, in which it asked if we have looked at all the alternatives and the possibility of toxic emissions, etc. The chamber of commerce asks questions but does not direct us. It states in the letter that with the public perception as it is at present, it is unlikely that incineration will be voted through. This was said by an organisation <Col N="1010" /> which is not in the political arena but is involved enough to know what is going on. It is telling public representatives that incineration will not go through. This indicates to the Minister that the possibility of its happening is non-existent.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me why he believes incineration is safe? Will he assure me and everyone else &ndash; public representatives and those they represent &ndash; that its safety is guaranteed? Will he assure me he has looked at the alternatives, such as gasification, and that they are safe? Will he assure me there is a genuine commitment to recycling and reduction? To date, I have been assured of none of these. As I said at the outset, I have two files &ndash; one thicker than the other, one saying no to incineration and the other saying yes.</P>
    <P>There is misinformation on both sides. I recall someone telling me that a certain location had no incineration and 100% recycling, which was extraordinary. I found out that the person was not telling me a lie and there was 100% recycling &ndash; 100% recycling of what was left because the rest of it had been transported to the next state where it was being incinerated. I was not given that information. I was given information on dioxins but what will happen to bottom ash was not addressed. This subject is worthy of a long debate. Senator Quill, other Senators and myself have continually asked for a debate on this which we did not get, so we must compress the discussion into Private Members' time. We are not being informed of all the facts. I want to be convinced that the decision I make is based on all the facts.</P>
    <P>I was surprised &ndash; genuinely I was not that surprised &ndash; to read an article by Frank McDonald, who would not be known as a supporter of local government, in yesterday's edition of<i> The Irish Times,</i> where he came out strongly in favour of incineration, having looked at a project in Vienna which is quite up to date. Vienna has a population of 1.8 million and they incinerate 800,000 tonnes, which highlights how much they have reduced their waste. We produce half a tonne of waste per person. The Galway west and Connacht regions do not generate enough waste to justify an incinerator. We will have to take waste from other places. Going on the figures, we will probably need three incinerators throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The time we have been given is too short. I should have complained about that this morning. However, my hands are tied by virtue of the fact it is our motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I am also shocked by the amendment. Senator Coogan and the other Fine Gael Senators specified in the motion what we wanted to discuss. It states, &ldquo;the issues involved in waste reduction, recycling, composting, incineration and gasification, with particular reference to any possible consequences to public health&rdquo;. That is as open and honest as could be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> I am a member of Limerick County Council, which has never spent as much time on any issue as it did on the production of a draft waste management plan for the Limerick, Clare, Kerry region, which we rejected the other day. We debated it at length but we are back to where we started. What is the Minister's stance? Where is the direction given by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to us local authority members? We are not scientists, engineers, hydrologists, geologists or hydrogeologists. It would take all those specialties to keep abreast of the debate that has not happened in Ireland, except at local authority level, but is raging throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the word &ldquo;incineration&rdquo; is not mentioned in the amendment. Perhaps the Government has decided it does not want to talk about incineration. There is a reference to &ldquo;energy recovery&rdquo;, but that need not necessarily be incineration because thermolysis and pyrolysis also involve energy recovery. Is the Government drawing back from even using the word because it now knows how controversial it is? I do not know why this amendment was tabled. It asks the Seanad to affirm &ldquo;its support for the current comprehensive integrated policy approach to waste management, based firmly on the waste hierarchy&rdquo;. We understand the waste hierarchy.</P>
    <P>I will talk about incineration, thermolysis and pyrolysis in a moment. I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is not here. The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, took the debate in the Seanad and Dáil on the EPA and the supposedly leaked document in <i>The Washington Post.</i> Why can the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, not come to the Seanad to debate this issue? We cannot say whether the EPA in America is any better or worse than our own EPA. We cannot just say we do not believe what we have heard about dioxins and the problems posed to our health by the food we eat. In this country we eat a lot of dairy produce and meat, through which humans digest dioxin which, we hear, results in carcinogenic problems.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the amendment in regard to waste prevention, minimisation, reuse and recycling. It is interesting that our local authority decided to accept that thrust but said it was not accepting the part dealing with thermolysis, gasification and incineration. We said we would revisit it in two years' time, with the proviso that we could opt out of that issue if we wanted. There seemed to be no problem with the local authority agreeing to that.</P>
    <P>We are expected to be recycling over 40% of waste by 2005. We have almost reached 2001, as the longest day of the year will be in a couple of weeks' time. How could any Minister or Department think we could be close to recycling 40% or 50% by 2005? That is wishful thinking. Local authorities have not been given the financial support to do anything about reducing, reusing or recycling waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1012" /> We have one small financial intervention in Limerick, which is for the compost cone, which has been so widely accepted by the community of County Limerick that there is a six month waiting list for them. The small manufacturer in Midleton, County Cork, cannot keep up with the demand for the composting cone generated by the pilot project in Limerick County Council. The public is ready, willing and able to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, but we cannot meet the demands within our local authority area for even the very basic aspect of the compost cone.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan referred to supermarkets. Supermarkets on the Continent ask customers if they have their own bag or if they will carry the goods in their hands. They then very reluctantly produce a bag, for which the customer has to pay quite a large sum. I have seen that in Denmark, Germany and most other European countries. Where is the proactitivy in relation to asking our major supermarkets to do something in that regard? I know that money goes to a local school if one brings back the bag one got last week. However, they are made of very thin plastic and do not last long. The supermarkets should tell us to bring our own shopping bags, particularly given how near the carparks are. That is what I would regard as being proactive.</P>
    <P>Businesses and industries should be asked to look at the products they use. It is not the concept of incineration that is wrong but what is put into the incinerator, because what is put in must come out. Why is the Minister not proactively asking industries and businesses to see if they could use alternative products which would not cause problems for waste disposal? I would have some hope if that were to happen. However, it seems no effort is being made in regard to businesses and industries.</P>
    <P>Most of the questionnaires sent to the public on waste management strategies ask whether people would prefer landfill or incineration. That is an extremely unfair question because it should not be a question of one or the other. The report states that, no matter what we do, we will still have to have a certain element of landfill.</P>
    <P>The proposal by M.C. O'Sullivan for Slievefelim, which is a most beautiful, untapped range of mountains in east Limerick and the border of north Tipperary, is that landfill should be put at 1,000 feet above sea level. I am a geography teacher and we know that mountains produce far more relief rainfall than lowlands. These consultants are supposed to have the most extraordinarily up to the minute hydrogeological advice available to them. Who would put a landfill site at a height of 1,000 feet, at the headstreams of the whole Shannon basis, east of the Shannon, as Tipperary is? That is incredible. We are being asked if we want Slievefelim or an incinerator, but the public will want neither.</P>
    <P>I understand we have to deal with waste and that it is not the Minister who is producing waste in Limerick, Galway or anywhere else. We know that, as individuals, we produce an enormous <Col N="1013" /> amount of waste. However, the public must be given a carrot to reduce waste. A woman came to see me who said she had a wheelie bin through a private operator but wanted to go to Limerick County Council because we had introduced the cone. She made a great effort to reduce her waste to a minimum and asked the council if she could have a small wheelie bin. They said she could, but owing to the restrictions in their funds as a result of not having an input into the funding they receive from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, she would have to pay the same amount for the small bin &ndash; £115 &ndash; as she would for the large one. What message is she getting? The message is that no matter how much one recycles or how great an effort one makes, one is going to pay the same as if one needed three or four bins.</P>
    <P>Regarding incentives for the general public, an excellent environmental awareness officer is employed in Limerick courtesy of the Minister's making some financial concessions and she is doing wonders. She has produced a regional waste management plan for householders and businesses and has visited schools in the county and much more, but she is not getting the financial backup to invest in further waste reduction measures. That is fine in theory, but it is impossible in practice.</P>
    <P>M.C. O'Sullivan prepares draft waste management plans for all the regions. Who are the Minister's advisers? I asked that question last week on the Order of Business. Is the Minister getting advice solely from M.C. O'Sullivan? I have nothing against the consultants; they are paid to do a job and I am sure they are doing that job to the best of their ability, but they were leaning heavily towards incineration until we on the local authority questioned them as to whether they had looked at thermolysis. They said it was not tried and tested and that they favoured a tried and tested method, but we pointed out that the lead in for Ireland would be very slow and that they could look at alternatives in this area. Now there is a slight move towards looking at thermolysis, though when we in Limerick County Council looked at the Karlsruhe facility we were told to forget about it. Until there is an open debate &ndash; which people are entitled to &ndash; on the dangers of incineration, everyone will say no to it. Governments respond to the public's reactions and at present incineration is a no-no word. People are entitled to a proper debate on why incineration is pushed so strongly. We should look at other sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>The EPA stated that Britain is not worried about incineration. The British Minister, Mr. Michael Meacher, has promised to limit the number of incinerators to be built in Britain and will try not to build any if Britain can do without them and still meet tough EU targets to cut the use of field dumps for rubbish disposal from 85% to 35% by 2016 and 2020. The British public is listening to the same arguments, so we are not the only ones with a big problem in this area. I <Col N="1014" /> am also shocked, as was Senator Coogan, by the Government amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we published Changing our Ways in 1998, defining a new national waste management policy, we acknowledged that historically our performance in this area had been poor. Unlike the majority of our EU colleagues, we have relatively low levels of materials recycling, no significant biological treatment capacity and no energy recovery infrastructure. Consequently, we are heavily reliant on landfill to deal with our waste arisings, which are increasing.</P>
      <P>However, we are now engaged on a radical transformation of our approach to waste management. In recent years, we have seen a very significant evolution of policy and law. We are now completing a strategic planning process which will lay the groundwork for the development of a modern waste management infrastructure that will enable us to deliver ambitious national waste recovery targets. There is no question that the objective of sound waste management presents significant environmental and lifestyle challenges which will engage us at national, regional and local level for some years to come. The challenges involved in the current transition to modern waste management practice can best be addressed on the basis of informed planning and commitment to progressive policies implementing the highest environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident our policy approach is well founded and well balanced, that good progress is being made and that we are laying a sound basis for future waste management in this country. The Waste Management Act, 1996, recognises that meaningful and comprehensive waste management planning is an essential prerequisite to improved waste management performance and much effort has been devoted at national, <Col N="1015" /> regional and local level to delivering effective results in this regard. Reflecting the waste hierarchy, the statutory objective of these plans is to prevent or minimise the production and harmful nature of waste, to encourage and support the recovery of waste, to ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is safely disposed of and to address the need to give effect to the polluter pays principle.</P>
    <P>Changing our Ways provided a national policy framework for the adoption and implementation by local authorities of strategic waste management plans. It outlined the Government's policy objectives in relation to waste management and in particular it focused on the need to develop and pursue integrated solutions. The policy statement strongly endorsed a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of waste treatment options to deliver effective and efficient waste services and ambitious recycling and recovery targets, greater participation by the private sector in the provision of waste management services, a more effective and equitable system of waste charging which incentivises waste minimisation and recovery and the mobilisation of public support and participation.</P>
    <P>Ambitious targets were set for achievement over a 15-year timescale, including a diversion of 50% of overall household waste away from landfill, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable municipal wastes consigned to landfill, the development of composting and other feasible biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of organic waste annually, materials recycling of 35% of municipal waste, recovery of at least 50% of construction and demolition waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85% over 15 years and a rationalisation of the existing network municipal waste landfills.</P>
    <P>The response of local authorities has been very positive and 32 authorities have adopted or are committed to making detailed regional waste management plans and it is evident that these plans will seek to give effect to the policy objectives and targets outlined in Changing our Ways. In particular, the emerging regional waste management plans make provision for an integrated waste management infrastructure, including segregation and separate collection of recyclable materials in urban areas, &ldquo;bring&rdquo; facilities for recyclable materials in rural areas, civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations, biological treatment of &ldquo;green&rdquo; and organic household waste, materials recovery facilities, recycling capacity for construction and demolition waste, thermal treatment facilities and residual landfill requirements.</P>
    <P>New waste facilities are generally unwelcome to the public and invariably generate vigorous local opposition. In part this is due to past performance of local authorities, which had no guidelines or standards set down for waste facilities and limited finances to ensure proper per<Col N="1016" /> formance. In part, it also reflects the prevalence of the NIMBY factor. Local communities have the right to expect democratic decision-making which is being achieved through the waste management planning process; they are also entitled to acceptable environmental standards which ensure that waste activities will not harm human health or the environment, but they have to play their part too. Nobody who creates waste can ignore the consequences or rely on the NIMBY factor. When we are creating over a half a tonne of municipal waste per person per annum, a range of solutions, beginning with prevention, is obviously required. As public representatives, it is our duty to resist the negative and the simplistic and to counter emotive claims with responsible leadership. Very stringent standards are imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to all significant waste facilities and we need to assure the public that their interests are being rigorously protected.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, public education, awareness and participation are an integral part of modernising waste management. We need informed discussion of the issues. I strongly believe that meaningful public involvement and a policy of openness and transparency can mitigate the real concerns of host communities in relation to waste treatment facilities of whatever kind. Clearly, the most controversial element of these plans is the proposed development of thermal treatment capacity both because of concerns regarding emissions and perceived implications for materials recycling.</P>
    <P>Thermal treatment of waste, carried on in accordance with high environmental standards, is regarded as environmentally preferable to the disposal of waste by landfill and plays a major part in municipal waste management in many EU countries and further afield. Accordingly, Changing our Ways proposed that, where technically and economically feasible, and subject to appropriate attention to materials recycling, incineration with energy recovery or other advanced thermal processes are among the treatment options which should be considered in an integrated waste management strategy. I am satisfied that this remains the case.</P>
    <P>To inform the development and implementation of regional waste management plans, two EU-funded feasibility studies were carried out for local authorities in 1998 on thermal treatment/recovery options as one element of an integrated approach towards waste management. These studies, incorporating expertise from Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, examined the technical, environmental and financial advantages and disadvantages of thermal treatment in two distinct rural regions &ndash; the north east and mid-west &ndash; and in the greater Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The studies considered three thermal treatment options &ndash; waste incineration with energy recovery, gasification and pyrolysis &ndash; under a range of criteria. At that time the consultants concluded <i>inter alia</i> that WTE is a safe, tried and tested tech<Col N="1017" /> nology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards; gasification and pyrolysis are emerging technologies which are continuing to be developed to the scale likely to be appropriate in Irish circumstances; gasification offers environmental advantages over WTE, including lower emissions; gasification does not have the same track record as WTE but appears to be close to becoming proven as a treatment method for municipal wastes; and pyrolysis may have future potential in certain applications but is not currently suitable as a bulk treatment method for municipal wastes.</P>
    <P>Our major infrastructural requirements in the waste area can best be addressed through the establishment of public/private partnerships delivering integrated regional solutions. Private participation in waste management can contribute not just capital investment but specialist expertise in the application of alternative and emerging technologies. As local authorities address the implementation of regional waste management plans, it may be expected that PPP proposals will emerge which reflect the state of the art in, and relative merits of, available waste technologies. The position in this regard, including the need and scope for support of a technologically innovative process such as gasification on a pilot basis, will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>The media recently highlighted a so-called report from the US Environmental Protection Agency linking waste incineration with carcinogens. In fact there has been no recent report by the US EPA in this matter. The media and certain interested parties have been content to comment, apparently sight unseen, on a leaked draft report being prepared by the US EPA regarding dioxins.</P>
    <P>Dioxins, which are ubiquitous in the environment, arise from a range of combustion sources, diffuse and otherwise. Detailed information regarding the known effects of dioxins on human health is contained in a range of reports, including a comprehensive published 1999 EU report entitled Compilation of EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data.</P>
    <P>The essential point said to emerge from the leaked draft report is that the US EPA has concluded for the first time that dioxins are a human carcinogen. This link is already accepted elsewhere. In 1997 the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an agency of the World Health Organisation, had already classed the most toxic dioxin compound as a known human carcinogen. The WHO also considers that there is a level of exposure to dioxins below which cancer risk would be negligible. In 1998 it agreed on a tolerable daily intake guideline for dioxins based on a thorough evaluation of all available data on the toxicological effect of dioxins and the most up to date methods of interpretation. Clearly, because of the potential toxic effects of exposure to dioxins, their emission must, where possible, be strictly controlled and minimised to <Col N="1018" /> ensure that exposure does not exceed relevant guidelines and standards.</P>
    <P>Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for the integrated licensing and comprehensive environmental control of waste incineration facilities. The EPA must take the precautionary principle into account and is precluded from granting an integrated licence unless, among other considerations, it is satisfied that the activity concerned will not endanger human health or harm the environment.</P>
    <P>In licensing incineration facilities the EPA already applies a flue gas emission limit value for dioxins of 0.1 nanograms, that is one ten thousand millionth of a gram per cubic metre of gas emitted. This is an extremely stringent standard which will shortly be adopted by the EU generally under the proposed Council directive on the incineration of waste. The European Commission estimates that the implementation of this directive will result in a 99% reduction in emissions of dioxins from waste incineration relative to 1993/1995, and anticipates that the contribution of municipal and clinical waste incineration to overall emissions of dioxins in Europe will be reduced to 0.3%, assuming the output of other sources remains unchanged. I am advised that emissions from proposed new thermal treatment facilities, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, should not have any appreciable environmental impact or contribute significantly to background levels of dioxins locally or nationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has been publicly challenged to comment on a recent press report quoting an official of the European Commission to the effect that the Commission is opposed to thermal treatment because of public health considerations. I am advised that the report in question is completely unfounded.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the waste hierarchy, the European Commission considers that preference should be given, where environmentally sound, to material recovery, such as composting and recycling, over energy recovery. This is entirely consistent with the approach underlying the regional waste management plans currently being adopted. These plans set out to achieve the maximum realistic levels of waste recycling and biological treatment before addressing the scope for thermal treatment of residual wastes, in preference to landfill. For instance, the waste management plan adopted for the Dublin region provides for recycling and biological treatment of nearly 60% of anticipated waste arisings, thermal treatment of about 27% and the landfilling of only 14% of waste. This kind of performance is on a par with the best international practice.</P>
    <P>Some criticism of the proposed regional plans stems from the view that thermal treatment is inconsistent with high recycling rates. This need not be the case. Throughout the EU the most <Col N="1019" /> environmentally progressive member states combine an impressive recycling performance with a significant reliance on thermal treatment as part of an integrated approach to waste management.</P>
    <P>For a topical and informed illustration of the role of thermal treatment as part of a progressive solution to the problem of waste management I would refer colleagues to a newspaper report yesterday regarding the Spittelau municipal waste incinerator located in Vienna, which is not only that city's principal waste treatment plant but is also a major tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the regional waste management plans currently being adopted by local authorities are getting the balance right and will provide a sound basis for the delivery of improved waste services and the development of an effective and safe waste management infrastructure. Accordingly I support the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I enjoyed the Minister of State's speech, even if some of it was a little aspirational. I realise he is genuinely very interested in this matter. It is essential that we should all share that interest.</P>
      <P>The European Union has as its core mission the inclusion of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations in all its policies. The new programme currently being drawn up by the European Union is likely to require all citizens to be informed about and responsible for their impact on the environment and to require that environmental concerns are integrated into economic, social and education policies. Despite what the Minister of State said, I question whether we are doing enough on this issue.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister of State praised the EPA because its policy documents and reports are excellent. I read its most recent national waste database report and it is frightening that, despite the numerous directives that have been introduced since the early 1990s, there is increased waste generation. Between 1995-98, waste increased by more than 37%. A huge amount of this was agricultural waste but there was a great increase in the manufacturing, mining, construction and demolition sectors. There was also an 11% increase in municipal waste which most citizens believe they can address. The Environmental Protection Agency does splendid work. It produces policy documents and deals with episodes such as the recent inadvertent planting of genetically modified grain. However, I question whether it has the resources needed to monitor the legislation passed in this House. There is plenty of legislation and directives but I question how these are being monitored, because I see very little effect of it on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praised the efforts made to get manufacturers to remove phosphates from detergents voluntarily in a couple of years. We have also promoted the involvement of Teagasc in monitoring <Col N="1020" /> the amount of phosphates spread on land, in the knowledge that in some areas there is a five year over-supply. Are there any reports on how Teagasc is doing in this regard? I worry about the fact that we produce reports and think we have done something. We send out directives and believe that to be more progress. However, unless something happens we are doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the Minister of State's speech which states that the Dublin region has adopted a waste management plan which provides for recycling and biological treatment of nearly 60% of anticipated waste arisings, thermal treatment of about 27% and landfilling of only 14% of waste. I am sure such a performance, whenever it will happen, is on a par with best international practice, but nothing is happening in Dublin 4. When Mary Banotti MEP and I walk around Sandymount, we are berated by locals who recognise us about the possibility of an incinerator being built there. However, the Minister of State cheered me tonight by saying that I will be able to inform them in future that it will be not just an incinerator but a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Given what we have been discussing tonight, we are looking at waste disposal in a backward way. We are trying to deal with incineration, which is the most important part of the Minister of State's speech, as an alternative to landfill. Incineration should be the last straw before landfill. The information we received from ENFO on how to deal with waste, which is excellent, includes the most favoured options which are prevention, minimisation, re-use and recycling and the least favoured options, energy recovery and disposal. We seem to be doing next to nothing on the most favoured options.</P>
    <P>Consider, for example, the ubiquitous plastic bag. If we were to begin with the prevention option, we would be making a great effort to encourage people to use a shopping bag when they go shopping, which is becoming a slightly more common sight that it used to be. However, very large shopping malls are being built outside towns in many areas where it will be impossible to shop with just a shopping bag. We must encourage local shops in the high streets in this regard as many people will not have access to shopping malls. As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, I believe the Government is cognisant of this fact but it is a matter into which we must put a great deal of thought if we are to encourage people to minimise the amount of plastic bags they use. These bags should not be given to someone who buys a packet of crisps, as I have seen happen on occasions. More social policy and educational efforts should be made in this area. When one shops locally, one has the benefit of the exercise which I am sure will cheer those who tabled the motion.</P>
    <P>The minimisation effort whereby we use fewer plastic bags and fewer wrappings is not promoted. Directive 315 of 1997 promotes and supports the recovery of waste plastics from farms. The regu<Col N="1021" /> lations impose obligations on manufacturers and importers of farm plastics to take steps to recover waste plastics from farms. Is this happening? I am not aware of any report on the monitoring of what proportion of plastic goes on to farms and what portion is taken back by those who send it out. The waste management packaging regulations, 1997, promote and support the recovery of packaging waste. The regulations impose obligations on all suppliers of packaged goods, packaging and packaging materials to take steps to recover packaging waste. Is this being monitored? Are we making sure that people who send groceries in cartons and so on to various supermarkets are being made to take back their waste? I do not think this is being monitored. Very little is being done in this regard.</P>
    <P>The third option favoured relates to the re-use of plastic bags. This is encouraged in our local shops where everyone brings back their plastic bags. However, I do not know how frequently this happens. Some effort in that area might be worthwhile. Some supermarkets occasionally make an effort in this regard but we need to have a greater educational input into it. Recycling was taking place in some of the supermarkets but there is the problem of exposing those who work in recycling plants to chemicals, such as polychlorinated dibenzyls, which are very undesirable. We are setting up industries to manufacture these bags which it would be better not to set up. It would be better to re-use the plastic bags.</P>
    <P>There has been no effort in relation to recycling. The bottle bank was started mainly by the Simon Community. While there are bottle banks in some areas, it would be better if this practice was seized upon as a major municipal initiative. There is another regulation, No. 1163 dating from 1998. I wonder if anybody is doing anything to enforce that regulation.</P>
    <P>Energy recovery is being treated as a commercial venture in Ireland and is viewed as something which will solve our waste disposal problem. We must stop using the term landfill as these facilities are dumps. The problems with incinerators have been gone through carefully, and I will spare Members a discussion of the problems associated with land dumps, which include rats and Weil's disease. Dumps are the least preferable option. I was travelling near one of the dumps in Dublin with a German who said they would not keep sending Ireland money for structural development while we have such dumps.</P>
    <P>We went to Rio and signed Agenda 21, but we have a huge issue to address. I regret that we seem to be going backwards. Admittedly we are trying to reduce landfill, but are only going as far as energy recovery when we should be going far further in terms of the most favoured options in order to make an impact on the waste problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Molaim Fine Gael go bhfuil an abhair tábhachtach seo ar an chlár. I commend the Leas-Chathaoirleach and his colleagues for tabling this important motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> The issue is a serious challenge for local government. The debate over the years has falsely been presented as a choice between either landfill or incinerators. Incinerators still need landfill for hazardous ash. There are working alternatives in many countries which have rejected incineration. It is also worth pointing out that incineration introduces a range of new problems which are easily overlooked, including the need for hazardous landfill for pollution control residues and for bottom ash, an increased risk of leaching of contaminants, the possible dispersion of hazards if ash residue is used for construction, the undermining of public confidence in the safety of our food both at home and abroad and the financial liability for local authorities if we succeed in reducing waste volumes.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to acknowledge a report in <i>The Washington Post </i>on May 17 which dealt with the EPA report which linked dioxin to cancer. The report stated:</P>
    <P>The Clinton administration is preparing to dramatically raise its estimate of health threats from dioxin, citing new evidence of cancer risk from exposure to the toxic chemical compound. A draft of a long awaited report by the Environmental Protection Agency concludes for the first time that dioxin is a &ldquo;human carcinogen&rdquo;. The report notes that emissions of dioxin have plummeted from their peak levels in the 1970s but still may pose a significant cancer threat to some people who ingest the chemical through foods in a normal diet.</P>
    <P>Dioxin comes from both natural and industrial sources, such as medical and municipal waste incineration and paper pulp production. The chemical enters the food chain when animals eat contaminated plants. Dioxin then accumulates in the fat of mammals and fish. It has been linked to several cancers in humans, including lymphomas and lung cancer.</P>
    <P>Exposure to dioxin occurs over a lifetime and the danger is cumulative, the report said. Studies have found that people all over the globe have some dioxin in their bodies.</P>
    <P>Is the Department waging a propaganda war, encouraged by county managers who are reluctant to examine alternative waste policies? Are we abrogating our responsibility as elected politicians by paying consultants who may have prejudiced their views by their industry associations? The recent significant lead taken by Wexford County Council has not been recognised as the considered judgment it was. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in March sought to suggest the recent EU dioxin report had been interpreted incorrectly by councillors in Wexford and a comment was attributed to Dr. Heidelore Fiedler, one of the authors of the report. Direct contact with Dr. Fiedler revealed that no such criticism of Wexford County Council was ever made and that councillors were wise in their assessment. On 16 March Dr. Fiedler said:</P>
    <P>I have not been involved in any discussions <Col N="1023" /> and I am not familiar with the process that happened in Wexford. But even if I would have been it is certainly not for me to comment on any decision that has been made by the council. The UNEP and LUA reports both find that waste incineration is the largest dioxin source in many countries.</P>
    <P>Recently, concern with waste incineration has been highlighted by three sources. The EU dioxin assessment indicated the toxic effects of dioxin compounds and pointed to waste incineration as the number one contributor to the problem historically and in the present. The <i>EU Dioxin Exposure and Health Data 1999</i> states: &ldquo;However, in several member states, waste incineration is still an important source of dioxins&rdquo;. The leaked report from the US EPA implies that all sources of dioxin should be eliminated such is the risk to health posed by this family of chemicals in the food chain. <i>The Washington Post</i> of 17 May stated:</P>
    <P>For a small segment of the population who eat large amounts of fatty foods, such as meats and dairy produce that are relatively high in dioxins, the odds of developing cancer could be as high as one in 100, the report says. That estimate places the risk ten times as high as the EPA's previous projections.</P>
    <P>The report, obtained by <i>The Washington Post, </i>links low grade exposure to dioxins to a wide array of other health problems, including changes in hormone levels as well as developmental defects in babies and children. It also concludes that children's dioxin intake is proportionately much higher than adults because of the presence of the chemical in dairy products and even breast milk.</P>
    <P>The head of the EU Waste Management Directorate has also stated that new incinerators are unlikely to be built in Europe, that the building of incinerators by countries is not part of the EU's waste management programme, and that thermal treatment hinders progressive waste resource management initiatives. On 19 May <i>The Guardian</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Europe is moving to phase out the building of huge incinerators just as Britain is planning a new chain across the country as part of the Government's waste strategy, Ludwig Kraemer, head of the EU Waste Management Directorate, revealed last night.</P>
    <P>In France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Germany and Portugal no more new incinerators are being built because the public will not stand for them. &ldquo;They are treated in the same way as nuclear power stations &ndash; people no longer want them,&rdquo; he said. Mr. Kraemer said concerns about public health and traffic congestion and pollution caused by the lorries required to deliver hundreds of thousands of tons of waste to each incinerator had turned the public against them. &ldquo;Once they are built we are talk<Col N="1024" /> ing about creating waste streams for the next 25 years to keep the incinerators going,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>His warning follows revelations from the United States that Britain's new generation of incinerators could pose a cancer threat to local residents.</P>
    <P>Emissions from incinerators threaten health and the quality of food. In the case of dioxins it is wrong to claim there are many other significant sources in Ireland. Our low levels in cows' milk testify to our lack of sources. Lists of other dioxin sources are used to mislead the Irish public since these measurements are from industrial and contaminated Europe. Burning straw in Central Europe releases dioxins because incinerators have deposited dioxins on the lipid layer of grass. It would be wrong to justify introducing a major source of dioxins into this country on the basis of figures taken out of context.</P>
    <P>All sources of dioxin must be eliminated. If waste incineration is a source of dioxins, then it must be eliminated. This is why the EU Waste Management Directorate has stated that incineration is now being viewed in the same way as nuclear power &ndash; nobody wants it.</P>
    <P>Particulate matter from incineration is another problematic emission because it is so difficult to trap the dangerous parts. Smallest particles present the greatest threat, in particular those less than 2.5 microns. Pollution control devices in incinerators manage to catch only between 5% and 30%. These emissions cause heart attacks and strokes.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to eliminate all the risks from waste incineration simply because it is not possible to eliminate serious pollutants such as mercury, cadmium and other heavy metals, as well as the smallest and most dangerous particulate matter. Even the amounts of these that are removed must be disposed of in a landfill. The EU calculates that currently 36 tonnes of mercury are emitted from incinerators. Even after 2005, if the proposed directive is fully implemented, the level will still be greater than seven tonnes. There is no doubt that waste incinerators would become the most serious point sources of such a dangerous toxic metal in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recycling figures in Europe are not as high as our waste consultants would have us believe. Composting figures are also quite low in many of the environmentally friendly countries. It is important to note that composting is the optimum choice for organic waste if we truly want to recycle it and improve the quality of landfills. There are composting methods available that eliminate methane emissions. It is the organic fraction that makes landfills leach and smelly and produce methane emissions.</P>
    <P>A selection of European countries listed in order of dependence on incineration clearly reveals that the three countries with the greatest dependence on incineration are bottom of the league when it comes to recycling. The situation in France is clearly the most damning of incineration, while the Danish figures also dispel the <Col N="1025" /> myth that it has a good environmental record in waste management. While Germany, Finland and the Netherlands have respectable levels of recycling, it is still clear that, overall, incineration prevents recycling from being maximised.</P>
    <P>The choice is not between incinerators or landfills. There will be landfills for the foreseeable future. The question is what will go into them. Will we dump ash containing a range of hazardous metals or will they be restricted to materials separated from all organics that are impossible to recycle? Rejecting incineration in many countries has led to energy being devoted to sustainable alternatives. Even though much of this activity has only begun in the past ten to 15 years, there are many examples of success.</P>
    <P>In 1995 targets were set in Nova Scotia to reduce waste going to landfill and incineration by 50%. A wide range of measures were adopted, one of which was to ban certain materials going to landfill. At the end of last year a 44% diversion rate had been achieved. New Zealand, where incineration was rejected some years ago, now has 22 zero waste councils aiming to eliminate the disposal of used materials. It approaches the issue as one of resource management where one of the major incentives is the economic benefit derived from alternatives.</P>
    <P>There is no approved hazardous waste landfill in Ireland. The hazardous waste policy is to reduce the amount of hazardous waste generated. The proposed six incinerators would produce more than 50,000 tonnes of hazardous waste per year from the pollution control residues. This amounts to over one million tonnes requiring landfill over 20 years. This is not in keeping with the need to reduce hazardous waste. Locating these landfills will meet with deserved opposition. Using the figures mentioned, over 510,000 tonnes of bottom ash will be generated requiring landfills for disposal. This ash will contain the various contaminants found in fly ash but in a lower concentration. The use of bottom ash for construction purposes is one of the ways some countries avoid necessary landfills. This carries risks for the future. The Dutch Government has legislated for this.</P>
    <P>When incineration was proposed in New Zealand some years ago the argument made against it by the country's farmers was that it would damage agriculture. They were fearful that Ireland would use its position as the country with the lowest levels of dioxin to wipe them out on the world market. It is ironic that we run the risk of handing a competitive advantage to New Zealand on the basis of its equally low dioxin levels and absence of incineration. Consumer confidence is all important in agriculture as demonstrated by the BSE crisis and the Belgian dioxin crisis. The quantity of dioxin involved in Belgium was a mere one gramme. The IFA in Wexford recognised this in its opposition to thermal treatment for the south east. It stated, &ldquo;Emissions from an incinerator, whether real or imaginary, could cause food quality concerns with retailers or con<Col N="1026" /> sumers.&rdquo;  I understand one of the major food producers in the region was contacted by overseas customers to secure a guarantee that there was no incinerator within 40 kilometers of the company.</P>
    <P>There are a number of forms of thermal treatment but as yet only incineration has been used commercially for municipal solid waste. All other methods are still at an experimental stage. Other methods have been used up to now for particular feedstock. For example, gasification has been used for the combustion of used tyres. It is worth remembering the observation of Mr. Eamonn Timoney of Fehily Timoney, consultants, when asked the difference between incineration and thermal treatment: &ldquo;The difference between thermal treatment and incineration is only PR.&rdquo;  Gasification makes many claims for itself, even though it is still at the experimental stage. The major diffference is that it involves heating the waste in a primary chamber before burning it in a secondary chamber at higher temperatures than normal. Nothing in this process would prevent mercury from being present at the emission stage.</P>
    <P>Real consultation with local communities will reap results and changes in attitudes. Up to now the various consultants have engaged in presenting consultation charades and misleading questionnaires with leading questions. Unfortunately they looked for their guidance from the various incinerator companies to which many are associated.</P>
    <P>There are many initiatives that can be taken. There are many locations for councillors to visit, not incinerators. The south-east study group returned from its visit to continental incinerators with conclusions that stated that there were no public concerns with incineration in the countries visited. In contrast Ludwig Kraemer stated, &ldquo;They are treated in the same way as nuclear power stations &ndash; people no longer want them.&rdquo;  This is an issue on which local elected representatives need to take the lead with their communities to address the solutions. It is not appropriate to hand over such decisions to paid consultants with no electoral accountability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the excellent contribution of Senator Walsh. It was well researched and gave much food for thought.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by Fine Gael calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to discuss the issues involved. The Government amendment affirms Seanad Éireann's support for the current comprehensive integrated policy approach. The reality is that if one was to travel to any part of the country today one would see posters on every second or third pole with the words &ldquo;No Dump Here&rdquo; or &ldquo;No Super Dump Here&rdquo;. In Ashbourne one can see posters with the words &ldquo;Ashbourne Opposes Super Dump&rdquo; and in Drogheda, &ldquo;No Bin Tax Here.&rdquo;  God knows what we would find in Tipperary but what we would not find is a comprehensive integrated policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> While the public is involved to some extent through the county councils, the points made by Senator Walsh are very important. Sometimes consultants are afraid to attend public meetings. They are afraid of the hassle. The people are concerned about the lack of a proper waste management policy and are looking to the Government for leadership, but clearly it is not giving it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government spoke about a tax on plastic bags. What about a campaign to get rid of all the rubbish that consumers have to take home in those same plastic bags? There is no aggressive policy in supermarkets and no campaign by the Minister to encourage consumers to leave unnecessary packaging behind. There is a need for a revolution in our supermarkets. I am sorry Senator Quinn is not present, but supermarkets should seek to educate consumers by providing a receptacle in which they can place unnecessary packaging. A person who had three pancakes and a cup of coffee in McDonalds described in a letter to <i>The Irish Times </i>last week, running to about 15 lines, all the useless rubbish, including styrofoam, he had left behind. The following day there was a letter from a person in Norway to the effect that in that country one must use cardboard rather than styrofoam and wooden rather than plastic materials. The Minister has, therefore, not done his homework. The leaving certificate started today. I would give him three out of ten. There are seven points to be gained by way of a public campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the NIMBY syndrome &ndash; not in my backyard. Most people keep their refuse in their backyard. What they do not want is a massive super dump in their local community. Where possible, communities should be responsible for their own waste management, rather than have rural communities deal with waste from Dublin, Wexford, Drogheda or wherever else. That is easy to say. However, Galway County Council had a proposal to move its landfill sites around. Landfill is the last option we wish to take but the council proposed to move its sites around the county in order that the environmental problems would be spread and no one community would be stuck with them. This may not have been politically clever and the chairman of the council may have lost his seat. However, there is much sense in the proposal that each community takes its share of the burden. People have to put up with an unbelievable burden given the amount of refuse at Balleally dump and would support a fairer and more regularised distribution of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to waste incineration but the lack of such a facility leads to more landfill. The Government's amendment reaffirms its confidence that the EPA is doing a good job. I do not agree. On 1 January this year the EPA decided to close the town dump in Drogheda without any notice. I pointed out to the agency that it was not living up to its responsibilities. It did not make <Col N="1028" /> sense to close a landfill site overnight without providing the local authority with a reasonable period of time, such as three months, to find an alternative site or alternative sources of funding. I pointed out to the head of the EPA that its decisions should be practical. No one disagrees with the closure of landfill sites if they are environmentally unsound but there must be a phased and costed method of finding an alternative, and financial support from Government to do so.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to support local authorities faced with crises when landfill sites are closed. It did nothing when the site in Drogheda was closed but told the council that it was its problem and that it should get on with it. As a result, the council had to introduce unpopular decisions with which it has to live. I reject the Government's amendment as it does not state a comprehensive, integrated policy. It is doing nothing to help local authorities which have to face difficult environmental decisions and for that it is to be condemned. All this highfaluting talk is nonsense when landfill and waste management issues are highlighted on every second telephone pole. The Government needs to take a practical, realistic approach which is properly funded and managed. It must listen to people and get the work done in that way.</P>
    <P>I reject the amendment. I do not understand why it was tabled as it is a total nonsense. The Minister of State referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about an incinerator in central Europe which meets all the criteria it is supposed to meet. However, that is contradicted by scientific evidence from the US. We have a difficult problem with which to deal. We must do so carefully in a planned, financed way but the Government is failing to do so. The next general election may come sooner than Members wish and waste management will be one of the most important issues in the campaign. It is time the Government got its act together but the flowery language in its amendment is rubbish.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate this issue. I congratulate those who framed the motion and the manner in which it was done. I was encouraged when I read the motion because it invited Members to debate this issue in a logical, non-confrontational way. I thought that was to the credit of those who framed the motion but I did not expect an amendment. The fact that an amendment was tabled, and the wording used, filled me with despair. The amendment does nothing but defend the <i>status quo</i> which is indefensible. This is a backward step and the wrong direction to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped, even at this stage, the Government would seek to reach a consensus among parliamentarians that we would face the daunting challenges of dealing with waste and, having done so, would be in a position to give leadership. However, the amendment gives me no grounds <Col N="1029" /> for optimism that such a course of action will be taken.</P>
    <P>The EPA's most recent report makes grim reading. It points out that we are falling back instead of making advances and that the quality of our environment is deteriorating on every front. The Minister of State's speech referred to the theory of waste management. I am a supporter of this Government, but I am filled with despair if it does not see the glaring gaps between the theory and the practice.</P>
    <P>A bird's eye view of the country would show mountains of waste everywhere. We have doubled our waste in ten years. Not alone is the volume of waste increasing at that rate, but the nature of the waste has changed dramatically. Last year, 10,000 cars were ditched. They were driven into ditches, hedgerows and backyards without any plan or proposal for their disposal. The same applies to batteries and fridges. We are living in an obsolescence society. In my generation things were mended if broken but we have moved away from that approach. If things are broken or are no longer in fashion they are thrown out, dumped or disposed of without proper facilities.</P>
    <P>This country is littered with badly presented waste and unauthorised dumping. This does not happen everywhere. Some areas, particularly those most dependent on tourism for their survival, such as County Kerry, have confronted the situation. However, the overall position is scandalous. At the same time, every county is peppered with posters opposing the location of dumps &ndash;&ldquo;No Tip for Tipp&rdquo;. The issue has generated much local witticism but every parish has signs erected, which add to the litter, opposing the location of dumps. If they are not against dumps they are against incineration. In such a situation one would expect the Government to give some national leadership. The problem is there and it is not going to go away. It must be confronted and dealt with and I would have expected strong national leadership where the public would be alerted to certain facts, such as that rubbish has to be dealt with, one way or the other. We cannot carry on with our heads in the sand.</P>
    <P>We should also establish the best independent scientific evidence on each option. A public awareness campaign should be launched to educate the public on the options and alternatives available so that they can make decisions based on the best available independent scientific information. Deciding how to address this issue has been allowed drift and the country is in a state of anarchy. That is not the way to run a country or to give leadership on an issue as fundamental as waste management. The public needs to be educated, motivated and challenged to take ownership of this problem and to become partners in finding a solution to it. There is no evidence of partnership in the approach to this debate this evening, and I am worried and upset about that.</P>
    <P>I favour the hierarchy laid out in the Minister of State's speech. While it is fine on paper, it is <Col N="1030" /> not happening in practice. We are recycling less paper now than at any time during the past ten years. The amount of recycling taking place is minimal. Less waste prevention, recycling and reusing is taking place here than in any other EU member state. The aspiration towards that exists, but there is no gradual movement in that direction. That applies to every local authority.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, most local authorities have waste management plans, but there is no dynamic to their implementation. Time targets have not been set for their implementation and they are not monitored to establish whether the targets set will be achieved. I am not encouraged by what is happening.</P>
    <P>Lest we be filled with despair, all the hotels in Killarney have come together and put forward a proposal that their organic waste will be composted. That represents a genuine effort by one community to take action to reduce material before it goes into a landfill site. That should be the rule rather than the exception. Any worthwhile initiative of that nature throughout the country is the exception when it ought to be the rule.</P>
    <P>If nothing else comes out of this debate, I appeal to the Minister of State present, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, to take a stand on this, to give national leadership to try to find a national consensus to deal with this issue and to put the necessary infrastructure and the investment in place to enable recycling to take place. The Kerbside project in Dublin was discontinued due to a lack of investment. That alone is a statement as to where we stand on this issue.</P>
    <P>I commend this motion, but as a member of the Government side I will find it very difficult to support the amendment. That is the truth.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome this debate. It is timely and one which Members on all sides of the House have sought for some time. Many speakers referred to signs stating &ldquo;No dump wanted here&rdquo;, &ldquo;No super dump here&rdquo;, &ldquo;No tip here&rdquo;. Where are we to dispose of waste? A colleague across the floor of the House proposed that each small town and village should dispose of its waste, but how would bigger town dispose of theirs? We must have a waste management policy and plan.</P>
      <P>There is an active waste management plan in operation in my county. There is only one super dump in the county and the refuse is transported from all parts of the county to that super dump. The only problem is it is filling up faster than anticipated, which will pose a problem in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manager of our local authority recently invited some of its members to attend seminars and visit other countries that have waste management plans in operation. We visited dump sites, incinerator sites and waste management sites in other countries. Some of my colleagues visited sites in Germany, more visited sites in Austria <Col N="1031" /> and more visited sites in Holland. We were very impressed with the programmes in operation in those countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill said the Government does not have a waste management policy in place. The Minister of State said, &ldquo;When we published Changing our Ways in 1998, defining a new national waste management policy, we acknowledged that historically our performance in this area had been poor.&rdquo;  That was a brave statement for him to make and it is true, but at least it was admitted openly.</P>
    <P>Each local authority has been contacted to put in place a regional waste management plan. This matter was discussed recently in my region and it was agreed that a waste management plan was required for Kerry, Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary. In that region perhaps one incinerator and one super dump are required as well as recycling and other facilities. Those matters are being examined and consultants reports on this matter have been completed. While I would not agree with everything consultants recommend, one must take note of it.</P>
    <P>During the most recent debate on this matter in the county council of which I am a member, the county management team advised that a regional incinerator or region dump might not be viable as it may be too expensive to transport refuse from one county to another. That would make the operation of such a facility too expensive for householders and local authorities. Therefore, local authorities might need to reconsider local incinerators or other forms of waste disposal.</P>
    <P>My esteemed colleague on the far side of the House said that given the size of this country, we might require two or three incinerators. One might be adequate, but the main problem associated with it is the cost of transporting refuse to an incinerator.</P>
    <P>Kerry is the first county in the country to recycle part of its waste. It has an active composting operation in place. A good deal of compost is being generated and it is being sold. That composting operation is successful.</P>
    <P>Speakers referred to the dumping of fridges, cars and other products. I was impressed that the waste disposal plans in place in other countries provided different areas for the disposal of different types of refuse, whether cookers, washing machines, old batteries or other products, which are all recyclable. They also provided for the separate disposal of paper, cardboard and so on.  We were informed that households have three or four bins for the disposal of bottles, cardboard and other materials, which can be recycled. The refuse that cannot be recycled is put into another bin, which is transported to an incinerator. That accounted for only 2% of total waste disposal, which ensures landfill sites will be viable for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>Various arguments are emerging about incinerators, including that in the recent report from the <Col N="1032" /> United States which states that incinerators in Europe are emitting too much dioxin, which is a danger to health. That claim would require further investigation. I would not support acting on that finding simply because it is highlighted in a report. I would have to check how the waste generated by 250 million people in the United State is disposed of.</P>
    <P>We will have to adopt a uniform approach to address this issue. The Government approach to it is the correct one. It has contacted local authorities and asked them to adopt a new waste management plan, to regionalise waste management, and to find the best and most economical way to dispose of waste. We could all suggest landfills but that involves a cost to the consumer. One has to consider all these issues. God only knows what happened in the past when waste was stored in the backyard and most of it was burned. They also had an ash pit. We live in modern times and people wish to dispose of their refuse in many different ways. There are new types of refuse, such as plastic and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to waste in Kerry. The amount of waste littered across the countryside in Kerry in recent years which the local authority has had to collect is frightening. Tonnes of it along the roadway had to be bagged to ensure the area was respectable for those visiting the county. I appeal to the public to be more concerned about waste. The Government will have to initiate a programme of school visitation as schools can play an active part. If we are serious about this matter, a waste management structure will have to be put in place, whether incinerators or some other structure. I mentioned to the Minister earlier that a countrywide debate is necessary. Before making any stupid mistake proper research is necessary.</P>

      <P>I too welcome the debate and commend Fine Gael Senators for tabling the motion. However, I do not commend the Government for tabling the amendment. It is the most bizarre amendment I have seen in a long time. This is a neutral motion and there is absolutely no reason all sides could not accept it. To amend it by deleting the motion in its entirety is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>We are behind in dealing with waste. In 1996 the Waste Management Act was passed under the previous Administration. It gave local authorities four years in which to put their house in order, to have waste management plans adopted and in operation. Not a single local authority has reached that stage. In the fourth year, at the eleventh hour, they are trying to adopt waste management plans. Part of the reason is that there has been no leadership and no direction on a national policy front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is merrily strolling along as though the problem scarcely existed, yet it is at crisis stage. It is the largest problem facing the country. Our rivers and lakes are seriously polluted and <Col N="1033" /> the streets are strewn with litter. In urban areas the business community is putting up advertisements in relation to litter in an effort to protect the tourism industry. That is a scandalous situation.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has published a discussion document, Changing our Ways, which has been long awaited. There was a two year delay in relation to the proposals in the Waste Management Act. While we had expected the waste management plan would have been adopted, the debate did not start until 1998. Kerbside, the only waste recycling system in this city, has been abolished and has not been replaced. There is no recycling of domestic waste in the city of Dublin. That is a dire situation. The number of bottlebanks is few. Litter can be found everywhere and is getting worse.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation in relation to landlord responsibility for litter which is put out by their tenants is not being implemented because resources to do so have not been put in place. Acres of plastic bags are put out at weekends, along the North Circular Road, the South Circular Road and other areas of high density private rented accommodation, which is torn up by dogs and cats. This results in litter being strewn all over the place.</P>

      <P>Yes, by magpies and all sorts of animals and birds which are appearing on the scene. There is a crisis.</P>
      <P>How is it that the Government has not seen its way to imposing a tax on plastic bags? Why not charge everybody for a plastic bag? It is very simple. In Paris or in any other European capital there is a charge on plastic bags. If it were imposed here some money would come into the retail outlets and the exercise would be worthwhile. It would even yield a few pounds in tax to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Something as simple as composting is not being done either. There is no reason any house with a back garden should not have its own compost barrel to deal with biodegradable domestic refuse. That is an obvious way of dealing with it. Dublin Corporation announced two weeks ago that it has such a scheme in place but it never told councillors that it has compost bins.</P>

      <P>It is outrageous. It should be advertised as being available either free or on payment of a token fee to every household that has a means of using it. The tentative targets in Changing our Ways do not add up &ndash; a diversion of 50% of all household waste, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable municipal wastes, 300,000 tonnes of organic waste annually. There is no attempt to make it all equal to 100%, it is all over the place. In one line there is a reference <Col N="1034" /> to percentages and in another tonnes. There is a reference to 35% of municipal waste and 50% of construction and demolition waste. These figures are taken out of the air and do not exist in reality. The Minister has told every local authority to draw up its plan, yet the national target is not accurate in any form. Dublin Corporation has a landfill target of 60% while the document refers to a landfill target of 50%. A 60% landfill is hardly a decent target.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Walsh in relation to incineration. This is an unreal science. The scientist is telling us there has been no threat, the EPA says there is no threat to human health and that dioxins emanating from incineration and gasification do not cause cancer. The latest studies show there is a ten times greater risk from incineration than was thought by the EPA a couple of weeks ago. We do not know what incineration has in store for us. Why pursue a costly system that will damage those living in the area? We have to rethink our strategy on charging. Much work has to be done as to where the charges for waste management schemes will come from. I would like to speak about this in some detail but I do not have time to do so now.</P>

      <P>This is an important issue in which everyone has an interest. The Celtic tiger is roaring so much now that one has time to sit around dinner tables and discuss our environment. It is a major issue and one that we are all very conscious of as it can bring about a better quality of life for all. The motion mentions waste reduction, recycling, composting, incineration and gasification, which are subjects of ongoing debate at local authority level and in all walks of life. I reaffirm my support for the Government's integrated policy on waste management. The matter is being tackled in a hierarchical way, involving the reduction and recycling of waste as well as reusing waste through composting and incineration. The hardest task is to get to the root of waste reduction, which involves dealing with plastic bags and making the public more aware of litter control generally.</P>
      <P>I have been seeking a tax on plastic bags for a long time. I am glad, therefore, that following a public consultation process, the Department of the Environment and Local Government is at an advanced stage in developing specific mechanisms to implement the Government's commitment to tax plastic shopping bags. I am advised that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, will bring that proposal to Government shortly. It is a great breakthrough. I cannot bear to come out on a Sunday morning and see so many plastic bags and cartons strewn all over our streets, trees, rivers and parks. This proposal is a great start and I compliment the Government on tackling the problem. This is a national issue rather than a local authority one and it must be tackled at source. It is great to see that leadership is being provided on this matter.</P>

      <P>I would condemn the Government if it had not taken the initiative. The Senator has not done his homework on that matter. I regard recycling very highly and I wish Senator Quill was here to discuss it. Only yesterday I attended the launch of the new household recycling service which will replace the Kerbside scheme. Senators Costello and Quill said nothing was happening with the Kerbside scheme. They said it had disintegrated but now the four Dublin authorities have come together, following the initial move by South Dublin County Council, to launch this new public private partnership. I am delighted I was at the launch yesterday in Rathfarnham where the green recycling bin has been introduced to take newspapers, magazines, light cardboard packaging and aluminium cans. This provides training for the public in differentiating between ordinary waste and recyclable waste. This example proves it is wrong to say that nothing is being done to manage waste. We met the residents yesterday and they complimented us on getting the scheme off the ground. At least we are showing an attempt at leadership in this area despite the fact that some contributors to the debate claimed there was no leadership.</P>
      <P>According to the announcement of the new scheme, over 6,000 green wheelie bins will be distributed to residents in the Rathfarnham area over the next ten days. Each householder will be given a green wheelie bin which will be collected every four weeks. Newspapers, magazines and aluminium cans will be accepted for collection. In all, 18,000 houses in the South Dublin County Council administrative area will receive the service this year. It is intended that all households in south Dublin will receive the service on a phased basis over the next two years.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the issue of composting, which involves the reuse of waste materials. Essentially, the process comprises converting kitchen waste to energy through gasification and thermal treatment. To this end we will again train the public by introducing another bin called the brown bin. South Dublin County Council is very clear about how it will manage waste. The three examples I have cited will be phased in over the next two to three years. Senators who say that nothing is being done by the Government can take it from me that leadership has been well established. I am delighted I was able to contribute to that process yesterday by launching the new household recycling service to replace the Kerbside scheme. It is quite incorrect to say that nothing is happening in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incineration will always be a political hot potato, but our aim is that only 15% of waste will eventually be dealt with by this process. The <Col N="1036" /> problem is that we did not get our campaign right to tell the public how incineration works. It is quite a complicated subject that requires much thought, so we need to explain it in a simple fashion. Incineration is a scientific method of managing waste but the public is ready to learn and the Government will take the lead in bringing the message to them. I welcome the amendment to the motion and I hope those who oppose it will listen to what I have said on the subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the amendment and I agree that the Government has done a huge amount since we started the Changing Our Ways campaign which highlighted the reuse, recycling and reduction of waste. We are on our way towards taxing plastic bags and I suggest that all the taxes raised in that way should go towards the provision of local recycling campaigns. A comprehensive investment programme should target education on waste matters for primary and secondary schools. Such a programme could be funded through local authorities.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister for more promotional and educational information on incineration to be made available in an audio-visual format and I repeat that request. Why introduce any such incineration technology &ndash; even if the dioxin emission levels are described as not carcinogenic or cancer causing &ndash; that may cause problems in future? We readily admit that our waste recycling and reduction methods are not good enough, so why not give the Changing Our Ways programme a chance? After a period we could evaluate whether we still require thermal treatment to get rid of any remaining waste.</P>
      <P>The Minister should re-examine waste policy and take a couple of years to evaluate the success of the programmes we are putting in place. Based on the findings of that evaluation, we would decide whether we need to implement a thermal treatment process and whether incinerators need to be placed strategically at regional centres. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this debate. This is indicative of the Government's commitment and I hope he will take all our points on board.</P>

      <P>It is evident from the Minister of State's response to this debate that he was not paying attention to what I said. It is unfortunate that the Government decided to put down an amendment to this motion. Given the contributions from Senators on both sides of the House, including the Minister of State's party colleagues, there was no justification for an amendment. We sought a genuine debate and information. What we received in response was a consolidation of the Government's position. The question now is what is the Government's position? It is evident from the contributions that the Government has none. If it wants to genuinely deal with waste management, it must introduce genuine policies &ndash; policies which were referred to by Senators from all sides and which must be <Col N="1037" /> effective &ndash; instead of which, we got a single justification for incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spoke about air emissions and toxins in bottom ash etc. but we never got into the details. Apart from the health aspects, what is the cost of incineration? Can it be justified in this regard? Are the figures genuine or one-sided? We are only getting one side of the argument, which tells us what we should be doing. The Minister of State said the response of local authorities has been positive. The Government spokesperson, Senator Walsh, in his well-researched contribution, told him that the response of local authorities to incineration has not been positive but the very opposite. Wexford County Council has already rejected it. The Minister of State must put in place a genuine, effective means of reduction, replacement and composting. He must examine these methods before he takes the alternative, <Col N="1038" /> which may threaten people's health, or come back with a justification for being so positively in favour of incineration.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the debate was so curtailed. Senators Quill, Costello and I, with other Senators, have continually asked for a lengthy debate on this issue, which we failed to get. Unfortunately, we had to compress it into the few hours given to us tonight, as a result of which certain issues were not dealt with. Worst of all, we have come out with no further information or no greater knowledge which tells us what we should be doing. How can we go back to our local authorities and tell them we have made no progress? All we got was a one-sided response from the Government. I will have to vote against the Government amendment as a result. I am sorry this amendment was put down in what should have been a genuine and open debate.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. There may be some confusion as to the actual matter on the Adjournment, but the issue is that there has been a problem with the absence of a speech teacher in this school. It seems difficult to understand how deaf students can receive a decent education &ndash; all students are entitled to as full an education as they can get &ndash; if they do not have the services of a speech teacher. It is difficult to contemplate how a situation has arisen where no speech teacher has been appointed to the school.</P>
      <P>The issue is simple. Will a speech teacher be appointed? There are also no Irish sign language teachers in both primary schools for the deaf in the Cabra area. We are talking about the hard of hearing and the profoundly deaf, but the same principle applies &ndash; education cannot be imparted to these young people unless there is both a sign language teacher and a speech teacher for those who are hard of hearing. I will be very interested in the Minister of State's response.</P>

      <P>Speech therapy services are the responsibility of the relevant <Col N="1039" /> health authorities. However, I assure the Senator of the Department of Education and Science's commitment to ensure that all schools catering for children with special needs, including St. Mary's school for deaf girls, receive the level of services they require. St. Mary's is a special school which caters for pupils, both at primary and post-primary level, with hearing impairment. The pupil-teacher ratio applicable to the school is 7:1, as is recommended by the Special Education Review Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Senator that the staffing levels in this school are well within quota. There are currently 146 pupils enrolled in the school, 50 at primary level and 96 at post-primary level. The school has a principal and 39 teachers, 12 primary teachers and 27 post-primary teachers. The school also has five special needs assistant posts which have been allocated by the Department of Education and Science. The deployment <Col N="1040" /> of the teaching staff in any school is a matter for the board of management of the school. I understand that a primary school teacher has been deployed by the board of management of St. Mary's to cater for the speech needs of pupils in the primary section of the school.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has also sanctioned 11 hours part-time teaching to the school to support speech teaching. This support is also deployed by the school management in the primary section of the school. The Minister has asked his Department's inspectorate to review the staffing arrangements in the school and to consult with the school management with regard to the need to deploy a teacher at post-primary level to provide speech teaching support. He has also asked his officials to raise the issue of speech therapy support for the school with the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 June 2000.</P>
