      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene to restore an educational grant to a third level student (details supplied) who had been refused this facility by Kildare County Council.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Walsh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to arrange to have a section of a Government Department decentralised to New Ross, County Wexford.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3, 1 and 22, motion 23: No. 2, Town Renewal Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 3, Firearms (Firearm Certificates for Non-Residents) Bill, 2000 &ndash; All Stages. Notwithstanding anything in the Standing Orders relative to private business, No. 1, The Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, 1997 &ndash; Report Stage (Resumed), will be taken no earlier than 4 p.m. No. 22, motion 23, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is agreed. The issue of national primary and secondary routes was raised some time ago and there was a request that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government or a representative of the National Roads Authority should be invited to the House to discuss it. Will the Deputy <Col N="1634" /> Leader arrange a debate so the position in relation to national and secondary routes can be discussed? Something must be done urgently about the congestion on our roads which has developed over recent years. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange such a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are happy with the Order of Business. I wish to draw the Deputy Leader's attention to the development yesterday in Europe where President Chirac of France appeared to agree with Mr. Fischer in Germany on what he called an inner core or pioneer group which could move faster in Europe. The House will not meet for a number of months, but there may be developments in that regard because France takes over the EU Presidency later this week. If specific attention is not paid to this matter during the next few months, we could be left behind in an area where Ireland has not taken steps. I ask the Deputy Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the urgency of this matter.</P>
      <P>An advertisement appeared yesterday on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, seeking tenders for electronic voting systems in future elections. It is interesting that this advertisement was placed at this time, given that there may be an urgency in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The cathaoirleach of South Dublin County Council said this morning at the hand over of a public private enterprise library in Lucan that the right way to avoid apathy and low turn out in elections is to ensure that polling takes place in supermarkets. I put my heart and soul behind that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was tied up with the Department of the Environment and Local Government's wish for electronic voting, deals could be done with supermarket companies for correct voting procedures at checkouts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>On a previous occasion I asked the Leader for a detailed debate on the responsibilities of the media, particularly with a view to the establishment of a regulatory body such as a press council. Members may have read reports in the newspaper today regarding the death of Anthony Cawley in prison. He was a sad and deprived young man who was serving a long <Col N="1635" /> term of imprisonment for crimes against society. Reports today suggest that there may have been a media connection with his death in terms of advertising relating to his case with a view to selling extra newspapers.</P>
      <P>There are many cases of insensitivity, recklessness and ruthlessness in the media regarding individuals, many of whom have not committed any crimes, but who have no recourse to fair play subsequently. It is time, in the interest of the media which we all respect, to analyse such cases. If a public representative was connected with this case, there would be an in-depth analysis day in, day out. We must have fair play across the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Mental Health Bill has not come before the House, despite having asked the Leader about it for three years. It is at Second Stage in the other House but it will not come before this House before the recess. When can we expect to debate it in the next session? It is extremely important legislation for which many people are waiting. I have received representations from people who find it extraordinary that we have been shouting about it for the past three years but still have not debated it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the continuing closure of fundamental services in rural areas and the reluctance of Departments to take responsibility for it. A large number of banks and other financial services are closing because of retrenchment and changes in the information technology sector. It is time the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development was asked to come into the House to outline the steps the Government may take to provide basic fundamental services throughout the country, particularly in rural areas. It is important for the Government to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Burke's call for a debate on our national primary and secondary roads. I am talking about the main road from the west to Dublin through Tarmonbarry. There was a serious accident involving a bus at Frenchpark in the past fortnight which highlights the type of bad roads in that area and in Swinford and Ballina. Some of us will not see a good road in that area if we adhere to the timeframe set out in the national development plan. There is an urgent need for a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I call for a debate on safety at sea. There were successful campaigns recently about safety on construction sites and in farmyards. However, each year during the fine weather young people are drowned as a result of boating and other accidents at sea and on lakes and rivers. If we cannot have a debate before the end of the session, I ask the Deputy Leader to <Col N="1636" /> request the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to undertake an advertising campaign to highlight the dangers of accidents at sea, particularly at this time of the year. Unfortunately, someone will lose a loved one during the summer. I ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to take this issue on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday was a turbulent day and we may have inadvertently missed decisions taken at the Cabinet meeting yesterday. Will the Deputy Leader tell us what measures, if any, were announced or decided in relation to price controls? I am glad the Government decided not to tinker with the groceries order. It has provided stability and a fair trading environment since it was introduced in 1987 or 1988.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the news that Dublin is the fifth most expensive city in Europe. This is important from the point of view of our tourism trade. Was the rise in inflation and the damage it may cause to our tourism trade addressed at the Cabinet meeting yesterday?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Chambers on the question of the maintenance of services throughout rural Ireland. If we were serious about that issue rather than simply paying lip service to combating exclusion and marginalisation, the Government has to do everything in its power to ensure that banks, post offices and all the necessary services are maintained. In addition, the Government, through the Department of Health and Children, must examine its policy in regard to some of the moves to centralise hospital services&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an interest to declare as a member of the board of Independent News &amp; Media but, personally speaking, I support Senator Ó Murchú's plea for a serious and sensible debate on the role of the media in society and in developing some sensible means by which people who are aggrieved by their treatment in the media can seek redress. We should try to extend the debate to include some sort of consideration of the advisability of changing our libel laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on the media. Some years ago I tabled a motion, which was discussed, but there were only three speakers &ndash; the then leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, Senator Cassidy and myself. It got a very bad reception in the Seanad. I get tired listening to wall to wall coverage in the media, particularly on radio, to the effect that politicians are all the same. I have been 37 years in politics and I can look them all straight in the eye. I have nothing hidden in my cupboard and I would not <Col N="1637" /> be 37 years in politics if that were the case. I speak for 97% if not 98% of elected representative in this country. Because 1% or 2% have in some way violated the rules, should we all be tarred with the same brush? Many solicitors and accountants have been struck off but those professions were not tarred with the one brush. Why are politicians being treated differently? It is because those in the media are getting away with it, but we should all defend ourselves. I know I speak for 97% or 98% of the men and women who are elected to public life at local and national levels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask that the debate be widened to include the privacy law. I have said before that if some politician gets into trouble, that is fair enough, but why should pictures of their wives and families who are innocent people, and their homes, be spread across the newspapers? That is done for one reason only &ndash; to sell the product that makes the big media combines more and more profitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We must not pre-empt the debate which has been sought. Senator Farrell, these are points which can be made in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are doing it to make money for their big combines and now they are taking over every provincial paper in Ireland to try to clean up on this issue. It is time we realised that they are selling this product not for higher motives but to see how much money they can make out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support Senator Chambers's call for a debate on services, particularly in rural areas, and we should include in that the up to date position on the EU directive on social welfare services and the effects it will have on rural post offices. I also support the call for a debate on national primary and secondary roads. I read the NRA report in the paper yesterday on the tolls that will be placed on many of the new motorways which described the N3 as the Dublin to Monaghan road, and the motorway from Clonee to Kells. In fact, the Dublin to Monaghan road is the N2 and as far as I understand, there are no plans to upgrade that road to a motorway. It is the main artery to the north-west. I would like that issue to be included in the debate and perhaps the Minister would give us an update on the position and whether we will have a motorway on the N2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A welcome announcement was made yesterday by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the effect that new houses built after January 2001 must be wheelchair friendly. That is wonderful news. Hav<Col N="1638" /> ing regarding the announcement of the building of additional houses, I urge the Minister to request engineering personnel in local authorities to ensure that houses currently being planned for this year and next year will be wheelchair friendly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Burke, Caffrey and Bonner raised the issue of national primary and secondary roads and the need to have a debate on road structures and the role of the National Roads Authority, which is an important issue. As we are nearing the end of this session, the amount of time available for such a debate is limited. I suspect we could have that debate in the next session. I recall the Leader of the House giving a commitment to have such a debate when the matter by raised by Senator Finneran recently.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's comments on what President Chirac said about an inner core of EU States, I noted what was said and I &ndash; and I am sure the Government &ndash; would be concerned about the possiblity that there could be a two-speed European Union. I understand President Chirac said that in the context of enlargement. I am sure the Government will take Senator Quinn's views into account and I will bring them to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As the Deputy said, the French Presidency has just begun and it is flagging part of its intention for its Presidency.</P>
      <P>I have seen a demonstration of the electronic voting system and I would welcome its introduction. It would enable people to vote in their nearest polling station for any constituency in the country. That is technically possible and such a facility would benefit students and others who find it difficult to travel home to vote, although there are security aspects to that. I am not sure supermarkets are the most appropriate places to install such a system; I would welcome its introduction in my nearest licensed premises, although I would not like to encourage young people to frequent them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the matters of the media, the press council and defamation raised by Senators Ó Murchú, Maurice Hayes and Farrell, Senator Ó Murchú talked about media responsibility, but perhaps it is a contradiction in terms as to whether the media are responsible. It is important in our democracy that we have free speech and fair comment. I do not think anyone is suggesting that they should be restricted, but this is an important issue to which we should allow time for a debate. When it was discussed in the past not many Members contributed, but in an earlier debate on the Law Reform Commission's proposals on defamation quite a number of Members contributed. I will check about allowing time to debate that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jackman raised the issue of the Mental Health Bill. While we do not have any control over what the Dáil does, I will raise that matter with the Chief Whip of the Dáil to ascertain what <Col N="1639" /> progress can be made. I am as anxious as the Senator to ensure that Bill should come to this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senators Chambers, Coghlan and Bonner said about the closure of services in rural areas. A certain base of social infrastructure is required in rural areas with regard to banks, post offices, Garda presence and so on. The Senators' specific request was that the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development should address this House to ascertain what can be done about that, although I suspect it will be the next session before we can arrange such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan raised the issue of safety at sea. As we enter the holiday period, it is important to stress the need for safety and to advocate caution with regard to activities on beaches and our inland waterways. Many such activities are covered in the recent marine casualties Bill, although I realise the Senator called for a broader measure to deal with accidents at sea.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform Senator Coghlan that the Government is introducing a package of measures, which have been widely called for, to control inflation. Since I was not at the Cabinet meeting at which this matter was discussed, I am not in a position to say what happened and even if I had been at it I would not be in a position to indicate what was said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Deputy Leader is the conduit between the Government and this House I thought he might have been in a position to say what happened and I wanted to afford him the opportunity&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things which the Government is attempting to do, and which I applaud, is to stop profiteering. It is obvious that one of the elements in inflation is profiteering by traders of various sorts. The Director of Consumer Affairs was right to advocate that people be vigilant in terms of shopping around in supermarkets or whatever.</P>
      <P>Senator Moylan referred to the regulation that new houses must be wheelchair friendly from January 2001. I welcome this move. In Kildare County Council I have been seeking for some time that the various building regulations be put in place to ensure that houses are wheelchair friendly and that people with disability can move freely. For example, handles on doors should be of the lever type rather than the knob type. Unless one is disabled one would not have thought about this but the Senator is correct and I shall certainly bring his views to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of Senators to a printing error in amendment No. 1 on the list of amendments. It should read: &ldquo;In page 3, subsection (1), to delete line 37, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 and 2&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete line 37, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 and 2.</P>
      <P>The printing error is confusing. The reason for this amendment is simple and was discussed yesterday on Second Stage. There is a high degree of arbitrariness in the Bill with regard to the decision making process for designating towns under the town renewal scheme. Urban towns in County Dublin are excluded from the scheme and we have not yet been given a reason for that. What explanation can the Minister offer for all towns in County Dublin being excluded from the scheme?</P>
      <P>There is also no explanation why the Minister for Finance, who is totally removed from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the local authorities, can make the final decision. That is unwise. It is important, therefore, that line 37 in page 3 and lines 1 and 2 of page 4 should be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to permit towns in Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to participate in the scheme. The scheme is designed to promote the physical renewal of smaller towns, with a heavy focus on residential development in run down areas of those towns, thus revitalising them as living communities. I am confident that the select application of incentives to smaller towns will have the desired effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if there is an implied criticism in the amendment to the effect that, as was claimed by Deputies Dukes and Gilmore in the Lower House, the Bill is anti-Dublin because of this section. Dublin has benefited hugely under every urban renewal scheme since the 1980s, when we first set about tackling urban dereliction through <Col N="1641" /> the use of tax incentives. The benefits that have accrued include the International Financial Services Centre, the development of the docklands area, the Temple Bar project and the HARP initiative, to name a few. Under the current urban renewal scheme, which was debated in the Seanad over a year ago, extensive areas of the city centre, Ballymun, Tallaght, Clondalkin and Balbriggan are benefiting.</P>
    <P>The focus of this scheme is different. It is configured to meet the problems which have arisen in scores of smaller towns dotted throughout rural areas which are not in a position to reap the type of benefits which proximity to the capital city can bring. The new scheme is also heavily focused on residential initiatives, particularly refurbishment. As I stated, it will have the potential to boost the supply of houses at a time when this is necessary. The towns in administrative counties in Dublin are suburban in character, not rural. These are already high demand areas for housing, as a cursory perusal of the property pages of the daily newspapers will confirm. I am absolutely amazed that a Senator from rural County Clare would seek to imply&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Senator success in that regard but she will not get an opportunity for some time yet. In these circumstances, I am satisfied it would not be appropriate to introduce incentives to encourage residential developments in the towns in Dublin suggested by the Senator. Anyone with their head screwed on and with a bit of common sense would recognise the huge demand for properties in these areas. The introduction of tax incentives for these towns at this stage would not achieve the objective of the Bill, which is to alleviate dereliction and decay and bring life back into rural towns.</P>
      <P>This legislation is a chance to help the sun to shine on rural Ireland for a change. It is the first proposal of which I am aware that can have a substantial beneficial effect on these towns if utilised properly and fully. It would defeat the whole purpose of the legislation to extend the proposals to towns in Dublin where the rural town problem does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking to the Minister's reply. I cannot equate his claim that the legislation will boost housing supply with the Govern<Col N="1642" /> ment's employment of Bacon for the third time to draw up a report recommending financial controls of 9% stamp duty and 2% tax over three years on property investments. The Minister of State said that the number of residential property units will grow in these areas. If people with money wish to invest in these run down areas to bring them back to life, where is the incentive for them to do so given the Bacon report? How does he see the Bacon report&mdash;</P>

One must consider the national dimension while first giving priority to and fully appreciating the local scenario. It is for that reason I tabled my amendment.</P>
      <P>Although towns close to Dublin enjoy an economic advantage, many of them suffer a degree of dereliction. The centres of many towns close to Dublin are very shabby and run down, despite being surrounded by wonderful suburbs. Many of these towns have benefited from urban renewal schemes but others, such as Ballybrack, Shankill, Cabinteely, Glasthule, Balbriggan and Newcastle, have not. I am amazed that the Minister of State has not paid greater attention to towns such as Newcastle in the constituency of his party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. His explanation is not convincing.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn's concern for the Dublin area is touching. I commend her for proposing this amendment because it highlights two significant differences between the policies of the main Opposition party and the Government. Few economists would agree with the main Opposition party in promoting tax incentives for residential development in Dublin. The day for that is long past.</P>
      <P>The development of rural Ireland, particularly the west, midlands and Border region, is a main feature of Government policy. The town renewal scheme will assist and encourage commercial and industrial development in areas of need. The amendment would fly in the face of this policy. This difference between the policies of Fine Gael and the Government is interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Senator's comment on the Tánaiste's constituency, the Minister of State is to be commended for concentrating on the revitalis<Col N="1643" /> ation of rural Ireland and overlooking narrow political gain.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate to argue the merits of the Government's proposals for housing when discussing this amendment. However, I point out to the Senator who raised the issue that the Government's concern is for people who are finding it difficult to buy their first home. We are anxious to moderate house prices so that people who had a reasonable expectation of being able to buy a house will again be able to do so. This is why a major change was made in the stamp duty requirement, exempting first time buyers of houses under £150,000.</P>
      <P>If the Senator is referring to the decision to increase stamp duty to 9% on all houses being purchased for investment purposes only, it should be understood that the levy does not apply if the person making the investment is prepared to register as a landlord, provide a rent book and comply with the requirements laid down for landlords of residential property. A person who is a professionally legitimate landlord in the house rental market should have no fear of the levy proposed in Action on Housing published two weeks ago. He will, however, have to pay 9% stamp duty on the purchase price. This measure is aimed at people who are buying up multiples of houses and pushing first time buyers out of the market. First time buyers cannot compete with people who in some instances have bought all the new houses on offer. We have heard of cases where 100 new houses were put up for sale and people wishing to buy them were told that the first three people in the queue had bought them all. We want to discourage this practice as much as we can. That is why we have introduced fairly penal levels of stamp duty in those instances because we want to bring about some equilibrium in the market and protect people in a weaker financial position.</P>
      <P>I do not see any justification in what has been said for accepting this amendment. The town renewal scheme gives a tax incentive to people to encourage them to invest in their own property or others to invest in property in rural towns. This is done in the hope that investment will flow, that the towns will be renewed and that a new spirit will be brought back into them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (3), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) the social and economic integration of disadvantaged groups of residents, and</P>
      <P>(<i>f</i>) the promotion of the Gaeltacht language and culture where a town is in a Gaeltacht area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment is very straightforward. I want certain considerations to be taken into account along with those already in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will fully appreciate why I have tabled my amendment, particularly paragraph (<i>e</i>) which refers to the social and economic integration of disadvantaged groups of residents. In every town the economic status of residents can vary quite considerably. There is quite a deprived group of people in some towns. In recent years there has been an attempt to address this problem through the introduction of a variety of schemes by the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach. The town renewal scheme provides an additional opportunity for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the county councils to provide incentives to break the division that exists in the social and economic strata of communities in small to medium sized towns.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State may find, on examining the proposals put forward for many of the towns, that some of them may not include the areas of greatest social disadvantage. This is partly due to the fact that local authority housing already exists in some of these areas or local authority houses have been purchased for private use. We need to ensure that there is balanced investment in towns and that it is not concentrated in the middle-class areas. I know this is a delicate matter. In the interest of balance we must focus on the areas of greatest social disadvantage. I appreciate that this is a difficult matter but I want the Minister and his Department to use their expertise to examine this matter.</P>
      <P>My amendment also proposes another paragraph relating to the promotion of the Gaeltacht language and culture where a town is in a Gaeltacht area. I am sure the Minister with his fluency in Irish and representing a constituency that has a large Gaeltacht area fully appreciates what is involved here. Recently I heard one of his constituents on national radio who was deeply concerned about a large local authority housing development proposed by Galway County Council. There was a great fear among the native people there that by imposing quite a large number of non Irish speaking people on that area, there was a danger that the Gaeltacht and the Irish language would be subsumed by the English cultures and traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> We appreciate that this is a difficult and a delicate matter and we recognise the constitutional rights of individuals to free movement, ownership and so on. However, there is a need to preserve what is good in our tradition and culture, especially in Gaeltacht areas. It is important that this is also a consideration and I ask the Minister to incorporate both of these paragraphs into subsection (3).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the broad thrust of Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn's point regarding these two matters, particularly the social and economic integration of disadvantaged groups of residents. Molaim í freisin as an suim atá aici i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the sentiments behind the amendment, I wonder whether it is necessary. The Town Renewal Bill deals with small towns and villages with a population of between 500 and 6,000, where there is not the social disparity evident in larger towns or cities. We are referring to rural Ireland where there is quite good social integration, such as in those areas that have applied, for example Bunclody, Ferns, Rosslare Harbour and Taghmon and places like these where there is not any great social divide. I know from my local authority's submission that we focused on areas within those towns and villages in need of refurbishment and revitalisation.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with the broad thrust of the amendment, I would have thought from reading through the Bill that the spirit of what the Senator has suggested is encapsulated in the broader remit of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria specified by the Minister in this Bill cover the broad policies and principles which underpin the guidelines for the scheme. These broad criteria include the promotion of physical renewal and revitalisation of towns as cultural, commercial, social and residential centres. The amendment which the Senator proposes seeks to address the issues of disadvantaged groups of residents in the promotion of the Gaeltacht language and culture. The criteria <i>(a)</i> to <i>(d)</i> as laid out in subsection (3) are, in effect, the broad principles on which the detailed guidelines of the scheme are premised and they encompass the various objectives outlined in the guidelines. Due to their broad scope, it seems unnecessary to add more specific objectives in this subsection as the guidelines are sufficiently broad to accommodate the issues being raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to have repetition or unnecessary verbiage when this measure is already provided for in terms of what is contained in subsection (3). While the focus of the scheme is on physical restoration and revitalisation, there are other direct benefits which will flow from the successful implementation of the scheme. Bear in mind too that the scheme will apply to quite small towns which will not have the critical mass to justify the large-scale integrated approach which <Col N="1646" /> characterised the previous scheme, the urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge de, táim sásta go bhfuil bunús sásúil sa Bhille i dtaca le stádas na Gaeilge agus le cultúr na Gaeltachta. Tá sé ar intinn agam go dtabharfar aird chuimsitheach ar phrionsabail áirithe nuair a bheidh pleananna athnuachana á gcur le chéile agus go gcuirfear cúrsaí cultúrdha san áireamh ach go háirithe, rud atá soiléir sa Bhille atá os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Agus muid ag tabhairt faoi chúrsaí cultúrdha bheadh sé dochreidte muna dtabharfaí tús áite do chúrsaí teanga. Mar is eol daoibh chomh maith, mar bhí díospóireacht ar an ábhar anseo tamall beag ó shin, tá cosaint speisialta sa Bhille um Pleanáil agus Forbairt don Ghaeilge agus do chúrsaí cultúrdha maidir le pleananna forbartha na n-údarás áitiúla. Tá sé leagtha síos chomh maith in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, which has been passed by the Houses. It provides for &ldquo;the protection of the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as the community language where there is a Gaeltacht area in the area of the development plan&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I stated yesterday, the implementation of the town renewal plan must comply with the proper planning and development of the area outlined in the county development plan. Heed must be taken of the objectives stated in the county development plan and the new planning and development legislation already takes language into account by including Gaeltacht areas. There is no need for the amendment. The additional criteria are provided for in the legislation and in the Planning and Development Bill, 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. However, the deficiency in the subsection is that while the criteria are outlined, they are broad and the danger is that they can be interpreted any way one wishes, whereas if they were more specific one could not interpret them as broadly or with such variance. Broad criteria can be interpreted in a variety of ways and that could be seen as a deficiency rather than a strength in the legislation. The inclusion of the additional criteria which I propose would not detract from the subsection but would strengthen it and give more specific guidance to the management of local authorities and to the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Finance in making specific decisions. Furthermore, it would be to the advantage of those charged with the responsibility of implementing the scheme to have them included. I hope the Minister of State will rethink his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh stated that social disparity is almost non-existent in smaller towns. Perhaps that is the case in Wexford but that has not been my experience throughout the country. There is much social disparity in small towns. This scheme applies to towns with populations between 500 and 6,000 and social disparity is quite evident in <Col N="1647" /> towns with populations of between 3,000 and 4,000. I agree with Senator Walsh with regard to small villages with populations of between 500 and 700 but a different scenario applies in larger towns with populations of 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000. This is important and should be taken on board. I accept that a reference to social disparity is included in section 3(3)(<i>b</i>) but the two additional criteria I propose would be of assistance. I invite the Minister of State to take them on board as they would not detract from the criteria which have been included. They would strengthen the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section covers every aspect of a town which is lucky enough to qualify under the scheme. When the scheme was debated at local authority level, I recall that the total area in qualifying towns covered by the scheme was to be between one and one and a half acres. It appears that the entire town could be covered under the section. If that is so, will plans prepared by local authorities be contrary to the section? The local authorities prepare their plans to include between one and a half to two acres in each of the qualifying towns.</P>

      <P>The guidelines make it clear that the maximum size towns will have populations of 6,000. The guidelines state that there will be no more than seven acres of new building and half of that must be residential development. That acreage will be scaled down for smaller towns with a population of fewer than 6,000. There is no specification that only one acre will qualify for tax incentives. I heard someone in Mayo say that on the radio but he was incorrect and I wrote to inform him of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a misconception. I have not received any plans yet from the advisory committee so I cannot say if Mayo confined the designation area to one and half acres. The guidelines refer to between one and three hectares, with three hectares applying to the maximum size town with a population of 6,000. The reference to an area specifically relates to anything newly built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill aims to bring about the renewal and revitalisation of old buildings so this scheme will encourage a great deal of refurbishment. Allow<Col N="1648" /> ance has been made for tax incentives for new building but that will be confined to three hectares in a town of 6,000. That is an area of approximately seven and a half acres. There was never any direction that the area for incentives be confined to one and a half acres.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall cause all advice submitted to him or her in accordance with <i>subsection (1)</i> to be published.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section is very important. It gives the Minister the right to consult and seek advice from persons with relevant expertise in town renewal. How will the Minister decide who has the necessary expertise and how is such expertise classified? It is also important that those providing this advice are not providing advice to potential developers or people with interests other than those of the Minister. For those reasons it is vital that this section be taken on board.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also ensure that all advice he is given is published. We need to avoid confusion and ensure there are no conflicts of interest. This amendment would ensure that people advising the Minister are not advising anyone else. In the past we have seen too many vested interests working and we know it was not in the public interest, as Senator Walsh would agree.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that this amendment was tabled. I mentioned yesterday that it is my intention to operate this scheme in as open and transparent a manner as possible. In keeping with the practice introduced in the 1999 urban renewal scheme, it is intended to publish the report and the advice of the expert advisory panel. Details of recommendations in relation to each plan submitted will be available and will be published on the Department's website. The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will also apply to material within the Department on the consideration of plans submitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a condition in the Bill which states that any person acting on the advisory panel must declare any interest in advance of consideration of a matter in which he or she has an interest. That declaration of interest is a statutory requirement under this Bill. I introduced that measure in the previous Bill &ndash; the first time that such a procedure was implemented in relation to the introduction of urban renewal schemes &ndash; and it is being done here again. The legislation proposing tax incentives for urban and rural areas has been introduced in the most open and trans<Col N="1649" /> parent fashion ever undertaken by any Minister introducing similar legislation. My actions contrast starkly with those of some of my predecessors.</P>
    <P>No one will be able point the finger at this legislation and say it is not open. Everything will be included on the website. The minutes of the advisory group in its consideration of each town plan were all published in the previous integrated area plans and will be published when the plans under this scheme are finalised. We hope to be in a position to announce the publication of the plans under this scheme in the next three weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's intentions but he may not be in his current position forever. In that event, it is vital that the Oireachtas copperfastens legislation that will act as guidelines for the Minister's successors. While appreciating that material will be published on the Internet and that there will be an annual report of the advisory committee, if an adviser comes into the Minister's office, the existing legislation will not ensure that every consultation with the Minister will be published.</P>
      <P>Given what has emerged at the tribunals, the more protected every situation is by legislation the better. That is why it is particularly important to include this new subsection in the Bill. I have no problem with the advisory group which is being established, but the reality is that it can be &ldquo;got to&rdquo;. The real concern, however, is about people who whisper in the Minister's ear during a back-room chat, yet there is no record of this. We must ensure that as much evidence as possible comes to light so there will be no opportunity for irregular or untoward activities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well intentioned and I have every confidence that he will do as he has stated, but it could be quite different with another Minister in charge. Where developments take place which include tax incentives, big-wigs descend like vultures and get around any obstacles that may arise. There has been ample evidence of that across the country and this new subsection is aimed at reducing such activity. The Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Senator has totally misunderstood the process involved. I do not have any consultations with anybody with regard to the plans which come into the Department and are passed on by the officials to the advisory group. That group examines them, looks at the towns and comes to conclusions on whether the plans, as submitted, comply with the guidelines and objectives of the scheme. It then makes a decision and makes recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said more than once yesterday on Second Stage, I have not received the recommendations yet and I have not seen any of these matters. When I receive the recommendations I will do exactly as was done on the previous occasion &ndash; I will bring them to Cabinet. I expect the Cabinet <Col N="1650" /> will accept the recommendations of the advisory board, as I will be recommending.</P>
    <P>I have no role in meeting people, discussing what they have submitted, or in adding to or subtracting from what they may require.

However, I am concerned about the import of some of the other suggestions made by the Senator. Given the current climate where some people in public life have transgressed the normal standards one would expect from politicians, there is a tendency to make such suggestions. It would be a travesty, however, if as a consequence we were to set up a system to remove the democratic power which rests with elected representatives, by virtue of the public's exercise of suffrage, <Col N="1651" /> and grant it to unelected bodies. I strongly support the right of politicians, at local and national level, to exercise power prudently and fairly. They should make decisions and not hand that function over to unelected people.</P>
      <P>In this instance there is an expert panel. In the last urban renewal plan a similar structure and system was in place and most people were satisfied with the process and with the subsequent publication of reports.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 39, after &ldquo;parts&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the whole&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not make sense that subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) states that &ldquo;a part or parts of the area to which the town renewal plan relates ought to be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more sections of Chapter 10 (inserted by the Finance Act, 2000)&rdquo;. It would be prudent to include &ldquo;a part or parts or the whole of the area to which the town renewal plan relates ought to be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more <Col N="1653" /> sections of Chapter 10&rdquo;. The fact it is not stated seems to be an omission by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, although I have not been here for most of its passage through the House. It affects Castlepollard which it is proposed to include.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not refer to the fact this Bill covers the entire country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Derelict areas of rural villages will be included for funding so people will be able to carry out the necessary work immediately. I know many Senators made long contributions on the Bill. The Bill seeks to ensure that work will commence almost immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope that planners will co-operate with the Minister and implement all sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to expand the area to which all incentives may apply to cover the entire area of the town renewal plan. The effect of this amendment would be to allow a blanket designation approach to be adopted in relation to the application of incentives for both residential and commercial projects. This would conflict with the targeted approach which focuses on areas most in need of renewal. This approach was followed not just in this case but also, as the Senators will recall, in the case of the current urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>The application of incentives represents a cost to the Exchequer and it is important that we ensure maximum value for money and the best possible benefit in the application of public resources to supporting town renewal objectives. The idea is to target areas of dereliction which need renewal and to get the maximum benefit rather than have blanket designations. In these circumstances, I regret it is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We might be a little confused. I appreciate that submissions have been made which outline specific areas in each town rather than entire towns. Maps have also been presented with the submissions for the areas in each town which the local authority wishes to designate. Each local authority's proposed town renewal plan complies with the criteria laid down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid this section will allow the Minister to reduce the areas within the proposed plan which conform with the criteria. I am not suggesting a blanket designation for each town but that the plan, as presented by the local authority and which complies with the criteria laid down by the Department, and the maps accompanying it, <Col N="1654" /> which provide specific areas for residential and commercial designation, be accepted. However, under this section only &ldquo;a part or parts of the area&rdquo; can be included. This amendment seeks to include the whole of the submission by the local authority. I am sure Senator Walsh, who has a strong interest in local authorities, fully understands my point. We are not talking about a blanket designation but about accepting the plan as presented for each town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister about relevant designated areas. However, the definition of a designated area could be the middle of a lane. There were many designated areas in Cork city over the years. The north side of Tobin's Lane, for example, was a designated area but the south side was not. If we designate a particular area, the whole of the area should be included, although I know that is not easy to do. Although the south side of the lane was as deprived as the north side, it was not designated. We should include areas rather than lines in towns, villages or cities. It should be the backs of areas rather than up the middle of a street. For instance, how can we designate between one side of a lane in the middle of Castlepollard or Ennis? I am not saying all areas should be designated because no work would be done then but the Minister is right. Cork has proved to be very well served by the designation of particular areas, particularly inner city areas, but the other side of the designated areas suffered. That is the problem. We should include the whole street. If one side of the middle of a lane is designated and the other is falling apart, that is most unfair. I do not see a whole town or area being included but that is where the definition of &ldquo;whole&rdquo; would work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would clarify Chapter 10 of Part X of the Act of 1997 it might crystallise thinking in this regard. My understanding is that &ldquo;part or parts&rdquo; refers to a specific type of development, perhaps residential development, and that it is open to county councils to include in their plans a variety of developments that will qualify. I think that is what it refers to but perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On previous occasions I might have seen merit in the proposal from Senators Taylor-Quinn and Cregan but in Westmeath, meetings were held with the planners and all the people in Kilbeggan, Moate and Castlepollard and the planners actually walked the little roads and the townlands with everyone concerned. As a result of the Tidy Towns competition, derelict areas, poor buildings and the shabby appearance of various public places, etc., were taken into account and agreement was reached with all the local organisations. I understand there was a difficulty in one or two other parts of the country, and I can see where Senators are coming from in that they were born in and represent one of those <Col N="1655" /> areas, but from the experience we have in Westmeath with the planner concerned, we had nothing but co-operation, consultation and communication. I agree with the wording in the Bill but I understand the difficulty that was experienced in another county in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see an instance happening as described by the previous speakers. The Minister said earlier that the maximum amount of land that can be developed in towns with a population of fewer than 6,000 is six acres. If that is the case a town with a population of only 1,500 could only develop a maximum of two acres, or one and a half acres. Is it the case that the maximum amount of land that can be developed in towns with a population of fewer than 6,000 is six acres?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seven and a half acres. That is for new build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not take into account old or derelict buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is stated clearly in the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were dilapidated areas in a sprawling town, I thought difficulties might arise if the town went beyond the maximum number of acres allowed in the guidelines. Would a degree of latitude be given if that were to happen? It may help Senator Taylor-Quinn in relation to the amendment she has put forward which refers to the whole of a town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised but as regards the amendment before us, the intent is to focus and target the incentives on specific properties that are deemed to qualify under the terms of the guidelines and the objectives of the Bill to achieve renewal and improvement. A consultant's study was carried out on the outcome of the earlier urban renewal schemes that had been designated throughout the country. One of the main conclusions in that study was that blanket designations should not be given in future town renewal schemes. Previous Ministers just ran their thumb down a street and designated the whole of that street, irrespective of the fact that a new building might have been completed on the same street a month previously. It was crude and it was done extensively like that. It was also very arbitrary. I have taken on board in the IAP and in this town renewal scheme the recommendations of the consultants. That is the reason I oppose this amendment which refers to the whole area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Senator Cregan about where the line is to be drawn on the street, pre<Col N="1656" /> vious urban renewal schemes were decided by the Minister in an arbitrary way. In the IAPs which I brought before the House and which are now in operation, and in this plan, the local authorities put forward the proposals and there must be full consultation at local level. I was delighted to hear the way it was done in Westmeath, as mentioned by Senator Cassidy, where there was the fullest of consultation, the planners walked the areas involved and they were all agreed. It is the principle of subsidiarity, to which I have always subscribed, long before it became common language in Europe and in looking for reform in local government, and this is part of that reform. These decisions can be made by the people nearest to the ground. They have the most local knowledge, they are the ones who can have the best input into it and they must be consulted. These lines were drawn locally. On this occasion they should have been drawn in consultation with local people and local elected representatives and it is the councils that decide this eventually and send it to the Department. Where they drew the line was a local matter but in the guidelines we issued we have indicated that they should go behind the buildings rather than do what was described by the Senator where there was disparity between one side of the street and another. However, if the buildings on the other side of the street were not in need of designation to achieve the objectives, there would not be any need to include them either so in some circumstances it might be a sound proposal to have the line going down the middle of a street. We have to draw the line somewhere but generally we suggest that if they are drawing a line, they should draw it at the back of buildings rather than have one set facing the other in that way.</P>
    <P>On the question of the acreage, I want to refer to the guidelines which were issued this time last year to every local authority; I think I sent them to every Member of the House as well at the time. I certainly tried to disseminate the information as widely as possible. The guidelines state that in the case of towns at the maximum population of size eligible under the scheme, the area for new build development designated should not exceed three hectares, this limit to decrease proportionately for smaller towns. They further state that at least 50% of the total new build designated area should be for residential use. That is repeating what I have already said to Senators in regard to that. I subsequently informed the local authorities, through my officials, that they were not to interpret the reducing size too strictly. As long as they did not go over the three hectares it would have been reasonable to make some relationship between that and the size of population of the town.</P>
    <P>I was asked about Chapter 10. This sets out the functions of county councils and the criteria that must be taken into account in the making of recommendations, that areas be qualifying areas for the purpose of town renewal tax reliefs pro<Col N="1657" /> vided for under Chapter 10 of Part X of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as inserted by the Finance Act, 2000, which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, included in this year's Finance Act in anticipation of the passing of this Bill. These reliefs comprise residential, industrial, commercial and new build incentives. They contain the full range of incentives allowable in certain circumstances. Therefore, I must reject the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), lines 14 to 17, to delete paragraph (<i>c</i>) and substitute the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) the market conditions in the eligible town or the area, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides that in making a recommendation referred to in subsection (1) the county council concerned shall have regard to the market conditions in the eligible town or the area.</P>
      <P>I propose the deletion from subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) of the words &ldquo;or areas of the eligible town concerned as respects the supply of, and current and anticipated demand for, the relevant types of development&rdquo;, as they indicate an anticipatory element. We are not in a position to legislate for anticipated situations, we can only legislate for what we deem to be realities. Section 2(<i>c</i>), as drafted, includes a nebulous element and I am not sure that nebulous element can be taken into account in legislation. I do not consider such words beneficial to the Bill or to any consideration under a town renewal scheme. The wording of subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) should be as I propose and subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) should refer to &ldquo;the nature and extent of any impediments to the carrying out of the relevant types of development&rdquo;. It would be wise if the Minister of State accepted the changes I propose to subsection (2)(<i>c</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section sets out the criteria that must taken into account by a local authority when making a recommendation under section 5(1). The effect of this amendment would be to delete important considerations that must be taken into account by local authorities when making recommendations, specifically on the assessment of current and anticipated demand for the types of development under consideration, including residential and commercial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the KPMG report on the previous urban renewal scheme, which was critical of the cases of dead weight and displacement that occurred with the awarding of tax incentives on a blanket scale. That report recommended that the proposed designated areas should be identified during the preparation of plans with the focus only on areas where needs would be addressed by tax incentives only. This recommendation for a coherent, targeted approach to incentivisation <Col N="1658" /> was adopted in respect of the 1999 urban renewal scheme, on which this scheme is modelled.</P>
    <P>We are not in the business of applying incentives willy-nilly. It is important for county councils to consider issues such as supply, current demand and anticipated demand for the relevant types of development to ensure that incentives are recommended only where they can be justified. Questions as to why a site is difficult to develop without incentives, whether incentives are necessary to secure a desired development, or whether a development will cause displacement elsewhere must be addressed when making recommendations to ensure that the income forgone by the Exchequer is justified. I intend to retain the section as drafted. Therefore, I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister of State's reply. There is a limit to what county councils can be expected to judge regarding their areas and the reference to anticipated demand in subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) is airy fairy. It is difficult to anticipate what the demand will be. In some instances, the actual demand under previous schemes, whether the urban renewal scheme or the seaside resort scheme, was way beyond the wildest expectations of local authorities.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I said that local authorities might be in a position to anticipate demand in a more prudent way if, for example, the Government was able to introduce a town renewal scheme having regard to its decentralisation policy. It could incorporate in this formula consideration of public service personnel who would be decentralised to certain towns and indicate to the local authorities concerned that such decentralisation of personnel would occur. Decentralisation would constitute more than an anticipated demand, it would be something concrete and definite. The reference to anticipated demand is vague and I hope the Minister of State takes my point into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that most local authorities have only just finalised or nearly finalised their county development plans, it is timely, as Senator Taylor-Quinn said, that this legislation is being considered. The one-stop-shop concept will be included in the action plans, such as one commenced in the north Westmeath local authority area last Friday and the one-stop-shop concept being incorporated into action plans in the local authority areas of Clare, Meath, Donegal and other countries. The provisions of this legislation, including the reference to anticipated demand, can be included in such action plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is possibly the best legislation that has been introduced for rural areas as it will impact on every village in that it will allow people, who have done well in business in large towns and cities as a result of the Celtic tiger, to avail of tax incentives to reinvest in their home areas. As the <Col N="1659" /> poet, Patrick Farrell said, where is the one who does not love the land where he was born? I commend the Minister of State on introducing this initiative that will benefit rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure this amendment is necessary. One could make the point that in making recommendations the county council concerned shall have regard to the market conditions in the eligible town or areas of it and one could take it as read as to the market conditions referred to. However, the words proposed to be deleted qualify precisely what is meant by the market conditions. While there is a demand throughout the country for residential development, if for example there was a demand for industrial or commercial development in a town or village, consideration would have to be given to the demand in the area concerned for the specified type of development included in an action plan.</P>
      <P>It is common sense to qualify what market conditions are referred to, although I appreciate one could argue that is not necessary. A corollary to that is Senator Quinn's earlier argument about extending, for the purpose of clarification, other areas of the Bill to ensure there is no doubt as to what is intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much more I can add. It would be extraordinary if I accepted an amendment that proposed to remove from the Bill a requirement that an assessment of current and anticipated demand for the different types of development under consideration should be taken into account in arriving at a decision on whether to include an area for tax designation. Acceptance of the amendment would leave that provision hanging in the air, so to speak, without further elaboration of what was meant by market conditions.</P>
      <P>The Senator queried the ability of a local authority to arrive at an educated opinion on the levels of demand for certain facilities in its area. These matters are being decided at council level and the local community are consulted on them. Local authority members have a right to be consulted and to make an input and they also have a right to obtain additional professional advice or information from people who are qualified in that area to help them make the best decision possible. I do not think it would be wise to exclude that. To do so would be a retrograde step, especially in view of the comments made in the KPMG report in regard to what happened where this was done without due consideration being given to these matters. Rate remissions which were being granted are not available now because of the European intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my town, under the earlier urban renewal designations, the existing shopkeepers in areas not included for designation felt sorely aggrieved that spanking new buildings, new shopping <Col N="1660" /> arcades and new commercial enterprises which were in direct competition with the older buildings were given capital allowances, rates relief, double rent allowances and beneficial tax incentives. This proposal is to ensure that due consideration is given to all these factors at local level before a final decision is made to include or exclude a particular building.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has made strong points on the type of developments created under previous urban renewal schemes in designated areas in particular towns and cities. I agree with him. Those who were already in business suffered the consequences because others got the benefits in designated areas. Those designated areas were agreed by particular individuals and the Government of the day. The Minister of State made the point that about 50% of all new designated areas, that is greenfield sites, will have to be residential. Does it have to be just 50% or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least 50%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very important. Again the Minister of State has indicated the thinking in Europe. In my city there is about 3 million square feet of accommodation over shops that is not being used. Residential accommodation is being sought urgently. In many European cities people live over their businesses; curtains are open and lights are on even when the shops are closed. That does not happen here, although it is being promoted. Are there any designated tax incentives that can be given? The fact is that in cities and big towns people are moving out because there are no benefits for developing over their commercial premises. What consideration is being given to providing such incentives? Is it relevant to another Bill or can they get the tax benefits if they restructure over their shops?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be aware there was an over the shop tax incentive scheme previously and it was deemed not to have been a great success. As the take-up was not great, there were no further extensions of the scheme. We visited that again at the behest of Dublin Corporation and have looked at it again. Much study has gone into it. It was deemed that by pitching the scheme in a certain way it would be possible to overcome some of the obstacles property owners saw to availing of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by the Senator that there is a critical need for additional residential accommodation. There is a great deal of empty space over shops in the larger cities which could be converted into residential accommodation <Col N="1661" /> with the right conditions and circumstances. Under the previous scheme there were fire regulation and access problems. Having looked at all those issues the Government announced its intention to re-introduce a living over the shop tax incentive scheme when it launched its Action on Housing two weeks ago. Action on Housing, under urban renewal incentives and other measures taken, states, &ldquo;A new living over the shop scheme which is aimed at tackling the problem of vacant upper storey space in major urban areas will be introduced. The scheme which is tax-incentive based has the potential to release a significant number of residential units in high demand areas particularly in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While the legislation has not been worked out, it is proposed that the scheme will be made available in the larger cities in the county boroughs where there would be extensive availability and a greater possibility in some streets of designations being made. Local authorities will make recommendations on the streets to be designated and where they consider the best results can be achieved. The Government has made its decision and will bring forward the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's decision. He has answered all my questions and understands my point. While the scheme has been announced is it properly promoted? There is no reason 3 million square feet of over the shop space is not used from 5 p.m. onwards and that car spaces are vacant in high rise car parks. The residents in such accommodation should be able to use the vacant car spaces and the incentives should be provided for them in public and private car parks. There is no reason they cannot park there from 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. onwards and be resident in the city. However, there is no incentive to do it. As a member of Cork City Council for the past 21 years I have not seen an incentive to do it. The planners have for many years voiced their particular ideas.</P>
      <P>The amount of space over shops which is not being used has increased in the past five years to 3 million square feet in Cork city alone. One can imagine what is available in Dublin. With no disrespect, apartments of 450 or 500 square feet are built and sold for £150,000 in the centre of this city. All the idle space could be renovated and restructured if the necessary regulations were put in place and if planners, management and the Government came together to ensure every possible benefit is provided to ensure places such as O'Connell Street and many other streets in Dublin are properly utilised. There should be lights over premises but that is not the case. It reflects badly on us in comparison with other European cities. If one walks around Brussels or Paris at night one will see that people live over the shops. It even happens in London.</P>

      <P>I support everything Senator Cregan has said. What he has said impinges on the Bill to a certain extent. It applies not only to Cork and Dublin cities but to other rural towns where there is an under utilisation of vacant space. At a time when accommodation is being sought the whole thrust is towards new buildings.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State in looking at the criteria for this scheme and in accepting the advice of his advisers not to allow a repeat of what happened under the previous scheme. One street in New Ross, Mary's Street, got owner occupier status for refurbishment. Anybody who looks at the street can see that that cannot be achieved. They are large houses. The same applies to the over the shop concept. It has to be looked at from the point of view of section 23 and allowing people to refurbish the properties for rent. There is nothing wrong&mdash;</P>

There is nothing wrong with good quality, private rented accommodation being provided in those areas when it is the only means of bringing such property into the overall accommodation programme. Senator Cregan's comments should be examined in the Department and, in so far as they relate to this Bill, should be implemented. However, there should probably be another Bill to provide for the release of all that vacant space to bring it into the accommodation sector.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall, having satisfied himself or herself that the plan and the recommendations are in conformity with the criteria referred to in <i>section 3(3)</i> and <i>3(4)</i> and the guidelines referred to in <i>section 3(5),</i> shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward amendment to section 6. Amendment No. 7 seeks to insert, after &ldquo;1997&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;and the Minister for Finance shall make the order.&rdquo;  The amendments elaborate on the section and give it more clarity and definition. Although the section already refers to &ldquo;a town renewal plan submitted to him or her under section 3&rdquo;, the amendments will further strengthen the provision.</P>

      <P>These amendments would have the effect of removing the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government <Col N="1663" /> and the Minister for Finance in regard to recommending qualifying areas and the consequent making of orders.</P>
      <P>The aim of the Bill is to facilitate the development of smaller towns. There is already a precedent in the urban renewal scheme whereby the recommendations made by local authorities, as modified by the expert advisory panel on urban renewal, were accepted and adopted without any changes being made by the Ministers. It is proposed to follow this independent and objective approach to the application of incentives in this scheme.</P>
      <P>The making of recommendations by the Ministers is one step in a process which starts with the selection by local authorities of suitable towns which would benefit under the scheme. It was never the intention to waste the time or resources of local authorities in preparing plans which would not be considered in full. If the plans submitted meet the criteria set out in the guidelines, it is envisaged that the towns will benefit from the incentives, subject to the recommendations of the expert panel. The Ministers are accountable to the Oireachtas and it would be prudent to retain this discretion.</P>
      <P>In addition, amendment No. 7 attempts to limit the powers of the Minister for Finance by imposing a mandatory requirement to apply incentives as recommended by county councils. Legal powers in relation to the application of tax incentives are entrusted to the Minister for Finance. The proposal is not legally, and probably not constitutionally, sound.</P>

      <P>Although Senator Cassidy said that the county development plan for his area has been finalised, a number of county development plans are not yet in place. There are various reasons for that, such as planners being under pressure, shortage of planners and so forth. The problem is that certain areas in towns might be omitted. Can they be included at a later stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen instances in the past where areas have been forgotten or not included in a designation, even though people were of the opinion that they should have been included. Under this section, will it be possible to include a property or a section of land, which was not included in the plan finalised by the local authority and forwarded to the Minister, at some stage in the future before the term of the scheme concludes? The area might have been omitted due to the county development plan not being finalised. Can provision be made in another section of the Bill <Col N="1664" /> to include areas that were omitted in the original plan?</P>

      <P>I hope consideration will be given at some stage to villages with populations of less than 500. In the selection process in Wexford there was great difficulty leaving out villages such as Campile and Duncannon, which were ripe for this type of renewal programme but did not meet the qualifying criteria. I hope the population criterion will be looked at again in the future.</P>

      <P>The scheme was announced, the guidelines were issued and an invitation was extended to local authorities to submit their plans. The plans were decided locally and then submitted to the Department. Once we have accepted the recommendations of the advisory committee and published the plans, it is not intended that there will be any appeals. That is it. The designations on the areas set out in the plans will be in operation for a period of three years.</P>
      <P>I said yesterday that we will examine progress in the implementation of the town renewal plans. There is a monitoring responsibility on local authorities and they must report to the Minister at the end of each year. We will watch progress in the scheme. We are looking on it as a first phase and the intention at present is that there will be a second phase. However, no decision has been made with regard to when it might happen. Obviously, once we see how the scheme is operating we will be inclined to move to the next phase and issue a second invitation to councils.</P>
      <P>It is most unlikely that a local authority, when asked to bring forward a second group of proposals, will give a further extension of the incentives to a town which was included in the first phase. The towns which were not included in the first phase should be entitled to be included in the second phase. If that did not happen, there would be great difficulty on the ground. From a practical point of view, that would be the fairest option. No decision has yet been made with regard to a second phase but there is an expectation.</P>

That is saying that it is not relevant to the town renewal plan unless the council is involved. I have been involved in council work for many years. I do not claim that everything the council does is right or that it is ahead of everybody else.

Will the Minister of State include a proposal where, if the Department so wishes, a building can be restructured? He should not tie the hands of the Department, particularly at this time when there is a shortage of planners in all county and urban councils. There are huge delays in some urban and county councils in relation to planning and people should not be penalised if a development plan is not in order.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Cregan's remarks. Our county development plan has not yet been put forward, never mind finalised. We are depending on a county development plan which is five or six years old. This legislation will be in existence for three years when I presume most councils will draw up a new county development plan. The proposals put forward under the town renewal plan are based on old county development plans, which may not be in conformity with each other. Will the Minister of State clarify if there can be a change in building or zoning in a town within that three year period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 deals with certification. This means that the tax incentives available will not be extended to the individual who is entitled to benefit without the local authority certifying that the buildings have been built in a way that complies with the terms of the town renewal plan. The Deputies are looking at the reference to <Col N="1666" />&ldquo;town renewal plan&rdquo; while talking about the county development plan. Any development undertaken with a view to benefiting from the tax incentives under the town renewal plan must comply with the terms of the county development plan as provided for under the Planning and Development Acts. I made it clear earlier that there would be no change in the areas designated once the plan is published. Perhaps other towns will get an opportunity in the second phase. This section deals only with certification and obviously the public purse must be protected and requirements must be completed and authenticated. The local authority is the authenticating authority. No tax incentives will be extended by Revenue to an individual unless he or she first produces a certificate.</P>

I am a member of a local authority which has six or seven towns included in the <Col N="1667" /> plan. This will put enormous strain on the staffing levels in that local authority as the planning section and architect's office are currently stretched to the limit. Will the ratepayers of other towns have to pay for the extra staff employed to monitor the progress of the plan in these towns and report back to the Department? Extra staff and financial resources should be made available to local authorities which have a number of towns included in the scheme. This will put enormous strain on the resources of County Mayo.</P>

      <P>As announced in the statement on housing, the Department will promote more widespread use of United Kingdom and European Union consultants for forward planning, emphasising expertise in high density design. It is intended to appoint additional staff on a consultancy basis to facilitate a quicker turn-around in planning applications by local authorities and An Bord Pleanála. It is hoped these measures will result in a major increase in the capacity of planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála. Local authority managers and members know that the appointment of additional staff has been sanctioned by the Department and the difficulty of finding staff is recognised. There has been some movement of local authority staff to An Bord Pleanála, and from both to the private sector where remuneration is greater.</P>
      <P>The level of house building in the United Kingdom and in other EU member states is not as high as in Ireland and it is hoped that consultancy firms throughout Europe will be interested in working in Ireland to help us achieve the ambitious targets in the national development plan. Resources will be made available to local authorities. The Department will take measures to achieve the appointment of additional staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke has raised the question of staffing. While I welcome the Minister's response to this question I am also concerned by it. The use of private sector consultants raises the danger of conflict of interest and is not satisfactory. During the Second Stage debate I requested the Minister of State to examine the staffing of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála and consider the remuneration of staff. It is important that those working in public plannning offices comply with the requirements of the public service. Consultants who also work for clients in the private sector may have a conflict of interest. Private consultants will cost much more than local authority staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Walsh has mentioned the submissions made to the Department by local authorities. Local authorities did considerable work in preparing their plans and members made difficult political decisions in choosing the towns for sub<Col N="1668" /> mission. I hope the Minister of State will include all the towns submitted in his designation. The public spending involved will be minimal and, while the designation of towns will not have a great impact on the national economy, the benefit to local economies will be enormous. This hope is shared by Members on both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that increased staffing is needed in planning offices but that is a separate issue. The implementation of this legislation will not significantly alter the work load of planners. I agree that it is important to ensure no conflict of interest arises when private consultants are used. The entire planning process must be examined and greater management efficiency is called for.</P>
      <P>Many managers were late in responding with measures to meet the growth in demand for housing. There is a tendency within the public service to see increased staffing levels as the solution to all problems. This solution is often dwelt upon when others could be availed of.</P>
      <P>Many applications to local authorities require a simple common sense decision. Are engineers and people with high level planning qualifications the most suitable people to make these decisions? Many people with administrative experience and common sense at more junior levels within local authorities could deal with planning decisions of a particular nature. The Department should encourage practical solutions such as this to local authority problems.</P>

The scheme is aimed at individual owners as well as developers and investors, and it is important that individuals know the opportunities the scheme presents and are encouraged to avail of them. It will take two or three years to see the results of building development. Previous urban renewal schemes were not widely availed of until the third year of the schemes and then there were calls for extensions to them. If local authorities were more diligent in communicating the message individual owners would make investment decisions and arrange finance sooner. I hope this will happen and we see the level of renewal which we all hope for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Firearms (Firearm Certificates for Non-Residents) Bill, 2000 will replace the temporary legislation in this area, the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, which came into effect on 14 July 1998 and will cease to operate on 14 July 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the amendment of the provisions governing the granting, under section 3 of the Firearms Act, 1925, of firearm certificates to persons ordinarily resident outside the State, whether for hunting or sporting purposes or for shooting species where such shooting is not pro<Col N="1670" /> hibited by law, for example, vermin, or for other purposes. It also amends the Wildlife Act, 1976, primarily in regard to the granting of hunting licences to persons ordinarily resident outside the State.</P>
    <P>Under section 3(2) of the Firearms Act, 1925, the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under section 29(2) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, a non-resident who wishes to hunt protected or exempted wild animals or protected wild birds in Ireland must have a separate licence to hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. There are two types of hunting licences: a licence to hunt exempted wild mammals other than hares &ndash; in practical terms this means deer &ndash; and a licence to hunt protected wild birds and hares.</P>
    <P>A firearm certificate will not be issued to a non-resident applicant who intends to hunt unless he or she has been granted a licence to hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, whether it authorises the hunting of deer or protected wild birds and hares.</P>
    <P>The situation in the case of residents of the State differs in that, under section 3(1) of the Firearms Act, 1925, the granting of firearm certificates to residents is a matter for the local Garda superintendent in the area in which the applicant is residing. As in the case of non-residents, a resident who wishes to hunt protected wild mammals other than hares must satisfy the Garda Síochána that he or she is the holder of a current licence to so hunt from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands before he or she can get a firearm certificate. However, under section 29(5) of the Wildlife Act, 1976, a superintendent can grant a combined firearm certificate and hunting licence to a resident who wishes to hunt hares or protected wild birds.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925 to allow the Garda authorities, after an initial transitional period during which the Minister will continue to be responsible, to grant firearm certificates to non-residents for hunting or sporting purposes and to process those applications in a similar way to the arrangements which apply in the case of residents of the State. For the first time, a combined firearm certificate and hunting licence will be available to non-residents for the purpose of hunting hares or protected wild birds. A separate hunting licence from the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will still be required in the case of non-residents who wish to hunt deer, as is the case for residents of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the Wildlife Act, 1976, by the insertion of a new section 29, provided for in section 4 of this Bill, to allow this new scheme for non-residents to operate. The new scheme, when fully operational after the initial transitional period to which I have just referred, will establish a level playing field in the matter of the granting of hunting licences to residents and non-residents <Col N="1671" /> alike, with some minor modifications to reflect the different situation of non-residents. For instance, many non-resident hunters come here only for short periods and may not return for several years, if ever, unlike residents who are entitled to hunt here for whole seasons and possess their firearms throughout the years. Non-residents, like residents, will have to be 16 years of age or over to get a firearm certificate, will be able to use the firearm only for the purposes specified and can have their certificates revoked for, among other reasons, failure to comply with the limitations as to use, and will have to comply with the obligations under the Wildlife Acts to get a hunting licence.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware from the debate on the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, the background to the Bill is that the High Court decided on 12 June 1998, following a judicial review sought by the National Association of Regional Game Councils which represents domestic shooters, that the procedures adopted to enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform adequately to discharge the obligations imposed by the Firearms Act, 1925, in granting firearm certificates to non-resident hunters were ineffective and insufficient. The High Court found that the procedures followed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in granting hunting licences to non-residents, which they must first obtain in order to be granted firearm certificates, were also ineffective and insufficient. The effect of this judgment was that both Ministers were precluded from granting hunting licences, and the consequential firearm certificates, to non-residents and the granting of licences and firearm certificates ceased with effect from the date of the judgment.</P>
    <P>As time did not permit an extensive overhaul of the Firearms Act, 1925, having regard to the fact that the Dáil was due to go into recess on 2 July 1998, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided that a two stage response was essential to deal with the matters raised by the High Court judgment. First, he decided that the public interest required that interim legislation be introduced as quickly as possible to enable hunting licences and firearm certificates to be granted and to protect the State against potential liabilities. The interim legislation, the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1998, came into effect on 14 July 1998.</P>
    <P>Second, the Minister decided to establish a review group comprising representatives of the relevant Departments, the Garda Síochána and interest groups to examine the implications of the judgment generally for the granting of firearms certificates to non-residents. The group was charged with bringing forward proposals in this sensitive but complicated area following a full review and having taken account of the views of the major sectional interests involved. The group <Col N="1672" /> reported in November 1998 and its report formed the basis for the preparation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the Firearms Legislation Review Group was that the firearms Acts should be amended to provide for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents by Garda authorities who, as I have explained, grant firearm certificates to residents. The group recommended that for the first two years the legislation was in force there should be a parallel right to apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Thereafter, such firearm certificates would not be granted by the Minister &ldquo;except where circumstances warranted it&rdquo;. The review group's report admitted that its recommendation was less than ideal but that it would ensure tourism interests were not damaged.</P>
    <P>The group also recommended that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should include a provision in the Wildlife Bill &ldquo;whereby firearm certificates will be deemed to be hunting licences also&rdquo;. In addition, the review group recommended that the certificates be granted for a period of one year and that the combined hunting licence and firearm certificate should specify the lands available to the tourist for shooting purposes.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Justice, Equality and law Reform accepted the main recommendation of the review group that the firearms Acts should be amended to provided for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents by the Garda superintendent in charge of the district visited, he was concerned that the recommendation for two parallel routes for applicants, the Minister and the Garda Síochána, could give rise to administrative difficulties and confusion and therefore prove to be impracticable. He was also concerned about the essentially open ended aspect of the recommendation whereby, even after the two year transitional period, applications might still be made to the Minister in certain unidentified circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes, therefore, a slightly different and more clearcut arrangement under which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will continue, on a transitional basis, to grant certificates to non-resident shooters for a further two years, after which period the granting of firearm certificates in such cases will be a matter for the Garda Síochána. However, this is qualified by a provision under which any time after the commencement of the legislation in July, the Minister may by order relinquish that function to the Garda. He would do this if he was satisfied that the Garda was organisationally ready within two years to assume full responsibility for granting firearm certificates for hunting and sporting purposes to foreign shooters.</P>
    <P>An amendment of the Wildlife Act, 1976, will allow firearm certificates granted to non-residents for the purpose, <i>inter alia,</i> of hunting hares or protected wild birds to be deemed to be hunting licences for the purpose of the Wildlife Acts, that <Col N="1673" /> is, it will provide for a combined firearm certificate or hunting licence to issue in these cases as already applies in the case of residents of the State, as soon as the Garda assumes responsibility for the granting of firearm certificates to non-resident shooters.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, the Firearms Legislation Review Group recommended that the certificates be granted for a period of one year and that the combined hunting licence and firearm certificate should specify the lands available to the tourists for shooting purposes. Certificates issued to residents of the State have a life of one year. Tourists exercise Community law rights to travel and avail of services and Article 6 of the Treaty of Rome precludes any discrimination against tourists exercising these rights unless they are capable of objective justification. Section 2(6) provides for a certificate life of up to one year, thus complying with the recommendation of the review group and EU law.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides in section 2(6) that a firearm certificate will operate from the date of its commencement until the following 31 July, which is the date on which hunting licences expire or for such shorter period as may be specified in the certificate. Section 2(6) also allows applications to be made before 31 July in respect of certificates required after 1 August. These arrangements mirror the provisions in relation to residents in the Firearms Act, 1925. The majority of applications for firearm certificates from non-residents are for the purpose of hunting hares or protected wild birds. The convergence in the expiry dates of the authorisations will make the issue of combined firearm certificates and hunting licences for the purpose of hunting hares or protected wild birds easier from an administrative point of view.</P>
    <P>As regards the Firearms Legislation Review Group recommendation that the combined hunting licence and firearm certificate should specify the lands available to the tourists for shooting purposes, this recommendation could not be accepted as it would have introduced a separate regime in that respect for residents and non-residents, thus possibly breaching European anti-discrimination laws. This is because all residents of EU member states must be treated equally.</P>
    <P>Regarding the other main provisions of the Bill, it is important to emphasise that, in practical terms, the provisions of the Bill do not change the procedures which have been followed for some years, under different Governments, in granting firearm certificates to non-residents. While the Bill proposes to amend the statutory provisions governing the limitations and restrictions for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, in real terms it gives effect to the existing procedures in recognition of the fact that the statutory obligations were, prior to the 1998 Temporary Provisions Act, in practice, difficult to meet and, in some instances, impossible. In the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, <Col N="1674" /> regard has always been had to the preservation of the public safety and the peace. This was always the overriding consideration.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in this Bill will in no way change this. In fact, two additional restrictive measures are introduced. These are in section 2(10) which allows the issuing person to attach conditions to a firearm certificate and also in section 2(13), where provision is made to allow the issuing person to revoke a firearm certificate where he or she is of the opinion that the holder of the certificate cannot, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his or her possession or that he or she is using, or has used, such firearm for purposes not authorised by the certificate or has contravened a condition attaching to the firearm certificate. These are new permanent provisions. Up to now there has been no provision in permanent legislation permitting the attachment of conditions to, or for the revocation of, a firearm certificate granted to a non-resident.</P>
    <P>I also want to emphasise that the policy, which in the main has been in existence since 1972, of restricting the granting of firearm certificates to certain categories of firearms, is not changed by this Bill. That policy, which is among the most restrictive in Europe, provides that firearm certificates will only be granted for shotguns and rifles in certain limited categories. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently reviewing certain aspects of this policy but that is not a matter covered by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from what might be described as new restrictions, the Bill provides in section 2(8) that, before granting a firearm certificate, the issuing person, whether it be the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the transitional period, or the Garda authorities thereafter, shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate. For the purpose of establishing that there is no good reason for refusing a firearm certificate, the issuing person may seek evidence of a European firearms pass where the applicant is resident in an EU member state, or any other documents relevant to firearms issued by an appropriate body outside the State, or the issuing person may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate. Such inquiries could be made to the Garda Síochána in the transitional period, or to other police forces, if it is considered necessary to do that to determine suitability in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The European firearms pass is a document which is issued by the authorities of a member state of the EU to a person lawfully entering into possession of and using a firearm. The pass contains information about the holder's identity and is a non-transferrable document on which are entered details of the firearm or firearms possessed and used by the holder of the pass. The pass is required to be always in the possession of the person using the firearm and changes in the <Col N="1675" /> possession, or characteristics, of the firearms must be indicated on the pass, as well as the loss or theft of a firearm.</P>
    <P>In the interests of further improving public safety, section 3 of the Bill makes it an offence to give false information when making an application for a firearm certificate or to alter a certificate with intent to deceive or to use a certificate with intent to deceive. Those offences are punishable by a fine of up to £10,000 or imprisonment for up to five years or both. Any other problems with firearm misuse by a non-resident can effectively be dealt with by the enforcement of existing firearm legislation in the same way as it applies to residents of the State. This new provision along with other provisions will ensure that the scheme being put in place will be among the most stringent and restrictive in Europe.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Bill maintains our traditionally strict controls over the use and possession of firearms by non-residents while safeguarding the jobs and incomes of those engaged in our tourism industry and rural economy generally. The Bill does not lessen the measures taken to safeguard the public safety and the peace. All checks previously undertaken will continue in force. In addition, two additional permanent safeguards have been introduced, the power to add conditions to certificates and the power to revoke them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I hope that the proposals contained in this significant and somewhat technical Bill will meet with the approval of all Senators. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is welcome. I welcome the Bill which is a very important one because of the regulations and, of course, the passing down of Mr. Justice Quirke's comments in the High Court. Speaking on the Bill, one would have to say that the vast majority of people in Ireland, perhaps 92% to 95% of people, have never seen a gun. We need to try to keep it that way. The Bill is emphasising that very strongly but as shown by the introduction of the first regulations on gun licences since 1925, the original Act or the regulations were not being implemented properly. A judge could see that and carelessness was found with respect to the possession of lethal weapons. I can understand the Minister's point. I can also understand his point regarding the importance of making sure that our second biggest industry, tourism, is well covered, that people can come here and, if they want to, use guns at a particular date or time. I do not hunt but at the same time it is understandable that this business should be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that we are assured of the suitability of any person, particularly a non-resident, who is given a licence to use a shotgun or rifle. That must be emphasised strongly. The judge was correct when he said that this was not followed up properly. When we consider the <Col N="1676" /> number of accidents involving guns which occur today, we must be careful about who gets a licence, not just non-residents but also residents.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people in Ireland do not want to see a gun and nobody wants them in use. I would much prefer if they were not used, even to hunt wildlife, but business is business and I do not deny that. Hunting is extremely popular at certain times of the year and many people travel here to hunt. I do not believe we are strict enough when it comes to implementing these provisions and there are some sections in the legislation on which I will comment.</P>
    <P>As was stated in the Lower House, the legislation was not brought forward quickly enough. The principal change following the recommendations of the Firearms Legislation Review Group is that there be one licence and one Department, in other words, people will no longer have to apply to two Departments. One wonders whether those centrally involved in the administration of a sport are the most suitable to consider what is best for it. This is a dangerous sport if it is not regulated properly. Did the review group bring forward recommendations to suit itself? That is a danger and the Minister of State will not deny it. I can understand why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not agree with all the review group's recommendations but at the same time most of its recommendations have been accepted.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that it would be better if two Departments oversaw the granting of licences rather than one? Up to now a non-resident went to a Garda station to apply for a licence but did the local garda or superintendent know him or her? They held firearm certificates from other countries but it is not necessarily the case that legislation or regulations in such countries are as strict as in Ireland. One wonders whether similar regulations apply in the US when one considers the number of people who are shot there daily. When it comes to granting firearm certificates, Ireland is strict and I hope we become more strict. We must protect our own and everybody who enters the country. We must ensure that applicants for firearm certificates are genuine. I am concerned about European and other international regulations. Gun licensing in the US differs from state to state. I want American hunters to visit Ireland but I want to make sure that we are well covered.</P>
    <P>How can a local sergeant, inspector or superintendent define whether a non-resident is a suitable person to be granted a licence? For example, when a licence is granted, from where does the gun come? Is it bought locally or is it brought into the country? Is the gun brought to the place where the licence is issued? That is relevant under the legislation and I will raise that question on Committee Stage. We must ensure that residents are protected. The Garda is strict when it comes to enforcing gun controls and residents. Members of the force regularly visit licence hold<Col N="1677" /> ers in rural areas to make sure everything is in order but that still does not protect everybody. A few weeks ago we saw what can happen.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the Bill, although I have a number of questions. Are we happy that the legislation is strict enough? For example, on Second Stage in the Dáil the Minister stated that &ldquo;. . . for the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, in real terms it gives effect to the existing procedures in recognition of the fact that the statutory obligations were, prior to the 1998 Temporary Provisions Act, in practice, difficult to meet and, in some instances, impossible&rdquo;. Are we saying this Bill is better? It does not show it. It brings about a change from two Ministers to one.</P>
    <P>It was impossible up to 1998 to implement the 1925 and 1976 regulations. Are we saying this legislation is so strict that there is no danger now? Up to now firearms posed little danger. There have been freak accidents where people have jumped over a ditch carrying a loaded gun. There is no doubt there will be accidents. This was always the overriding consideration and the measures proposed in the Bill will in no way change this. Two additional restrictive measures have been introduced in section 2(10), which we will examine on Committee Stage. Are we satisfied that the vast majority of people are protected under this new legislation which is long overdue?</P>
    <P>The judge's comments in the High Court case were frightening &ndash; there was no such thing as an investigation into the suitability of the person applying in the case of non-residents. I do not blame the judge. He specifically stated that nobody, either national or non-resident, should be permitted to have in his or her possession, use or carry a firearm or ammunition without an inquiry or investigation into the suitability of that person. How can we investigate the suitability of a person &ndash; a non-national &ndash; coming into the country for the first time? Are they suitable because they have a firearm certificate from Italy, the US, Bulgaria or Great Britain? The Bill does not provide for such investigation. The judge is perfectly right. The specifics of investigating the suitability of non-nationals must be outlined. How many seek licences annually and for what duration?</P>
    <P>Are we saying the manpower is available to monitor the expiration of licences annually and inquire whether a gun has not been used since 31 March when the hunting season closes? How do we know whether a gun has been used? Is the licence holder allotted a specific amount of ammunition? The vast majority of people do not know anything about these issues. That is why the judge made these points. Is the legislation strong enough to address the judge's comments in the High Court? He pointed out that such carelessness in respect of the possession of lethal weapons was reckless and irresponsible. He is telling us that we were not on top of our job and he is right. Is the legislation strong enough? How can we assume that a person with a firearm licence <Col N="1678" /> has the right to hold that licence in the Republic, whether it is for one or 12 months? How can we know that the gun has not been used elsewhere? Is the gun handed over when the person is not in the State? Is that covered by the legislation?</P>
    <P>Residents of the State are investigated thoroughly. I have heard of the police calling at people's houses to check that guns are in the proper place and ammunition is stored safely. That is the right thing to do because we have seen the harm guns can cause. The barrels of shotguns can be sawed off to make them even more dangerous. Who looks after the gun when the person is not a resident of the State? Where is it kept? That is what the judge will want to know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I was here two years ago when emergency legislation was introduced as a result of the High Court case taken by the game councils. Legislation was necessary because otherwise tourists would have been prohibited from shooting. Many licensed operators are currently taking bookings for the winter season. It is important that measures are in place to protect this valuable sector of the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is introducing regulations. Non-residents will now be treated in the same manner as residents of the State. The Garda will be able to issue a combined firearm certificate and hunting licence.</P>
      <P>The regulations controlling licences in this State are already strict but I am glad to see power being handed to the Garda. Even residents cannot get a licence unless they are gun club members or own lands over which there are shooting rights. In addition, the Garda will not issue licences unless the proper insurance is in place and produced at the Garda station.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see these new regulations being introduced. I know a man from Brussels who visits Ireland four or five times a season. Previously he had to make an application for a new permit each time he arrived but, under these new regulations, he will get one permit to cover the entire year in the same way as a resident.</P>
      <P>The legislation is important for those who shoot competitively for Ireland because it addresses the movement of arms within the European Union. Ireland is the home of top class gun clubs and we have some of the best shooters in the world competing in the Olympic Games and the European and World Championships. I was delighted to see two people from County Kerry coming second in the world in that sport. Castleisland has one of the finest gun clubs in Europe.</P>
      <P>I am a firearms enthusiast, as are my friends and family. Senator Denis Cregan said that there not many people interested in shooting. At the last count, there were 200,000 licensed firearms holders in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not frightening &ndash; this is a sport. There are many young people involved and we are enticing more people to join all the time. Our young shooters are the best in the world. The Olympic Games in Sydney will allow us to improve our reputation.</P>
      <P>Many people have accused gun clubs of allowing people who come to Ireland to shoot protected species. Nothing could be further from the truth. One person was caught once leaving Dublin Airport with a swan in his bag, but that was a long time ago. When tourists go out with a gun club, they go with a local person who will tell them what birds they can shoot. They supervise the person hunting.</P>
      <P>The gun clubs should be commended for restocking the duck, pheasant, grouse and partridge populations, and more work should be done in that regard. The Bill deals with the issuing of a separate licence for shooting deer. Deer are becoming very plentiful and farmers complain about them destroying their crops. A balance must be struck and the gun clubs play an active role in that. In County Kerry there is an abundance of deer. At times they escape from the wildlife park in Killarney and move into the neighbouring farms where they do a lot of damage. Their numbers must be thinned out.</P>
      <P>The safety of guns was mentioned. In future gun owners will have to have a safe with special locks for their guns installed in their homes so that young people and non-licence holders will not be able to get at them. That is a good approach. Any person applying for a new licence will have to install such a safe. Many firearms owners already have them installed.</P>
      <P>A person entering the State with a firearm can leave it with a registered firearms dealer and pick it up again when he returns with his licence.</P>
      <P>Under this new legislation, to apply for a licence from the Garda an EU passport must be shown. This provision was introduced some years ago for those in shooting competitions who travelled to Europe to compete. Their passport confirmed the identity of their firearms. People applying for permission to hunt will have to produce their passport and a firearms licence.</P>
      <P>This legislation gives more power to the Garda. It is welcome and warranted and deserves the support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which addresses matters in order to enable us to benefit to the maximum amount from our tourism industry. The provisions of the Bill relating to tourists who seek a firearms licence are not clear to me. Is there a maximum number of guns that will be covered by such a licence? Does it refer to one or two firearms per person? To be fair to visitors, people who travel here to partake in clay pigeon <Col N="1680" /> or game shooting require different weapons. Consequently, we should be flexible in that regard.</P>
      <P>Under the new security arrangements the Garda Commissioner is proposing for the safety of such guns that bed and breakfast establishments and hotels should have facilities available to ensure the guns will be in safe-keeping on such premises. Ordinary game licence holders are being given 12 months in order to provide secure safes, but the Minister should extend that period by a further 12 months. As Senator Dan Kiely said, there are approximately 200,000 licensed guns and a substantial number of people will not have secure safes in their homes. I agree with the proposal which is necessary, but more time should be given to enable people to comply with it. Otherwise, people will panic if they have to provide the secure facilities within only 12 months.</P>
      <P>As regards the involvement of Dúchas and the Garda Commissioner, does Waterways Ireland have control of certain areas and, thus, an involvement similar to that of Dúchas?</P>
      <P>We must examine the aspects of this issue relating to the control of wildlife. As other Senators have mentioned, deer have caused damage to crops but they can also endanger the lives of motorists travelling through or close to forests. Many complaints have arisen in this regard, but no one appears to be responsible for such herds of deer. Neither the landowners nor the forestry authorities claim any responsibility for them, yet the animals can cause a huge amount of damage to cars. It is only a matter of time before lives will be lost as a result of this.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will enable more visitors to enjoy our tourism facilities and, in particular, clay pigeon shooting. Many private operators have developed such facilities around the country for visitors from England and continental Europe.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate on this short, non-controversial but nonetheless important legislation. It is of particular relevance to those rural areas that attract tourists who wish to hunt, which is a relatively specialised sector of the tourism industry. In the absence of the Bill, as and from 14 July, there would have been no statutory framework for the granting of firearm certificates and hunting licences to non-resident hunters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with some of the points raised by Senators. Senator Dino Cregan referred to the lateness in bringing the Bill before the House. The Bill largely gives effect to the recommendations of the firearms legislation review group. It is also constrained in what it can do by the High Court judgment in 1998 and by European anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, it is relatively <Col N="1681" /> straightforward and uncontroversial. In these circumstances, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not consider it necessary to delay work on any other legislation in preparation in his Department in order to give priority to this Bill which, in any case, would not have come into operation until 14 July.</P>
    <P>This is the 31st Bill passed by the Oireachtas in the lifetime of the current Dáil for which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility. A further ten Bills from the Minister's Department are at various stages before the Oireachtas, and many more are in preparation. While this Bill is largely straightforward, the control of firearms is a complex area and requires careful legislation and a coherent, sensible and balanced approach. These elements have been brought together in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan also asked what checks were made on non-resident applicants for firearm certificates. Section 2(10) provides that the issuing person may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate as to the suitability of any applicant for a firearm certificate. There is also provision in section 2(9) for the issuing person to treat any document issued by an appropriate authority as evidence of suitability. Detailed information is submitted at the time of application for a firearm certificate by a non-resident. Checks are made at that stage, including verification of age, firearm calibre, evidence of firearm authorisation, confirmation of permission to shoot on land, and details of the Irish address at which the non-resident will be staying. Checks are also made to ensure that no convictions have been recorded against the applicant in the State.</P>
    <P>Due to the different procedures and practices in other countries, it would not always be practical to insist on a police certificate of conviction and, in any case, it might not always be the most appropriate way of assessing a person's suitability for use of a firearm in this country. Also, the gardaí will know the local landowner who has given permission to the non-national to shoot on declared lands. That is the benefit of involving the local gardaí who can also liaise with the local wildlife rangers.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan wanted to know if the Bill complied with the High Court decision of 1998. In preparing the Bill, the Minister had regard to the High Court decision of 1998 &ndash; which gave rise to the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Act of that year &ndash; European anti-discrimination laws and the report of the firearms legislation review group. All these matters pointed clearly to the fact that the legislation should provide obligations that can be discharged and that the provisions applying to applications for and grants of firearms certificates from residents and non-residents alike should be as closely aligned as possible, taking into account that justifiable differences can arise from different circumstances. To sum up, the High Court decision was foremost in <Col N="1682" /> the minds of the Minister and his legal advisers during the preparation of the Bill, and that is clearly reflected in the text.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked what happens to such firearms when not in use. If the weapon remains in the country it must be lodged with a registered firearms dealer. However, generally, the firearms are taken out of the country by the non-residents.</P>
    <P>There was an inquiry about the number of firearm certificates issued to non-residents for hunting and sporting purposes. The number of firearm certificates issued in this category is in the region of 4,000 per annum, while the number of hunting licences issued annually is approximately 3,000. The number of firearm certificates issued is usually greater than the number of hunting licences because while a firearm certificate must be issued in respect of each gun, the non-resident applicant may have more than one firearm.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely is correct that it is illegal to shoot songbirds. The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, will introduce stronger provisions for wild birds and animals.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan referred to the directive on gun cabinets. The recent directive on gun cabinets is a matter solely for the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no statutory function relating to it. Accordingly, the process under which the verification of the gun cabinet installation is carried out is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to determine and implement. I assure Senators that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring the concerns expressed in the House regarding the directive on cabinets to the attention of the Garda Commissioner. The Minister has already informed the Garda Commissioner of comments made by Deputies during the debate in the other House.</P>

      <P>A non-resident could be a European or a person from outside Europe. Section 2(9) states, &ldquo;The issuing person may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate as to the suitability of any applicant for a <Col N="1683" /> firearm certificate under this section.&rdquo;  I hope I misunderstood him but the Minister of State said in reply to Second Stage regarding definitions in this area that if a person had a conviction in another European state, it would not necessarily mean that he or she would not be entitled to an appropriate licence. I ask him to clarify that matter because it is confusing.</P>
      <P>What operation will be involved in terms of other EU countries and the granting of licences to non-residents in Ireland? What investigations will be carried out or system put in place regarding the granting of licences to people from different parts of the United States? Regulations differ between American states. For example, I was in Florida at one time and I stayed with a person in the Titusville area, which is near Cape Kennedy, for three nights. He was married to a girl from Cork and I was visiting Cape Kennedy and Orlando, which is only 20 minutes away. In his house, he showed me three different guns. I was very quiet when the guns were shown to me in his bedroom and I was not comfortable for the rest of the night.</P>
      <P>I do not want such situations in Ireland. The vast majority of people in the Republic of Ireland have never seen a gun and my view is that the fewer people who see them, the better. The judge also made this point. The legislation and regulations established under it must ensure that people coming to Ireland are properly investigated with regard to licences to carry guns or bring guns into the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I addressed this aspect in my reply on Second Stage. There will be discretion in relation to those issuing licences. The holder of a licence in another country must produce his or her pass. This will be a safeguard in terms of how a person behaves in his or her own country. The production of a pass is an indication that a person's credentials are in order in relation to the issuing of a certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is correct and I understand his point. However, my point is that the legislation governing firearms in the United States is very loose. For example, a 16 year old can get a licence. What investigations will be carried out or regulations put in place regarding who has authority over a 16 year old who has a rifle or a shotgun? A 16 year old cannot enter an off-licence or a licensed premises, and rightly so. I am confused and I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like the idea that individuals can bring guns to Ireland from America given that the legislation governing firearms is so haphazard between different states. Is it the case that the authorities will be happy for a person to bring in a gun just because he or she has a licence from <Col N="1684" /> their state which entitles them to carry a shotgun there? If that were the position I would not be happy about it. If I was a Garda sergeant, superintendent or inspector with any type of logic, I would not be happy about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Cregan's concerns because I lived in the United States for some time. However, there is nothing whatsoever wrong with a person possessing a hunting gun. There is a big difference in the type of weapons used in the United States and Ireland. Small calibre guns, such as shotguns, are used in Ireland for sports such as clay pigeon shooting. People use small calibre 0.22 rifles and permits are required for larger weapons such as 0.225, 0.222 or 0.228 guns for the hunting of deer. This is the highest calibre of gun allowed in Ireland. One cannot possess or hold a larger firearm and they are not extremely dangerous weapons.</P>
      <P>I like the fact that the local superintendent will make the decision. He will have to have some knowledge of the person applying for the licence. At present, a person can make an application to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform by submitting the relevant information. Under the Bill, the person making the decision will be on the ground. The applicant will have to appear before the Garda Síochána and he or she will have to be recommended by another person. It is a good element of the Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, our laws will be the most strict in the EU. The legislation clearly indicates that a person over the age of 16 will be entitled to apply for a licence. Regarding Senator Cregan's point, if a person has a conviction, he or she will not have the necessary documentation to apply for a licence. If the Minister is unhappy with the information, he can make further inquiries in relation to the application.</P>

      <P>We have an excellent junior team whose members are 16 and 17 years of age. They have been successful in shooting competitions all over the world. The members of the team were vetted before they took possession of a gun and they underwent a comprehensive training programme run by the clubs I mentioned earlier. They are the type of people we are trying to attract into the business because it is good for the country to have an Irish flag flying over a junior, senior or veteran shooting team.</P>

      <P>The Senator misunderstood my point. I am not referring to sporting people. I ask the Minister of State to clarify that the authorities are happy that guns will not get into the wrong hands. Perhaps somebody could explain to me from where sawn-off shotguns come. We do not want to give the impression, as Senator Kiely did, <Col N="1685" /> that only particular guns are used in Ireland. As the Garda has admitted, sawn-off shotguns are stolen from the legal owners. We must ensure that the procedures are as strict as possible. We must ensure that the majority of people who have not seen and do not want to see a gun &ndash; unless I am suffering from delusions, which I doubt &ndash; do not see one. I would like to see more people involved in such sport, whether clay shooting or otherwise, but we must ensure it is well protected and done properly. This is big business in Ireland and I welcome it. However, the judge said it was not protected. We cannot deny that, and that is why the Bill is before us.</P>

      <P>Senator Cregan mentioned 16 year olds. The National Association of Regional Game Councils is making every effort to ensure that people are properly trained in gun safety. The Senator also mentioned sawn-off shotguns. The Department, the Minister and the Garda Commissioner are taking steps to ensure that fewer guns are stolen by providing proper safes, which is important. It is not a problem to get a licence for a gun. However, old guns, which can be dangerous, are being licensed and used. We should consider testing guns once they have reached a certain age or have been used for a certain length of time. This issue is not relevant to the Bill but it is important.</P>

      <P>As private Bills are not a very frequent occurrence in the House, before we resume Report Stage I would like again to point out a procedural matter to Senators. In accordance with Standing Order 117 of the Standing Orders relative to private business, the Leas-Chathaoirleach has a supervisory role in relation to the proceedings on the Bill but he is not in charge of the Bill in the accepted sense as, say, a Minister is in respect of a public Bill.</P>
      <P>I also remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment. On Report Stage each amendment must be seconded. I now call Senator Dardis to resume his contribution on amendments Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive.</P>
      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, lines 8 and 9, to delete &ldquo;AND THE UNIVERSITY OF DUBLIN ARE&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;IS&rdquo;.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&ndash;(Senator Dardis).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Dardis: I thank the Cathaoirleach for his clarification of Standing Orders. We will abide by <Col N="1687" /> Standing Orders. One of the central difficulties about the Bill was the degree to which the Standing Order was abided by. I do not contest the fact that the Standing Order was changed. It was changed but nevertheless it was germane to it.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to repeat what was said on the last occasion we debated the Bill. It is all contained in Vol. 163, No. 1, of the Official Report of 18 April 2000. I am pleased that the reservations expressed on the previous day and the difficulties which were highlighted have been resolved satisfactorily, as far as I am aware. Hopefully we can dispose of this matter quite quickly.</P>
    <P>I stand by the proposition that it is the responsibility of Parliament to give close scrutiny to any Bill, whether it be a private, Private Members' or a Government Bill. We fulfilled that obligation and it is notable that the committee cautioned us that references to the University of Dublin be examined further. That is what was done on the previous day.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is no animosity on my part or, as far as I am aware, on the part of anybody else in the House, towards Trinity College. We are deeply conscious of its tradition and I sought to defend that tradition on a previous occasion. I vigorously reject the proposition put forward by Senator Henry that there was an attempt to humiliate anybody. That would not be my intention nor the intention of anybody else in the House, but as far as I am concerned the college failed to address certain issues. We sought to highlight that and the matter, from my point of view and hopefully from the point of view of everybody else, is now closed. I fully appreciate that some of these issues may wind up in the courts and it would be improper of us to intrude into that area given the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>We can now progress to dealing with the amendments and on that I would like the guidance of the Chair. Am I to understand that each of the seven amendments in my name and the name of Senator Keogh are being taken together? It will be interesting to see how Senator Keogh will vote in the event of a division on these amendments &ndash; we hope we can avoid that embarrassment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to deliver its commitments in the provision of essential health services, particularly in the area of accident and emergency, waiting lists, psychiatric services and preventative measures in the general health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, to the House. I am shocked by the amendment the Government has tabled, particularly in light of the unprecedented double apology the Minister for Health and Children had to make in the other House a short while ago regarding the unpre<Col N="1690" /> cedented deaths of two elderly people as a consequence of major failures in the health system. One of those deaths occurred in the mid-west region where a 66 year old woman had a very unhappy end to her life, having had to journey in an ambulance over a ten hour period from Limerick Regional Hospital to a psychiatric hospital in Ennis and to the general hospital in Ennis.</P>
    <P>What maddens me about the Government amendment is that it is aspirational and contains language one would expect to hear at a conference on health at which the Minister would set out his or her agenda for the future. There is no action word in the Government amendment as to what should be done now. It contains terms such as &ldquo;customer focus&rdquo;, but I question whether our health services are customer focused. It refers to a strategic approach to dealing with waiting lists and waiting times and commends the planned, structured and strategic approach being taken, but there is no planned, structured and strategic approach to our health services. It angers me that the words in that amendment indicate a sense that the Minister is suggesting the health boards should do everything, which would mean we do not need a Minister for Health and Children. I had hoped the Government would have indicated in its amendment that it is doing its best and supported the Fine Gael amendment in an effort to try to do better. That would have been far more honest.</P>
    <P>We consider it essential that we address the issue of health, particularly in the dying hours of this session. I had hoped the Minister would have learned about the urgent need to address this issue from Tipperary South by-election campaign. When canvassing there constituents expressed their anger and frustration about the lack of delivery of many essential services in the health area, not only in terms of the numbers on the waiting lists but the waiting times and the general management of the health services.</P>
    <P>Senator Mary Henry, who will contribute later, tabled a motion two weeks ago which deplored the lack of any sense of urgency by the Government in addressing the medical and nursing staff shortages in hospitals. It is unusual for Private Members' time to be used in almost consecutive weeks to address a matter relating to health services. Fine Gael Senators find it necessary to use Private Members' time again to condemn the Government on its failure to deliver on its commitments.</P>
    <P>I have highlighted four areas in my amendment and I could have highlighted many others. Accident and emergency departments deal with 1.2 million people annually and 14 consultants cover those departments. There are one consultant and four junior doctors on duty in the casualty department of Limerick Regional Hospital. That casualty department dealt with 112,000 people in 1998, 10% of the total national figure, and I am sure the figure for 1999 is higher. The shortage of junior doctors in our large hospitals which deal with maximum numbers of accident and emer<Col N="1691" /> gency patients has reached a crisis point. The casualty departments in small hospitals also experience problems. Such hospitals are located in Letterkenny, Cavan, Navan, Drogheda, Naas, Portlaoise, Kilkenny, Tralee, Castlebar, Sligo.</P>
    <P>Another problem that has emerged is the lack of anaesthetists. Those small general hospitals have maternity units and pregnant women in those areas would like to have access to epidural facilities. Access to epidurals is severely curtailed and in the case of two of those hospitals the facility to have an epidural is available only every second day. The shortage of anaesthetists on duty in the maternity units of those hospitals is creating a major problem.</P>
    <P>I cannot dwell on the problems experienced in psychiatric hospitals owing to the shortage of junior doctors, nor do I have figures on the numbers on waiting lists, which is a matter I will examine further.</P>
    <P>The Minister is putting legislation through the Dáil providing for an extra two year contract for junior doctors. Their contracts expire at the eleventh hour, 30 June. That emergency legislation will enable the employment of only a small number of additional doctors, perhaps 20 to 25. I wish the Minister had examined the needs of junior doctors who wished to register in a hurry. Does he realise the logistical difficulties regarding registration that must be ironed out with the Medical Council? Although it is an independent authority, that does not preclude the Minister and the Department from co-operating with it. I hope officials of the Department are liaising with staff in the Medical Council to ensure there is no delay in the processing of such registrations. Has the Minister contacted the aliens office about the need to fastrack the processing of visas? We know how difficult it is to get a visa at the best of times and how difficult it must be to get one in a hurry.</P>
    <P>We need more medical students. The National Manpower Forum seems to be at a standstill, although it has highlighted the need for a significant increase for consultants. I hope the Minister of State has specific figures on these matters.</P>
    <P>In the case of overcrowded accident and emergency units, we need to divert ambulances to hospitals that can take the overflow, but that requires a degree of co-ordination and I question if there is such co-ordination.</P>
    <P>We are blue in the face from going through the waiting lists. Despite all the claims the Minister may have made that the numbers on the waiting lists have decreased during the past three months, waiting times have increased. In other words, a greater percentage of people have to wait longer for their operations. I have the facts and figures. In March 2000, 72.39% of people were waiting over a year for cardiac surgery as opposed to 69.19% in March 1999. Some 92% of children have been waiting over six months for cardiac surgery as opposed to 74% last year. I did not make up these figures. They are in breach of the <Col N="1692" /> Department of Health and Children guidelines. The waiting time for cataract operations increased by 64% in the past three years. This means that people are effectively blind and almost 36% have waited over 12 months for their operations.</P>
    <P>These figures are shocking. People are needlessly disabled because the health service is in crisis. I do not wish to go through all the figures because it would take up too much time and they are available for the general public to check. There are long waiting times in areas that should be dealt with. For example, in cardiac surgery the waiting time since March 1999 has increased by 3.2%, cardiac surgery for children has increased by 18%, for ear, nose and throat for children it has increased by 3.5% since March 1999. I have already mentioned ophthalmology.</P>
    <P>It upsets me that when going through all the material the changes are all percentage increases in waiting times. I would not be too worried about the waiting times for plastic surgery if it were for cosmetic reasons but I would be very worried if it were for severe accident cases. The waiting time for surgery in general is 2.64% and for children 6.77%. These figures come from replies to parliamentary questions that I have checked. There are 3,542 children on waiting lists for listed procedures and 2,724 are waiting longer than six months. This gives the breakdown of the 76.9% in breach of Department of Health and Children guidelines.</P>
    <P>Given that millions of pounds are spent on waiting list initiatives why do we still have these figures? I cannot understand it because I know the money is going in. Is it a problem with the health boards? Is it a management problem? We need answers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the preventive measures. If the Minister were here, coming from a teaching background as he does he would know we are talking about prevention in relation to tobacco, alcohol and their effects on the body. I would hope not to have to dub him the &ldquo;Minister for Sickness&rdquo; because he wishes to be known as the Minister for Health and Children. We have to address this positively. Messages have to be reinforced to children, teenagers and adults in a creative and innovative way. I am sorry Deputy Shatter's anti-smoking strategy has not been adopted in full because it is an holistic approach to the problems arising from tobacco.</P>
    <P>The cancer figures are frightening. The waiting list for 1996 was 20,865 and for 1997, 21,450. It is interesting to note there are no national figures available for the time lapse between presentation and actual treatment, which is vitally important when attempting early intervention and treatment for cancers. These are the facts from the National Cancer Registry Board. If I have the opportunity after the recess I shall table a Private Members' motion on cancer. However, other speakers will raise this issue which is not getting the airing it needs. Prevention is of major import<Col N="1693" /> ance in relation to cancer for males and females. I hope the Minister will address this issue urgently.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to second the motion moved by Senator Jackman condemning the Government for its failure to deliver on its commitments in relation to the health services. We are all aware of the increased resources that have been poured into the health services. There is a common perception that the money is being wasted on bureaucracy and administration. There are huge gaps in the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>I happen to be chairperson of the Well Woman Centre in Dublin. The Well Woman Centre was founded in 1978 and its original purpose was to provide women with access to family planning information services. That clinic has developed significantly in the past 22 years and it now offers a broader health care service primarily to women but also to men. We operate three clinics in the Dublin area &ndash; Coolock, which has a number of GMS clients, Pembroke Road and Liffey Street &ndash; and see over 55,000 clients annually. Although the clinics operate in the Dublin area, women come from all over the country to avail of the services provided.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Health and Children that women want delivery and choice within the health service? I speak from a base of 55,000 people. The overall comment from our clients on why they wish to use our service is that they find the medical system as it operates hierarchical and unfriendly to women in many instances. They also complain about the amount of time wasted on waiting due to inefficient appointment time management. There is a great deal of criticism of the point of delivery of services. While they will cite that individual clinics or hospitals may do their best, their management is seen as a waste of resources.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Jackman that the amendment only serves to underline the shortcomings in the health service. There is something radically wrong with the service and we all have to admit it. I am sure it will be admitted on the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to concentrate on two main areas of critical importance to women's health, one of which is breast cancer. A survey was conducted by the Women's Health Council on the views and perceptions of women who attended symptomatic breast clinics. It is empirical evidence that women referred by general practitioners or by the Well Woman Centre for investigation and diagnosis in relation to breast cancer report delays in their first appointment and insufficient clinic time being available to them when they get to the clinics. This leads to enormous anxiety for women at a vulnerable time. The research by the Women's Health Council shows that between 50% and 100% of women suffer extreme anxiety <Col N="1694" /> in the period leading up to their first appointment. That is not good enough. Those women state that the medical staff appear to be under severe time pressure, chemotherapy is not available on site to them and there are practical and emotional problems for those who have to travel for radiotherapy. Women have to rely on family or friends to take them for treatment because there is no logistical help available. They cite the lack of formal services as adding considerably to their anxiety and distress during very traumatic times.</P>
    <P>There are some practical suggestions that could be made. I do not speak specifically about women in this instance but it is my particular area of expertise. Why not allow medical card holders free transportation by taxi, hackney or whatever other means? This would be a simple straightforward logistical help for those suffering trauma. Other specific concerns are that specialist nurses such as breast care nurses are diverted to other areas and thereby the necessary supports are not provided to the patients. These are the nurses who can identify those in need of counselling and in greatest need. If they are not there they cannot do it. There do not appear to be any formal links at delivery level between the Department of Health and Children and the clinics. There might be information available on the Irish Cancer Society, checklists and so forth but that is dependent on the individuals working in the clinic. That must be addressed. There is grave concern about how resources are being targeted.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise is cervical cancer. The new plan for women's health must succeed in reducing the number of women who contract cervical cancer. It is so sad that, according to the statistics in the plan for women's health, 60% of deaths from cervical cancer can be prevented by a screening programme for women between the ages of 25 and 60 years. This programme was to be established three years ago but the start up date has been delayed again because of the shortage of cytologists to read samples and, remarkably, delays in establishing an accurate population register of women aged between 25 and 60 years. The latter is unforgivable.</P>
    <P>The 1997-9 plan for women's health promised that the national screening programme would commence in 1999 or earlier if resources permitted. The resources are there but where are they being used? I have been signalled that I have no more time but I feel strongly about this issue. At present, clients of Well Woman clinics wait an average of 12 weeks for smear results. There are at least a dozen vacancies for cervical cytologists. If the Department can get nurses from the Phillippines to fill skills gaps, it should also examine the skills gap in the recruitment of cytologists. It is not right that people should have to wait so long for these results. It is an extremely anxious time.</P>
    <P>The population register for the cervical screening programme must be compiled now and the programme must be implemented on a national <Col N="1695" /> basis. We need action now. If there is no action, there will be a greater requirement for costly medical attention and, tragically, lost lives. That is the worst scenario.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)welcomes the unprecedented increase in capital and revenue investment which is being committed by this Government to the development of all aspects of the health services;</P>
      <P>(2) supports the structured approach being taken by the Government in the creation of a customer focused health care service;</P>
      <P>(3) welcomes the continuing development of the accident and emergency services and the strategic approach being taken to deal with waiting lists/waiting times; and</P>
      <P>(4) commends the planned, structured and strategic approach being taken in the development of both the acute and non-acute sectors of the health services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I recently read in <i>The Irish Times,</i> an organ not noted for supporting the Government or containing anything remotely favourable to the Government, that Ireland's health system is among the top 20 in the world. The French system tops the list with Ireland in 19th place, behind the UK. One can criticise the parameters used. The United States spends 13.7% of its GDP on health services yet it has one of the highest perinatal mortality rates in what we call the First World. One cannot, therefore, believe all statistics or the grading and monitoring parameters used. They do not mean the same thing to everybody.</P>
      <P>However, a number of points should be made. In 2000, total health spending will amount £4,221 million, an increase of 14% on last year. The capital allocation is £231 million, a 35% increase on 1999, in the first year of the national development plan, which has committed £2 billion for the period 2000 to 2006 in respect of the capital programme for health. This is treble the amount of capital funding in the years from 1993 to 1999. There will be an increase of £95 million for people with disabilities this year, a 116% increase on 1999. The cardiovascular strategy, to be funded by £12 million in 2000, will have a full allocation of £24 million in 2001. This funding will come from a tax on cigarettes, a subject we discussed in this Chamber last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the mental health sector, an area in which I have a great interest, there are substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatry services and new consultant appointments will liaise with the Prison Service regarding the provision of appropriate services in prisons. These are the people who are really marginalised and it is time we spent money on them. These people have <Col N="1696" /> little or no voice and have the least claim on our attention. We should have been doing this in the past. In the case of other medical specialties, a consultant will usually get access to the nine o'clock news and strongly press their case. The psychiatric services do not have that access for reasons I have never understood.</P>
    <P>Funding for a new suicide prevention programme provided six new consultant posts and 80 additional nurses are being provided for palliative care services. Palliative care is another growing health care area. No matter what we do to limit the incidence of cancer, it will occur. People are living longer so we will need more palliative care, not less, in the future. Another area where money will have to be spent is pain control. Medicine does not have the answer for every person's pain; it never did. At least we can control pain and help the sufferer.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman pointed out that over one million people attend hospital accident and emergency departments every year. I wonder how many of these cases are genuine accidents and emergencies. A sorting system is needed. Many of these people do not need to go to the accident and emergency department. They clog up the departments. One can talk at length on this subject. Senator Jackman and Senator Keogh made their points and I could make mine. However, I agree that there is a problem.</P>
    <P>In fact, two problems face the Government over the next five to ten years. We are moving from a health service that was previously vocationally driven, in other words, people became doctors or nurses because they felt they could help people. That attitude is changing rapidly. During the last debate on this subject, Senator Leonard said &ndash; I will paraphrase her because I do not wish to misquote her &ndash; that medical personnel do not wish to be seen as people who are vocationally driven. Instead, they wish to be seen as professionals who are properly remunerated with proper hours of work and full support structures in place. Despite the amount of money in the country, we cannot deal with that issue overnight. It will take some years to tackle.</P>
    <P>The other problem faced by the Government, indeed politicians in general, is the perception that access to VHI, BUPA or finance can help a patient leapfrog the waiting list, even though in many cases the same consultant is in charge of both lists. This perception is a problem and it must be challenged and dealt with. I believe the only criteria for accessing treatment should be clinical, not one's ability to pay for the procedure one thinks one needs. I hope we can deal with that issue soon.</P>
    <P>There are problems of perception. We could deal with them if we used more of the facilities available in the medical services. I can see no reason that a patient with a general medical services card should not be treated in the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Hospital if there is a clinical need. Clinical need should be the only <Col N="1697" /> defining reason for a patient to move up or down the waiting list.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about access to surgical procedures and I always tell people there is no surgical procedure that is without risk. There is no such thing as minor surgery or a simple procedure such as cataract operations, and I am not making a pejorative point. These procedures are not simple; they can be difficult, life threatening and they can go wrong.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. She has a difficult job to get the point across. I welcome also the extra expenditure in the health services. However, money is not the problem. Getting trained staff is the problem. Surgeons do not grow on trees; it takes 15 years to train a surgeon. It takes five to ten years to provide nurses with adequate training and experience. Experience is very important in medicine.</P>
    <P>This is a first world country, not a Third World country, and there are deficiencies in the delivery of our medical services which we must address. We have been told we are training more doctors than we need. However, one of the reasons doctors emigrate is that they have no properly structured career path. They have no guarantee if they pursue a certain specialty that they will find employment in this country, even though the need exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I am pleased to speak to the Fine Gael motion, which is somewhat of a surprise given their track record in Government.</P>
      <P>Some of the points raised by my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, are well worth noting. I have some knowledge of the success of providing services to people suffering from intellectual disability and autism. It is interesting that last year the Government announced a commitment to meet the identified needs of persons with intellectual disability and autism within a defined timeframe of three years, beginning with a major acceleration of investment in the year 2000. The additional funding in 2000 is designed to support the setting up of additional services at an annual cost of £35 million. Because of the timeframe involved in bringing on stream all the new services planned for 2000, the actual cost of those services in 2000 will be £28 million. This funding is in addition to the £10.7 million already allocated to the services in 2000 to meet the full year costs of the 1999 developments and identified needs of existing services. This brings the total additional funding provided in 2000 to £38.7 million, increasing to £45.7 million on 1 January 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funding of £35 million will provide 555 additional residential places. This has been called for <i>ad nauseam</i> by the parents and friends of the mentally handicapped who have an abiding interest and who do great work in providing services on a voluntary basis for people suffering from intellectual disability. Some 185 respite places will be made available, which is very important to carers of people suffering from intel<Col N="1698" /> lectual disability. Another 700 new day places and health related support services will be provided for people suffering from autism. An additional £20 million is being invested this year to provide services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. I recall all those who came in wheelchairs and so on to the gates of Leinster House calling for those improvements and I am pleased the funding has been made available to provide these essential services.</P>
    <P>A total of £30 million in additional revenue is being made available for child care services. These resources will allow more emphasis on the prevention of problems through supporting vulnerable children in the family and community setting, while ensuring services are promptly available to children at risk. There is no point closing the stable door when the horse has bolted. This is a proactive move on the part of the Minister, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts the current economic climate and statisticians have said we are an aging population, the reason being that there are better health services and people are living longer. If we have more older people, we must provide proper health care services for them. The initiative in providing additional sub-acute places to relieve pressure on acute hospital beds does not stand alone. It complements an established programme of developing services for older people which has gained considerable momentum since this Government came into office. I would like to outline some of the developments. Excluding the nursing home subvention scheme, the amounts of additional funding provided for services for older people by the previous Government in the years 1995-97 was £2.1 million, £2.5 million and £3 million, respectively. In 1998, an additional amount provided by this Government was £7 million and in 1999 the figure was £16 million. I do not need to labour that point, which is well made.</P>
    <P>When this Government took office in 1997 the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, increased the waiting list allocation by 50% within a very short time. I am surprised that despite substantial increases in funding by the former Minister &ndash; I am sure that practice will be continued by the present Minister &ndash; waiting lists have increased. However, a report published recently showed that waiting lists decreased for the first time this year. In tandem with that, the Minister has provided substantial funding to reduce further these waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to speak recently on a motion in this House on the availability of psythiatric nurses. Last year was one of the most successful years to date in recruiting psychiatric nurses. Given that the Midland Health Board is one of the smallest of the eight health boards, I am pleased the provision of an acute psychiatric unit at Portlaoise General Hospital is at an advanced stage in the planning process. The Midland Health Board recently signed off, so to speak, and referred to the Department of Health and Children the next phase of bringing on stream the <Col N="1699" /> facility which will be provided in phase 2B. This is a constructed shell which was built in tandem with phase 2A. We had to wait for the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to come into office to provide the necessary funding to open that facility because the Fine Gael Minister of the day failed to provide the funding to commission phase 2A. Members on this side of the House have a lot to be thankful for to the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen. The present incumbent of that office, Deputy Martin, brings to his new portfolio a record of success in the Department of Education and Science and I am sure he will be a great success there also, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <P>I can only speak about my own health board and the services available there in highlighting the success brought about by this Government. In the project team's report, which was not included in the original brief, the provision of a 36-bed psychiatric unit will be provided in phase 2B. Therefore, one health board will provide two acute units. Furthermore, after 14 years of calls from me the Minister has provided the funding for the establishment of a college of nursing. A number of consultant posts has been approved in histopathology, haematology and oncology. I do not claim everything is perfect but the Government is making major strides towards providing the best possible health service.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry shares my abiding interest in mental health. Before the year is out the new mental health Bill will be before the Oireachtas. As a former member of the psychiatric nursing profession, I look forward to contributing to the Bill, especially on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I know Government Senators and the person who framed the Government amendment mean well but I query the wisdom of their self-satisfaction about the health service when the public knows it is in the most appalling mess. If the amendment had proposed that Seanad Éireann supports the Minister for Health and Children who is doing the best he can in very trying circumstances, I would have had to support it because I believe he is, but the Government amendment is quite ridiculous. I know Senators Glynn and Fitzpatrick mean well but simply to describe throwing large amounts of money at the health service as doing something is patently silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our problems are due to a lack of forward planning in the past few years. Current problems in the health service have been coming upon us for the last three years. When the Medical Council described the changes they were going to make for training posts which non-EU doctors could take up, some Senators must remember my predicting trouble in the non-consultant hospital grades. Half our staff are non-EU doctors, particularly outside Dublin, Galway, Cork and Limerick and non-EU doctors will not take up posts which are not approved for training purposes. <Col N="1700" /> The day I predicted has come. This week's medical papers contain advertisements for positions to be filled on 1 July.</P>
    <P>Not only is it worrying that these posts are still unfilled but hospitals will now become so desperate that they will accept any candidate. I do not mean to be derogatory about people who apply for these posts but hospitals will not be in a position to insist on quality people to fill posts. In places like Kilkenny which never had trouble filling jobs before, no one has turned up for interview for some posts. We are in a dreadful situation and it would be wiser if we recognised that.</P>
    <P>Two things will make the situation even worse. The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said it will not recognise for training, junior posts in a single or two handed obstetrics unit. The last two single handed obstetricians in the British Isles are working in Monaghan and Dundalk. This is totally unsafe. The last nine two handed practices in the British Isles are in this country. None of those hospitals will be recognised for training. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, knows this.</P>
    <P>The next piece of good news is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has given hospitals a deadline of 18 months in which to address training deficits or lose accreditation. If this does not happen more of our small hospitals will have no junior surgical staff. These problems can be seen in advance. They have nothing to do with money. They have to do with organisation.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed during Private Members' time two weeks ago when the Minister for Health and Children, for whom I have expressed admiration, said we must decide whether we want the health boards to have autonomy. Of course we want them to have autonomy but they must also be organised. The other day Senator Finneran said there should be more co-operation between health boards. The Minister must organise this co-operation. I have been involved in North South co-operation and Senator Maurice Hayes, who is chairman of the Mater Hospital in Belfast, has been very good about trying to organise this. However, it is from the top that this organisation must come and it is not simply a question of money.</P>
    <P>The situation is very serious yet at the end of May the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, whom I know to be a truthful woman, told the Dáil there was no problem. A week later the Minister, Deputy Martin, said there was a slight problem. Now we have a truly dreadful problem. I am told only a small number of jobs remain unfilled but I am inclined to wonder. Sligo Hospital, a very good hospital, is advertising this week for a senior house officer in accident and emergency, a registrar in accident and emergency, a senior medical house officer, a senior house officer in ENT, a registrar in ENT and a senior house officer in obstetrics and gynaecology. All these posts are to be filled by 1 July. Manorhamilton is looking for a senior house officer, Letterkenny is looking for a senior house <Col N="1701" /> officer/registrar in anaesthetics, a senior house officer in geriatrics, a senior house officer in medicine and a senior house officer in psychiatry. Are these hospitals wasting the health boards' money advertising posts which are not vacant? </P>
    <P>Similar advertisements have been placed by every health board. The Southern Health Board requires a senior house officer in paediatrics in Tralee, a senior house officer in medical oncology, a basic surgical trainee, registrars in accident and emergency and a senior house officer in orthopaedic surgery in Cork University Hospital and a senior house officer in general surgery in Bantry. Are these health boards wasting their time advertising jobs which are actually filled? The Southern Health Board has advertised for an anaesthetic registrar, a radiology registrar, a rheumatology registrar and a medical senior house officer for Waterford. St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny, where I was told the other day that no one turned up for interviews for some jobs, requires a senior house officer in medicine and a senior house officer in paediatrics. Cavan, Monaghan, Navan and Drogheda have terrible problems.</P>
    <P>Why are we being told only a few jobs remain to be filled? Why are health boards advertising for staff? Statements are made by Senators with the best of intentions but they cannot be factual. Senator Glynn said the other day the Midland Health Board has a rheumatology service. Can he tell me the name of the consultant rheumatologist because I know of no record of one? The Midland Health Board is one of the boards without a consultant rheumatologist. Who is running the rheumatology service? Is it a reflexologist or what? It is pointless to make statements we know are incorrect.</P>
    <P>We can fill posts if we make a proper effort to organise matters ahead of time. Nine oncology consultant posts were filled within a year and a half. Neurology posts can be filled with a little organisation and planning. Senator Chambers spoke the other day about stroke treatment. One cannot have stroke treatment without a neurologist. I beseech the Minister not to introduce a prostate screening programme because there are no urologists to whom patients can be referred.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed. I know Senators are not trying to mislead the House but we would be better advised to call on the Minister to close down units, particularly accident and emergency services, which do not have adequate staff and which are dangerous. The shortage of anaesthetists is particularly worrying.</P>
    <P>The mental health Bill will not come before the select committee before the end of this year. This gives us an idea of the priority given to psychiatric services. This is the most important legislation to come before the Oireachtas but I am told it will not even be considered in committee before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I am glad we are having this debate this evening because the nature and quality of our <Col N="1702" /> health services is uppermost in the minds of every family here. This country is doing exceptionally well in other areas. Without doubt we have a First World economy, nobody disputes that. However, in many respects we have a Third World health service. Senator Henry, who has a detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground, has painted a very grim picture. Last week a Richter scale was put in place to show expenditure on health and Ireland was ranked marginally higher than Britain in terms of expenditure and customer service. Our position should cause us all to reflect on what we are doing and on what we should be doing.</P>
      <P>Throwing money at our health services will not yield the kind of results we need and that need to be yielded without any delay. There must be a root and branch investigation of every element of the health services, from administration to the delivery of services and the customer service or lack of it. This must be done but it has not happened so far in my political lifetime.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and took great heart from what he said. At the outset he said that the hierarchy in hospitals here had not changed between the turn of this century and the turn of the previous one. No one had the political guts or will to tackle entrenched positions and vested interests within the health service. I was happy to hear from the Minister, for whom I have extraordinary respect, that he will tackle this situation. He also plans to tackle the problem that has arisen in respect of junior doctors. Unfortunately, I cannot discuss this matter because I have only eight minutes at my disposal.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, having listened to him this morning and knowing his credentials, that he will be the first Minister in my lifetime to begin to tackle the junior doctor issue. This is a fundamental issue in dismantling and addressing the many structural faults within our system. I wish him luck and all speed in making this happen.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry painted a very grim picture of the training, or lack of training, that is available in the services. In-service training is available in every other industry. On the job training is a feature of the times in which we live. Very little of this has happened in the health services because of the entrenched positions adopted by people in positions of privilege and power. This is one of the first issues the Minister will tackle. He must deal with a management problem in the health services and its organisation and I wish him well in his endeavour.</P>
      <P>We must look at how our health boards are managing in terms of forward planning and how they predict where vacancies will arise. We must see how they plan, prepare for and address these vacancies. Unfortunately, this has not happened in most of the health boards that I am aware of. We must examine how they deliver their functions within the overall spectrum of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> Staff shortages in key areas will cripple the services for a great many people this year. I advise the Minister to tackle the differences that exist between public and private patients. He has the intelligence and integrity to do this. People are waiting for hip replacement operations. They are suffering acute pains and a marked deterioration in their quality of life and productive input. Public patients must wait months, and in many cases years, for such operations while people who are VHI members can nominate the time for their operation. This must be tackled. I ask the Minister and the Government to dedicate a team of surgeons to deal with public patients.</P>
    <P>With regard to customer service, if the health services were in any other sector and if people did not badly need these services, no one would go to them. Patients are given appointments and told to turn up at 8 a.m. They take their place in the queue and if they are lucky they may be seen by 4 p.m. It is a disgrace that appointments cannot be organised and time allotted so that people who can be seen at 4 p.m. are asked to turn up at 3.45 p.m. The way people are treated in hospitals is a disgrace. It is time we stood up and faced this problem. The rectification of this problem needs to be identified. People who deliver a poor level of customer service need to be told that it is unacceptable to the paymasters here.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh made great play about women's health. I want to talk about women's health issues and how they have been treated here. I want to advert to how the women who suffer from hepatitis C were poisoned by officialdom within the health services and treated politically. It is true that Mrs. Brigid McCole had to die before the then Minister of the day, Deputy Michael Noonan, took action on the hepatitis C issue. In any other civilised country he would have been asked to resign and he would have had the decency to do so.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems that we still suffer in terms of the financing of the health service originated from the time when a tax amnesty was given by the then Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. If the people who availed of the amnesty had paid their taxes we might have been able to provide a reasonable health service. I have heard persons call for a vote of no confidence and the resignation of upright honourable politicians and persons of integrity. It is about time we got our thinking straight. I do not know whether it would take a psychiatrist or a psychologist to get us to think straight about these issues but it is only from a position of truth that good things happen and flow.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the present Minister for Health and Children, and he has a mountain to overcome, will bring our health services to where they should be, a position where citizens would have equal rights and entitlements within the services. Unfortunately, this is not available at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I am glad that Senator Jackman, who is very concerned about these issues and has impeccable credentials, has given us the opportunity to comment on the health service. There is a great deal more detail that I would like to put on record but I do not have time to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important and timely debate. An indicator of any society is the care it offers to those who are ill. As an indicator of an advanced society, our health service leaves a great deal to be desired. There are very serious shortages and shortcomings in our system which have not been addressed by the Government. I refer in particular to waiting lists and times. The number of adults waiting longer than one year to have a procedure carried out is disgracefully high. At Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in my home town, Drogheda, over 252 adults are waiting longer than one year for their medical procedures. That is disgraceful and unacceptable. If the norm set by the Minister is a maximum of one year it is seriously put at risk in our hospitals where that time limit means nothing because the resources are just not available.</P>
      <P>The number of children, nationally, on a waiting list for longer than six months is disgraceful. This Government seems to be in a state of paralysis and seems unable to do anything about it. Despite the fine words of Senator Quill, I find that this Government is not showing the same care and attention that Deputy Noonan did when he was Minister for Health in the previous coalition Government. I laud him for his cancer strategy and for the effort and commitment he put into improving our health service when times were much more difficult than at present.</P>
      <P>A gentleman came to my clinic recently who could hardly breathe and was in some distress. He told me he had never been to a politician before. He was on a cardiac emergency waiting list for over three months. His doctor was to be back from leave at the beginning of the next month, although there was no criticism of the doctor concerned, but as he was a medical card holder and could not get his operation when he needed it. He felt the only person he could come to was someone like me. This demonstrates that there is a serious problem in our system.</P>
      <P>People who need operations should not be queuing up to see politicians, they should be lying in wait, whether in Dublin, London or wherever else we buy them the care and the operations that they need. If we cannot provide for them in the State, we should insist they are provided for outside the State and the money must be provided for those operations. There has been some progress made recently on a new initiative by the Minister for Health and Children but it is not good enough. It is not good enough that that poor man had to come to see me. Hundreds of thousands of those people are on waiting lists in hospitals countrywide and they are absolutely sick of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> I received a letter from the North Eastern Health Board about the number of people waiting for treatment in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, which is greater than 1,500. It may be a regional hospital but the specialties are not being provided under this Minister. The ENT list is in excess of 375 people. The surgical list is in excess of 309 people and it goes on and on. Over 287 people are on the urology waiting list. That is utterly unacceptable and totally disgraceful. This Government needs to take a fresh look at the shortage in the resources on a regional basis. The fact that so many specialties are based in Dublin needs to be re-examined because people in the regions and the regional health boards are not receiving the services there and we have to re-examine that.</P>
    <P>One critical factor is that there are serious shortages of nurses in the health system, particularly the specialist nurses. In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, there are 55 vacancies for nurses that cannot and will not be filled. The health board has made very positive effort to recruit these people but it has not been possible to get them in the State. What is the Minister doing about it? What policy has he to improve conditions for nurses who work in our hospitals and to improve their career options? He should make it a much more attractive career for those people who want to care and who want a career in nursing but who find the money and the career structure is not there for them. In the short term, the Minister needs to go abroad to recruit nurses to bring into our country. He needs to do this quickly because the system failing fast. It is disgraceful.</P>
    <P>Another issue that arises is the number of people in acute hospitals who cannot go home because they are not well enough but who do not need full acute services. A significant number of step-down beds are needed throughout the State. This Minister is doing nothing to provide them. It is disgraceful that elderly people are sometimes sent home to an empty house with a coal fire and no help. It is impossible to get home helps. One cannot get a home help in Drogheda because they are not being paid enough. They receive a disgraceful sum of money to do their job. The Minister needs to examine the fact that we need full-time carers and that health boards should offer a career of carer, that is, a person who will work for the health board in a full-time capacity, who will travel around and look after the people who are ill in the community, not on an hour by hour basis as happens at present. It should be a full-time, pensionable job. People are ready, willing and able to take up that challenge. Is the Minister able to do something about it? Of course he is, if he wants to. It is time he improved the services for senior citizens.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to services to children is disgraceful. Hundreds of children who need speech therapy cannot and will not receive it under this Government. Children in the North Eastern Health Board or Louth community care <Col N="1706" /> area who are unable to speak or have very serious speech problems will have to wait a year before they have receive an appointment.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I have no more time as there is much more I would like to say. I will say it at another forum. It is time the Government got a good shaking up and did something about the health services instead of paying lip service to them, while all around us, people are seriously ill and cannot get the services they need and the care to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this House on the Government's commitment to the provision of our health services in the areas highlighted by the distinguished Fine Gael and other Senators, accident and emergency services, waiting list or times, psychiatric services and preventative measure in the general health services.</P>
      <P>The Government has already put in place a range of programme improvements and funding expansion which means that today there are more people being treated by the health services, more people employed in the health services and more capital projects planned or underway than at any time in the history of the services. I assure the House that the Government is totally committed to ensuring that we have a health service which is responsible in meeting the health service needs of our people despite what has been said this evening.</P>
      <P>The health service is the focus of considerable ongoing attention which intensifies when the standards expected of the service are not met. It is seldom, however, that the improvements in the services are given proper acknowledgement. Since the Government took office, there have been many positive developments which must be acknowledged. Not least among these is the unprecedented level of capital and revenue funding which is being provided for these developments.</P>
      <P>When the present Government took office in 1997, the revenue provision for health was £2,754 million. The provision for the current year amounts to £4,297 million, which represents an increase of 56% in funding. This increase in long awaited resources has allowed for a major acceleration in the development of a range of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also recognised that, in moving forward, the current health infrastructure is inadequate for the delivery of a truly modern and efficient service. Under the national development plan £2 billion in capital spending has been made available to develop health facilities of the highest order, which will include addressing geographic imbalances in the health system. The inclusion of health in the NDP was a statement of priority in its own right since it is recognition, for the first time, of the central importance of health facilities in Ireland's social and economic infrastructure. The £2 billion provided is almost <Col N="1707" /> treble the capital resources provided over the previous seven years. The first fruits of the NDP are seen in this year's Estimate where there is a record capital provision of £231 million.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that funding, while vital, is only the starting point in accomplishing radical improvement. There is always scope to improve standards of customer service and all those engaged in the health sector must put this concern at the centre of all of their operations. It has been highlighted in the debate that more needs to be done in certain areas and further planning needs to be assessed. The way the service is organised, managed and delivered is undergoing considerable change and these improvements must continue.</P>
    <P>Patients availing of health services, in every area of the country, are entitled to expect a quality service. We want to see performance rewarded and health agencies have been informed that this is the basis on which additional funds will be made available. The Government will continue to work with all concerned in investing resources and energy into the improvement of services. We will take all opportunities to bring the necessary services on stream quicker and will lead reform for the benefit of the public patient.</P>
    <P>I believe that we already have a strong health system and that it compares well internationally. The challenge is to modernise it further so that we can compare with the best in the world. I make no apology for such an aspiration. We can harness our already skilled staff, our growing resources and our committed managers to achieve this objective. We have begun this process already. Substantial initiatives have been taken in many areas of both the acute and non-acute health services sectors to ensure that services are reformed, reorganised and properly geared to meet the needs of our population.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell on them at length, but briefly they include the recently launched cardiovascular health strategy, which provides for achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. An initial investment of £12 million this year is the first in the history of our services. There has been investment of £4.9 million in 1998, £5.5 million in 1999 and £3.6 million in 2000 in cardiac services, including cardiac surgery, to support the objectives of the wider cardiovascular strategy. The continuing implementation of the national cancer strategy with funding this year of £2.98 million, is already improving the availability of cancer treatment services throughout the country. More than £41 million has been allocated under the strategy since 1997. A plan for the development of renal services is being prepared which will involve an investment of £20 million over the next three years, £6 million of which will be spent this year.</P>
    <P>A medical manpower forum is being established to review key aspects of medical staffing in our public hospitals. There will be a review of the adequacy of bed capacity in both the acute and <Col N="1708" /> non-acute settings. This review will identify capacity issues against the background of substantial increases in demand as a result of changing demography and advances in medical treatment. It is my intention that the results of this review will be addressed in the context of next year's Estimate. There was an investment of £53 million up to the end of 1999 for persons with intellectual disabilities, with a future investment of £38.7 million in the current year increasing to £45.7 million in 2001. This compares more than favourably with the contribution of the last Government with its minimum investment of £12 million. There is continued investment in services for persons with physical and sensory disabilities. Additional revenue funding of £20 million is being provided in the current year.</P>
    <P>There is a committed approach to tackling hospital waiting lists so scandalously neglected by the Senators' party when in Government. The funding for waiting lists was cut back from £20 million to £12 million at one stage. The new hospital at Tallaght has been opened. Within the time period of the NDP, and because of the additional resources now available under the plan, major projects will proceed, including the joint Mater/Temple Street development, St. Vincent's Elm Park, phase I, St. James's Hospital, phase IH, Cork University Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel. Other works and planning will be undertaken in the Dublin maternity hospitals. In addition, planning will continue on the Mater Hospital phase I and Crumlin hospital &ndash; new theatres. Projects in the Border, midland and western region will include Tullamore, phases I and II; University College Hospital, Galway, phase II and Portlaoise General Hospital and Castlebar General Hospital, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>There is ongoing investment in child care services. Funding made available in 1998 and 1999 provided for additional much needed staff resources. This investment is being built upon through the provision of additional funding of £30 million for this service in the current year. There will be a continuation of the established programme of developing services for older people which has gained momentum since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific issues raised by the Senators in their motion. I am happy to do this even if only to refute their charges against the Government's record on these issues. A major commitment of the Government when coming into office was to address this area. Strategies for cancer and cardiovascular services, to which I have already referred, clearly span the acute and non-acute sectors. However, specific attention must also be paid to performance within acute hospitals. The Government is providing for an all out assault on waiting lists. Waiting lists for a number of procedures are unacceptable and will be reduced. In reviewing the overall performance of the current system, in-patient waiting lists represent just 4% of the total discharges from acute <Col N="1709" /> hospitals. While waiting lists are unacceptable and must be addressed, let us not forget the level and quality of service provided to the other 96% of patients.</P>
    <P>The new Eastern Regional Health Authority has already established a dedicated team to address this issue and my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has agreed accelerated work plans for addressing waiting lists with each health board. A total of almost £33 million will be spent on addressing acute hospital waiting lists this year. During the first quarter of this year waiting lists fell by 2,485, which was not noted by the Opposition. This was an encouraging reduction, particularly since, traditionally, elective work suffers in the early months of the year as the number of emergency medical admissions increases. Last month the Minister announced a targeted initiative to deliver an additional 7,600 waiting list procedures by the end of the year to accelerate progress in this area even more quickly. These procedures will be over and above the waiting list activity agreed with agencies at the start of the year. This latest initiative will cost £10 million.</P>
    <P>In many ways, the availability and quality of hospital services set the context for the perception of the health services as a whole. There is no escaping the fact that certain key areas, particularly waiting lists and accident and emergency services, are critical to the public perception of the health services. Only when the performance in these areas is improved and hospital services are integrated properly with primary and community care services will our health services be seen as meeting the best standards. What is also clear is that problems in areas, such as waiting lists and accident and emergency services, cannot be solved in isolation. Integrated solutions are the key. This will involve continued development and refinement of appropriate roles for acute, primary care and community services.</P>
    <P>For example, the £35.4 million in additional funding this year for services for the elderly has a key role to play in putting in place the community facilities, home help and nursing supports required to allow older people to move out of the hospital setting once the acute phase of their treatment is completed. This investment will be complemented by dedicated funding of £5 million for tackling difficulties in accident and emergency services. This funding will go in large measure towards increasing the number of sub-acute beds, particularly in the Dublin region, to allow acute hospitals to free up beds occupied by the elderly and chronic sick. Integration of strategies for the development of services for older people and accident and emergency services offers the best means of meeting the policy aim of supporting older people in the community and achieving the best possible performance within hospitals.</P>
    <P>This Government has provided additional funding to acute hospitals providing accident and emergency services to enable them to implement a range of initiatives in the medium term aimed <Col N="1710" /> at addressing the difficulties being experienced in their accident and emergency departments. This additional funding amounted to £2.3 million in 1998, £2 million in 1999 and a further £2 million in the current year. It has enabled hospitals providing accident and emergency services to continue to implement a range of initiatives aimed at alleviating pressures in accident and emergency departments, particularly during periods of peak demands which occur most frequently during the winter months. These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. They allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment/observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.</P>
    <P>Difficulties in accident and emergency departments are most acutely felt in hospitals in the eastern region, which deals with in excess of 45% of all accident and emergency attendances. The Eastern Regional Health Authority has already decided that improvements in accident and emergency services are a priority and has established a dedicated team to examine in detail the existing services in the region as a whole, including paediatric services, and to bring forward a comprehensive policy for the development of accident and emergency services in the region generally.</P>
    <P>The team will review issues affecting accident and emergency services in terms of the principles of access, time, appropriateness and quality. It will be seeking to ensure that patients presenting at accident and emergency departments within the region have access to an appropriate service that deals with their needs in a timely and comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>The review will address a variety of issues to include the examination of services within accident and emergency departments and the examinations of policies procedures and protocols for emergency services. It is hoped that examination of these areas will generate solutions for current problems occurring in some hospital accident and emergency departments, such as long waiting times for diagnosis and treatment, long waiting times on trolleys for patients awaiting admission and overcrowding in accident and emergency departments arising in part from delays in admission of patients.</P>
    <P>A review of alternative options for care will also be conducted. These options will include the development of out of hours GP services at community centres or in a hospital setting and the development of satellite and community based units for minor injury and illnesses. The initiative of the authority in this vital area of health services provision will result in a much improved service for patients presenting at accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The role of primary care, and in particular of GPs, is also of central importance within the overall system. Under the NDP there will be very significant development of primary care involving investment in multi-purpose health centres. These will be local hubs for the provision of a range of primary care health and personal social services leading to a more comprehensive and integrated service to patients. Under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the Government is committed to establishing at least four primary care pilot projects which will allow for the development of 24 hour, seven day services. A sum of £1 million has been made available for this purpose in the current year.</P>
    <P>Already the GP pilot project in Carlow, CAREDOC, is operating successfully as are initiatives such as DUBDOC in Dublin, centred around St. James's Hospital. A further pilot project in the Northern Eastern Health Board is due to commence in July. The roll-out of a properly evaluated primary care model will be of major importance in allowing patients to access health care at the most appropriate level.</P>
    <P>I note the Senators' outdated terminology when talking about mental health services. These services continue to improve and much progress has been made in the past number of years. It is acknowledged, however, that much still needs to be done. The commitment to transfer all existing admission acute units from psychiatric hospitals to units in general hospitals continues.</P>
    <P>The advantages of providing acute services in general hospital settings are obvious. Apart from the substantial improvements that such units offer in terms of structure, decor, furnishings and general comfort, the close proximity to and the availability of general medical and surgical services to those suffering from mental illness are obvious. Furthermore, the availability of psychiatric teams to the general hospital through liaison and consultation services is an important input to the general hospital services.</P>
    <P>At the end of the period of the national development plan in 2006, it is hoped that the programme of acute psychiatric units will be significantly advanced. This will mean acute admissions to the old psychiatric hospitals will become a thing of the past. Approximately £150 million capital will be provided over the lifetime of the national development plan for mental health services. A significant part of this funding will go towards the development of acute psychiatric units linked to general hospitals as a replacement of services previously provided in psychiatric hospitals. The plan will also provide for more community facilities such as mental health centres and community residences which will accelerate the phasing out of the old institutions.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £12.25 million is being made available to the mental health services in 2000 to develop community mental health services, to increase forensic psychiatry services, to provide rehabilitation services, to increase child <Col N="1712" /> and adolescent services, to provide liaison psychiatry services in general hospitals and to enhance staffing levels. This additional funding represented a 100% increase on the additional funding made available in 1999.</P>
    <P>It is intended to accelerate the provision of community based mental health services for persons with mental illnesses throughout the country. Such residential accommodation in 1994 stood at 368 providing 2,685 places. This total increased to 398 in 1999 with 2,923 places. Between 1994 and 1998 the number of day hospitals and day centres increased from 159 to 176.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue of £2.9 million is being allocated in 2000 towards the further development of community based mental health services, including the improvement of the psychology and social work services. The lack of multi-disciplinary teams in many areas of the mental health services has been highlighted by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his most recent report. It is necessary to develop special rehabilitation programmes for patients who have spent long periods of time in hospital in order to facilitate their transfer to more appropriate accommodation in the community.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of this objective £250,000 has been allocated to the Western Health Board to fund a dedicated rehabilitation team which will commence a rehabilitation programme for long stay patients in St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe. If this pilot project is successful, a similar approach will be considered for other hospitals.</P>
    <P>A start was made in 1999 on strengthening forensic psychiatry services. It is necessary to increase the number of consultant forensic psychiatric teams to adequately deal with the level of psychiatric morbidity within the prison system and to facilitate better management of disturbed behaviour within the mental health services and thus prevent unnecessary admissions to the Central Mental Hospital. A total of £1.35 million additional revenue was allocated in 2000 towards substantial improvements in the forensic psychiatry services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>Priority is being given to the development of mental health services for both older people and children and adolescents. Revenue resources totalling approximately £2.5 million were made available by the Department in 1999 to enable improvements to be effected in these services.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.1 million was allocated to further developments in child and adolescent psychiatry services this year. This funding will provide for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry and for the development of multi-disciplinary teams to focus on specific areas, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder &ndash; AD/HD. A working group has been established by the Department to review child and adolescent psychiatry and to finalise a plan for the further development of this service. The group held its first meeting on 15 June.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1713" /> The increase in the number of people living to advanced old age requires the development of specialist mental health services to meet their specific needs. In this area, services have been expanding in recent years and £1 million in additional funding has been provided for the mental health services in 2000 towards the provision of additional consultants in old age psychiatry.</P>
    <P>It is intended to allocate additional resources to enable these services to be further developed over the next few years. It is also intended to increase the level of capital funding available for the development of mental health facilities in the community as part of the national development plan in order to make services more accessible.</P>
    <P>At national level, priority is being given to education awareness and to promoting a better understanding among the public of mental health, thereby facilitating a greater and more positive acceptance of the transfer of mental health services from institutional to community-based settings. Links with the voluntary sector continue to be strengthened, both at national and local level, and an additional £300,000 has been made available this year to strengthen these links and services. There is ongoing co-operation between the boards and several voluntary organisations such as AWARE, GROW, Schizophrenia Ireland, the Samaritans and local branches of the Mental Health Association of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that the Government is failing in its commitments in this area is outlandish. Evidence of our work in this area is crystal clear to anybody who cares to take even a cursory look at developments.</P>
    <P>As regards preventative measures, a number of significant programmes are under way in this area. I would like to highlight some of these, the first being the national breast screening programme. In March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase 1 will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the 50-64 age group, which represents approximately 50% of the national target population.</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process rather than the costs involved and my Department's key objective is to ensure that the programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria. It is for this reason that the national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; <Col N="1714" /> and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme. The service is being delivered by two central units, the Eccles unit on the Mater Hospital campus and the Merrion unit on St. Vincent's Hospital campus, with outreach to the community by means of three mobile units. Limited screening commenced in both units in March, without publicity, to test equipment, systems and procedures. Decisions in relation to subsequent phases of the programme will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase 1 of the programme in place. Phases 2 and 3 will involve the extension of the programme to the rest of the country. The steering committee has recommended that phase 2 of the programme should follow phase 1 as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department is conscious of the importance of early access to symptomatic mammography services, and of the provision of an equivalent standard of excellence in both symptomatic and screening mammography services. At the request of the Minister, Deputy Martin, a review of the symptomatic breast cancer services has been undertaken by the National Cancer Forum. The Minister has received the report of this group, which he is considering. He proposes to make funding available under the national cancer strategy to develop further symptomatic breast cancer services throughout the country.</P>
    <P>My Department also recently raised the issue of mammography referral practices with the health boards. The Department's key concern is to ensure that all women, irrespective of age or where they live, have timely access to symptomatic services. A critical factor in this regard is referral by GPs to local diagnostic mammography services in the first instance. This should result in a reduction in average waiting times at all mammographic units, thereby improving access for women and at the same time ensuring that expertise levels are maintained and developed in diagnostic units around the country.</P>
    <P>Improvements will be taking place in the dental treatment services scheme, which Senators have alluded to. Medical card holders will be entitled to receive a dental examination and a range of treatment from the dentist of their choice. This year over £32 million is being provided for the scheme. In addition, it is proposed to extend entitlement to dental services to children up to the age of 16 who have attended national school, with effect from 1 August 2000.</P>
    <P>Ophthalmic services are also being examined and improvements will ensue, with funding totalling £3 million having been provided this year for the implementation of improved services.</P>
    <P>The maternity and infant care scheme provides for pre-natal and post-natal care, free of charge for all women regardless of means, and for their babies up to six weeks of age. The report of the maternity and infant care scheme review group advised that a system of combined care, i.e. where the expectant mother is under the care of both her general practitioner and hospital obstetrician, is the best and most convenient form of ante-<Col N="1715" /> natal care for the majority of mothers. The report contains 109 recommendations, including a revised schedule of visits for mother and baby.</P>
    <P>The national cervical screening programme is another scheme dealing with preventative medicine which is under way. These new developments represent progress, but they have not been highlighted by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Child health is another area that is receiving attention from the Department. The report, Best Health for Children, published in the latter half of 1999, is a review of child health services undertaken by the chief executive officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>Further improvements have been made in immunisation programmes. The unsatisfactory uptake of childhood immunisation is a matter of concern and my Department is working with the health boards to develop strategies to maximise the uptake. Boards have been asked to make every effort to devise strategies tailored to local needs, employing innovative approaches, if considered necessary, in order to achieve significant improvements in uptake. If a 95% uptake can be achieved, the eradication of a range of serious diseases will be achievable.</P>
    <P>In relation to MMR immunisation, which is of particular concern, the office for health gain has recently developed a new campaign to heighten public awareness about this issue, and this was launched on 20 June. New vaccines are coming on stream to protect against group C meningococcal disease and we hope to have them by September.</P>
    <P>Despite what has been said by a number of Senators, much progress has been made since the Government took office. We are not saying that everything is hunky dory; naturally there are problems. No service is perfect but we are examining the matter in a pragmatic, phased and rational manner. We are not throwing money at the problem for the sake of doing so. We have a plan and are working with health boards and the voluntary sector to achieve results. Appropriate health care provided by professionals in proper settings is the cornerstone of an effective health care system. The Government is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service that is capable of responding fully, quickly and effectively to the health service needs of the people. We are proud of our record since taking office of delivering on our commitments in the health area. Much has been achieved and important developments have commenced under the Government. We also recognise that there are problems with the health services and we do not wish to understate these, as I said. However, we do not wish to exaggerate their magnitude as this only serves to undermine the confidence the public has in the services.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to all the advertisements in the newspapers for personnel at present. However, this is the time of year that health boards advertise for staff and they are having difficulties in some areas. However, that is not unex<Col N="1716" /> pected. The Senator also mentioned the obstetrician and gynaecology services where there is only one gynaecologist. Progress has a price and there is a price that people will pay. People expect better services but, in the long term, they may only be provided in bigger units. This aspect must be considered; people must be given what they request.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the opportunities the resources now available provide are fully realised and that real and lasting improvements are delivered. The challenge facing everybody working in the health sector is to ensure that the public gets the maximum benefit for their resources and that the delivery of a quality health service to all who need it is achieved. This should be achieved in the short term rather than in the long term. This is the only Government that will ever deliver on the health services. Our track record speaks for itself in spite of the comments of the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, in relation to his tenure of office. The situation left much to be desired when we entered office.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the comprehensive nature of the Minister of State's speech but I was reminded during it of an article I read recently in one of the daily newspapers by Terry Prone, the well-known communications specialist. In it she mentioned a trap into which every Government falls. This trap appears mid-term when a Government starts to get defensive, outlines what it is doing and where money is being spent and wonders why people are not more grateful.</P>
      <P>This Government is not the first to fall into that trap, which Ms Prone likened to a person going to a hotel, paying for a room and being expected to be grateful that there are sheets on the bed. The Minister of State's contribution reminded me of that, particularly when he said that the maternity and infant care scheme provides pre-natal and post-natal care free of charge to all women regardless of means and their babies up to the age of six weeks. It should do so, and much more besides. This is a basic matter and nothing about which the Minister of State should crow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public knows that, given the current state of the economy and the resources available, the Government's performance with regard to health issues is not good enough. I support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party which refers to a <Col N="1717" /> number of issues of obvious concern to the public. There is a failure to deliver on the provision of essential health services because they are in crisis. I agree with other speakers that it is not a case of throwing money at the services, although funds properly spent would help. It is a question of tackling fundamental problems in the health services of which we have been aware for some time.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to some of these problems, but particularly the fact that, due to the neglect of the Minister's predecessor, the services are lurching from crisis to crisis in terms of the shortage of nurses, junior doctors, waiting lists, etc. There is almost a state of emergency with regard to the provision of junior doctors. Everybody is aware of this fact and that the gap in terms of services for public and private patients is widening daily. In spite of the Government's laudable remarks about equality and delivery of services, it is not happening. I cannot deal with the fundamental problems in the health services and suggest an alternative in the short time available to me.</P>

      <P>It has been deliberately misrepresented. As I pointed out in my local media, the Senator's colleagues in the other House have deliberately misrepresented our policy document because they know it is correct and they are afraid of it. The issue is live and people are very angry about what is happening in the health service. People know because they see it happening. For example, this week I received a report from Nenagh General Hospital that there are people on trolleys in corridors at this time of the year.</P>
      <P>When the Labour Party's spokesperson on Health, Deputy McManus, visited Nenagh General Hospital recently, she made the point, which was supported by the hospital administration and senior staff, that small hospitals such as Nenagh General Hospital should be allowed to diversify. The Minister of State mentioned certain services only being available in large hospitals and I disagree with him in that regard. There is huge potential for small hospitals to develop specialties, for example, in surgical procedures. This would give increased value for money in terms of the services delivered by hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, one cannot get an appointment in Nenagh General Hospital with a physiotherapist because there is only one physiotherapist instead of three. This is an example of the current staffing <Col N="1718" /> crisis and public patients are suffering as a result. This is only one example of what is happening around the country and what is making the public angry. If one asks why the Government cannot do better, there is no answer. The Government's actions are similar to shifting the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i> It is lurching from one crisis to another. I do not question the Minister of State's commitment but I question the Government's ability to introduce the fundamental changes necessary to generate a health service that, as he said, would be of benefit to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for sharing her time. The Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children are decent, well motivated people. However, if it takes the Department of Health and Children as long to deliver the health services as it took the Minister of State to deliver his speech, we will be waiting a considerable amount of time. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges should consider the need to exclude the time given to the Minister's contribution from the calculation of Members' time. The Minister of State had many important things to say, and we welcome them being said in the House. It was a carefully thought out speech, but it should not have taken up a third of the time allocated to a debate to which many Members wish to contribute.</P>
      <P>The provision of a decent health service is one of the critical criteria by which a decent society is judged. The late Noel Browne took on a difficult situation and got money, and money is important. It is not an instant solution but the problems facing us today relate to the training of doctors and nurses and getting people into the system. There are plans and equipment but we do not have the personnel and this is a significant problem.</P>
      <P>The points system also needs to be considered. My information from friends who are nurses is that, to a certain extent, we do not always get the right people. They are not properly motivated and they do not consider it a vocation. It is a vocation as are politics and teaching. I was involved in two of those; I have not yet become a nurse but if the situation becomes critical, I will volunteer. We need to attract people and we need to train them properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I will vote with this side of the House is that the amendment is too strident and shrill. How could I vote in favour of paragraph 3 of that amendment which seems to suggest there is nothing wrong with the accident and emergency services? Within the past week there was a sad piece in the newspapers about an elderly woman who was a resident of what I knew as the governesses' home in Harcourt Street. She was 80 years old and still fairly mobile. She was on a bus which stopped suddenly and was thrown forward. When brought to hospital she was left waiting for eight or nine hours. She was not too seriously injured but the shock caused a drop in her blood pressure. She should have survived if she had been given treatment immediately. <Col N="1719" /> However, the queues meant she was placed in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I am not a coroner so I cannot say she died as a result of it, but that story tells us something. If an elderly person of 80 years old is placed in that situation, there is something wrong. The accident and emergency service is not good. It is not the fault of any one party or Government but we must honestly address these issues because they affect our citizens. This was a reticent private family, yet her two daughters released this story to the newspapers because they did not want it to happen to anyone else's mother and they were right.</P>
    <P>We know how barbarously junior doctors have been treated and how outrageous it is to think they can wait ten years to be given humane conditions. We would not allow lorry drivers to work the hours these doctors do because of public safety. I am not pointing the finger at any particular Government because they have all been the same.</P>
    <P>The dental system is daft. A person can offset cosmetic dentistry against income tax but if he or she has a gumboil or an abscess, he or she must pay for it. That is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to hear about women's health. However, we must also hear something about men's health. We must hear about testicular cancer and men should be shown or told, if they are too thick to know it themselves, how to examine themselves. We should also look at prostate cancer. These are killer diseases.</P>
    <P>I regret voting against the Government, although I hope it happens twice because it will shoot up my voting average, but I must do so because of the seriousness of the issue. However, I will not do so to score points against the Government. If the other parties were in Government and they were making the same case, I would vote against them too.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, although both it and the motion are before the wrong body. We should remember that the health boards were set up as statutory bodies to look after people's health. It is only the Minister's job to provide the money to do so. Some years ago we said our services were a shambles because enough money was not provided. We now have more money than we can spend but we do not have sufficient personnel. The Medical Council has a case to answer in this regard because it stopped non-EU doctors from coming into the country, claiming they were not competent, they could not speak fluent English and were unable to take proper instructions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> Few Members of the House did not have queues of mothers outside their doors seven or eight years ago trying to get their children into nursing. However, we set the standards so high they could not get into nurse training because they did not have the points. Those people trained in England and when they came back here they got top jobs because they were highly proficient. Did they not have the ability to become proficient before they went to England? Why did they have to go to England to train? </P>
    <P>The medical profession is a locked shop. We have heard the gap is widening between private and public health care. Do we realise the same doctors and consultants are dealing with private and public health care? Senator Henry said that soon no one will be working in one unit. I was for 20 years a member of a health board which closed many small hospitals because consultants could not get a full backup service. However, when the VHI was set up, nursing homes were closed and private hospitals were established. Where is the backup service in a private hospital and who is working in them? The consultants from the public hospitals are doing so. The Minister must tell consultants to stay in the public service and serve the public if they work there and that anyone who goes into the private service should not have the cushion of the public service. Council engineers are not allowed to have private and public practices. Why should consultants do it? We must carry out a root and branch examination of this area.</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was a big waiting list in the Southern Health Board area for hip operations. Deputy Allen was chairman of the board at that time and he sent busloads of people to England and Northern Ireland for them. The Medical Council said they would not be treated properly and that they would not get a good service. Since I did not hear those who came back complaining, the service and the hip replacements must have been good. As a result, hips were fitted at a rate of three or four a day in all the hospitals throughout the country because they knew they would lose business to England. I compliment the Minister on making money available to send patients out of the country and to pay for their operations. That is the only way we will break the monopoly of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I defend the accident and emergency service. Many people complain about it but I have availed of it twice in the past five or six years. I was in the accident and emergency department of the Mater Hospital where everyone received great treatment. I lay on a trolley for a number of hours but I got as good a service as I received in a private ward afterwards. I defend the nurses and doctors. People shout about being left waiting for seven or eight hours, but they get full treatment. Many people who came into the Mater Hospital had drink and drug related problems and the Garda had to be called a few times to move them. They should not be allowed to block up accident and emergency departments. It is time we stopped <Col N="1721" /> people from using accident and emergency services who do not need to use them. People lying on trolleys are well cared for. I am speaking from experience, not on the basis of dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Meara said everyone is entitled to a basic health service, particularly an accident and emergency service. However, the public has a duty to be responsible. A survey was done for one of the national newspapers today which shows that the majority of patients attending Beaumont Hospital during a three week period could have been treated adequately by their GP or nurse practitioner. Out of 676 patients examined, it was discovered that only 137 needed to be at a high technology facility such as Beaumont Hospital. What do the public perceive accident and emergency departments to be? </P>
      <P>I do not generally believe what is written in newspapers, but I know from personal experience of working in one of the busiest children's hospitals in the country that parents bring their children to an accident and emergency department on a Sunday afternoon to sit for approximately four or five hours with a problem which the child has had for two, three or four days. One does not need to be a genius to realise that is not an emergency. There is a responsibility on the public to use accident and emergency departments for accidents and emergencies. We talk about the health service being delivered from a central level and that is something that the people on the ground can examine.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, referred to some of the preventative measures that can be taken. Vaccinations are available free of charge to parents for the benefit of their children. Senator O'Meara talked about the health service being for the benefit of everyone. The MMR vaccination is available free of charge to parents. All they need do is go to their clinic or their general practitioners, yet only 75% of parents are doing that. Children are being neglected to a certain extent despite the fact that the service is available free of charge. Whose responsibility is it to vaccinate children? It is the parents' responsibility. The service is there, let them use it. We are talking about preventative measures and that is one basic preventative measure that parents can take.</P>
      <P>We debated the health services two weeks ago and the question of centralisation. The services were decentralised when the health boards got control and we are now blaming the Minister for everything. What did we put managers into the health boards to do? They are supposed to be managing the services and preparing for the development of the services within each region, yet they abdicate their responsibilities. I am sure every Member will agree with me that there are more facilitators, co-ordinators, programme managers and area managers than we need. There are so many titles, the list goes to the end of the page. What do these people actually do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1722" /> Perhaps we have too great a hierarchy in administration in the health service at all levels, not only in hospitals. I am well aware of the hierarchy in hospitals having spent ten years in that sector. I have experience as a public representative and of dealing with the health boards, but most of the time I cannot explain the titles and they change so often I do not know the actual responsibilities. If we had more analysis of the responsibility of some of the personnel in the administration of the health boards we could put the actual resources where they are needed &ndash; towards the basic care that people deserve.</P>
    <P>Some of the Senators opposite had the decency to acknowledge that increased resources have been made available. I welcome all the measures that have been taken. Two weeks ago we talked about the nursing shortages. Nurses were treated so badly years ago they left the system, or they did not get into it, and I would not blame them for doing that with the treatment they got at the time but the Minister and the Minister of State have taken measures which I hope will encourage more people to enter into that field.</P>
    <P>We recognise that there will never be enough money in the health service. Part of the reason for that is the advancements that are taking place not only in technology but also in medical and surgical procedures. Every day new advancements are made in these areas. Only last week enormous advances were made in the field of genetics. That will take from our resources in the medical field. We need to examine the hierarchy within the health boards and the jobs some of those people do.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. I will be very brief because I realise we have gone over the time.</P>
      <P>I am delighted this motion is before the House this evening. The reason for it is the frustration felt by public representatives, particularly on this side of the House, with our health services. Senator Henry pointed out the state of the health services throughout the country and she highlighted the inadequacy of some of those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the national surplus is £2.4 billion, more money should be put into our health services. Along with Senators from all sides of the House, I have been plagued by representations from people complaining about the health services over the past number of years. I understand the reason some of the Senators on the Government side got excited this evening about this motion. They are getting the same representations as those of us on this side. While I acknowledge that increased funding has been put into the health services over the past number of years, it is still not adequate. With the increasing population and the increasing needs in our health <Col N="1723" /> services, more funding is needed. Senator Quill pointed out that we should not throw money at the health services for the sake of it. No matter what changes are brought about, extra funding is still required.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister of State about the cancer research forum group which issued a report recently on cancer facilities throughout the regions. Will he furnish that report to the Members of the Seanad and the Dáil since it recommends the closure of the breast cancer unit at Mayo general hospital? As has been pointed out by Senator Jackman, the incidence of cancer throughout the regions has increased. In 1996 the figure was 20,000 but in 1997 it increased to nearly 22,000, something which was pointed out by other Senators this evening. I ask the Minister of State to convey a strong message to the Minister that the closure of the breast cancer unit at Mayo general hospital will not be tolerated. It needs to develop along with other units throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I realise there are time constraints. I have a lot more to say on this subject but I will have to continue on another day.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who supported me. Indeed I detected support from the other side of the House, despite the fact that the Minister of State has been extremely defensive in the way he addressed the motion, aside from the 28 page &ldquo;research document&rdquo; which I will keep and with which I will benchmark progress by the Government.</P>
      <P>I detected an honesty from Senator Quill, which is typical of the Senator, in that she acknowledged that she is happy with what the Minister, Deputy Martin, has been doing recently but she also talked about the actual management of the services and the hierarchy of services, as did Senator Leonard. Senator Henry and Senator Fitzpatrick are practitioners and they acknowledged that there were problems.</P>
      <P>What disappointed me was the defensive nature of the attack. The by-election did not teach the Government much at all. This is a real issue which involves real people and I detected in the 28 pages of the Minister of State's script, being an English teacher, that everything was very much in the future tense. That is fine. The Minister, Deputy Martin, has only been a short time in his job but we can go back to the years when the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, was in office. Reference was made to Deputy Michael Noonan's term as Minister. Two and a half years is a short time &ndash; and I am not making any claims with regard to what the rainbow coalition did in Government &ndash; and we were not talking about a bonanza with a financial give-away at that time in comparison to the figures to which Senator Burke referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed by the defensiveness with which our motion was treated. There is a problem with the accident and emergency service. We are not making it up. One can see that <Col N="1724" /> any night of the week in the Limerick Regional Hospital and hear from the people about the length of time they have been waiting. It is not a case of going in with a cut finger or another problem that the GP could treat. People are very aware of what is happening now. We are talking about accidents and the two cases in which the unfortunate individuals died. This is the human aspect of the Department of Health and Children and we cannot walk away from it.</P>
    <P>If there is one issue I feel very strongly about, which was referred to by the Minister of State, it is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and child and adult psychiatry. I accept that I should refer to mental health services rather than psychiatric services and I am glad I was corrected on that.</P>
    <P>There are at least seven or eight cases of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder currently before the High Court who have nowhere to go but to the High Court to seek access to basic health services. Such services are closely linked to educational services, which they are not getting. Their parents have sought redress for them in the High Court because the health services have let them down.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick and I are members of the Committee on Health and Children. At a meeting of that committee ADHD, of which the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, had not heard, was discussed. A report, which highlighted the difficulties experienced by children with that disorder, was obtained at a cost £5,000 and a prevalent study is now being undertaken in this area. I am talking about children with real problems.</P>
    <P>If we criticise management personnel in the health boards, it must be remembered the Minister is the final arbiter in this area. If there is a problem in the eight health boards, it is up to him to approach management personnel in a gung ho fashion and tell them they are not managing the funds in an appropriate manner.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard referred to glossy titles for various administrative personnel, but are they doing anything to improve the delivery of our health services? I do not blame the health board for problems in the delivery of our health services. I blame the Minister for not approaching the health boards, pointing out the problems and asking them how the money allocated to them is being spent. I am shocked, horrified and disappointed about that.</P>
    <P>I would like a future Private Members' motion to deal with problems in the delivery of cancer treatment services. I accept some cancers are fatal for men are well as women. We are not addressing the lack of delivery of such services.</P>
    <P>I would have been far happier if the Government amendment reflected the honesty displayed by Senators across the floor of the House who said it did not represent how they felt about this issue. It is a shame it is so vague and aspirational. I am disappointed this motion does not have the full support of the House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Higher Education Grants.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the case of a man who approached me some time ago with a problem. I hoped I might be able to do something. This Minister is a humane and decent person who is prepared to be flexible. Previously, I dealt with an analogous case of a blind student who was accepted to do a PhD in Trinity College. He secured a grant but the blind pension was subtracted from the grant &ndash; it might have been the other way around &ndash; which made it impossible for the unfortunate person to take up the opportunity offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case before the House tonight involves a gifted student. I have a copy of his work with me. It is a beautiful production, part of the thesis he wrote for his diploma in fine art called &ldquo;Social Interaction Among The Ascendancy And Its Influence In The Development Of Their Estates <Col N="1727" /> In Eighteenth Century Ireland With Special Reference To Newberry Hall And Carton House Demesnes In County Kildare&rdquo;. It is a wonderfully illustrated and literate production, the facts well marshalled. That is surprising in a sense when one considers that although he is intellectually gifted, this man suffers from dyslexia. It is a serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>He also has a problem with a personal situation which I will outline as delicately as possible. He contracted a marriage with a member of the well known building family, the Gallaghers. He found himself enmeshed in the difficult financial problems surrounding the collapse of Mr. Pat Gallagher's business interests and his personal financial circumstances were greatly complicated. Nevertheless, he continued his studies in Trinity College and he is now anxious to do a PhD. In order to do that, however, he had to take out further loans.</P>
    <P>He was already embarrassed by the difficulties in his personal circumstances. He took out a loan from the Ulster Bank which was guaranteed by his elderly parents. There has been considerable pressure in this regard and there is severe correspondence from the bank. At one stage it indicated that it proposed to call in the parents' guarantees. This is a nasty way for a bank to behave, particularly in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>As a result of this pressure the person's entire life is in difficulty. It also causes difficulty for me because I had hoped to receive a detailed briefing from him. I had requested that he send me bullet points for the debate, although I believe I have covered most of them anyway. However, due to his circumstances, contacting him has become problematic. He usually calls fairly regularly to see what is happening and he suggested it would be a good idea to raise this matter on the Adjournment. He has been out of contact, I am sure through no fault of his own, and I have not got the bullet points. His mobile telephone is ringing out. I have presented the case as well as I can but I feel a little bit like a barrister who does not get the final briefing from the desperate client or the full instructions from the solicitor. This person is surrounded by complex difficulties which are manifested dramatically by my inability to get hold of him. My secretary has been trying all week to get hold of him. I tried Trinity all day and the man in charge of fine arts is off on a sabbatical and does not want to hear anything about troublesome issues such as students. The Department is marking exams and I could get hold of no one throughout the day to get further information on the case.</P>
    <P>This is the case of a gifted person, a mature student, someone who suffers from dyslexia and who has had family difficulties. Despite the financial difficulties surrounding his life, he has managed to produce good work and wishes to go on doing so, although I am sure there may be difficulties. I am not suggesting all the problem lies at the feet of the granting authority. However, in <Col N="1728" /> these special circumstances, perhaps some flexibility, some human approach, some contact initiated by the authorities to this person, would mean the talent of someone who could contribute a great deal to our understanding of the cultural history of this country, in particular eighteenth century architecture and the surrounding social phenomenon, would not be lost. If we could throw a lifeline to a man of these years in this situation, who has been brave, is a very charming and decent man who now finds himself on his own &ndash; as far as I recall his marriage has run into difficulties &ndash; and indicate that discussion and negotiation could be part of the scene, we would have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>We might also send a little rebuke to the banks. I conclude by relaying a story which was told to me by someone the day before yesterday. This relates to someone whose daughter wanted to buy a motor car. Despite the fact that she has a reasonably good income, she was £750 short of the price of the motor car. She was a bit upset and her father rang the bank and said, &ldquo;If you can write off £1 million for a former Taoiseach, the least you can do is give £750 to my daughter who will pay it back.&rdquo;  She obtained the money within an hour. Perhaps that is a little lesson for banks. I think it is a particularly malignant practice to try to call in guarantees of elderly parents. In fact, elderly parents should be warned against signing these guarantees if they can avoid it. Therefore, I hope the Minister can do something in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on doing such an excellent job without having any of the facts. Fortunately, I was able to obtain some of the facts from the limited information he gave me. I congratulate him on the work he was doing for another constituent in relation to the banks and advise him that that is the story of my life, which I had better not go into. There is no doubt this type of thing occurs often. People are often in a very weak position and, consequently, if they are given some advice and help, it is surprising how one can find a better balance. That is not entirely unusual and perhaps it is part of the work on the ground, so to speak.</P>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. The scheme, which is administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my department, offers means tested financial assistance to eligible students attending approved third level courses. An approved course for the purpose of the higher education grants scheme means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution. I assure the Senator that Trinity is an approved institution. That relates to the point made about the possibility of doing postgraduate work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the candidate to whom <Col N="1729" /> Senator Norris refers pursued the diploma in history of European painting at Trinity College in the academic year 1999-2000. This is a one year part-time undergraduate course and as such is not approved for the purposes of the higher education maintenance grant scheme. Unfortunately, it must be a minimum two year full-time course.</P>
    <P>I also understand from Kildare County Council that the student in question applied for a maintenance grant under the terms of the 1000 higher education grant scheme in respect of this course. His application for grant assistance was turned down by the county council on 29 October 1999 on the basis that he was pursuing a part-time course and, as such, he did not qualify under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Any consideration of the possible extension of the scope of the third level student support schemes to students pursuing part-time courses must have regard to the availability of financial resources and to the competing needs in the education sector. Priority must be given to areas of greatest need. In this context, the profile of part-time students was considered in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education published in 1995. This report found that almost 90% of part-time students were in employment. These are the facts in the report.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. I recently announced increases of 5% in the rate of maintenance grant to apply for the 2000-01 academic year. I also announced an increase of 5%, both in the qualifying income limits for grant purposes and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased where two or more children are in further or third level education.</P>
    <P>Within the overall resource constraints, the need to target resources at those most in need is well recognised and underpins the Government's approach to tackling disadvantage. There is provision within the national development plan for a third level access fund totalling £95 million over the period of the plan. Building on the existing arrangements, the development of third level access is necessary to promote the participation of students with disabilities, students from disadvantaged backgrounds and mature &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; students. The objective of this measure is to facilitate and improve access to the labour market for the beneficiaries, while improving their long-term employability through enhancing their educational qualifications. Considerations are ongoing on the allocation for initiatives under this fund and I am not yet in a position to convey details about the measures to be taken. I hope soon to be in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1730" /> It is the right approach to target available resources at those most in need. I am also committed to ensuring that all measures operated by my Department are applied objectively and in accordance with the terms and conditions in force. In the specific case raised by Senator Norris, I regret that the student in question did not qualify for a grant under the relevant scheme of support and, consequently, the local authority was correct in its decision. However, I appreciate the point made by the Senator which must be given attention. I am considering the situation of part-time students because I believe it is an area which needs attention. Many people are trying to work and advance their education. A substantial number of young people argue that they are paying taxes and supporting their brothers and sisters who are full-time students. I am also examining the question of mature students.</P>
    <P>I regret that I am not in a position to help the student of whom Senator Norris has spoken but I thank him for raising this matter. I hope to keep cases such as this in mind when developing policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed and humane reply which is more or less what I expected. I encourage him to look at the question of part-time students. In this case the term part-time conceals much, such as the facts of his dyslexia and his overhanging debt. This man is really working full-time on his studies. I welcome what the Minister has said about part-time and mature students.</P>
      <P>Perhaps part-time students who are working and earning a substantial amount of money might be treated in a different category from those who are part-time but are earning little or nothing or suffering from an overhanging debt. I am grateful to the Minister for his humane treatment of the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to the House. I compliment him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on their interest in and commitment to the decentralisation process. If their plans to decentralise 10,000 Civil Service posts to various parts of Ireland is successful they will have done a great service, not only to the country, but to the public service. There is much merit in and much to be gained by public servants working in rural Ireland, particularly given the issues that face most capital cities in Europe. Dublin is growing at a rapid rate with all the attendent transport and environmental problems. It behoves Government and policy makers to ensure, as far as possible, that we have balanced development across Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many good reasons why public servants should participate in this programme, <Col N="1731" /> particularly the access to housing accommodation. In Dublin today one must pay a six figure sum to acquire a house and prices will continue to increase. Good quality three and four bedroomed houses in New Ross can be bought for between £75,000 and £100,000. Some of them overlook a river and have excellent views. There are large areas in the area's development plan for the area designated for residential use and easily serviceable. The whole process is very attractive to people. There is a lot of merit in the policies being pursued.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State will know coming from a neighbouring area &ndash; I often tell him that he is my nearest TD &ndash; that there is a good road network from New Ross to the major centres of the south east, such as Waterford, Kilkenny and Wexford. These areas have much to offer shoppers and tourists. New Ross is well situated in the centre of the south east. We often promote New Ross, sometimes to the chagrin of Waterford people, as being equidistant from Dublin, Cork and Limerick. The town is well positioned and it should be an extremely attractive location for the decentralisation process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has taken a keen interest in this policy. I must also congratulate him on taking a particular interest in areas in the south east that he feels are suitable for decentralisation and are attractive locations for selection. I hope and believe that New Ross will be on his list of areas that qualify and meet all the criteria.</P>
    <P>I am sure he is aware that New Ross Urban District Council has been to the forefront in promoting and attracting decentralisation to the town. The council, through the good offices of the Minister, is looking at other locations for public service facilities such as a Garda station and new civic offices. I like to think that we will have a campus that will be an attractive location and suitable for the decentralisation purposes. A number of eminently suitable sites have been identified and some of them are owned by the local authority. New Ross is very well placed to avail of and accelerate its own objectives, particularly new civic offices, and to meet the demands that will be placed upon us by a decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>New Ross is well placed from an educational point of view. Access to educational facilities will be one of the main priorities of people trying to decide whether to move from Dublin. Waterford Institute of Technology is one of Ireland's best institutes and it is only a 20 minute drive from New Ross. Many people feel it is of university standard. The college has a business section which is extremely well regarded. Many people in the business sector, banking and elsewhere, would rate it as having a higher standard than some of the universities. It produces some of the <Col N="1732" /> best graduates from our commerce, finance and economic colleges.</P>
    <P>Also in favour of the selection of New Ross is that its second level educational facilities are second to none. We have five extremely good second level educational facilities which cater for boys and girls. They rank among the best in the country. New Ross ranks highly in the educational, sociological and sporting fields. A year ago Good Counsel College became All-Ireland senior football champions. Many graduates from these schools went on to be extremely successful in Irish business life. For example, Pat O'Neill is a former chief executive of Avonmore, Dermot Desmond who is very successful in the financial services sector and Maurice Keane is involved in the Bank of Ireland. Michael Casey is deputy director at the Central Bank. He came from New Ross and he was educated at the CBS. There is quite an array of people that I could mention.</P>
    <P>New Ross has educational facilities that have a proven track record. They should be attractive to anyone coming to the area. People should consider them to be good enough for their children. They will help their children to achieve academic and business success in the future.</P>
    <P>The environment is very important to people considering relocation. Those of us who reside in the Barrow valley, who traverse the Suir, Nore or Barrow rivers to Inistiogue, the Passage or St. Mullens will agree that the area has a lot to offer. We also have various heritage centres. It takes less than half an hour to drive from New Ross to Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford. Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay and Rosslare are only a short distance away. These locations are among the best seaside resorts in Ireland. We are fortunate that they are located in the south east. We also have the John F. Kennedy Park and Hook Lighthouse. The Minister of State was instrumental in championing additional funds for the Dunbrody project. We also have the Waterford Heritage Centre. Within a 15 mile radius of New Ross there are 15 excellent beaches. If someone spends a fortnight on holiday in New Ross they can go to a different beach every day, weather permitting. The town has a lot to offer.</P>
    <P>From a cultural point of view, I cannot say much about the Wexford hurling team because of what happened recently &ndash; that makes two of us, Minister. However, New Ross has one of the best musical societies in the country. The AIMS choral festival is held in the town every year. The area is rich in heritage, culture and the environment. I recommend New Ross for the decentralisation programme.</P>
    <P>Over the years New Ross has been somewhat disadvantaged economically, despite the fact that it is in the south east. County Wexford is generally considered to be well off, but New Ross's economic performance has not been that good for historical reasons. There have always been tradit<Col N="1733" /> ional industries in the area. We have had job losses recently in a number of industries. As a consequence, the benefits to the locality from a decentralisation programme would be very significant. In politics and in life, the objective of helping those who help themselves is very important. New Ross has shown a tremendous resilience in practising self-help. Our district hospital closed about ten years and a voluntary group resurrected and revitalised the hospital as a voluntary community hospital.</P>
    <P>We had difficulty in attracting industry. A group of local people joined together and built an advance factory and that will be repeated. There is a desire and a track record locally of ensuring that we play our part. If the Minister can succeed in ensuring that New Ross is designated for decentralisation, he can rest assured that the amenities, facilities and everything else that goes with it will be in place to ensure a successful relocation for the people involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased that Senator Walsh has raised the important and topical issue of decentralisation in the House this evening. I compliment him on the leadership role he has played with the community of New Ross working with all the sectors of the business community, the local councillors and Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Hugh Byrne, who collectively put together a very good package.</P>
      <P>The level of interest in the issue is evidenced by the fact that it is also being discussed on the Adjournment in the Dáil this evening. The House is well aware by now that the Government is committed to a new and extensive programme of decentralisation. In pursuit of this policy, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been engaged in a series of meetings with his Government colleagues, with the intention that he will be in a position to bring proposals before the Government in time for decisions to be taken on the new programme by the end of next month.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming programme starts from a position which Senators may find somewhat surprising. Almost 50% of all civil servants are already located outside of Dublin. Although decentralisation cannot account for all of this, it has played a major part and has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions of the country, including Senator Walsh's, have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation. It is the Government's intention that the forthcoming programme will maintain that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the interest in the forthcoming programme has centred on the locations to which decentralisation will take place. In excess of 90 cities, towns and villages throughout every county have made their respective cases for inclusion in <Col N="1734" /> the new programme. The Government intends to give due consideration to all the submissions received and, when making final decisions, will take a large number of factors into account, such as the development needs of the various centres under consideration, the availability of suitable sites or office premises, transport links, capacity of local infrastructure, principally water, sewerage and telecommunications, population of the centre in relation to the numbers being relocated, proximity to third level education and availability of housing and schools. These have all been ably covered by Senator Walsh in his address this evening.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that until such time as the Government has had the opportunity to consider all the aspects relating to the new programme, it would not be prudent of me to comment on the likelihood of any particular centre featuring in the programme. In view of the level of interest which this initiative has generated and the impact which a new programme will inevitably have, I caution against any expectation that a large-scale relocation of public servants to provincial locations is imminent.</P>
    <P>Members will appreciate that even after decisions have been taken to identify what should move and to where, it will be necessary to decide how this costly programme is to be financed and organised. It will be necessary to secure sites, observe planning procedures, design the buildings, appoint contractors, construct premises &ndash; all before staff can be transferred. I make this cautionary statement, not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on either my part or that of the Government, and I appreciate the kind words of Senator Walsh in the House this evening, but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken, it is likely to be some considerable time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>However, as the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and notwithstanding the current constraints in the construction industry, I assure the Senators that my office will be working closely with the industry to ensure that the programme is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible, once decisions have been taken. In view of the importance of this programme as indicated, I intend to take a personal interest in the programme's efficient delivery. As further evidence of the Government's commitment to the new programme, I repeat the recent assurance given by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the Committee on Finance and Public Service to the effect that the implementation of the programme will be given priority attention within the Department of Finance and that the programme will be pushed out vigorously.</P>
    <P>Proper co-ordination will be ensured between the various Departments which will have a central role in the delivery of the programme, that is, the Departments of Finance and the Envir<Col N="1735" /> onment and Local Government as well as the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the very many worthwhile submissions, including a number from Senator Walsh's county, which I received on the subject of decentralisation. I met recently with the Senator and a deputation from New Ross who presented a very impressive case for inclusion in <Col N="1736" /> the new programme. I assure them all and those who have been making representations and presenting submissions, that they will be taken into account by the Government as part of the consultative process which has been initiated.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 June 2000.</P>
