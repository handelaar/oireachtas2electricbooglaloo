      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide automatic gates and lights at the Iarnród Éireann crossing at Slieve Donamon, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Social Welfare Bill, 2000 &ndash; Second Stage. The contributions of spokespersons will be 30 minutes while other Senators will have 20 minutes. I will not order a sos at 1 o'clock but I suggest that we review progress at that time and if a sos is required, we can decide at that stage.</P>

      <P>In response to the Deputy Leader, I would be happy to review progress at 1 o'clock. I trust that progress will have been made at that stage, but we will wait and see.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a matter with the Deputy Leader and I am sure I will get his consent in this regard. We have had the disturbing news that Ireland has the highest percentage of teenagers who use E. This is a problem that is escalating out of control, not just in urban areas but even in the smallest villages. It is necessary that we congratulate the Garda on their recent successes with drug busts, as they are called, and ensure that the Minister provides extra funding to tackle this problem. The island of saints and scholars now has the highest number of teenagers using this drug, and that matter will have to be addressed. I would welcome a debate on this issue as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> I discovered today, to my amazement, that the price of one of our national newspapers has increased by 10p. We wonder why people are opting to buy what are called the pulp newspapers, but most people in my constituency would not be able to afford to buy a daily newspaper, which would require them to spend £7 per week on newsprint. Has any justification been given for this increase when all newspapers are claiming increased sales? I do not know what is happening in this regard. If we could have some information on it, I would be grateful. That newspaper is not value for money at the price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I am agreeable to the Order of Business. I want to raise two issues with the Deputy Leader of the House which it might be useful to debate very soon. The first is that the nation is threatened with a bus strike, and I congratulate the Government for standing up to these people who are seeking a 20% increase when we have just had an agreement on 5.5%. It would be timely if we had a debate in this House and sent a message to people that these sorts of increases are simply not on in the current economy, especially in a company like CIE.</P>
      <P>The second matter I would like to raise &ndash; this is a serious issue for the economy &ndash; was raised today in <i>The Irish Times</i> and on RTÉ's &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. It concerns what appears to be a small item, which got a larger hearing earlier in the week, that a very good restaurant up the road in Baggot Street is closing. I am not making any special plea but I am making a point. This restaurant is closing because it cannot get staff. That is symptomatic of what is happening in the economy. We now have a job crisis in reverse. Businesses cannot get staff and the economy is beginning to bubble over and explode. One only has to look at a report published earlier this week, which said there are 70,000 unfilled jobs in the economy, to see that the overheating is becoming critical. While we are basking in the glory of economic prosperity, a crisis is looming around the corner. Many other businesses will close down, not because they are not making profits, which is the traditional reason, but because they cannot get workers. I would like the Government to address that serious problem in a debate in the House. Otherwise, the economy will overheat and bubble over and businesses will go bankrupt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asking for weeks for a debate on litter. I am now broadening that request to ask for a day long debate on litter pollution and also waste management and waste disposal. The EPA report published yesterday is quite frightening in regard to the amount of waste the country is generating. One half of the country <Col N="1167" /> will not accept landfill sites while the other half will not accept incineration and the entire country is producing increasing amounts of waste. Very little, if any, reduction or recycling is taking place. We have a real crisis. Senator Ross referred to the labour crisis, but this crisis is even more serious. I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a day long debate on both these issues, with a view to coming up with some solutions. We are going down a cul-de-sac very quickly in this regard. I predict this will have adverse consequences for our tourism, food and agriculture trade unless it is tackled very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a full day debate on waste management and litter. The EPA report, which indicated that recycling is reducing rather than increasing, is shocking. I know this involves the issue of newspaper sales, that the market has fallen out of newspaper recycling and that there are economies of scale involved. However, where economies of scale mean it is not possible to recycle for profit, we should be able to step in and ensure there is a market for recycling. I ask for a debate on this.</P>
      <P>That debate should be extended to include issues such as incineration and gasification. Every local authority has been asked to examine the possibility of installing not a gasification system because we do not know enough about it, but an incineration system. People around the country are worried about dioxides and the hazards of waste ashes. We should not put these matters to bed but should have an open debate. We should have our own expert knowledge on whether these pose a threat to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning an interviewer on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; made a very bland statement to which I take great exception. He said that some politicians steal, too. I take great exception to that scandalous statement. I rang RTÉ to register my protest, which I repeat here. I call on that interviewer to either substantiate his statement or withdraw it and apologise. It is scandalous for any interviewer to make such a bland statement condemning politicians, who are respectable people doing a good job. It is scandalous for the airwaves to be used in such a manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise another issue in this morning's news, which is the rationalisation within Bord na Móna in the midlands, with the proposed closure of several of the peat burning stations there. That would have serious social and economic consequences for that area. I ask the Minister with responsibility for energy to come to the House to discuss this matter, which is very serious for midland counties such as Longford, Roscommon and Offaly. According to the recent Central Statistics Office publication on household and individual income, those counties have the lowest <i>per capita</i> income in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> Naturally, Bord na Móna will say there will be deployment and so on. However, it is not quite that simple. It appears the whole Bord na Móna operation in the midlands will be centralised to two power stations, possibly in County Offaly. That would mean the end of places such as Lanesboro and Bellacorick in County Mayo. That has very serious implications for the distribution of employment and the social and economic problems to which that would give rise. Experience has shown that replacements are not found when State supported industries of that kind disappear.</P>
    <P>I request the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss this matter. Bord na Móna is still a semi-State body and we have responsibility for it. We should have an input into proposed major changes in its policy and operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted there is continuing support for a debate on waste management, which I have been raising for a number of weeks in the House. I hope the Leader will take on board that this is an ongoing problem and that we have been requesting a debate for weeks. As Senator Quill said, we must be proactive and identify solutions. For example, the Government should introduce a policy of using recycled paper for all departmental and political business. That would go a long way towards increasing the market for recycled paper.</P>
      <P>I also support the call by Senator Ross for a debate on the labour crisis. We must look at how we can, with the national training agency, work on a strategy to bring the long-term unemployed into the labour market by giving them the skills they need and, in the interim, identifying short-term solutions to help alleviate the labour shortage over the next six to 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the points made by Senator Quill and others on the need for a discussion on waste management and recycling. The problem, which Senator Ross touched on, is the lack of workers. Will we have the staff to implement any policy we introduce? That fear has been expressed in my council and many other local authorities. That is a very serious problem, irrespective of what policy or management philosophy we introduce. The all day debate should include the issue of staffing. Staff, such as wardens, will be required to implement the programme and impose penalties. That is the big problem. This issue is much broader than just the introduction of a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on community employment schemes? I understand that the huge changes taking place are causing great problems for community groups. In order to set up a community employment scheme in one's <Col N="1169" /> area, one must have a limited company and audited accounts. Huge impediments are being placed in the way of community groups. There have been major difficulties in my county of Galway recently where groups in communities and parishes have been trying to set up community employment schemes. These schemes have been very successful in the past but they now require a company, extra insurance, audited accounts and so on. These groups do not have the resources or finance to do that. This major issue should be cleared up. I would like the Minister to outline to the House the current changes in the community employment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on litter. I supported it when it was raised last week. It is important for local authorities to employ litter wardens because recycling is a very worthy option. While it might not be an economic option, can we afford not to have it? It is important that local authorities employ litter wardens and hit people where it hurts &ndash; in the pocket.</P>
      <P>I echo the words of my colleague, Senator Willie Farrell, asking for a press council. Appropriate legislation should be brought in to set up this press council. It is important that when any organ of the media, especially the printed media, gives an incorrect report about any individual that the response and the correct version should have the same pride of place and the same amount of space as the incorrect one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Senator A Senator">
      <NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Very often, it is quite the reverse. One would need a pair of binoculars and a microscope to find it. It is time there was a press council, as has been called for in this House for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend my support to the point made by Senator Glynn and Senator Farrell. Such unbalanced comments do nothing to serve the democratic process. Politicians should certainly be open to criticism but there is an onus on those who have the privilege of reporting and informing the public to do so in a balanced and responsible way. That is not happening in certain sectors of the media.</P>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on waste management. We asked for this debate two weeks ago. A central part of it should deal with incineration. The use of incineration runs contrary to many of the comments made by Members concerning recycling and minimisation. It was proposed that the south-east should have incineration. The full volume of waste generated in the south-east would only just support an incinerator in terms of viability. Therefore, it would be contrary to a policy of minimisation and recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise with the Leader an issue involving certain undesirable practices by elements within the legal profession. I am not referring to the exorbi<Col N="1170" /> tant fees charged by barristers at tribunals and elsewhere, but the practice which was recently commented upon by the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurances Limited. It has come across solicitors' practices who have been circulating in council housing estates, inducing people to make claims against the local authority. I ask for a debate on this. I understand a Bill has to be enacted to prevent this type of advertising. If one looks up the Yellow Pages one will see similar advertisements in the same vein which do nothing to serve responsible citizenship and responsible, legal professional bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I lend my support to the proposal for a discussion on waste management. It is worthy from a national and educational point of view to discuss the aspects of this topic because there is huge resistance to change. There are strategic plans drawn up countrywide and there is a huge volume of opposition to any positive way of dealing with the problem. It would be worthwhile and welcome to have a debate here with the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>I also support my colleague, Senator Ross, on his call for a discussion on the use of human resources within the State and meeting the needs and challenges of the developing economy. I ask that we invite the Tánaiste. I understand that FÁS has set out a new development plan and proposes to take on extra people and train them for industry. We should examine the existing human resources within the State in trying to strengthen the economy and not create difficulties in the near future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to another piece of rubbish not concerning waste management but computer games. The House will be aware that I raised this issue on numerous occasions in the past and I am pleased to note reports in this morning's media that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, has brought this important issue into the mainstream. At this point all I ask the Leader is to consider having a debate in the context of the damage that such games do to children. Perhaps it might be instructive to have the Minister of State to the House to respond to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that 97% of computer games are inoffensive and entertaining and I have no wish to restrict their sale in any way but there is a hardcore 3% of games. The industry regulates itself and there is no other means of ensuring that parents are aware whether a game their child is getting over the counter promotes destructive values. I will not dwell on the point and I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to speak on it. I re-emphasise the danger this presents to young minds. It is free and unrestric<Col N="1171" /> ted and parents generally have little knowledge of the content of these games. I have been one of those parents which is how I know about it. I ask again if in the context of the Minister of State's comments and the wider issues it might be instructive to have a debate on it in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach and I look forward to the participation in debates of all the Senators who asked for them when they come before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ridge raised the important issue of drug abuse among young people and particularly the figure concerning the use of ecstasy. I join in her congratulations to the Garda who have made some very significant seizures. I condemn what took place in Cork the other day where there was violence on the street and where people were injured as a result of drug trafficking. The chief superintendent of the area in which I live has confirmed that this issue affects small towns and villages countrywide, not just the major cities. It is an important issue and we should try to have a debate on it as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding requests for debates, the Social Welfare Bill is before us today and the Minimum Wage Bill will be before us next week if it passes through the Dáil. There is a constitutional imperative to have those two items of legislation concluded before 1 April and they take precedence over everything else. However, there are pressing issues which should be debated at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have no control over the cost of newspapers but I wonder why, in such a buoyant economy where advertising revenue is so high, it is required to raise the cover price of newspapers in addition to the obviously significant amounts of money flowing into them <Col N="1172" /> through advertising revenue. The other matter arising from this is whether the Internet will take over as the source of information rather than the daily newspaper but that is something which we could also consider during a debate.</P>
    <P>The matter of the bus strike was raised by Senator Ross. I congratulate him on his second successive day as leader of the Independent group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, is the Deputy Leader of the House out of order on that remark? Perhaps the Cathaoirleach would give a ruling on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite in order to refer to the presence of a Senator in the House. It is not in order to refer to the absence of a Senator from the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear. I thank the Cathaoirleach.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally if the Cathaoirleach ruled this matter out of order I would immediately apologise to the Senator. The bus strike is an important issue and if it goes ahead it will have a serious effect. I heard this morning that there was a potential loss of £14 million to the traders in Dublin as a result of a two-day bus strike which is of serious concern. The Government believes that any solution will have to be based on genuine productivity and restructuring measures and that additional Exchequer subvention will not be made available to finance any cost increasing pay claim.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness I congratulate Senator O'Toole on having the INTO vote carried. We have to abide by the procedures which are well tried and established. It is important to maintain the consensus on social partnership that has helped to create the prosperity we now enjoy. In that way we will continue to enjoy the fruits that stem from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the restaurant, it seems that listening to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; pays off because pretty well everything that comes up on the Order of Business has featured on that radio programme. I heard the proprietor of the restaurant explaining why it was necessary to close down. <Col N="1173" /> The Tánaiste has made the point that we will require 100,000 people to fulfil the labour shortage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of delivering on the national development plan, there is obvious concern that the main constraint on our economic development is a labour shortage. However, the Minimum Wage Bill will hopefully be before the House next week and these issues can be discussed appropriately on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Senators Quill, Coogan, Cox, Ormonde, Walsh and Chambers mentioned litter and the wider aspect of waste disposal, including incineration. I have said previously that we should discuss these issues. It should be a one day debate taking into account the wide-ranging aspects that have been raised today. I will endeavour to ensure this matter is discussed in the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell made a point about &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and I also found the remarks referred to distasteful. However, the level to which we can control what is said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; is questionable, although Senator Glynn is correct in saying that we can discuss a press council, which we have done in the past. There has to be a balance in the capacity of the press to gather facts and disseminate information. The press has done a valuable job in that regard. It is a question of balance and ensuring the right of individuals to protect their good names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor raised the issue of Bord na Móna and the potential loss of jobs due to the closure of power stations in the midlands. I share his concerns about that. The bogs have been an important source of employment in the midlands and have sustained the local economy there for a very long time. On 17 February a tripartite agreement was entered into between the Department of Public Enterprise, ESB management and the ESB group of unions on these matters. As I understand it, the outcome was that there would be an orderly closure of these plants and that two new peat-powered generating stations would be constructed in the midlands. Obviously, a large number of jobs would flow from their construc<Col N="1174" /> tion. As far as I am aware the bogs do not move so the jobs would go to the bogs in question.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the refurbishment of the stations has been overtaken by the discussions which took place and which were circulated to Deputies, although I do not think they were circulated to Senators. I do not think that it right because if they are circulated to Deputies they should also be circulated to Senators. As far as I know, that decision was circulated to Deputies at the end of February.

      <P>I shall certainly endeavour to do that for the Senator and I do not diminish the gravity of the matter he has raised.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh mentioned the community employment scheme which, in a sense, is related to the Minimum Wage Bill. The Tánaiste will be in the House to take that Bill. Matters have changed radically with regard to the employment opportunities that are now available. In that context, I do not find it surprising that the community employment scheme might change. One very irritated person told me recently that they had trained someone very diligently under the community employment scheme, after which they got a job. I thought, however, that was what the scheme was for &ndash; to find jobs for people &ndash; but this particular person did not see it in that context. The Senator can raise these issues when the House debates the Second Stage of the Minimum Wage Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh spoke about the legal profession and the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Assurance Bill. I am not sure when that Bill is due before the House but there are proposals to deal with members of the legal profession trawling for business. It would be totally improper to go around local authority or private housing estates touting for business in this way. It raises the question of the compensation culture.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the damage that video games do to children and that issue would merit consideration. However, we have two Bills which must go through the House before 1 April and they will take priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives effect to the substantial improvements in social welfare rates of payment announced in the budget. It introduces new income support measures for carers, special rate pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance, and a new widowed parent grant. It also provides for exemptions from PRSI for low paid employees, a radical reform of the method of assessing capital for social assistance purposes, and improvements for farmers and people making the transition from welfare to work.</P>
      <P>Before addressing these measures in more detail, it would be useful to review with Senators the context in which I have been improving and modernising the social protection system. Over the past few years, Ireland has experienced extremely rapid economic growth. Our performance has been exceptional by international standards and in terms of our historical experience. In terms of GNP, Ireland has grown by an annual average of almost 8% between 1993 and 1999. This compares favourably with the rest of Europe where average growth rates of 2% per annum were recorded during the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has now fallen to below 5% from a peak of almost 16% in 1993. Our unemployment rate is now below the European average. Annual inflation averaged less than 2% between 1993 and 1999. A number of factors have contributed to Ireland's success over these past few years. First, prudent budgetary policies have been followed by successive Governments. The budget has been brought into surplus, thus reducing our debt-servicing burden and releasing resources previously devoted to interest payments for more economically and socially desirable purposes.</P>
      <P>Second, social partnership agreements have combined moderate wage increases with tax reductions and higher social expenditure. The moderation of wage pressures at a time when the economy was experiencing an increase in growth also enhanced our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Third, a relatively young population, net immigration and the increased participation of women in the labour force ensured that the labour supply was available to meet the demand created by strong economic growth. Fourth, significant investment in education has increased the productive potential of the labour force. In the 1990s we were reaping the full benefit of expenditure on education which began in the 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These factors, combined with low inflation rates and favourable corporation profits tax, have helped to attract a disproportionately large amount of foreign direct investment. This investment, most notably in the pharmaceutical, com<Col N="1176" /> puter and electronics sectors, has contributed significantly to our performance.</P>
    <P>This year will see further growth in output and employment. Although the pace of growth may slow slightly, economic growth in Ireland will be yet again among the highest in the world. It is worth noting that GNP growth is now projected at 6.3% and GDP growth at 7.4% and this year employment is projected to rise by 3.3%, bringing the unemployment rate below 5%. Prudent budgetary policies should result in a budget surplus of around 3% of GDP.</P>
    <P>While prospects remain good for 2000 there are signs of emerging supply-side pressures which, if not addressed, could undermine Ireland's long-term potential output growth. In the labour market there are emerging shortages of skilled and unskilled labour. As a result wage pressures are above those of our main trading partners. The new partnership agreement, Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness, seeks to address these issues through sustainable wage increases and taxation reform.</P>
    <P>While headline inflation has risen in recent months, this increase should prove temporary. A key challenge to secure ongoing growth is to ensure that this temporary increase does not become embedded in the economy. As a result of our rapid growth, infrastructural bottlenecks have become increasingly apparent. Public infrastructure needs to be improved significantly if we are to sustain economic growth. The national development plan sets out how these matters will be addressed over the next six years through an ambitious programme of investment totalling £40.6 billion.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland is currently benefiting from favourable demographic conditions it is estimated that over the next 20 years the number of persons aged over 65 will double. This will put pressure on the public finances at a time when potential growth will be much lower. To prepare for this the Government has decided, starting this year, to set aside 1% of GNP annually to partially pre-fund future pension costs.</P>
    <P>The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness forms a solid basis for further economic prosperity and promoting greater social inclusion over the next three years. It commits us all to creating a fair and inclusive society for everybody. Under the programme all rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards a target of £100 per week for the lower rates of payment. For pensioners the new agreement confirms that the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments given in the review of the Government's action programme. For families, substantial progress will be made towards a target of a monthly child benefit rate of £100 per month for the third and subsequent child.</P>
    <P>These commitments amount to a £1.5 billion investment over the three years in social inclusion <Col N="1177" /> measures. Under Partnership 2000 the commitment to social inclusion measures over and above normal Exchequer funding was £5.2 million and, therefore, over a shorter period &ndash; two years and nine months &ndash; we are committing three times the amount committed under the previous partnership agreement. In addition, the commitment of £5.2 million under the previous partnership agreement was more than doubled when payments over the three years of the programme were included in social inclusion measures. This investment represents a clear demonstration of the Government's priority in ensuring that the fruits of our new found prosperity will be shared equally among all our people.</P>
    <P>The ongoing process of modernising social protection in Ireland is taking place in the context of a European-wide debate on the key issues. After a four year period of consultation, the EU Commission, in its communication last July, identified four broad objectives of a modernisation strategy as follows &ndash; to make work pay and provide secure income, to make pensions safe and pension systems sustainable, to promote social inclusion and to ensure high quality and sustainable health care.</P>
    <P>While each member state will remain responsible for its own social protection measures, a proactive co-operation process of exchanging information and identifying best practice is now envisaged. This new process will be supported by the European Commission by an enhanced report on social protection in Europe to be produced annually.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting an emerging consensus that priority attention should be given by social protection Ministers to the pensions and social inclusion objectives &ndash; the health care objective would be receiving attention from health Ministers and the work objective has already been receiving significant attention under the ongoing European employment strategy.</P>
    <P>The adoption of the two priority objectives regarding pensions and social inclusion for concerted EU examination is appropriate and timely from Ireland's point of view. Pensions will have to be both financially and socially sustainable into the future and the current Social Welfare Bill and particularly the Pensions Bill planned for later this year will aim to underpin such future sustainability here. The Government is also committed to a significant investment over the coming years in measures to promote social inclusion under the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness agreed with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The problems of the socially excluded are many-sided but social welfare Ministers in general and my Department in particular will continue to have a key role in addressing them. Ireland has much to learn and much to offer in this new process of co-operation. Apart from focusing on modernising and improving social <Col N="1178" /> protection systems, we will also have a keen interest in any emerging proposals for special measures in the social inclusion area which can now be initiated by the EU Commission, whose competence in this regard was clarified in the Amsterdam Treaty. Senators will recall the significant influence of the early EU poverty programmes on the innovative approach taken by my Department to community development over the past two decades.</P>
    <P>As Senators will already have considered the Bill in detail, I will focus on a number of its key provisions. Securing the future of older people continues to be a key priority of the Government. Since we took office, we have taken significant steps towards our objective of building an inclusive society. In our recent review of An Action Programme for the Millennium we set priorities in a number of key areas, including the attainment of a minimum rate of £100 to all social welfare old age pensioners by 2002 and to increasing these pensions in line with increases in average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>The Bill delivers on these commitments. It increases all pensions to older people by £7 per week bringing old age contributory and retirement pensions to £96 per week. Last year in the UK old age pensioners only got an increase of 75p; in this country they got an increase of £7. Bringing the pensions up to £96 is well ahead of the commitment we made in An Action Programme for the Millennium, which gave a commitment to raise the pension to £100 by 2002. As we have reached £96 in 2000, we hope to pass the £100 limit next year. We are on target to exceed our original commitment to a rate of £100 per week for those pensions in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The rate of payment to widow/widower's contributory pensions for those aged 66 or over increases to £89.10 with the old age non-contributory pension increasing to £85.50 &ndash; both on target to reach £100 by 2002. These increases represent real increases for pensioners well ahead of the expected rise in average earnings.</P>
    <P>The Government is also committed to substantial increases in other social welfare payments. The personal rates of social welfare payments, other than those for older people and invalidity pensioners, are being increased by £4 per week. This represents an increase of about 5.5% for most payments &ndash; the same level as the wage increase agreed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. A special increase of £5.90 per week is being made in the standard rate of invalidity pension to bring it into line with the new £81.10 rate for widow/widower's contributory pension. This will assist approximately 40,000 people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for special increases in the rate of qualified adult allowances for this year, as part of an overall strategy to increase the allowance to 70% of the main rate over the next three budgets. This Bill represents <Col N="1179" /> the first step in this strategy by providing for a minimum increase of £3.80 in the general qualified adult rate. The qualified adult allowance for old age contributory and retirement pensioners is being increased by £4.70 per week &ndash; giving a total increase for a pensioner couple of £11.70. The rate for old age non-contributory pensioners, where the qualified adult is aged over 66 years is being increased by £7.50, with such couples gaining overall by £14.50 per week. There are also higher increases for those rates currently below 60% of the relevant personal rate. The combination of personal and qualified adult increases mean that couples will receive a minimum weekly increase of £7.80 per week &ndash; an increase of almost 7%. That is a minimum payment. The increases in the weekly payments will take effect from the first week of May next, four weeks earlier than last year. Next year, I intend to bring forward this implementation date to coincide with the start of the tax year in early April 2001.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the importance of child benefit in providing financial support to families and in reducing child poverty. The Bill provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rates, resulting in a full year investment of £106 million extra, which represents an overall increase of 23% in the cost of the scheme. This will bring the total child benefit in the year to approximately £575 million, the largest increase in the history of the State in any one year. Child benefit rates will be increased by £8 per month in respect of the first two children and by £10 per month in respect of the third and subsequent child. This means that a family with three children will receive £141 per month, an increase of £26 this year. It is my intention over the next few years to continue to provide substantial increases in child benefit in line with the commitments in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with a priority focus towards £100 per month to the third and subsequent child.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 34 introduce key reductions relating to PRSI and the health contribution aimed at improving the position of low paid workers, following on the discussions of the new partnership agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Under section 8 employees earning £226 or less per week will be exempt from paying PRSI. Employees earning more than this will continue to pay PRSI on earnings above the PRSI allowance of £100. Over 460,000 employees will gain from 5 April up to £5.67 per week from this additional measure at a cost of £50 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The earnings limit for exempting employees from the 2% health contribution levy is also being increased under section 34 from £217 per week to £280 per week. All employees earning between £217 and £280 per week, and all self-employed people earning between £11,250, the current annual threshold, and £14,560 will benefit by up <Col N="1180" /> to £5.60 per week at a cost of £52.6 million in a full year. In effect, there is an extra sum of £102 million in a full year being put into the pockets of approximately 660,000 employees. This is on top of the increases in wages which have been agreed under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>A table in one of yesterday's newspapers indicated that someone on a minimum basic wage of £170 per week will gain a minimum of £12 per week this year, £11 extra next year and £9 extra in the following nine months. Obviously people on higher wages will gain more. Substantial wage increases are being made available to people and in some cases people will also gain up to £5.60 per week from the changes I have announced in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 and 9 provide for an increase from April next in the earnings ceilings up to which contributions are payable by employers, employees and the self-employed and for a reduction of 0.7% in the employer's rate of social insurance contribution to compensate for the introduction of the new training fund levy later this year.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of measures aimed at improving the incentive to work and alleviating certain unemployment traps. Section 7 increases the weekly income thresholds for family income supplement from May next by £13, which will lead to an increase of approximately £8 per week in the average family income supplement payment. I also intend to increase by way of regulations the minimum payment provided under the scheme from £5 per week to £10 per week.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the tapered qualified adult allowance arrangements, which relate to the treatment of spouse's earnings is being improved and extended to include people on invalidity, old age contributory pension and retirement pension. At present a qualified adult allowance is payable where the qualified adult has earnings or income of less than £60 per week. A reduced allowance is paid where his or her income is between £60 and £105 per week and, in such cases, child dependant increases are payable at 50%. The improvements announced in the budget provide for an upward adjustment of the income range from £70 to £135 per week, improvements in the rate of withdrawal and the full payment, rather than 50%, of child dependant payments until the spouse's earnings exceed £135 per week. Section 20 implements the latter measure. These were issues which were of concern to many people, particularly female spouses who were carrying out extra work and whose husbands' social welfare payments were being docked pound for pound as a result of the extra income into the household. This will be of particular benefit to families where the head of the household is claiming social welfare and the other is engaged in part-time work. A family with two children, where the spouse has earnings of £90 <Col N="1181" /> per week, for instance, will be better off by £38 per week from May next by comparison with the current system.</P>
    <P>I am also taking steps in section 26 to improve the treatment of people on rent supplement who take up part-time or casual work opportunities. Under the existing arrangements, any increases in earnings are currently clawed back in full by way of reduced rent supplement payments. From April next, a £25 income disregard will be introduced to ensure that there is a positive return from work for those who avail of part-time work opportunities. The section also provides for a disregard of additional income arising from participation in training courses, such as a FÁS skills training course, for people in receipt of rent supplement. This measure will take effect from April next and some 2,500 people are expected to benefit.</P>
    <P>The valuable role of carers in our society is irreplaceable. No other Government has been as committed to supporting carers as this Government. We have delivered on a wide range of measures, both in terms of income support and in terms of services provided. This is reflected in the increasing numbers of carers in receipt of carer's allowance, whose numbers are up by 60% from 9,200 when we took office two years ago to more than 14,200 at the end of this month. We expect the number of those in receipt of carer's allowance will be in the region of 17,000 by the end of this year, which will be an even greater increase. Expenditure has also increased substantially and will be more than doubled from £36.5 million in 1997 to £78.3 million this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to improvements in the carer's allowance, I have extended existing schemes to carers, such as the free schemes, and announced new support measures, such as the respite care grant. I am providing for an increase of £100 in the respite care grant this year to bring it up to £300. However, despite these major improvements, more needs to be done and the Bill extends our support to a new group of carers. As I announced in the budget, I am introducing a radical and innovative benefit scheme, non-means tested carer's benefit, to enable carers to give up work temporarily to care full time while still retaining their employment rights. This will ensure that our social insurance system caters for a very important contingency with which many of us are familiar.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Government has agreed to extend the duration of the carer's benefit and associated leave from 12 months, as originally announced in December, to 15 months. The new scheme, to be known as carer's benefit, involves two central elements, both of which are regarded as essential to the recipient. The first of these is a weekly income support payment of £88.50, to be operated and paid by my Department. This will be a social insurance benefit and will, therefore, not be means tested. It will be paid provided <Col N="1182" /> the relevant PRSI contribution conditions have been met.</P>
    <P>The second entitlement is the protection of the carer's employment rights for the duration of the caring period. This will require the introduction of separate legislation by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, who has special responsibility for labour affairs. This new scheme will become operational from October 2000, following the enactment of this legislation. Sections 10 to 12 of the Bill outline the main features of the new scheme. The new benefit will be based on a person's PRSI contributions and the maximum claim duration will be set at 15 months in respect of any one care recipient. This time period should be sufficient to facilitate carers who have to leave the workforce temporarily to care for an elderly or infirm person or to make alternative long-term arrangements.</P>
    <P>In addition, it will allow for the protection of the carer's employment rights, which is a key feature of the scheme. In the event of the carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, the carer will be able to apply for the existing carer's allowance. Although it will not be means tested, the new scheme will be closely linked to the means-tested carer's allowance in relation to other conditions. The same medical criteria, residency and part-time working conditions will apply. The scheme will cover all insured persons paying social insurance with the exception of the self-employed, Class S, and those earning less than £30, Class J.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be available to people in employment for at least three months immediately prior to claiming benefit who have at least three years' contributions and are working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight prior to commencing full-time caring duties.</P>
    <P>The weekly rate of payment will be £88.50 and additional increases for child dependants will be payable, where appropriate. The Bill also provides for an additional payment in cases where a carer is caring for more than one person, as applies for carer's allowance and for payment of a respite care grant.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the introduction of special rate contributory pensions for people with pre-1953 insurance. Pre-1953 contributions, while currently taken into account for certain requirements in determining entitlement to old age contributory and retirement pensions, are not counted in determining the yearly average test. Consequently many people with pre-1953 insurance have failed to qualify for pensions or only qualified for a minimum pension because their contributions were not fully recognised. Under section 16, these people may qualify for a special old age contributory pension at 50% of the maximum personal rate if they have at least five years, or 260, social insurance contributions paid under the National Health Insurance Acts <Col N="1183" /> or a combination of pre-1953 and post-1953 insurance.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to announce significant improvements in the current structure of the rates bands for the retirement and old age contributory pensions. The current structure includes five different rates of reduced pensions. This will now be reduced to three rates. Pensioners with a yearly average ranging between 20 and 47 contributions will now be entitled to a reduced rate of pension equivalent to 98% of the maximum personal rate. This change will result in 38,000 pensioners receiving overall increases of between £7.50 and £12.20 in their weekly personal rates of pension. This improvement will take effect from May next and will be implemented in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 17 introduces radical changes to the method of assessing capital and social assistance payments. Concerns have been expressed by Members of both Houses that the effective assessment rates under the existing system, particularly in the case of single people with relatively low amounts of capital, bear little relation to the actual returns currently available on investments. I am pleased to be in a position to respond positively to these genuine concerns. I am introducing quite radical changes to the system of capital assessment and extending this improvement to most social assistance schemes, including unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will provide that the first £10,000 of capital will be completely disregarded. Capital between £10,000 and £20,000 will be assessed on the basis of £1 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital; capital between £20,000 and £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £2 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital and capital above £30,000 will be assessed on the basis of £4 weekly means for each £1,000 of capital. These limits will be doubled in the case of a married couple in receipt of old age non-contributory-blind pension or carer's allowance. In other words, a couple with up to £20,000 in a bank, building society or credit union will not have their means tested social welfare payment touched.</P>
    <P>A survey of old age pensioners with capital, undertaken by my Department, found that 88% had capital of less than £10,000. The changes being made will mean benefits for nearly 99% of all old age pensioners. The majority of non-contributory pensioners with capital will no longer find that capital assessed against their pension. This change is equitable and progressive and is considerably easier to understand from the perspective of the customer. It also provides significant gains to social welfare recipients who have capital. For example, a single pensioner with £10,000 capital will gain by £6 per week. The new arrangements will come into effect in October next. This will encourage old age pensioners to keep money in a bank or building society rather <Col N="1184" /> than at home because it will no longer be assessed for social welfare purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for a number of improvements in the farm assist scheme agreed as part of a package for the farming community outlined in the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. They involve a reduction in the assessment rate from 80% to 70% and an increase of £100 per annum in the income disregards for each child. Both these improvements will make a valuable contribution in supporting farmers on low incomes. It is proposed these improvements will also apply in the case of low income self-employed fishermen claiming unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1999, I introduced an enhanced bereavement grant of £500. I increased it from £100 to £500 in that year. As a result of this measure, the numbers claiming the bereavement grant in 1999 increased by 80% and expenditure on the scheme increased fourfold. It is obvious that many people did not bother to claim the death grant of £1,000 but when it was increased to £5,000 in one fell swoop it was a much more sought after grant.</P>
    <P>I indicated it was my intention to introduce further measures in this year's Bill to address some of the difficulties and problems faced by newly bereaved people. We are all aware of the grief experienced by families on the loss of a spouse and parent. The emotional difficulties can be particularly acute as, more often than not, it means the loss of a spouse at a relatively young age. In addition, with children involved there can also be very practical problems for a newly widowed person at this time. To assist newly widowed persons with children to cope in the immediate aftermath of such a loss, the Government has decided to introduce a special additional grant payment of £1,000, effective from budget day, 1 December 1999. This is provided for in sections 13 to 15. The grant will be payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a widow/er's contributory pension or a one parent family payment, or a bereavement grant payable on the death of their spouse. It is estimated that the payment will benefit more than 1,500 widows and widowers each year at a cost of £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>The measures contained in section 25 deal with the problem where the six weeks after death payment is not currently made or is paid at a reduced amount. These arise in particular in households where there are two pensions in payment and in cases involving the payment of one parent family payment. There were anomalies in some instances where the survivor qualified for a continued six week payment after the death while other households did not qualify. Approximately 3,300 people will benefit from these measures at a full year cost of approximately £1.5 million. These measures will mean that a six weeks after death payment now applies in all circumstances under <Col N="1185" /> the social welfare code. In effect all the anomalies in the six weeks after death payment have been eliminated as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>Section 27 implements one of the social inclusion commitments in the proposed Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and addresses a concern which has been raised many times by Members of both Houses and other public representatives. The section allows an unemployed person to qualify for either an unemployment benefit or for unemployment assistance whichever is more beneficial to his or her circumstances. This change will be of particular benefit to community employment workers who were previously long-term unemployed. They will now be able to claim unemployment assistance at the long-term rate if they revert to the live register and qualify for extended child dependant increases for school-going children up to the age of 22 and for secondary benefits such as free fuel. Until now they were not entitled to do this because they had to transfer to unemployment benefit. They will now be able to claim either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, whichever is more beneficial.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous changes to the social welfare system. Current financing arrangements of the social insurance fund allow for the reimbursement from the fund to the Exchequer of social insurance costs arising where a person entitled to old age or widow's or widower's contributory pension or deserted wife's benefit opts instead to claim old age non-contributory pension at a higher rate. The annual cost of these payments is some £24 million.</P>
    <P>These provisions are now being extended to other categories of payments where a person who is entitled to a social insurance benefit on foot of his or her PRSI contributions opts instead to claim certain assistance payments at a higher rate, for example, a higher unemployment assistance payment rather than an unemployment benefit payment. The new arrangements are expected to cost in the region of £22 million annually.</P>
    <P>Section 29 also provides for the charging to the social insurance fund of expenditure incurred in relation to recipients of social insurance payments under certain free schemes administered by my Deparetment. These schemes are currently available to people receiving certain social welfare payments and other qualifying payments, or who are aged over 66 years and satisfy a means test. The schemes are currently fully financed by the Exchequer from my Department's Vote. This change will not lead to an increase in overall expenditure by my Department but will involve a transfer of charges from my Department's Vote to the fund of around £71 million annually.</P>
    <P>The section further provides that expenditure incurred under the medical card system for dental treatment for insured persons who would otherwise qualify under my Department's dental bene<Col N="1186" /> fit scheme by virtue of their PRSI contributions will also be borne by the social insurance fund. This will involve a transfer of around £7 million in charges from the Exchequer to the fund.</P>
    <P>It is logical, therefore, to charge the social insurance related expenditure, such as free schemes, to the social insurance fund. On the same principle, it is also logical to recoup from the fund any liability which exists where a person who is entitled to a social insurance benefit on foot of his or her PRSI contributions opts instead to claim certain assistance payments at a higher rate.</P>
    <P>I note that in the recent budget in the United Kingdom the Chancellor stated that everyone over the age of 75 would now be entitled to a free television licence. Our old age pensioners have had this benefit for many years and many have the benefit of other free schemes. My Department recently estimated that anyone who benefits from all the free schemes receives an extra benefit equivalent to approximately £13 per week. What we have done for old age pensioners for many years is an example to other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill provides for changes in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This scheme is currently operated by health boards under the general direction and control of the Minister. The purpose of the amendment is to enable deciding officers of my Department to decide entitlement in certain cases. These include claims for basic supplementary welfare allowance from people who are awaiting a decision on claims made for social welfare payments such as unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment, which account for 50% of claims for basic payments, and claims for retention of rent or mortgage interest supplement from some 5,000 people who are making the transition from welfare to work with the support of active labour market programmes such as back-to-work allowance.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to provide for the direct payment of supplementary welfare allowance by my Department in these cases with a view to improving customer service and administrative efficiency. This proposal is in line with the conclusions reached by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1998 in his report of the value for money examination of the administration of the scheme. Someone who claims unemployment assistance but has to wait for a decision is obliged to go to the health board to claim supplementary welfare allowance to tide him or her over while the decision is made. As a result of these changes, a customer will be able to have the decision on supplementary welfare allowance made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and will not be obliged to go from one office to another and back again. My Department is at present consulting with the relevant staff interests in the health boards on the appropriate timescale for this change. Following these dis<Col N="1187" /> cussions, I will be bringing forward regulations giving effect to this transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 32 extends the scope of the legislative provisions I introduced in 1998 for an integrated social services system to include the National Breast Screening Board on the list of specified bodies. Senators will recall that these provisions provided for the standardisation of the RSI number as a unique public service identifier, the personal public service number (PPSN); the introduction of a public service card and a payment card; and the sharing and transfer of personal information between specified public bodies for determining entitlement to certain social services and for the control of such services.</P>
    <P>The existing list of specified bodies includes Government Departments, local authorities, health boards, the Revenue Commissioners, FÁS, An Post, the General Registry Office, the Legal Aid Board, the General Medical Services Payments Board and the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>My Department has consulted with the range of specified bodies on how the new system should work. Plans are now well advanced to launch a combined PPSN and public service card initiative across the public service to heighten public awareness of the potential it offers for improved service delivery. This initiative will include the development of a common means database accessible to agencies delivering means tested public service schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 32 extends the existing data sharing provisions to allow data exchange between my Department and other specified bodies for the purpose of providing them with a PPSN for each person for whom they hold records. Quite recently my own constituency office received an inquiry from my local authority as to whether I, as Minister, could provide information to assist them in delivering a waiver scheme for people over 65 in relation to local authority charges. I was not able to give the information. It would have been much easier for the local authority to deliver the benefit if the information could have been given. This legislation would not have affected that situation but it will allow Departments to transfer numbers relating, for example, to people being admitted to hospitals. It will be of major benefit in that respect.</P>
    <P>This section will also allow my Department to provide to local authorities landlord details of tenancies in respect of which a rent supplement is payable by my Department to assist them in carrying out their statutory responsibilities with regard to such matters as fire safety and accommodation standards in private rented accommodation. It will allow the Department of Education and Science to track early school leavers across publicly funded training courses so that the information may be used to develop appropriate responses in terms of outreach and curriculum development and it will allow the National Breast <Col N="1188" /> Screening Board to exchange data with other specified bodies, using the PPSN, for the purpose of identifying persons who, for public health reasons, may be invited to participate in their programme.</P>
    <P>This year's package of social welfare improvements is by far the most significant ever, involving a core budget package of £403 million, increased since budget day to £428 million, to include improvements aimed at pensioners, people with disabilities and the low paid. In addition, the Bill provides for substantial reductions totalling approximately £103 million in PRSI and health contribution levies for low paid employees which it is estimated will assist low paid employees by as much as £5 per week. This amounts to a total package of £531 million. This is in addition to the existing budget of almost £5 billion.</P>
    <P>The Bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to looking after the needs of our older people, carers and others who are dependent on the social welfare system for income support. It addresses commitments set out in our action programme, as recently reviewed, aimed at building an inclusive society and improves the living standard of everyone on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be pleased to hear, Sir, that I have no intention of speaking for 30 minutes. I will be exceedingly disappointed if I cannot say what I have to say in a shorter period. I am sure the Minister will be relieved to hear this. In keeping with the usual courtesies, I welcome him and his staff and thank him for his exceedingly comprehensive document. His brief covers a huge spectrum, literally from the womb to the tomb, with particular emphasis on the family. I appreciate the excessive amount of work and thought given to the Bill. As the song goes, I will accentuate the positive but not eliminate the negative. We have to look at the Bill from the perspective of whether the glass is half full or half empty. I am not necessarily in agreement either with the title of the new agreement, Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and would have to include in brackets the words &ldquo;For Some&rdquo;. A new underclass has emerged, an underclass which does not seem to have a stable social existence.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on granting real and meaningful increases. I am sure he is fed up listening to adulation from his own side and the reverse from the other, but it is necessary in a democracy to air one's views. Sometimes there is consensus, which is remarkable. It would be wonderful if this could be arrived at always in areas that affect people's lives directly but this is not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge and appreciate the £7 increase for pensioners. In some of his asides the Minister made one feel that getting old is not too bad, that there is a certain comfort about it, that we will all be well looked after. The proposals on carer's <Col N="1189" /> benefit are exceedingly positive. The opportunity is being given to care for a close family member or friend while maintaining one's position in the workplace. This is to be admired and welcomed and will take effect from October next. The Minister is concerned about the newly bereaved, particularly those with young children. This is also an excellent proposition.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister for consolidation. I have received many concise glossy cards outlining the new payment rates. The Minister's brief is so vast that one could safely do a philosophical doctorate on movements between different portions and still not get it right because the system is so unwieldy. From his remarks in the Dáil yesterday I understand he proposes to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the report of the Commission on the Family &ndash; a heavy tome &ndash; bearing in mind that the Minister's brief extends to family and social affairs. What is social welfare but another name for the support of society? I appreciate that the Minister will not be able to cater for the people about whom I am speaking at this stage, even by way of amendment, but it is regrettable that more thought has not been given to the position of families in deprived areas, especially in urban areas, the titles of which keep changing, be they marginalised or areas which have not been included. These families are not receiving enough support.</P>
    <P>One of the terms of reference of the Commission on the Family was to examine the effects of legislation and policies on families and make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a changing economic and social environment. I take issue with the Minister on the lack of provision for families, particularly from the point of view of child care. I appreciate that people are sick listening to this but do they realise just how bad the position is? Each week at my advice centre I meet groups of young women with children who cannot access child care. An excellent child care facility has been provided by my local council with the support of the Combat Poverty Agency but it is always full. As a consequence these young women are not in a position to return to the workforce.</P>
    <P>On family breakdown, where are we going as a nation when parents will not keep their daughter in the family home when she has a child? Eighteen year olds are living in total isolation in anonymous housing estates. We have become a nation of individuals. That is the reason I disagree with the individualisation policies of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. Because we are all demanding our rights as individuals, people are not being treated as members of units and there is a visible breakdown. In many families the State, being the main provider of income, has assumed the role of husband.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Where are we going as a nation in teaching people about their duties and responsibilities when parents will not accept a grandchild into the family home in cases where young people did not think through in advance the consequences of their actions? There are young women with babies living in hostels in Dublin who cannot be acccommodated off the housing list. I cannot think of anything worse than living with a three month old child in a hostel alongside drug addicts and those who earn their living through prostitution. I know of one young woman who leaves a hostel each morning at 7 a.m. and has to take two buses to bring her child to the only pre-school available between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. That is her only contact with the area in which she lives. That is because there is a housing crisis and she does not receive any support from her family because her father is an alcoholic and her mother must keep the peace.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is not responsible for the circumstances in that home, but this is not such a wonderful society when there does not appear to be a way to accommodate the needs of that young woman other than in an anonymous hostel for down and outs. There is an increase in homelessness among young people, purely because they come from unstable backgrounds. This may be because some people have never had any help in trying to be responsible adults.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to put into action the recommendations of the Commission on the Family with regard to pre-school education. The report of the commission proposed the development of a nursery education policy, separate from but related to crèche and child care facilities, and indicated that there was a preference for community pre-schools as opposed to fee paying ones. The report further stated that in the submissions focusing on pre-school and early education there was general support for the Early Start programme and some submissions asked for its implementation in all areas designated as disadvantaged. The Minister and I have spoken about this before and I know he cannot wave a magic wand, but he must act on the report's many aspirations to support the family, which is the only unit of society on which one can follow through.</P>
    <P>The family is the fundamental unit of society. I appreciate that that there can be single parent families, two parent families and families of sisters and brothers, but the only way one can help society where there is a grave need, where the parents are ill, unable to cope or never had access to the kind of stable background in which we all have been lucky enough to grow up, is by stepping in and giving support at the pre-school stage. There is nothing more tragic than seeing young girls whose only way of life is wheeling their babies around the social support system. They cannot go to work and they cannot become active <Col N="1191" /> members of society due to a complete lack of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister will note that I have not referred to the mother in the home because we all know the Minister for Finance made an appalling mistake in that regard. His proposal would contradict completely the recommendations in the commission's report.</P>
    <P>I wanted to ask the Minister about the transfer of payments from the health boards to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. Is he recommending that the rent allowance issued by the community welfare officer in the health centres be administered by his Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to that happening because I have come across grave abuses of this payment. I appreciate that his Department does not administer the payment, but the money involved comes from his Department. There is a breakdown taking place and the Minister referred to it, as far as I can remember. Landlords can remain totally anonymous in as much as they need give only their name to the health board, which obviously has the address of the accommodation.</P>
      <P>I am appalled by some landlords' idea of their duty to the tenant and the neighbours of the tenant. In a recent case I had to go, as Miss Marple might, to the Land Registry to find the name and address of the owner of a property because his tenants were like neighbours from hell. On approaching the health board I was told that its hands were tied because when a person identifies a place to live and meets the requirements with regard to his or her lack of income, the board just issues the money. The health board does not have the right or does not feel it has a duty to inquire any further. Eventually it took a war of attrition to get the gentleman in question, who is from a rural area and must have been well cushioned in such an environment, to act.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that there will be greater control on how that payment is disbursed. There should be checks on conditions in which tenants must live because these can be appalling. Equally, there should be checks to verify that the landlord is registered and that he keeps up the premises and ensures the tenants are of good behaviour.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he had increased the death grant to £1,000 from £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I wanted to know. There will be a total payment in some instances of £1,500. Nobody can complain about that and I welcome the increase which is entirely appropriate.</P>
      <P>I also wanted to ask the Minister his views on how the Government would be able to introduce a payment for women in the home in view of the fact that the report of the Commission on the Family promised to support them. I ask the Minister to expand on this in his reply because I cannot see how the £3,000 allowance will be disbursed.</P>
      <P>Is the Department responsible for hostels for homeless people?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that if he were to receive a progress report, it would place him among those with As. However, it would also state, as my school report used state every Christmas, that he should do better, could do better and, as they stated eventually in my case also, must do better.</P>
      <P>I mentioned these areas of concern with all sincerity as they reflect local realities. There is an underclass which could be helped. When one hears a priest in Dublin state that he knows when he baptises a child that he will be visiting him or her in prison, we know that we should be getting involved at that early stage.</P>
      <P>The main lack in the Bill is in its failure to provide for a comprehensive child care system which would somewhat redress the balance for those I have described as being outside the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. I look forward to the Minister taking on board what has been said in good faith. I regret that the Minister has not addressed this very important priority, but I sincerely compliment him on the very positive things he has included.</P>

      <P>&mdash;from the Opposition benches. There is a line in a musical, &ldquo;Anything you can do I can do better, I can do anything better than you&rdquo;. The Opposition's usual role is to be critical and belittle improvements which are <Col N="1193" /> made in the Bill. When in Opposition it is very easy to be aspirational and promise what one would do if in Government. It is a comfortable position given that one has no possibility of making changes for a number of years. Senator Ridge has set the tone for what I want to say. We should commend the Minister on his achievements to date as he endeavours to benefit all sections of the community.</P>
      <P>The Minister has proceeded along the lines he embarked upon a number of years ago to bring about a more inclusive society, especially by raising the living standards of those on the margins. The reality is that the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has increased the social welfare budget quite significantly since taking office, from £225 million in 1998 to £420 million in 2000. This is without taking into account the reductions in PRSI and the health contribution levies for lower paid employees. Taking those figures, the package of increases provided in the budget is £531 million.</P>
      <P>As they say in my part of the country, it is good that cannot be better. As Senator Ridge said, and I am sure the Minister agrees, there are anomalies which we would like to see addressed. There is unfairness in every system and social welfare is no different.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of changes provided for in the Bill, mainly in terms of the elderly and carers. Since taking office the Minister has prioritised the elderly for special recognition. I refer to the improvements for pensioners over a number of years. The Minister indicated that pensioners on a full contributory pension will receive an increase of £7 per week, bringing their pension up to £96 per week. The priority of the Government is to look after the elderly and it is well ahead of the target it set on taking up office. Since then the Government has increased pensions by £18 per week. Opposition speakers will say the country is awash with money and that the Minister should be providing double that amount. Of course there can never be enough money for social welfare, but we must place things in context and an increase of £18 in three years is quite an achievement in comparison to what was done in the years before the Government took office. I have no doubt we will far surpass our target rate of £100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of section 16, which deal with pre-1953 contributions, also benefit the elderly. I commend the Minister on this measure and congratulate him on taking on board suggestions made by the Joint Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs in our pre-budget submission. The inclusion of pre-1953 contributions when calculating the yearly average of contributions will affect only a small number of individuals, but it is right that due recognition is given to those who worked long and hard before 1953. However, I hope recognition of pre-1953 contributions will be extended to persons currently on <Col N="1194" /> a reduced contributory pension. Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether this is provided for in the Bill. Including contributions prior to 1953 for people currently receiving a reduced pension would increase their rate of pension.</P>
    <P>It is a huge improvement to provide a disregard of £10,000 in the capital assessment of pensioners. The elderly are not very trusting of banks, possibly because they had little dealings with them through the years, and many prefer to keep money in a tin box in their homes. It is extremely foolish and dangerous to do this, given the society in which we live. However, the elderly fear that the few pounds they have saved for a rainy day or as a nest egg will be taken into account when they are assessed for pension eligibility. I did not realise that 80% of pensioners have capital of less than £10,000. This provision is very welcome and pensioners can be assured that they will not lose their pension because they have a few pounds in savings.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the changes made in terms of payments to a surviving spouse following the death of his or her partner. The loss of a spouse puts a huge emotional burden on an individual. The added financial burden at that time can cause serious worries, particularly for elderly people who are very conscious of their financial position and how they will survive.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the carer's allowance. We have met with the Carers Association and know of the difficult situations of some families who are looking after elderly people or children in need of full-time care. I compliment the Minister on his commitment to carers and on the improvements he has introduced for carers on an annual basis. The scheme is relatively new, dating from the early 1990s, but the Minister has set about improving the lot for carers and in extending the allowance to more of them over recent years.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office, there has been a 60% increase in the number receiving the carer's allowance and our elderly population will increase significantly over the next 20 years. Elderly people and children who required long-term care have a longer life expectancy as a result of improved medical care and this must be examined. The scheme must be developed on a long-term basis because there will be still further increases in the numbers requiring assistance under it.</P>
    <P>Nobody under-values the work carers provide on a 24 hour, 365 day a year basis and I empathise completely with them. All of us have listened to carers relating harrowing stories. The Carers Association called for the abolition of the means test for carers but I am reluctant to agree to that. There is constant reference to an inclusive society and a level playing pitch, but if the means test were abolished, people earning high incomes would receive the allowance even though they would not need it. However, the income disregard for carers must be examined in coming <Col N="1195" /> years, especially in light of the pay increases under the PPF. It is currently £75 for a single carer and £150 for a married carer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the carer's benefit for a period of 15 months. Many people would voluntarily give up employment without any recompense to look after a family member who may only require short-term care because of terminal illness and so on. This benefit is extremely important for those who fear that their employment rights would be affected if they voluntarily gave up their jobs. The Carers Association has acknowledged the introduction of free schemes for carers. The care of elderly relatives etc. adds hugely to the cost of running a home and the free schemes will provide an extra cushion for these families, which save the State a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>However, if there is a change in the economic circumstances of applicants for the carer's allowance, particularly married couples who care for elderly relatives, they must appeal the decision on their application or submit a new one. There should be a time limit on the processing of the original application rather than having the applicant go through the entire process again. It is unfair that his or her amended applications cannot be fast-tracked. The appeals system must be speeded up as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I turn to child care. Senator Ridge quite rightly highlighted a number of problems in this area, of which all of us are well aware. While the Minister does not have overall responsibility for child care, he is responsible for child benefit and the changes he has made in this regard must be acknowledged. I welcome the increase in the benefit by £8 per month for the first two children and £10 for subsequent children. The child care issue is highlighted daily in the workplace. The Minister stated that under PPF the Government is committed to increasing child benefit for the third child and subsequent children to £100 per month over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the voluntary sector and employers expressed different views on what they expected from the Government in regard to child care. The fairest way to approach the issue is to increase child benefit, as the Minister has done in this legislation. I welcome the allocation of £46 million in the national development plan for child care. Inadequate child care facilities and the cost of such facilities remain a stumbling block for many people returning to the workforce. This problem will not go away but the Minister has set about improving child benefit, which addresses his responsibility in this area. We are obliged to make changes in child care.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge went into a great deal of detail in regard to the family unit. One anomaly in the social welfare system, which is constantly drawn to my attention, is that married and cohabiting couples are treated differently from couples who <Col N="1196" /> choose to live apart. Given the increase in marital breakdown and changes in the family structure, the participation of parents in the rearing of their children should be encouraged as much as possible. The current scenario is not satisfactory as the welfare system discriminates against people who choose to live together or marry. I do not know how this anomaly can be addressed but we must examine ways and means to establish a level playing field. It appears the social welfare system is sending out the wrong message in that it is more beneficial financially for couples to live apart than to cohabit or marry. It is not always possible for couples to be together but where that is an option we have to deal with them in the long term in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 20, which relates to the qualified adult allowance, we hear constantly about the labour shortages and the need for more part-time and other workers. In households where one person is in receipt of social welfare payment and another is engaged in part-time work, there is a lack of incentive on the part of the social welfare recipient to return to the workforce. The existing limit is from £60 to £105 but with the new changes that will be increased from £70 to £135. In light of the current difficulties in finding people to take up vacancies, we should aim towards increasing those amounts substantially in the next budget to enable an individual to earn an increased income in a part-time capacity. I know of a number of cases where individuals consciously reduced their part-time working hours because they feared their partner's social welfare payment would be reduced.</P>
    <P>The increase in the respite care grant was particularly welcome and I compliment the Minister on introducing that measure in last year's Social Welfare Bill. The grant has been increased by £100 to £300. Carers do a 24 hour job 365 days of the year. They want to do that work but a change is as good as a rest and very often, for both the carer and the person receiving the care, a break from the work is exactly what the doctor ordered. It gives carers a chance to recharge their batteries and it gives the recipients an opportunity to live in a separate environment which can only benefit their health. That is an avenue we could pursue to improve respite care even further. A break is essential for anybody who is a carer because the work can get in on them and they can become isolated from their community. It is difficult for people to care for another on a full-time basis and carers need extra breathing space. While I welcome the increases, we could go even further in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge referred to the supplementary welfare and rent allowances. I have some difficulty with these allowances being administered through the health boards because, administratively, they are more hassle than they are worth. I welcome the fact that the supplementary welfare allowance is being taken over by the Department <Col N="1197" /> in certain cases, but the Minister said a review is taking place and perhaps the administration of these allowances could be taken over by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the increase in the number of places on the back to work and back to education schemes. As I said earlier, we hear about the problem of shortages in the workforce but these schemes are extremely innovative and are beneficial in helping people to get back to work and education.</P>
    <P>The budget is announced in December but increases in payments generally are not made until the end of the year. The Minister has brought forward those payments on a continual basis since he came into office and increases will now be paid in May. I look forward to the time when they will be made four weeks earlier, in April, because the delay in payment is an ongoing complaint from social welfare recipients. I congratulate the Minister on taking the initiative in this regard since taking office.</P>
    <P>In any debate on social welfare one expects an onslaught from the Opposition and much criticism of the Minister, but that did not happen today. The Opposition is being realistic. It knows the Minister is doing all he can do but we will never be 100% happy in that regard. We can all find fault with the Bill but the Minister has addressed as many issues as possible. He has more than adequately addressed the issues he prioritised on coming into office a number of years ago. I compliment him on the Bill, which I support fully.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for his extraordinary knowledge of social welfare, which is complex, and the enormous number of schemes available to people. The fact that there are so many schemes causes a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. In the years ahead the Minister might consider amalgamating some of the schemes so that people like me and the general public would understand them a little better.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because an increase of £403 million in expenditure in payments is enormous for people who find themselves, to some extent, on the edge of society at a time when our economy is booming. It will help to create a greater degree of social inclusion, which is something to which we all aspire. The increases for pensioners, people with disabilities and the low paid should be dealt with in more detail. Our pensioners are the people on whom this economy was built. They are the ones who gave their time and energy so that we could have the opportunity to benefit from a booming economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can we say about people with disabilities? They are striving to integrate into society as best they can. They are getting a great deal of help from various bodies, voluntary and others, and we should do everything we can to improve <Col N="1198" /> their lot. Our society should be based on including everybody and the improvements announced in the budget by the Minister are very welcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to the low paid, there are several improvements in the Social Welfare Bill that will be welcomed by everybody. As Senator Leonard said, one might have expected more combat from the Opposition but everybody will agree that improvements for the low paid are welcome. Next week, for the first time, we hope to debate a minimum wage Bill, which will improve the lot of all low paid workers and that is to be welcomed. I know people have great concerns about its implications. However, everyone should be entitled to a minimum standard of living and income. We must move in that direction.</P>
    <P>One of the Government's greatest achievements to date, in terms of improving the lot of society, is the huge increase in employment in recent years. That is testament to the partnership arrangement we have had for the past 15 years. We must continue this, which is why I particularly welcome the recently announced Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The greatest contribution to social welfare over that period has been the increase in employment. The one way to improve social inclusion is to provide opportunities for gainful employment so that people can better themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased payment to pensioners of £7 per week. We are fully on course to attain the £100 target by 2002. However, when the Minister for Finance delivered the Budget Statement before Christmas I was somewhat disappointed we did not attain the £100 target this year. Many pensioners, who gave everything to their families and society, have very little. Any small improvement in that area is welcome. However, rather than just attaining our target of £100 by 2002, we should try to better it.</P>
    <P>The average increase of 23% in child benefit is an extremely good achievement in one year. One of the best ways to deal with the problems of child care is to increase child benefit, which is targeted directly at those who require it. While child care for younger children is a problem, there are also problems associated with a family as they grow up, in terms of the extra costs of education, sport and so on. Anything we can do to help in this area is welcome. An increase of 23% in one year is fantastic by any standard.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard referred to the issue of carers. It is interesting that, in the very short period since the Minister took office, the number of recipients of the carer's allowance has increased by 60% and expenditure in this area has doubled. There is, undoubtedly, still room for improvement. As Senator Leonard said, no matter what we do, we would always like things to be better, and that is natural, however, the area of respite care, to which Senator Leonard referred, requires further attention. I accept that the improvements which have been made will benefit those in that situa<Col N="1199" /> tion. However, carers need to get away for a short time from circumstances where they may feel trapped and they need to know that the person or persons they care for will be well looked after in their absence. As Senator Leonard said, the person being cared for also benefits from encountering other people during such breaks.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one of the major criticisms I regularly hear about the range of social welfare payments. Our budgets are now announced at the end of November or early December. The financial year begins in early April, but many of the improvements in social welfare do not take effect until June or July. We should take stringent steps to bring those improvements forward to the start of the financial year. That would be a fantastic achievement. It would make the management of the budgetary process much easier and the recipients would feel much happier. I appreciate that would cost a great deal of money, but it could be phased in over time, given that we are in a position of relative plenty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill, most of the initiatives in which I commend. The Bill represents a genuine effort to share the benefits of the present economic boom more widely and to prevent the constant widening of the gap in our society between the haves and the have nots. The point I wish to make is based on a slogan, which I think was used by Oxfam in relation to Africa, which said, &ldquo;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man to fish and you feed him for life&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The measures in the Bill and its recent predecessors are, for the most part, short term. They address the symptoms of the problem but not the solution. The more fundamental, long-term measures which are aimed at removing the causes of the problem seem to get a lower priority in Government spending.</P>
      <P>It reminds me of how readily we dig into our pockets when there is a crisis around the world, such as in Mozambique, Biafra and Ethiopia. Ireland has a marvellous record in that regard. We respond readily and make an effort to solve the problem there and then. However, no matter how valuable such actions are, they do not get to the kernel of the problem. We also help in that regard, but it takes much more time and money to address that aspect. This returns to the question of giving a man a fish rather than teaching him how to fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A broad analogy can be made in this regard with the way we address the question of disadvantage. We have an immediate problem. There are poor people in Ireland who must be helped as generously as possible. We seem to have made good progress in recent years in doing something about that. The Bill is another stepping stone <Col N="1200" /> along that route. However, we are less energetic, generous and ready to commit ourselves when it comes to addressing the long-term causes of deprivation.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason we do not address it is that it is a much bigger problem than the short-term one and is much more expensive and difficult to solve. The much greater amounts needed are very daunting for a State which traditionally has had to count every penny in this area. I understand the Minister's inability to solve everything. However, we must find a way to get to the root of it.</P>
    <P>Another part of the reason we do not address the causes is that we are not quite sure how to do it. It is very easy to give money to the poor. That is simple and works in an immediate way. However, it is much less easy to address the cause of disadvantage. I am as responsible as others for using the existence of pilot schemes as an excuse to say we are doing something about it. Some schemes have been very useful but others have failed to produce any discernible results. The upshot is that we do not know how to address the problem of disadvantage with any great degree of certainty.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate on two aspects of disadvantage. Before I joined this House I was a member of the Finglas Area Partnership, one of the very first area partnerships set up at the end of the 1980s. As a Senator I had to step down from it. I rarely regret that Members of the Oireachtas are not allowed to sit on State boards, it does not present me with any problem, but I was reluctant to step down from that one because I really believed that we could have played a larger part. At the end of the 1980s the problem was unemployment. It soon became clear that the short-term initiatives, although necessary, would not solve it. The problem now is not unemployment but disadvantage and those black spot areas with high, in some cases almost 100%, unemployment. A broad-brush approach is not the solution to these problems, we will have to find it in another form.</P>
    <P>One of the efforts we made in the Finglas Area Partnership and made by other partnerships was community building and the other was education. These are the two vital issues today. The problems we have are worse in many ways but, fundamentally, the issues are the very same. Even with our Celtic tiger economy, there are areas with 100% unemployment. How will we solve that? We must address those areas of community building and education with whatever it takes. It will take a great deal to achieve it but if we write off whole communities we do so at our peril. We must find a solution which involves self-help rather than just giving the money to get people out of this week's challenge.</P>
    <P>In the area of education, I was fortunate to work for five years chairing the NCCA with the Department of Education on the applied leaving <Col N="1201" /> certificate. Those five years were very useful because they taught me a great deal. Education is the one way to escape disadvantage. Many years ago Donogh O'Malley set up the free education system to ensure equality of opportunity, but that will not achieve everything. That will not include these people who are being left out. Currently, the target for second level education is that 90% of pupils will complete their leaving certificate. I was always unhappy that it left out one person in ten who was not going to receive second level education. The figure being achieved is much less than that &ndash; one person in five is not getting second level education.</P>
    <P>We must work not just on equality of education but on equality of outcome. We must do whatever it takes to ensure that every young person of the age of 18 has the maximum number of opportunities before him or her according to their own talents and abilities. We will never have total equality of adults but we must put more work into that area. Currently, what often determines one's future is the status of one's parents and, equally important, the community in which one lives. The education and community influences are probably linked and there is probably a way of solving problems with them. There is a vast difference between offering equality of access to education and achieving equality of outcome. There is a big difference between the two, conceptually and in terms of expense. Therefore, I can understand why the Government is unable to do any more than just grapple with it.</P>
    <P>The other part of the problem is that it is so big that we tend to run away from it. Throwing money at the task in the hope that it will keep a lid on the problem will not solve it. We will have to do more at the fundamental level of the problem.</P>
    <P>I praise without reserve most of the contents of the Bill but we need not just more but a different approach. We need to give more importance to the long term, we need to focus on removing the causes of disadvantage and we need to remove the causes of deprivation. We must accept that this is the biggest challenge society will face in this century. I welcome the Bill and the efforts being made by the Minister but we are only tinkering with matters until we start taking a long-term rather than a short-term view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an t-Aire go dtí an Teach. I congratulate the Minister who will go down in the annals of both Houses as the champion of the poor and the underprivileged. He will be known as the man who charted his Department through very stormy waters, especially in the context of unemployment which has been reduced by 90,000 since he took office. That is no mean feat by any standards. He has really looked after those who have been the builders of the State, the people now in the winter of their years, who built up this State and who worked for little <Col N="1202" /> or nothing. We are now reaping the benefit of their labours. I refer to support for pensioners.</P>
      <P>It is very comforting to note that what was stated in our programme for Government was dismissed by some people as aspirational and non-achieveable. Not only is it achievable but the Minister is well on the way to achieving it. The £7 increase this year in the budget will bring the old age and retirement pensions to £96 a week and it is on target to exceed £100 per week by 2002. In addition, the rate of payment to widower's contributory pensioners for those 66 or over increases to £89.10 and for non-contributory pensioners to £85.50. They are also in line to reach £100 by 2002 which is a real achievement by this Minister and Government.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the Minister has taken care of those who are not able to take care of themselves, the social welfare recipients, and those who cannot provide for themselves. The personal rates for social welfare payments, other than those for older people and invalidity pensioners, are being increased by £4 per week. This represents a 5.5% increase, the same level as the wage increase agreed in the PPF. The Minister was also successful in achieving an additional £1.90 in the standard weekly rate of invalidity pension. This will increase the weekly rate by £5.90 to £81.10 and bring it into line with the standard rate of widower's contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of other measures such an increase of £3.80 in the general qualified adult rate, with the retirement pensioner's rate being increased by £4.70 per week, which will bring an increase to a pensioner couple of £11.70. That is a very significant increase because as everybody knows, old bones are cold bones. The increase in the medical card bands, which for the first time brings many elderly people into full qualification under the general medical services scheme, is a major step forward for which this Minister and Government should take credit.</P>
      <P>My colleague Senator Leonard and the Minister have covered most of the points I wished to make. Having looked after the elderly people who built up the State, the Minister has also made a significant investment in the people of the future with the increases in child benefit. The Government acknowledges the importance of this benefit and the Bill provides for substantial improvements in the monthly rate, resulting in a full year investment of some £106 million which represents an overall increase of 23%. This was never achieved before and is another landmark achieved by this Minister and his Department. Child benefit rates will be increased by £8 per month in respect of the first two children and £10 per month in respect of the third and subsequent child. This means a family with three children will receive £141 per month, an increase of £26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to talk about social inclusion. The Minister is investing. He is putting his money where his mouth is. Others may have promised, <Col N="1203" /> but this Minister is delivering. It is not what one says but what one does that is important, and this Minister is a doer.</P>
    <P>The changes in PRSI will have significant benefits for the low paid. We have been preached at left, right and centre about social inclusion by those who purport to represent the social conscience of the country. They amuse me, however, because they never do what they say. Others promise but Fianna Fáil delivers.</P>

      <P>If I were Senator Ridge I would be heaving sighs too. Under section 8, employees on classes A, H and E earning £226 per week will be exempt from paying PRSI. People will benefit from that measure to the sum of an additional £5.67 per week.</P>
      <P>My colleague Senator Leonard mentioned carers. We are going through a period of prosperity but let us not throw caution to the wind. Some of us remember the early 1980s when this country was going down the tubes, and while the Minister is careful in spending public moneys he will not go overboard. Senator Leonard is correct to say that it would be nonsensical and irresponsible to provide the carer's allowance on a blanket basis, irrespective of income. I will stand corrected if I am wrong but I do not think I am.</P>
      <P>The number of people in employment was also mentioned. Senator Quinn referred to positive measures in that regard and said we were tinkering around with the symptoms, but that is not the case. With the family income supplement, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has provided an incentive and made it worthwhile for those who have a difficulty pertaining to their source of income to go out to work. I do not believe that people should get anything for nothing.</P>
      <P>I re-echo the words of my colleague, Senator Finneran, who raised this extraordinary situation on a number of occasions in the House. It confuses me that the catering trade and the retail sector generally have great difficulty in recruiting people. This is the case even though according to the national quarterly household survey, which provides the best assessment of unemployment, there are 100,000 people unemployed. According to the live register the figure is 170,000. The live register is not a measure of unemployment but a head count of people attending unemployment offices, including casual and part-time workers as well as those on credits. I find it hard to believe those figures. Are we talking about the unemployed or the unemployable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people may say that I am against the unemployed but I am not. I am very much in favour of people, who cannot provide a job for themselves or who are unable to work, receiving the type of assistance the Minister is providing. <Col N="1204" /> Everyone who is mentally and physically capable of work should be offered some kind of employment for their own well-being. We will have to re-examine this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a marvellous job in this Bill and there is no doubt the measures contained therein will prove to be a landmark in social welfare history. Many people spoke about those who made contributions prior to 1953, but they did nothing about the situation. The Minister has done it and well done to him. I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Ridge for her kind comments because the Opposition is there to oppose. I never said that I would achieve everything in one budget or one Bill. One can only do what one can each year within the resources that are available. Senator Leonard said there will never be enough, which is the reality.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge said the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness might only be good for some people. I do not accept that because literally to a man and woman, the voluntary sector, one of the pillars in the negotiations on the new programme, is very much in favour of the PPF. That sector recognises that the programme will represent a massive investment over the next two years and nine months. The voluntary sector also says that perhaps it did not receive everything it wanted, but that is always the way. It acknowledges now, however, perhaps for the first time, that there is an opportunity and willingness to deal with some of the endemic difficulties in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ridge is correct about child care. It is an issue about which there are as many different opinions as there are Senators and Deputies. While child care is not my direct responsibility, income support for children and families is within my remit. An investment of £106 million over and above the existing investment of just under £500 million in a year is a very significant increase of 23%, the biggest in the history of the State. As regards the broader issue of child care, the Government decided in the national development plan to put aside £250 million for the supply of child care which is most important. One can put a lot of money into the demand issue but if the <Col N="1205" /> places are not there all one is doing is putting up the price of child care places.</P>
    <P>It is important to ground whatever one does in future in many places, and the Government is committed to doing so. This year alone we have invested £46.4 million in the supply of child care. My Department has £5 million of that figure. All Departments which are in receipt of this money will have difficulty spending it by the end of the year. I will be spending the £5 million I have to assist out of school child care services by community groups, which Senator Ridge referred to. It is in effect the bottom up approach for disadvantaged communities. As Senator Ridge knows, my Department has the successful community development project up and running in over 100 disadvantaged locations around the country. That will increase to 120 or more in the coming year. The £5 million will go towards increasing child care facilities. In those disadvantaged areas there are already some significant child care facilities which have been funded by previous programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge referred to landlords who do not meet their commitments. I reiterate that as a result of section 32, if the rent supplement is paid by my Department we can provide the landlords' details to the local authority in order that the local authority can ensure the landlords are carrying out their statutory responsibilities, particularly those relating to quality and fire safety.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard raised the matter of contributions made before 1953. That issue had been floating around for some time so I decided to make a number of changes. However, no matter what one does with social welfare, when one makes a change someone else is always left out. I changed the over 56 category recently and some of those affected feel aggrieved. When one changes the goalposts there are always people who feel aggrieved and that will be the case with the pre-1953 sector. Some people who may have felt they would qualify may not qualify. Senator Leonard asked if people would be able to top up. This is a 50% pension, so anyone below 50% will come up to 50%, while anyone over 50% will gain no advantage. On top of that there are changes in banding, as these people are already on a higher rate of contributory pension, but they must be between 20 and 47 years to qualify for increased payments over and above what they are receiving. We have rationalised those rate bands.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard also referred to my Department taking over the full running of the rent allowance scheme. The Government agreed in principle with a recent report which suggested transferring the payment of rent allowance more or less from the Department of the Environment and Local Government through the local authorities. For the first 12 months of receipt of rent allowance a person will be paid through my Department, but after 12 months they will, in effect, go onto a new scheme. That scheme will <Col N="1206" /> take time to deliver and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has set up a unit to progress this decision. It is to ensure there is a much closer link between the payment of rent allowance and the housing list, which is what most Senators would wish.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to the £100 target, which might have been higher this year. There was some discussion of giving a once-off increase of £11 to bring people up to £100. I wonder, however, where one goes next year if one gives £11 this year? Do we go back to £5 next year? People might feel aggrieved in that case. We are on £96, so we are within a stone's throw of the £100 we committed ourselves to reaching by 2002. Obviously, if next year we give an increase similar or higher to this year we will reach that target. That is probably the best way to do it.</P>
    <P>Senator Gibbons also raised the possibility of bringing payments forward to the start of the year. One could not really bring social welfare payments forward to the start of the year, given that the budget is in December, as there is a huge amount of work involved in changing schemes, with computerisation, printing books and so on. There has to be a lead in time. We have committed ourselves to bringing social welfare payments back to the start of the tax year &ndash; the beginning of April &ndash; next year. We have brought it back four weeks this year and will bring it back by another couple of weeks to the first week in April next year.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the general issue of disadvantage and I accept what he said, that the problems of disadvantage are probably now more difficult. It is more difficult from a State point of view to intervene. When I started in local politics in 1987 in my home town the constant cry at my clinic was, &ldquo;Get me a job&rdquo;. At the time it was very frustrating as one could not get jobs. Now I have the exact opposite in my clinics, with people coming to my constituency office looking for advice as to which job they should take out of three or four they have been offered. That is the change in a relatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn on community development, in which my Department is involved, and education. My experience, as a public representative who works fairly hard on the ground, is that some people who had a certain address and came from a certain estate were refused the possibility of even being considered for a job. However, those people are now getting jobs. In my view, recent years have seen the issue of intergenerational unemployment become a thing of the past. I find that the children of families who have historically had high levels of unemployment are now getting jobs. I could make the political point that live register figures have dropped by one third since this Government took office, but that is the result of policies all parties have continued with since 1987.</P>
    <P>Much has been done. Social partnership and <Col N="1207" /> education have been key factors. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness refers to the need to identify 25 specific areas in the country, urban and rural, which need the direct involvement of all Departments, not just my Department's involvement in 120 community development projects.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Glynn for his complimentary remarks and I acknowledge his comment on prudent spending. That must be said. One cannot throw money at a problem in a scattergun fashion and think one will solve it. One must target the money at those most in need, financially and physically.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> I thank Senators for their comments. I always enjoy coming to the Seanad because, to a certain extent, it tends to be less party political than the Dáil.</P>
