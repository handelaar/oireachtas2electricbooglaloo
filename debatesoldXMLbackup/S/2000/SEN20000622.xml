      <P>Today's Order of Business is No. 2, Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 3, Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; all Stages. Business will be interrupted between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for having no surprises on the Order of Business, which is agreed. Given that we have amendments to the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, will the Leader inform us if it will be taken in the near future?</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader said we would meet on Monday week because the Office of Public Works wants us out of here. My understanding is that most Senators will remain in Kildare House and I do not see how meeting on a Monday will make much difference. I ask the Leader to arrange for a sitting, in an orderly way, on Tuesday and Wednesday of that week&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, but I wish to point out that we do not have a leader because like every other group in the House we cannot agree on anything. On my own <Col N="1486" /> behalf, but not on behalf of Senator Henry, the Order of Business is acceptable.</P>
      <P>I wish to again ask if we will have a debate on inflation before the end of session as an item on its own. It is totally unacceptable for the Leader to say we will have a debate on a finance related Bill which will probably concern housing and have nothing to do with inflation.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments regarding the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill. When will the House debate it as I understand it must be completed by the end of session?</P>
      <P>As a former county councillor, I am perfectly happy for the House to sit on Monday week.</P>

      <P>I am. What is An Bord Bia doing in France to overcome this blatant discrimination?</P>
      <P>On a related matter, will the Leader say whether the quota review group has altered the rules for the distribution of new milk quota? Can the circumstances in which milk quota leases are exempted from clawback be clarified? Both matters are of grave concern to the agricultural community and I look forward to the Leader's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week during Private Members' time we had a debate on the staffing levels in hospitals. I am sure Senators heard the announcement by the Irish Hospital Consultants Association that the situation is grave in some county hospitals. Will the Leader draw the statement to the attention of the Minister? Perhaps it would be wiser if some casualty departments were closed and others were adequately staffed, rather than have adjacent hospitals poorly staffed, perhaps giving very bad service to people. I know this would be politically unpopular, but it may be <Col N="1487" /> the only thing to do. For example, the consultant anaesthetist in Naas general hospital contacted me to tell me there would be one anaesthetist consultant some of the time from 1 July and no juniors. The hospital is adjacent to the busy Cork-Dublin road which is being used more than ever as a result of the rail strike. There is also a very serious situation in Cavan-Monaghan. I dare not speak on the Midland Health Board or I might get statistics from the Leader. Something dramatic will have to be done to ensure the safety of patients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs the grave disquiet and annoyance among parents, particularly mothers, about the delay of nine months in bringing forward the increase in child benefit, when many other benefits were brought forward earlier this year? Many mothers in particular feel this is discriminating against them and are angry about it. I wish the Minister would again look at this and try to bring the payments forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Trinity College, Dublin and the University of Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Bill, will the Leader of the House ensure arrangements are made to facilitate the three Senators representing Dublin University who wish to speak on the Bill and who have played a useful role?</P>

      <P>The university will acknowledge that without the assistance of the university Senators the Bill would have collapsed at a number of stages, first, through bad drafting and, second, through inadequate political lobbying. It was the Senators who saved the day. It is important that we are present for the final Stages to have our say.</P>

      <P>To return to more mundane matters &ndash; a lower level of education &ndash; will the Leader of the House use his good offices to impress on the Minister for Education and Science the importance of accepting the applied leaving certificate as a qualification for entry to third level colleges? For it to be acceptable one has to do a PLC course. This amounts to discrimination against the students concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on his initiative in sending patients abroad for treatment, given that there are not enough doctors to treat them at home. Is it not great that hospitals no longer complain that they are not getting enough money? That day is gone. It is no longer a question of money, but one of personnel. This was not the case in years gone by.</P>

      <P>Government policy on Aer Rianta is confusing. Will the Leader of the House ask the relevant Minister to explain why the impression is being given that the £60 million due to be allocated over a five year period will not be forthcoming? The impression is being given that a privatisation programme is in hand. There has been a 20% increase in traffic in Cork. I seek clarification of the true policy of the Government on Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Senator McDonagh about the need to review the status of the applied leaving certificate as a qualification for entry to third level, I would go further and say that the institutes of technology have a very big role to play in terms of the courses they provide for students who complete post-leaving certificate courses. If we are to have a discussion on this matter it should be more holistic than what Senator McDonagh has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter which I have raised on numerous occasions. I welcome the announcement by the Taoiseach last week that he has called for an independent judicial inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Robert Hamill. I visited the Hamill home two years ago on the occasion of an anniversary walk through the centre of Portadown when I was impressed by the genuineness of his family, in particular his father and sister, Diane, who has fought to have his case highlighted. I am delighted that the Taoiseach has taken up the matter. I know that time is short but I ask the Leader of the House to ascertain what the up-to-date position is on this matter and the investigation of the murders of Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in what Senator Farrell had to say about hospitals having more money than ever before. How does this fit in with VHI subscriptions which have increased substantially in each of the past four years? While inflation is running at 5.2%, medical inflation is running at well over 12%. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Finance to deal with this matter in the debate on inflation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry's sentiments regarding staffing levels in hospitals. Senator O'Dowd called on the Minister for Health and Children to see what he can do to make it more attractive for young men and women to pursue nursing as a career. The problem is not confined to the medical profession. Those involved in the services sector are also finding it very difficult to maintain lines because of the shortage of staff who do not want to work unsocial hours. They want to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Everyone recognises that we are confronted by a major problem.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the views of Senator Keogh to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs who is doing an excellent job. Public representatives have no greater friend when it comes to the art of communication. We receive a communication from him every second day about improvements to the service.</P>

      <P>I will pass on to the Minister for Education and Science the views of Senators McDonagh and Ormonde who have vast experience in the area. Senator Cregan expressed concern about Cork Airport. The Minister for Public Enterprise was in the House yesterday to take Second Stage of the Aer Lingus Bill, 2000. The Senator will have the opportunity to raise the matter with her when Committee and Remaining Stages are taken next week.</P>
      <P>I will have inquiries made for Senator Bonner regarding the independent inquiry for which the Taoiseach called last week into the circumstances surrounding the death of Robert Hamill. I will pass on the views of Senators Farrell and Joe Doyle to the relevant Minister. Senator Burke inquired about extending the gas pipeline to his part of the country. I will make inquiries in this regard and advise him of the outcome early next week. Senator Burke also inquired about the position of sports grants. I understand these are at an advanced stage of being finalised.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 is related to amendment No. 1 and they may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;facilitates&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1) states: &ldquo;A person who organises or knowingly facilitates the entry into the State of a person whom he or she knows or has reasonable cause to believe to be an illegal immigrant or a person who intends to seek asylum shall be guilty of an offence . . . &rdquo;. The case was made on Second Stage and in the debate in the other House that there are many instances where a person who is a carrier, say a truck driver, may unknowingly carry a passenger who intends to become an illegal immigrant, asylum seeker or seeks refugee status in the county they are entering, including this one.</P>
      <P>Nobody should be held guilty for assisting somebody into the State for humanitarian reasons where there is considerable<i> prime facie</i> evidence that the person would quality for refugee status or asylum in this country. There is a moral obligation on any person to assist somebody into the State for genuine reasons, for example, a person may be in flight or subject to persecution in their country. I would take that view if I assisted somebody whose life was in danger in his own country and where I was involved in assisting him into this country to seek asylum.</P>
      <P>It is shameful that this country should receive adverse mention in the report published recently by Amnesty International. It is the most respected NGO to monitor human rights practices throughout the world. In the 40 or so years it has reported it has never made an unfavourable mention of this country until now. It expresses its concern about various parts of the Immigration Act, including its failure to recognise the fundamental nature of the right to non-refoulement. It also expresses its concern about the failure in this Bill to make a distinction between professional traffickers and those assisting genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister feels any shame about what the Amnesty International report says about this country. I raised the report with him yesterday on Second Stage and invited him to make a detailed response to it, but I am afraid he was very dismissive. I am very concerned about what Amnesty International has to say and for that reason I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment. When a similar amend<Col N="1492" /> ment was put forward on Committee Stage in the Dáil we did not have the benefit of the Amnesty International report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's amendment. There is a broad desire here to criminalise people who, for humanitarian or ethical reasons, may help those who enter this country illegally and who afterwards may be proved to be genuine asylum seekers. There is always concern about people in other countries who try to point that their state is not treating all of its citizens or those who enter it well. That could happen here. I have before me a report from Turkey, where an internationally renowned Turkish surgeon has been sentenced to live in censorship for five years after facing charges relating to press statements he made about the ill treatment and detention of human rights defenders. The sentence means that Professor Velie Lok, an orthopaedic surgeon and well known human rights advocate, cannot publicly criticise the Turkish authorities on the issue of torture for five years.</P>
      <P>Reports from the World Medical Association state that doctors in Turkey are continually being harassed because they provide medical treatment to victims of state torture. I do not suggest there will be state torture here, or anything like that, but I cannot see where the Bill excludes people from being criminalised who give medical help to those who may be in urgent need of it. The Bill provides that people must act for gain, but suppose there is a payment? The person could then be criminalised. A broad sweep is being taken against those who may act for humanitarian or genuine ethical medical reasons. I am sure this is not intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor's amendment is covered. Section 1(2) states that subsection (1) shall not apply &ldquo;to anything done by a person other than for gain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>For reasons I will explain, I cannot accept these amendments. I understand the concerns expressed by Senators Connor, Henry and Norris and I accept the principles behind the amendments and what the Senators are trying to achieve, that is, to ensure that those who give assistance for humanitarian or other non-profit oriented purposes are excluded from the scope of the section. The Minister has already given recognition to this important principle in Section 2(2), which provides that the assistance only becomes criminal if it is given for gain. In this way he is ensuring that the activities of bona fide people, who give assistance to non-nationals to come here, are not included within the scope of the Bill. <Col N="1493" /> Senators will see that this approach sets the focus of the Bill firmly on the profit making traffickers and ensures beyond doubt that non-profit making activity is excluded. I know that this House, given its reputation for upholding human rights, would not condone the activities of those who traffic in people, be they asylum seekers or others, and profit as a consequence of such exploitation.</P>
      <P>Some confusion may exist about the effect of the trafficking provisions of this Bill. Accordingly, I want to make clear what these provisions will and will not do. They will criminalise the activities of traffickers, including traffickers in asylum seekers, provided such trafficking is done for gain. As the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated yesterday, the offence is not committed by those who act for humanitarian purposes or because of family links, etc., provided of course that they do not make a profit out of the assistance they have given. I stress that whether an individual gained from assistance given to an asylum seeker will ultimately be a matter for the courts to decide, taking account of all the circumstances of any particular case. Gain in the context of this section obviously means profit. For example, recoupment of legitimate costs such as the price paid for a boat ticket would not constitute a gain or a profit. This is an important aspect of this Bill which effectively ensures that the scope of the offence catches the profiteer and does not affect the bona fide activities of genuine people or genuine organisations. For the purpose of certainty the Minister has also provided in subsection 2(<i>b</i>) that the offence is not committed by a person working for a bona fide organisation which gives assistance to asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>Senators Connor and Norris wish to insert the words &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo; obviously to put beyond doubt the exclusion of assistance given for humanitarian reasons. However, subsection (2) already puts the matter beyond doubt by providing that, to come within the scope of the Bill, the assistance must have been given for gain. Assistance given for gain is given for that reason and a person who profits from trafficking activity should not be able to claim that the real purpose behind the assistance was a humanitarian purpose. The two concepts are incompatible &ndash; it is one purpose or the other purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Senators Connor and Norris would probably render the section and therefore the entire trafficking provisions difficult, if not impossible, to operate because it adds an additional, unclear and unnecessary element of proof. It would mean that a trafficker who had charged some poor unfortunate person £1,000 for his or her services could claim that he or she was motivated by humanitarian considerations and it would be necessary to prove the absence of such intent. This would be particularly difficult as the term &ldquo;humanitarian assistance&rdquo; is open to a very broad interpretation and most certainly lacks the <Col N="1494" /> certainty required for criminal law. I know that is not the intention of the Senators and therefore they would not want that to be the net result of the amendment. There is no need to insert such complications.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) says it all and it is the appropriate mechanism for ensuring that humanitarian assistance is not covered by the scope of this offence. It is a mechanism used in the trafficking legislation of many of our European partners. Both the Minister and I are satisfied that it is the right approach, having looked at it in detail in the examination of the amendments submitted.</P>
    <P>I accept the principle behind the amendment proposed by Senator Henry. A doctor or other person who gives assistance to an asylum seeker to come to the State because the person is in need of medical assistance should not come within the scope of this Bill, and the Senator wants to be sure of that. Subsection (2) is the assurance that such assistance will not do so as I would expect that the assistance which the amendment seeks to cover is assistance which is given for no financial reward. The Senator would obviously prefer to see the exclusion on medical grounds spelt out in the section. However, not only is that unnecessary, it is also dangerous as it could leave open the possibility that a trafficker who put an injured person in a sealed container at Cherbourg could claim that he or she was assisting the person to get medical assistance in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I hope the Senators will see that what they are trying to achieve is covered by subsection (2) and I ask them to withdraw their amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive explanation, but nevertheless I remain dissatisfied. The Bill has come in for a great deal of criticism and specific criticism in this particular area in that it is not clear in the way it distinguishes between criminal traffickers and people who for genuinely humanitarian reasons wish to assist asylum seekers. To insert the words &ldquo;other than for humanitarian reasons&rdquo; in this section would not create any great problems regarding the burden of proof. For that reason, despite the Minister of States's comprehensive explanation, I remain unconvinced.</P>
      <P>This amendment does something to err on the humanitarian side because a little too much of the Bill errs on the other side, and that has been eloquently stated in criticism about us which has been disseminated all over the world. It seems odd that the unfavourable mention to which I refer, which was made in the Amnesty International report published last week, singled out this particular legislation. It made the specific criticism of this Bill that it did not make that distinction. If we inserted this amendment in the Bill, it would help us recover some of the image we have lost.</P>

The Minister of State's explanation is that this could result in people being put into trucks to be saved, but this is when people have given medical assistance which is not the same as sending them off somewhere to get medical assistance. I am not happy about it.</P>

      <P>I want to clarify what section 4, in particular subsection (3), provides. Section 4 provides that where a person is convicted of an offence of trafficking the vehicle used may be the subject of a forfeiture order by the court. This order may be in addition to, or instead of, any penalty imposed by the court under section 2. Forfeiture is not mandatory and the question of forfeiture is a matter for the court to decide in the particular circumstances of the case before it.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) provides that where the convicted person is the captain, driver or other person in charge of the vehicle, forfeiture will not be possible unless the owner or, where the owner is a company, a director or manager of that company knew or could with reasonable diligence have discovered that the vehicle was being used for the purpose of the commission of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the provision is to ensure that operators take prudent measures against such activities and cannot just turn a blind eye to any illegal activity which might be going on. It does not create a need for the operator to foresee the unforeseeable or to do more than could be reasonably expected of him or her. The provisions specifically provide that if the exercise of due diligence could not have discovered the illegal activity, then the forfeiture provisions will not apply in these circumstances. On the other <Col N="1496" /> hand if I were to accept this amendment, it would mean that an owner of a vehicle could turn a blind eye and effectively wash his or her hands of what might be going on.</P>
    <P>I assume that the Senators are concerned that this &ldquo;reasonable diligence&rdquo; test might create strict liability or at least a high level of liability for the owners. This is not the case. There are two aspects to the provision.</P>
    <P>First, it means by implication that the owner is expected to exercise reasonable diligence in the use of his or her vehicle. This means that he or she is expected to exercise the reasonable care that might be expected of a person in the position of the owner. This is a commonly accepted standard of care and is no more than what common sense would suggest should apply. Such reasonable care would have been taken if the owner established a proper system to guard against misuse of his property by traffickers and took reasonable steps to ensure that his or her business was operated in a responsible and bona fide manner. The second aspect of the provision is that if the trafficking is such that the exercise of reasonable vigilance could not have detected it, then the owner is not considered culpable and his or her vehicle cannot be forfeited.</P>
    <P>There is a further safeguard for the owners of property in the section including the provisions of section 4(5) which provides that owners or other persons with an interest in the property must be given an opportunity by the court to show cause why a forfeiture order should not be made. This provision does not impose requirements on owners other than the requirements which common sense would say that the responsible owner should in any event put in place.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, in other jurisdictions, additional requirements have been placed on owners through carrier liability legislation or through strict liability legislation in respect of stowaways. Such matters are not provided for in this Bill. The Minister is aware that there is a need to examine whether such provisions should be a feature of our law and he is having these matters examined in the context of the proposed Immigration Bill. Any proposals which he will bring forward will be made after appropriate consultation with carriers such as hauliers, shipping and airline companies.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Irish Road Haulage Association has called for the introduction of a code of practice for its members. The association is to be congratulated on such a proactive and responsible approach to the problem. As the Minister has already said, the introduction of a package of measures concerning carrier responsibility for passengers brought to this country is under consideration. The Minister intends to consult with carriers, including the Irish Road Haulage Association, on his proposals in this respect.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators can see that their amendment is not necessary and I ask them to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her explanation. I am not overly enthusiastic about this amendment. I am aware, and I made this point about the Tokyo Convention as it applies to aircraft, that the commander of an aircraft has only to concern himself with safety and good order on his aircraft. I cannot speak about similar conventions covering shipping. According to the Tokyo Convention, it is not part of the duty of an airline pilot to interpret immigration law or anything of that nature.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the unfortunate cases in European airports where three people died in transit. One flight was from Zurich Airport, another was from Frankfurt to Khartoum and the other I do not recall. Security and immigration officials obviously accompanied those people. There was also the case at Brussels of Semira Adamu, a national of Niger, who died at the airport. The pillow method was used in these cases, so these people were suffocated. The method was used because they resisted their expulsion and that resistance continued on the aircraft. They died accidentally but the methods and means used to enforce the expulsion orders and to restrain them were excessive to the extent that the three people died. We should be aware of that.</P>
      <P>If we are legislating for carriers' liability, there should also be another liability to ensure that excessive force is not used by officers of any state if they find themselves taking an unfortunate person back to Iran, or something similar. Our national airline would not be able to complete such a journey. One would have to fly to London and then take an unfortunate Baha'i, for example, who is probably facing persecution in Iran, back to Tehran on a London to Tehran flight. I do not suggest that any person employed by the immigration service of the Government would engage in excessive force, and God forbid that it would ever happen.</P>
      <P>However, as regards carrier liability legislation, the liability does not go to the extent of saying that carriers must co-operate with officers carrying out deportation orders which involve the carrier's aircraft or ship taking them to the required destination. Clear guidelines must also be included about the level of force which can be used. It should be borne in mind that, if an excessive or unusual level of force has to be anticipated, that carries implications for the safety of the flight or voyage.</P>
      <P>I withdraw my amendment, but I would like the Minister of State to take account of what I say.</P>

It does not impose a requirement to know anything about immigration law. It simply provides that the owner is obliged to take reasonable care to ensure that his truck coming across from the Continent, for example, is safe, secure and locked.</P>
      <P>I assure Senators Connor and Henry that the points they made will be recorded and assessed when we prepare the Immigration Bill. The Senators' concerns are more to do with that legislation and, if we proceed with legislation in the area of carrier liability, which we are not doing here but which is being examined in the context of the proposed Immigration Bill, their concerns will be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;Order')&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any other lawful proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to limit the suggestion that a refusal of asylum could only be challenged by judicial review. The argument is that an asylum seeker could, for example, already be charged with an offence for being in the State illegally, and he would not be in a position, if this section were agreed, to use as part of his defence the fact that he believed his deportation order to be illegal. The State would be in a position to say that he could only challenge the order by judicial review and not by way of defence in a criminal trial.</P>
      <P>When the Minister replied to a similar amendment in the other House, he said other procedures existed which, if engaged in by litigants, would be cumbersome. However, this ignores the possibility of raising the invalidity of a deportation order by way of defence in a trial and affects the use of the invalidity of refusal of asylum to challenge the subsequent deportation order. The Minister also said that statute law can interfere with habeas corpus. As I am not a lawyer, I will have to take his advice on this. He suggested that this section is possibly unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>If the question of the validity of a deportation order comes up as a critical matter in a criminal prosecution where, for instance, it might be an argument for the defence against a charge of breach of a requirement of the order under section 3(10) of the Immigration Act, 1999, the proper course is for the defendant to institute judicial review proceedings in the High Court under this section of the Bill and to seek the adjournment of the District Court criminal proceedings pending the outcome of the High Court proceedings. It would not be appropriate for the District Court in criminal proceedings to determine the validity of the deportation order. That is a matter within the jurisdiction of the High Court only. It would not make sense to have such a question determinable in two different courts.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be wider than that. It would permit a free form procedure no matter what the nature of the step in the immigration or asylum process that was being questioned and would thus undo the streamlining effect of the procedural simplification proposed in the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), line 33, to delete &ldquo;14 days&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;3 months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I did not speak on amendment No. 4 but in a sense this amendment is related. This is probably the most fundamental problem with regard to the Bill. Section 5 deals with the right to a judicial review of a person seeking refugee status or asylum in this country. The Minister, for whatever reason &ndash; and I suspect the reason &ndash; has decided in the case of refugees to limit the period from three months to 14 days to prepare and present a case for judicial review. That is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>We are signatories to various international conventions and instruments which bind us to treat everyone equally before the law. It has been well established in the constitutional test cases in the courts that non-citizens should have the same rights as citizens. Why should we discriminate against people we consider foreigners? These people wish to apply for asylum or refugee status which may, in turn, lead to naturalisation. For the benefit of the Minister, Article 16 of the UN Convention, 1951, states:</P>
      <P>. . . a refugee shall have full access to the courts of law in the territory of all contracting states. A refugee shall enjoy in the contracting state in which he or she has initial residence the same treatment as a national in matters pertaining to access to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> That is a clear statement. I am open to correction but I understand we have incorporated most of the UN Convention, 1951, into domestic law as part of the Refugee Act. That makes it the domestic law of the land.</P>
    <P>I always have in my possession a pocket version of the European Convention on Human Rights and feel the need to have it, Deputy O'Donoghue being the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Taoiseach has stated that this country, with only a few other member states, will ratify in domestic law next October the European Convention on Human Rights &ndash; a document which proceeds from the Council of Europe. This document is respected worldwide as a wonderful statement of basic human rights and any contracting state to it has a high standard on the observance of human rights.</P>
    <P>A human rights commission has been established here and in the North and the British Government has also agreed to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights in its statutes. I think it was the Minister of State who dealt with the human rights commission Bill in its final Stages in this House and she confirmed that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights consists of a number of sections which deal with the right to a fair trial. With regard to a person seeking a fair trial in a contracting state, section 4 states that a person must have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his or her defence. Article 16 of the UN Convention, 1951, and Article 6 which will be incorporated into our domestic law, will be in clear contravention of our own laws with regard to refugees and asylum seekers if this amendment is not accepted. The legislation will be unconstitutional because it has been well stated by the courts that non-nationals should have an equal right of hearing, irrespective of whether a person is the biggest rogue in the land or the most upstanding citizen. The courts, to their credit, have clearly reiterated that over the years. I am pleased our Constitution does not state that non-nationals do not have a right of access to our courts. The courts, including the Supreme Court, have since interpreted that non-nationals should have the same hearing as nationals.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental issue and I wonder about the reason behind it. The Minister said frivolous and vexatious cases are being brought before the courts and judicial reviews were not for such purposes. That is not the case because there is a filtering system within the courts. We had an example of this a few weeks ago when a lecturer in Limerick took a case against the appointment of former judge, Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, to the European Investment Bank. First, he had to go through the procedure which showed he had an arguable case before the hearing for a judicial review could be heard. With that filtering system, the Minister cannot argue that frivolous and vexatious cases are being taken and that court time is being wasted and, in turn, the asylum and refugee <Col N="1501" /> determination system operated by his Department is in knots.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to respond to these matters in detail. I know she has a written brief. I read most of what she said in the Dáil and found it unconvincing. We must be extremely careful. We appear to be on a route which will result in our infringing conventions and international instruments to which we are party. We will be in violation of the Constitution and domestic law when these instruments are incorporated into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impressed at Senator Connor's ability to explain why this will be bad law unless we do something about it. I know the Minister and Minister of State are anxious to introduce laws that will hold up in court. Senator Connor made the point that the Bill appears to be in contravention of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. We have not ratified that article yet but it is our intention to do so in the future. We are obliged to ratify it under the agreement.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to support laws which treat non-nationals differently from nationals. The period in which a judicial review can be taken by non-nationals has been shortened from three months to 14 days. I argued during the Second Stage debate yesterday that one of the ways we could handle the immigrant situation was by making sure we made quick and precise decisions. I was not all that worried with the change to 14 days in the first instance. I then had to take another look at what has happened in the past year.</P>
      <P>We have operated a policy of dispersal around the country of those seeking asylum. Many of them are located in isolated areas and practically all of them have no financial resources easily available to them. I believe we are being unjust and impractical in springing this change upon them. It is unequal to the constitutional rights they will have when we ratify the European Convention. I know the Minister of State wants to introduce good law &ndash; I want that too. I heard what the Minister had to say in the other House but I believe that we have an opportunity to make a change in this Bill. I urge the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senators Connor and Quinn have said about the dispersal of refugees throughout the country. They spend a few days in Dublin and are then sent to another location and often they are moved again. In those circumstances such people would have no time to become involved with free legal aid or a solicitor who will take their case. Surely we are, as Senator Connor said, grossly discriminating against non-nationals. I thought our current law provided a period of six months within which a judicial review could be sought. I would be very unhappy if the Minister of State could not accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is with us today because Senator Connor appears to have quite an effect on the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure Senators fully understand what we are doing in practice as distinct from theory. An item in this morning's newspapers will, perhaps, help explain the position. A local resident took a case to court yesterday to prevent a concert being held at Punchestown Racecourse this weekend. There would have been no point telling that resident he had three months or six months within which to take his case because the concert is being held this weekend. The Minister outlined a similar scenario in the Dáil relating to a football match.</P>
      <P>Senators appear to be suggesting that although a person is being deported we should allow him to remain for three months as he may like to seek a judicial review. The court needs to look at cases in a shorter timeframe. The purpose of the Government proposal is to provide a judicial review procedure which is tailored to the particular requirement of the matters at issue in the areas of immigration and asylum. An important aspect of the specific adaptation to those requirements is the incorporation of realistic time limits which are related to those applying to the decisions, orders and other steps listed at section 5(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>n</i>).</P>
      <P>Senator Connor raised many questions. In circumstances where an order if unchallenged would be executed within 14 days, the law should nonetheless allow a period of three months within which a challenge can legitimately be brought. It does not make sense to say, &ldquo;Let's wait for three months before we proceed because this individual may decide to take a case.&rdquo; What Senators are asking the House to accept is that, notwithstanding that there are time limits of two and three weeks built into the legislation governing the various steps covered under section 5(1), the law should in effect say: &ldquo;Don't mind those time limits at all, you have loads of time within which you can take a case to the High Court challenging the validity of the decision or order.&rdquo; The logic of such a provision is that there should be a three month gap between each step in the asylum process in which the staff of the Department or the new staff of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeal Tribunal give the applicant the full entitlement of time to question the validity of the process so far in the High Court. Each step would produce a three month delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to follow the logic of this amendment in another of the contexts covered by the amendment, any person refused leave to land in the State would nonetheless have to be allowed to remain for three months in case they wished to challenge the validity of the refusal. Each step in the deportation process would have to be followed by a long interval to give the potential deportee the opportunity to avail of the period provided by law for the taking of judicial review <Col N="1503" /> proceedings. I am sure Senators will agree that is no way to operate. Acceptance of this amendment would result in an open door through the backdoor. We would, in effect, be saying, &ldquo;Come on in. If you are refused leave of entry you can stay for three months to think about it.&rdquo;  The primary time requirement in the Rules of the Superior Courts is not three months but a requirement to act promptly. That is the first requirement set out in the Rules of Court in order 84, rule 21, paragraph 1. The three month limit or, as Senator Henry pointed out, six months in some cases&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be extended again by a judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. In many cases, as I have explained in the football example and the Punchestown concert this weekend, it is more theoretical than real. It does not really matter if it is two or six months, it must be done this week. The requirement of promptness of action overrides in practice any time limits which the rules may set or which may be set in the Bill. If I, as a person involved in an administrative procedure with some organ of the State, am not happy with a step in the procedure and I am not happy that that step was carried out properly in accordance with the law or principle, the onus is on me to act promptly and before any subsequent step is taken on foot of that procedure with which I take issue. If not, the court would throw me out if I allowed time to go by and other steps were taken before I queried something that happened some time before.</P>
      <P>The Government proposes to set a limit of 14 days for a judicial review in these types of cases to reflect the real world. The limit which the amendment seeks to insert is fine in general circumstances, which order 84 of the Rules of Court must cater for, but in immigration and asylum cases, to which section 5 is designed to apply, they are patently out of kilter with reality. There is no point in incorporating a theoretical, unreal or unworkable time limit into the section. To do so would only cause confusion because of the obvious conflict between that limit and those set in the various provisions listed already in subsection 1. The High Court also has a provision to extend that 14 day period if it feels it appropriate in an individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her lengthy explanation. She has done a good job of attempting to convince us, but we cannot escape the reality, which is that the Minister wishes to limit the right of refugees and asylum seekers to seek a judicial review as against the right of other people. If a non-national is found guilty of an offence after going through all the procedures necessary and seeks a judicial review in relation to a matter which has nothing to do with his or her status in the State, he or she has <Col N="1504" /> three months to act, but the Minister has singled out refugees and asylum seekers because he does not like them. Let us face it. He wants to make them unwelcome and uncomfortable in the country; that is what this measure amounts to. It is clear discrimination.</P>
      <P>The argument was made that in planning law one is restricted to two months, but the three month rule proceeds from the courts themselves. It is an insult to the courts to say that the amount of time to be allowed for a judicial review in asylum cases is to be 14 days. That has to be in contravention of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which guarantees that people have adequate access and time to prepare their defence.</P>
      <P>Who is more vulnerable or needs more time than refugees who may not understand English? They may have no friends here and may not understand the Irish legal system; they may have difficulty getting an advocate or an interpreter. They need time more than any other person appearing before a court and we should give applicants for refugee and asylum status more time than is normal because of the particular circumstances that often apply in their cases regarding their lack of understanding of our language and culture.</P>
      <P>They are often frightened of approaching the courts, but this is often the case with many ordinary citizens also. It is almost a horror to those who have had no experience of legal proceedings to have to go to court. What then does it mean to poor refugees or asylum seekers? If they are rejected by the courts and they seek a judicial review as a last resort, they need to have the wherewithal to put that together. It is not easy. Arguments have to be put together and presented to the court for that filtering system to ensure there is an arguable case before any hearing takes place. That is the procedure.</P>
      <P>We are not convinced by the Minister of State's reasons for reducing this period from three months to 14 days. I am not blaming the Minister of State. This proceeds from the antipathy of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform towards asylum seekers and refugees, which has often been expressed here.

      <P>It is regrettable that we have had a personal attack on the Minister in his absence. Yesterday he made a detailed speech on Second Stage and listened to Opposition comments for hours before responding fully to every query that was raised. It is time to say stop, as the Minister is being accused of lacking sympathy for those entering the country and other matters. If we look at his record in this area &ndash; and it is only one area he deals with &ndash; we can see he has put huge resources into the processing of asylum applications.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the Minister's responsibilities to the citizens. When a person has gone through the due process, made an application for asylum, had that application turned down, has perhaps appealed that decision and has had the appeal turned down, they have the benefit of a judicial review which they must carry out within 14 days. Those on the Opposition benches are saying they should have three months. Either we are serious about deporting people who have gone through the system and who cannot be accommodated as asylum seekers or we are not. The Minister is being told he should deport people and he has a responsibility&mdash;</P>

He would be failing in his duties if he did not do that. The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, has made the position in regard to the 14 day period very clear.</P>
      <P>We have heard all sorts of points about people being sent to isolated areas but I do not know any isolated area. One can drive from one end of the country to the other in a day. A period of 14 days is ample time for a decision to be taken.</P>

      <P>I certainly will, but I go back to the point that this legislation is a method of policing people so that they do not come here rather than assisting in trying to find out who is lawfully and rightly in need of asylum here. People have been dispersed around the country, they have language difficulties and have come from areas in which, perhaps, they have been subjected to barbaric treatment. A 14 day period is a very short time in which to allow people to make an appeal. That is why I support this amendment. Everyone else may feel they can get their wits together very quickly but the people I have met deserve a little longer.</P>

      <P>At this stage a person will have gone through the appeals process and the details in regard to their reason for entering the country without formal authority to do so. They will have been given legal aid, interpretation facilities and housing and financial support while their case is going through. Having gone through everything, they will reach the deportation stage. Senators need to address the fact that everything possible will have been done for the individual along the way in terms of legal and other supports and now they are to be deported.</P>
      <P>Senator John Cregan hit the nail on the head when he said that at this stage we have to decide whether we are serious about deportation. When people reach the deportation stage, we cannot ignore the fact they have gone through all the loops and hoops.</P>

      <P>The person will have been here for some time, a matter about which the people we represent are complaining. People ask us why the process is so slow and why it takes so long. In another debate on another day, we would be criticised about that. The process is slow but what the Senators are saying is that we should make it slower and longer, even though the individual should not have come here in the first place or did not have authorisation to enter the country. We need laws which stand up. The people we represent will not thank us for having a deportation law which is unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the deportation process under the Immigration Act, 1999. That Act sets out a detailed step by step process for dealing with persons who are liable for deportation &ndash; a <Col N="1508" /> process which culminates either in the making of a deportation order or in permission to remain in the State being given or renewed. The steps need to be mentioned at this stage because it is important that we know the person has gone through these steps before the point of deportation.</P>
    <P>The person is first questioned, formally notified that a deportation order is under consideration, told the reasons it is being considered and invited to make representations as to why a deportation should not be made. Once the time for making representations is up the Minister considers all aspects of the case, including a list of considerations set out in section 3(6) of that Act and taking into account whatever representations have been made. If the Minister decides the person should leave the State the deportation order is made. The person is notified of the order and told to report on a specified date to the authorities so their departure can be arranged. The process is generous. The public is complaining that we do not seem to be able to make it work. We are trying to make it work but for some reason Senators are trying to make it more unworkable. We have to address that.</P>
    <P>Mr. Peter Finlay is quoted as saying that the idea that a High Court case could be prepared in 14 days is lamentable. The issues and facts in any case are very clear by the time a decision is given. Every decision is supported with reasons and the law applicable is reasonably self-contained. I see no reason that a competent barrister could not master such a brief within 14 days &ndash; there are examples of where this occurs &ndash; especially where in the asylum process legal aid and interpretation facilities have been available at every stage of the process.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor probably did not realise what he was saying about the Minister. Yesterday I listened to the debate in the House in my office and I heard the Minister being very welcoming. He used the word &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; often in his speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister was being accused of today was racism. I do not think it was the Senator's intention to do that &ndash; I hope it was not. The Minister has a tough job and he has taken very seriously his obligations to all those who come to our shores, even those who do so illegally, and we have to bear that in mind. Many of the people we welcome have come here illegally but they are given all the opportunities to defend their case. We have to be fair to a Minister who has a tough job in this regard and who faces the public who are asking all of us &ndash; I am sure Senators are not immune &ndash; why we are not in a position to have effective deportation when it gets to that point. We have to be sensible and practical, and the process has to work when a person has been through all the hoops and loops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Reducing the period of leave to apply for a judicial review to 14 days is quite outrageous, particularly in view of the Department's policy of dispersing refugees around the country. This makes it difficult for people as they are often emotionally distressed and living in rural areas on limited means. People in direct contact with the situation are strongly of the belief that such a restriction on time is unjust and impractical. The real concern is that it is motivated by a desire to get rid of people as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>If people are to receive justice they should have reasonable access to it. However, starving them of that right by restricting the time in this niggardly manner seems to be an attempt to deprive them of reasonable access to the courts to seek a judicial review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I stated that the more the processing of applications could be speeded up the more effective and streamlined the system would become. If we wish to encourage the Minister to speed up the system and get people through it faster, it would be totally contradictory to suggest he should stop at the other end of the process.</P>
      <P>The people we are talking about are not refugees because the Government does not deport refugees. It has brought in thousands of refugees who have been made feel welcome and have been well treated and looked after. We are talking about asylum seekers who have gone through the system on two occasions, who are being given an opportunity to go through it a third time, but we are saying the Minister should not deport such people. We have to make up our minds whether everyone who comes into the country should be allowed stay or whether we are prepared to make the distinction between refugees, illegal immigrants and asylum seekers.</P>
      <P>It is fair and proper that the Minister should carry out his responsibilities by giving people a chance. However, what if they come through the system and are deemed not to have grounds for being granted refugee status? If we can speed up the system at that end, surely we will speed up the processing of applications. That can only be good for the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the idea of people being labelled as deportees and having forfeited their right to be considered as asylum seekers or refugees, that is not the case until the final appeal is exhausted. In the period in which a judicial review is being sought, they still have an ambiguous status.</P>
      <P>I had the privilege of working with the Minister of State on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights when she showed herself to be acutely intelligent and to have decent, strong human feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and other European countries are essentially involved in the construction of fortress Europe. However, over the past few years there have been over 2,000 deaths during the deport<Col N="1510" /> ation process. On Second Stage Senator Connor referred to a notorious case of a woman from the former Belgian Congo who was literally sat on and squashed to death by Belgian police on an aeroplane. Not many people realise that over 2,000 people have been killed by different European police forces or have committed suicide because they were so desperate not to be returned to the countries from which they emigrated.</P>
    <P>These cases put into context the question of why people leave a country with a beautiful climate and environment but a savage political situation. Why would people leave their families and the culture they know to come to Ireland or other European countries, very often by dangerous and difficult means, and then be so distressed that many of them are killed by police or commit suicide? This does not suggest it is something entered into lightly for frivolous notions of enhancing their lifestyles. Many more of these people are desperate than we are prepared to admit. They may not fit the narrow categories we have defined for refugees but in any human sense, many of them qualify as such.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Norris's comments, particularly those concerning the Minister of State. Senator John Cregan said there is a necessity to speed up the process when someone has been through the court system and had an application for refugee status rejected. There is another mechanism open to such people and that is the right to seek a judicial review of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is trying to suggest that people are no longer refugees once the process is out of the way and the courts have rejected the application, but before people have exercised their right to a judicial review. The law states, and the Constitution has been interpreted as stating, that a non-citizen has an equal right of access to the law. Thankfully this has been stated many times by the courts. All we are seeking is that an asylum seeker or refugee would have the same right of access to the courts and to exhaust every avenue open to him or her as any other person involved in any other kind of offence or application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain convinced there is only one reason for the Government's approach and that is to restrict and delimit the right of asylum seekers or refugees because the Minister wishes to do so. He wants to make these people feel uncomfortable and unwelcome so they will be got rid of as quickly as possible. This follows the line taken by the Minister's constituency colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae. I regret that no one in Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, spoke out against the sentiments expressed by Deputy Healy-Rae when he said a mechanism should be put in place to show these <Col N="1511" /> people the road. Within hours of that statement the Minister said he intended to bring in new draconian laws.</P>

      <P>The amendment is opposed because it would remove the provisions which confine appeal to the Supreme Court to appeals on a point of law. Subsection (3), which the amendment proposes to delete, confines the right of appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court in judicial reviews of immigration and asylum matters to cases where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal to the Supreme Court would be desirable in the public interest. The provision applies to decisions of the High Court to grant or refuse leave to apply for judicial review, which would arise at the earliest stages of the judicial review process, and also to the decisions of the High Court on the merits or otherwise of the judicial review application.</P>

    <P>To look closely at the words used in the subsection and their precise application to the cases in <Col N="1513" /> question, let us look at the situation of a person liable to be deported who goes to the High Court claiming that the procedure leading to the deportation order was flawed in some respect. In order to get past first base, the potential deportee has to show the High Court there are substantial grounds for this assertion. As the application is not <i>ex parte,</i> the Minister is in a position to put counter arguments and factual clarifications before the court. The court, having heard both sides on the preliminary issue, should have a good basis for its decision, whichever way that goes. If the court decides there is substantial ground for arguing that the deportation procedure was flawed, the Minister, if he is not happy with that decision, can seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The subsection states that, in those circumstances, in order to be given leave to make such an appeal, the Minister must persuade the court that its decision involved a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that the appeal be heard. Similarly, if the High Court has refused the application for leave to seek judicial review, it will be for the applicant to demonstrate to the court that these two conditions were met in order to be allowed to appeal. In circumstances where the High Court has had the opportunity of hearing both sides of the issue, that is a perfectly reasonable restriction on the right to appeal.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the subsection as it will apply following substantive consideration of the judicial review. The High Court will have arrived at a decision following full exposition of the facts of the deportation process, as applied to the particular case, including all the documentation. It will have heard both sides of any dispute on the facts of the case and detailed legal arguments on the issue of whether there was a flaw in the procedure, as applied to the person in question. If, after all that, the Minister or the person in question is dissatisfied with the High Court's decision, then it is not unreasonable that it should be for the Minister or the person seeking to appeal that decision to the Supreme Court to show the High Court that there is a point of law of exceptional public importance and that an appeal would be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The constitutional position is clear. Under Article 34.4.3, the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction from the High Court is &ldquo;with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law&rdquo;. This subsection is just such an exception or regulation. Protection under Article 34.4.4 for appeals involving constitutional issues is effected in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the section. Where the High Court is asked to give a certificate of the type set out in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and refuses that request, the refusal is itself appeal<Col N="1514" /> able to the Supreme Court because such a refusal has not been excluded specifically in the provision. Article 34.4.4, accordingly, applies in the normal way.</P>
    <P>In all, I am of the view that the appeal provision in subsection (3) is of a piece with the general intent of this provision to ensure, consistent with the interest of justice, that the pursuit of court proceedings will not unnecessarily delay the processing of cases in the immigration and asylum areas and that the general interests of the public will be served by its retention in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was tabled in my name and that of Senator Connor. It is an important issue. The Minister of State has just rehashed the Second Stage speech of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. She is right that this kind of limitation is possible on legal grounds and that it is envisaged under the Constitution &ndash; I am not saying anything other than that. However, it is not required or necessary and it represents a further restriction of the rights of the asylum seeker.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying that only technical grounds apply and that there must be demonstrable flaws in the procedure. It is seen entirely from the Minister's point of view, as is evident from the speech of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the reply of the Minister of State, and there is no attempt to imaginatively encompass the plight of the individual before the court. The House would want to play a role in trying to ensure the rights of the individual are protected and safeguarded.</P>
      <P>Several times the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;an exceptional point of public importance&rdquo;, which imposes a very high level test. The point must be exceptional, that is, quite unusual or remarkable, which is very restrictive. What about an ordinary point of public importance? We are talking about degrees of importance and saying it must be exceptional. We are also saying it must be of exceptional public importance, but what about the importance to the individual? There may well be points of extraordinary and exceptional importance to an individual which may not constitute a fundamental or exceptional point of constitutional law. The point may be extremely important for the individual and even be of moderate public importance, but we are imposing a test of exceptional public importance. The law should enshrine the interests not just of the Minister and the Department, or even the exceptional interest of the public, but attempt to encompass the rights of the individual making the application. For that reason we should press the amendment as far as possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, paragraph (<i>a</i>), between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)by the insertion of the following subsection before subsection (2):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1B)A person detained under subsection (1A) shall not be detained for a period of longer than 48 hours save by order of a court.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is important because the Bill does not provide a time limit in this regard. As far as I can see a court order is not necessary and I think it is extremely important that people can only be detained for 48 hours unless there is an order from a court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. Section 5 of the Immigration Act, 1999, already contains detailed provisions in relation to the detention of persons who are the subject of a deportation order, including the non-detention of minors in these cases. The section states that a person shall not be detained for a period or periods exceeding eight weeks in aggregate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes a step on those <Col N="1516" /> endeavouring to execute a deportation order which can be of no constructive purpose. An order signed by the Minister is valid on its face and, of course, can only be made after the process set out in section 3 of the Immigration Act has been gone through. If the correctness of the procedures leading to the making of the order are to be questioned, the subject of the order has the right to institute judicial review proceedings. Section 5(5) of the Immigration Act provides for a court review of detention where a deportation order is under challenge. Section 5 of the Bill before the House provides a specific statutory basis for judicial review in immigration and asylum cases tailored to the needs of those cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to detention in prison or a Garda station, there are well enshrined processes for obtaining legal assistance on demand, for example, the 1987 custody regulations in relation to Garda stations, and there is ample opportunity to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to initiate <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings on an application for judicial review. There is little point in providing an alternative process which would simply serve to impose an unnecessary procedural hindrance to the execution of the deportation order lawfully made which has not been complied with by the deportee. Furthermore, the provision would be incapable of advancing the interests of the deportee in any meaningful way. A visit to a court, as envisaged by the amendment, could not stop the deportation, which could only be done by the High Court by way of judicial review proceedings.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the amendment would only waste more time, impose a huge burden on Garda time, soak up court resources, consume departmental resources and be a drain on the Exchequer in the form of barristers' fees, all for no productive purpose. It would not advance the interests of the deportee one iota, beyond the perfectly adequate protection under the Constitution and otherwise in our laws in the form of <i>habeas corpus</i> and judicial review remedies.</P>

      <P>Forgive me, but my poor brain cannot take in all that Civil Service speak so quickly. It began to remind me of &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo;. I presume it means my amendment is unnecessary, and the Minister could have told me that which, I regret to say, is about as much as I understood.</P>
      <P>I do not like seeing something so open-ended. I presume I will be able to find in the Minister of State's explanation the reason it does not matter. Could people be detained for seven or 14 days? I suppose they could. Has the Minister of State anything further to say?</P>

      <P>It is possible. We are talking about the point at which the person is about to <Col N="1517" /> be deported. We spoke about this in the other House. In many cases it will involve the person being detained in a Garda station overnight while an airline ticket is purchased and the passport is being sorted out &ndash; that is what travelling is about. Unless there is a huge difficulty with the documentation or in purchasing an airline ticket, which there should not be, most people should not be detained longer than overnight. It is about making the necessary travel arrangements.</P>

      <P>A person in prison in New York who is to be deported to Ireland, and who explains that they have their passport and that the airline ticket could be purchased, could be put on an airplane tonight. If the person does not speak English, interpretative facilities are provided. The difficulty arises if the person is awkward, totally unhelpful and obstructive, does not use an interpreter, explain where their passport is or say from which country their details may be obtained. However, in such a case the fault would lie with that person. If a person says where the documentation which is necessary to travel is obtainable, it should not be difficult. A delay would occur if the individual failed to communicate or be helpful in terms of documentation, or destroyed their passport. However, if there is normal communication, the person should only be in the Garda station overnight. That is the norm. It is a matter for the applicant. I can do no more.</P>

      <P>I take the Minister of State's point. If one is in New York one will be sent back as fast as one can go because of the availability of flights, but has the Minister of State ever tried to book tickets to Lagos in Nigeria? There are many Nigerians living here. Perhaps the Minister of State has more influence, but many weeks could go by before someone is eventually sent back. It may even be necessary to send someone with them. I just wish that if they have to be detained for a period longer than 48 hours they will be detained somewhere other than in a police station, and it should not be a prison.</P>

    <Title>Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 2000  [  Certified Money Bill ]  : Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill can be stated very briefly. It is to provide that a judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Feargus Flood, who was appointed to the Bench on 1 October 1991, will qualify for full pension of one half of salary when he reaches retirement age on 9 July, notwithstanding the fact that he will not have the full 15 years service required for full pension entitlements. The new provision applies only to the High Court and one judge of that court. The question of extending this new provision to the other serving judges of the High Court does not arise.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood has been engaged on a wholetime basis since November 1997 as chairman and sole member of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters &ndash; the Flood tribunal. Mr. Justice Flood has agreed in the public interest to remain on in this position after his retirement as a judge at the age of 72. It is impossible to say at this stage how long the tribunal will last but it is anticipated that his services will be required for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>I am sure all sides of the House will agree that the tribunal has carried out its work in an exemplary manner and that its contribution has been invaluable in trying to arrive at the truth concerning the matters set out in the terms of reference. The chairman's role has been a particularly onerous one. Since the tribunal began its work almost three years ago it has sifted through an enormous amount of written material and spent many days hearing evidence from witnesses. To date more than 200 people have been interviewed by the tribunal in this regard and hundreds more have been spoken to or communicated with by members of the legal team. The tribunal has received a huge number of documents and files from various planning authorities, Departments and financial institutions within the State. All this has been carried out under the stewardship of the Honourable Mr. Justice Feargus Flood who deserves our thanks. It sometimes behoves the State to recognise in a more practical way the efforts individuals have made and continue to make for public affairs. This is one such case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> On a more general level, I am sure it is widely accepted that in considering appointments to the Judiciary, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the Government should have open to them the widest possible field of selection. In many instances the acceptance of such appointments &ndash; I must be blunt here &ndash; means that the people involved accept large reductions in current income. This has not deterred distinguished legal practitioners from accepting judicial appointment and they have served the State well.</P>
    <P>In the area of pensions, because they have taken up duty on the Bench relatively late in their careers, some of these judges have not accrued the necessary years of service which is required to receive the maximum pension entitlements. In the specific case which is the subject of this legislation, the judge in question is just over six years short of the necessary 15 years which would entitle him to a full pension. He has, in the interests of completing the work of the tribunal efficiently and effectively, agreed, at the request of the Government, to continue on as Chairman until the work is completed. I believe that a commitment such as this should be acknowledged in a tangible way.</P>
    <P>In money terms the Bill provides that Mr. Justice Flood's current pension entitlement will increase by over £20,000 per annum, up to £45,715. His retirement lump sum will be increased by just over £64,000, up to £137,145, based on current salary. These payments will be made immediately on the judge's retirement on 9 July next. His total remuneration, that is, pension and salary, will continue at the level of that of a High Court judge for the duration of his chairmanship of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill has been brought before the House to deal with an individual case. Other judges are not involved. I believe that this adjustment is well deserved and, as such, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this measure. It effectively allows Mr. Justice Flood to continue his work at the tribunal of inquiry, of which he is a sole member, and which is inquiring into certain planning matters in north County Dublin. I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Flood and his team. They have done an excellent job of work. They are working at the behest of these Houses. Tribunals of inquiry are extensions of Parliament. Mr. Justice Flood is carrying out an inquiry for the Houses of the Oireachtas and he will report back to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the two years or more that the tribunal over which Mr. Justice Flood presides has sat, he has had to endure much adverse public comment about the length of time it was taking over its deliberations. There was a campaign in the news<Col N="1522" /> papers against the tribunal and calls for it to be wound up were made very easily, in an almost irresponsible manner, in many publications, especially about a year ago. However, the painstaking work of Mr. Justice Flood and his team is now showing fruit. Nobody today would suggest that the tribunal should quickly wind up its work or that there is anything futile about what it is doing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood courageously came back to these Houses within six months of commencing his work to seek an extension of the terms of reference, which was granted. The increase of £21,360 in his pension and the lump sum increase of £64,000 may appear to be generous, but I believe that Mr. Justice Flood is well worth it. These sums of money would only go a little way to compensate many of the advocates for even a week's work at the tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill. We are giving Mr. Justice Flood no more than he deserves. I compliment him on his work and I wish him well and good luck with the remainder of it. We look forward to his report, which I am sure we will have in a matter of months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this short and simple Bill. Lest there be a false public perception, it is important to note that the Minister of State emphasised that the new provision applies only to the High Court and only to one judge of that court. The question of extending it to the other serving judges of the High Court does not arise. I wish to be associated with Senator Connor's comments complimenting and congratulating Mr. Justice Flood on the tremendous work he has been doing for the past three years since the establishment by the Government in 1997 of the tribunal over which he presides. It is of grave importance that he be allowed to continue with his very responsible job. None of us knows how long more it will take, but presumably it will take a considerable period of time.</P>
      <P>It would send out the wrong signals if Mr. Justice Flood was to be removed from or leave the tribunal at this stage. It is very important he remains there and it is, of course, important to him that his pension entitlements are rectified accordingly. I thank the Opposition for ensuring that the Bill has a speedy passage through this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. The Bill is short, containing only two sections, and is of specific intent. We should focus on that intent because we are concerned with what is a unique situation where a particular judge, instead of taking up his retirement in the <Col N="1523" /> normal way, has agreed in the public interest to continue to chair a very important tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>I again emphasise that the provisions of the Bill apply only to one judge of the High Court. There is no question whatever of the arrangement set out applying to any other serving judges of that court. It is also very relevant to point out that it is impossible to say how long the tribunal will last. The most that can be said is that it is likely to continue for some considerable time. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Flood has demonstrated great commitment in agreeing to oversee the completion of this work in the interest of continuity.</P>
      <P>The tribunal team has carried out its core work in a very effective way. While also being involved in various types of litigation, it has assiduously followed the main lines of inquiry in modular form, aimed at moving the process forward as efficiently as possible. I am sure the House will agree that the Chairman's role has been crucial in all this.</P>
      <P>Since the tribunal began its work almost three years ago, it has sifted through an enormous amount of written material and spent many days hearing evidence from witnesses. All this has been carried out under the stewardship of Mr. Justice Flood and his team and they deserve our thanks for this, as Senators have said.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the Government's practical response to an individual effort and a personal commitment in respect of an important area of public affairs. On a broader level the State can be justly proud of the contribution the Judiciary has made and continues to make, both in terms of it members' day to day work on the Bench and currently in the other inquiries and tribunals which regrettably are now part of the process of trying to arrive at the truth in certain matters of public concern.</P>
      <P>In the specific area of pensions, the reality is that many judges take up duty on the Bench relatively late in their careers, with the result that some judges do not accrue the necessary years of service required to receive the maximum pension entitlements under the judicial pension scheme. In the particular case which is the subject of this legislation, the judge in question in just over six years short of the necessary 15 years service, which would entitle him to a full pension. He has agreed, at the request of the Government, to continue on as Chairman of this tribunal until its work is completed. I believe this should be responded to in this way.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been introduced to deal with an individual case. Other judges are not involved. The arrangements provided for in the Bill are well deserved. Once again, I commend the Bill and I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no real problem with this section. It is appropriate that a pension should be provided for somebody who has done the State a great service. I am glad the Minister of State is in attendance. I do not believe the provisions of the section should be confined as they are because there are other parallel anomalies in the system which the Bill could have addressed. Some of them concern women who were subjected to the marriage bar, an analogous case to the matter addressed in this Bill, particularly this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated in her Second Stage speech that many judges did not take up the bench until relatively late in their careers and, as a matter of justice, this should be looked at.</P>
      <P>I received a letter, for example, from a woman in Galway, which states:</P>
      <P>I am one of those women who on marrying in 1956 was compelled to resign my job.</P>
      <P>Now that I'm in my seventhieth year and after rearing my children and later my grandchildren, it would be heartening to receive a pension all for myself and feel independent of my husband and his pension with the few extra pounds thrown in for me as if I am just an afterthought.</P>
      <P>That is exactly the same situation which we are addressing in this section, and I wonder if the Minister could give an indication that this kind of an anomaly would be resolved at some stage because it is directly parallel.</P>
      <P>I received another letter from a woman which states:</P>
      <P>I worked for the E.S.B. for a few years prior to my marriage in October 1957 when I had to resign due to the marriage bar and also to look after my eight children. I will be celebrating my sixty-sixth birthday this month with the knowledge that I am <i>not</i> entitled to any pension, which I think is grossly unfair, unjust and not in line with Mr. McCreevy's law of individualisation.</P>
      <P>A third letter I received states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I got married in 1958, women had to give up their jobs, &lsquo;the marriage bar'; we were denied our basic right to work. When our children were grown up and it was possible for married women to be employed we encountered the &lsquo;age-bar', further discrimination. Ireland joining the EU put an end to institutionalized discrimination for women, our laws changed to reflect this. It hardly seems credible that in 1999 any law, scheme or service <Col N="1525" /> could exist which effectively discriminates against any section of the population. However, institutional discrimination still exists against older women. Having endured the &lsquo;marriage bar', and the &lsquo;age bar', we are now facing the &lsquo;pension bar'.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what was happening in the case just described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude. The Acting Chairman has given me a great deal of latitude and therefore I will take a little longitude also, if I may. There is one final letter and it is from a woman who is looking for exactly the same thing. She hopes that there will be &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; for women who are taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Finally, before the Minister of State replies, I want to read out one short paragraph from a very useful letter I received from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, if I may, because this is directly relevant to the Bill and to this section. It states:</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has recognised that issues remain to be addressed in this area and has ordered a review of this issue. Accordingly, the review of the existing arrangements for Homemakers will be undertaken as part of the ongoing review of eligibility conditions for contributory old age pensions. The Minister has asked that proposals be brought forward which he will consider in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely grateful to you, Acting Chairman, for your generosity in allowing me this latitude and I am sure that the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1526" /> Mary Wallace, will be pleased that this matter has been raised because it will strengthen her position and that of other Ministers in looking for the rectification of precisely the same kind of anomaly which we are addressing in the case of Mr. Justice Flood. It is terribly important because the public is now so suspicious that there is a kind of circle of privilege and that people in public life and in politics look after themselves pretty well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Norris will be aware, I have been 20 years debating the marriage bar. I know of his personal interest in it and he knows of mine. As the Acting Chairman stated, both of us can be ruled out of order for debating it under this legislation, but it is an important issue. Unfortunately, as the Acting Chairman stated, it is not the subject of the legislation with which we are dealing here, but I think everybody knows that. We are dealing with the traditional pensions under the 1961 Act. The matters raised by Senator Norris, important as they are, are to be dealt with under the other public service pensions legislation another day.</P>
      <P>It is important that I should stress again that the legislation relates to appointment to the Judiciary and the fact that these appointments made by the traditional Appointments Advisory Board and the Government must be open to the widest possible selection, but the fact is that many people who take up these appointments suffer large reductions in income on becoming members of the Judiciary. They are appointed to the positions because of their experience in life. The area covered under section 1 is important and we need to be clear about it.</P>
      <P>While I am conscious not to stray too much from the debate, although I could talk all day about the issue raised by the Senator, it is critical that I again point out, as Senator John Cregan did, that the legislation refers to a specific case. Although it is legislation dealing with the courts, it does not apply even to any other judge involved. It would be saver for us to keep it as clear as that.</P>
