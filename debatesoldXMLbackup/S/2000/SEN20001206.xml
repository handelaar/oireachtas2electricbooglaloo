    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion re referral of Article 3 of the Fourth Protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re referral of draft order of the Extradition Act, 1965, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, to be taken without debate; No. 3, resolution re the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, to be taken without debate; No. 4, Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, 1998 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages; No. 5, statements on the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers on BSE to be taken from 1.30 p.m. to 4.15 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time. No. 24, motion No. 29 will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8. p.m. and business will be resumed thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, being referred to committee without debate. However, will the Leader investigate if there is a mechanism whereby these committees could report back after they have finished discussing these items? There are Members of this House who are not members of these committees and who would like to comment on them. I would like the Leader to look at that matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for his speedy arrangement of statements on the BSE crisis. It is to his credit that we are having a full debate on that this afternoon. The Leader said that Committee and remaining Stages of No. 4 will be taken today. It may well be that that can be done, but can we leave the decision on taking Report and Final Stages to be discussed by the Whips after Committee Stage rather than agreeing to take them now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> No. 16 on the Order Paper is the Registration of Lobbyists Bill which is in the name of the Labour Party. Committee Stage of that Bill had been ordered for last Friday. My understanding was that the Leader had made a general commitment when we debated Second Stage of the Bill six months ago to make Government time available for its remaining Stages, on which there is all-party agreement. Will he let me know the position in that regard?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask for a debate on the operation of the legislation covering immigrants. I do so, not just because of the case of the Pakistani businessmen that was discussed in the House last week, but also because of the situation of a lecturer in the Russian department in Trinity College Dublin who has been refused the right to have his wife and child here, although his predecessor had his wife and children here. He was allowed to have his wife and child with him in his previous job in the University of Glasgow. I wonder what is going on. I would like an assurance that the Minister will come to the House to explain this.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of an unsatisfactory answer, I propose to move an adjournment of the Order of Business, that instead of No. 1, we take the question of immigration policy&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator proposing an amendment to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I formally propose that instead of No. 1, we take the question of immigration policy and require the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be present in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that proposal for a debate on immigration policy. As Senator Norris said, there are questions in regard to the Russian lecturer, the Pakistani business people who were arrested and put in prison and the Mosney holiday centre, which was used for the community games and is the main holiday centre for working class families in Dublin and the north-east. It is now to be confiscated, effectively, by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for use by asylum seekers. That is very unsatisfactory. Issues arise on an almost daily basis that give rise to concern about immigration policy. It is appropriate, therefore, to debate the matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland before Christmas. Many issues have arisen, including the legislation on policing and the recent IRA statement on decommissioning. It would be appropriate for the House to tease them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning on No. 16, dealing with the Registration of Lobbyists Bill, 2000. Last week's Order Paper indicated that the Committee Stage of the Bill was to have been taken <Col N="1279" /> on Friday, 1 December. This was raised in the House last week but the Leader made no reference to it. Why was Committee Stage not taken as agreed and why is there no reference to Committee Stage on today's Order Paper? Will the Leader indicate when it will be taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on alternative energy, if not before then immediately after Christmas. Wind farms are appearing everywhere. They put a blight on the countryside, yet there does not seem to be a national policy on them. It is very important to ensure that a policy is agreed and guidelines are in place, especially in tourism counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, issued a report this week recommending that funding be provided for literacy modules for workers on community employment schemes. According to the report there is a big problem in this area. The funding recommended would be well spent and it would be appreciated if the Minister for Education and Science would designate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange an urgent debate on waste disposal with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in attendance. The urgency of the problem is evident, given that the regions are having extreme difficulty with landfills. In view of the impending disposal of meat and bonemeal it is becoming a crucial issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to advise the House on what is happening to the railway provisions in the national development plan? My area has been denied the Luas light rail project but has been promised an underground metro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should probably be underground with Senator Norris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">

      <P>Is it an invitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen many nice brochures and colourful plans but no timescale has been indicated. Extra lines are to be provided for the Arrow service from Heuston Station to Sallins. However, like St. Thomas, I must see, touch and experience before I believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that adding to the proposal for Senator Norris? The Senator will have great fun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a discussion early in the new session on the impact of regionalisation. The <Col N="1280" /> south east is the most underfunded region in the country&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has finally realised it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;in terms of road and rail infrastructure and the take-up of third level education. The statistics for the south east are abysmal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator blamed us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for a debate on the south east in particular but on the impact of regionalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The south east has the best hurlers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not abused the Chair on the Order of Business&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I never said I would be brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one promise the Senator has kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate early in the new year on the possibility of introducing Question Time once or twice a week to discuss matters raised on the Order of Business. Perhaps this issue must be discussed first at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That would be one of the most appropriate ways of dealing with me in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Callanan call for a debate on incineration. This side of the House has asked time and again for an honest debate on that subject and for the Minister to come before us and tell us his thinking. We know he supports incineration, but his own people are voting against it. We would like him to clarify the position and Fianna Fáil's policy. I am delighted to support the call for such a debate. Senator Callanan will get an opportunity during the debate from 1.30 p.m. to 4.15 p.m. to discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Senator now that I am in favour of incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the biggest burning issue in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Callanan's request for a debate on waste management in the context of the beef industry and our responsibility to deal with some of the discharges. I also support Senator McDonagh's point about the literacy <Col N="1281" /> requirement for community employment or FÁS schemes. This is an important issue which should be dealt with.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard in the past 24 hours about the sale of the TSB and the ICC. The TSB was formed when the Cork Savings Banks and the Dublin Savings Bank amalgamated. I would like to know from the relevant Minister if the original shareholders of these banks will get any money back. It is only right and proper that we should have a debate on what the people who set up the banks should get.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on waste management. I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House as a matter of urgency to discuss this issue. I ask the Leader when he proposes to have a debate on the BMW region. It is only fair, in light of what Senator Lanigan said, to have a debate on the regions, particularly the BMW region which is a special area in terms of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The BMW region is ten times better off than the south east in terms of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not rubbish. It is statistically correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's call to report back on Nos. 1, 2 and 3. It is a good suggestion. As regards No. 16, I hope to have this matter clarified today and I will come back to the leader of the Opposition later.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on the legislation governing immigrants. I will leave time for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on Northern Ireland. I was extremely impressed by the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the debate on Northern Ireland the week before last. I thank all those who took part in the debate which we will remember for a long time. There is no time available to have the issue debated before the Christmas recess. However, <Col N="1282" /> we will judge the situation as matters move on early in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely called for a debate on alternative energy such as wind farming given the difficulties that will arise in relation to that issue. I will make time available for this debate. I will pass on the views of Senator McDonagh to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senators Callanan, Coogan and Chambers called for an urgent debate on waste management and waste disposal. We are all aware that this is a very pressing problem for local authorities. I will consider this debate for either Tuesday, 19 December, or Wednesday, 20 December, before the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>I will pass on the views of Senator Ridge to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke. Senator Lanigan called for a debate on the impact of the regionalisation programme. I may be able to allow time for this debate on 21 or 22 December.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan expressed his opinion on the TSB Bank and ICC Bank buy-out. As I said yesterday, most small and medium sized family businesses owe their survival and present day success, including the employment this has provided, to ICC Bank in particular. I hope the new purchasers of ICC Bank and TSB Bank will be the caring banks they have been in the past in dealing with small and medium sized family businesses. People involved in small and medium sized business throughout the country would not be in business today but for the understanding of ICC Bank.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked for a debate on the BMW region. With the permission of the House, I will include that debate with Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on the impact of the regionalisation programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris moved an amendment to the Order of Business: &ldquo;To delete item 1 and substitute a debate on immigration policy&rdquo;. Is the amendment being pressed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), line 6, after &ldquo;subject&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in particular to Article 23.2 and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These are the most important amendments. The purpose of the Bill is to provide protection for children and to ensure that parental responsibility matters and that enforcement orders, decisions and judgments can be implemented in a reciprocal fashion between two contracting states.</P>

    <P>The other side of the coin is equally true &ndash; that a contracting state, for whatever reason, may have made a decision that might not necessarily be in the best interest of the child. Normally we must recognise the decision of that foreign court, <Col N="1285" /> but there is a little loophole here in Article 23.2 of the convention which gives some protection in a situation of this nature in that it enables us to refuse to recognise such a decision if we think it is not in the best interest of the child. I am sure no jurisdiction would do this for the wrong reason but it may well arise from time to time. I propose to make specific reference to Article 23.2 which allows us to refuse recognition so that, if something of this nature arises, we can draw the attention of the courts to the matter and to the entitlement as we deem appropriate in this respect.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is similar and is self-explanatory. It states: &ldquo;For the purposes of the Convention any requirement which is not in the opinion of the court in the best interests of the child shall be deemed to be manifestly contrary to public policy.&rdquo; That is something we should ensure. Because of the nature of the contract between the two contracting states under the convention and the possibility of this arising, it is important we introduce those two caveats or protective measures into our domestic legislation to ensure the interests of the child are paramount.</P>

      <P>We must bear in mind that this is an attempt by this country to adopt and accept the convention. Within that convention, there are many international bodies of law from various countries, whether Monaco or the Czech Republic, which I understand has already accepted it. Senator Costello's amendment is attempting to modify the convention rather than adopt and accept it. The tenet of the Minister's speech last week and the purpose of this legislation is to ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>Each country will have a different legal system. For example, Great Britain and Ireland have the common law system. We have a very similar system to Wales, Scotland and England. Some European countries have a different system of law which is based on the Napoleonic code. The American and Canadian systems are a cross between the Napoleonic code and the common law system.</P>
      <P>Children are clearly paramount in the Bill but we must also accept that we cannot modify the convention to suit ourselves. We are adopting the convention and we have to suit it rather than have the convention suit us. If Senator Costello's amendment were accepted, it would be a direct attempt to interfere with or in some way water down the convention. That would be incorrect and would be the wrong approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of give and take. We will be accepting the laws of Monaco, the Czech Republic and other countries and, consequently, our laws may have to adapt to international laws rather than international law being modified or weakened to suit Ireland. I fully agree with my colleague that the interest, safety and well-being of children are of paramount concern here but the Bill amply covers this while realising that we have to accept the Hague Convention. While I understand from where the Senator is coming, the <Col N="1286" /> amendment is inappropriate and unacceptable to our side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 would require the District Court to have regard in particular to Article 23.2 of the Convention in determining whether to recognise or enforce a measure taken by a competent authority in another contracting state under section 3(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Bill. Section 3(2)(<i>b</i>) already requires the District Court to exercise its jurisdiction pursuant to chapter 4 of the convention which will have the force of law in the State by virtue of section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 comprises Articles 23 to 28, inclusive, of the convention. Consequently, it is clear that the basis for the exercise of the court's jurisdiction in such cases is to be found in those articles, including Article 23.2. Article 23.2 gives the ground on which recognition may be refused.</P>
      <P>If I were to accept the amendment, the effect could be that it would require the court to exercise its jurisdiction by reference to Article 23.2 above and beyond provisions in the articles I have mentioned. This seems to be an attempt to qualify the convention. On that basis the amendment is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, the words &ldquo;manifestly contrary to public policy&rdquo; are to be found in two separate articles of the convention, namely, Articles 22 and 23. Article 22 enables the court to refuse application of the provisions on applicable law, if application would be manifestly contrary to public policy, taking into account the best interests of the child. Article 23(<i>d</i>) enables a court to refuse to recognise a measure taken by a court or authority in another contracting state if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy taking into account the best interests of the child. Therefore, if the court here is asked to consider the &ldquo;manifestly contrary to public policy&rdquo; exception in the convention as specified in those articles, it is required to assess that exception taking into account the best interests of the child. Section 2 of the Bill gives the force of law to the provisions of the convention and this includes Articles 22 and 23.</P>
      <P>The issue that is raised in the amendment is in part already provided for in the convention, and it will be part of our domestic law by virtue of section 2 of the Bill. However, we cannot go further than is provided for in the convention and allow the court to refuse to apply the relevant law or to recognise and enforce a foreign order in circumstances other than those provided for in Articles 22 and 23. In other words, we cannot adopt an<i> à la carte</i> approach to the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve its purpose, the convention obliges contracting states to accept the principle that the authorities in all contracting states are equally capable of ensuring a fair hearing to the parties involved and a skilled and humane evaluation of the issues of child welfare involved. It may be that in certain cases the jurisdiction of the Irish courts <Col N="1287" /> is ousted in favour of the jurisdiction of authorities in other contracting states under the convention. Consequently, it will not be possible for Irish courts to conduct an inquiry into the welfare of a child in all such cases, the principle being that the authorities of the country with which the child has a closer connection, usually the country of the child's habitual residence, are better placed to do so. This is not unusual because it can and does arise under another Hague convention, the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, which has been part of our law since 1991. That Act, in this connection, has on several occasions been upheld by decisions of the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill, for its part, has been examined and approved by the Attorney General. The Convention on the Protection of Children requires that rights conferred by virtue of the law applicable in the contracting state and measures taken by authorities in a contracting state shall be recognised by operation of law in all contracting states. The virtues of such a system of automatic recognition are simplicity and certainty in the context of orders relating to the welfare of children. It is based on the assumption of mutual trust that the courts exercising jurisdiction under the convention will do so responsibly. This is not an absolute rule, and there is a degree of flexibility enshrined in the relevant provisions. Article 23, for example, specifies six instances where recognition may be refused, most notably those including exception where recognition is manifestly contrary to the public policy in a requesting state, taking into account the best interests of the child.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to water down the convention or to undermine or qualify it in any way. I do not think any of the amendments I have tabled is directed in that way or could be interpreted in that fashion. The amendments are designed to focus on the implementation of the legislation in this jurisdiction. This is enabling legislation, a framework Bill for the implementation of the Hague Convention on the protection and welfare of children. All of us have stated that our concern is the best interests and welfare of the children concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said the jurisdiction of the Irish courts could be ousted by another jurisdiction &ndash; I am not sure if those were the words she used. Effectively what this convention means is that we have to accept the jurisdiction of a foreign court. We must do so with care because countries have different legal systems and different approaches to child welfare. We ourselves have been late in the day in cherishing all the children of the nation equally. The Children Act, 1908, is still in operation and the criminal age of responsibility is seven. Decisions of a court in a foreign jurisdiction will be at variance with decisions taken in our courts. There is no doubt about that because every country is at a different stage of development in relation to child welfare <Col N="1288" /> and the enforcement of children's rights and protective measures. It is proper for us in this House to draw the attention of the Irish courts to an area where a difficulty might arise.</P>
    <P>I understand only two or three countries, besides ourselves, have signed up to the Hague Convention. Whatever about reciprocal arrangements between jurisdictions, we do not know the legal mechanisms operating there or the degree of child care in those countries. It is appropriate to ensure that the attention of the courts is drawn to the protective measures. Certainly Article 23.2 appears to provide the most protection in that there are grounds on which recognition or enforcement of decisions can be refused. If that is contained in the convention it is appropriate that the enabling legislation should reflect that also. What is the purpose of the enabling legislation unless it incorporates the convention and the core of the legislation is the protection of children's welfare? We are prepared to accept decisions of other courts but where there is a caveat let us direct the court's attention to it. It is in the best interests of the children that a particular reference should be given to protective measures whereby we can refuse to recognise or enforce a particular judgment.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting to undermine the convention or to qualify it but rather to ensure it operates in the best interests of Irish children.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this convention is to be a model for all jurisdictions. It addresses a long-standing problem by setting out a clear and uniform system set of rules. At present there are 14 or 15 states in Europe and beyond that there are several jurisdictions which have different rules. As Senator Costello rightly pointed out, the Children Act, 1908, is outdated. I am pleased the Minister mentioned that he proposes to bring in new legislation to deal with that. It is important that this legislation deals with civil law and not criminal law. Primarily, we are dealing in this convention with civil law regarding the custody of children, access and maintenance. We have a mobile society and many people reside in my constituency who come from all parts of Europe and beyond. It is important to have a uniform system in place in Europe. The convention is the model and this and other legislation is an attempt to raise our rules and laws to the model of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Senator Costello is anxious to protect the interests of children and that there should be a fall back whereby our legislation would take precedence over the convention. If that were to be allowed, and if every other country in Europe were to apply the same rule, the convention would break down. The convention is trying to create a level playing pitch in the interests of children in all these matters. The thrust of the convention would be defeated if each state were to build into its law an opt out clause when ratifying it. The convention is a model, the purpose of which is to create a uni<Col N="1289" /> form system of rules and regulations which will apply across Europe and beyond in the best interests of the children.</P>
    <P>We may be somewhat tardy in ratifying the convention but Ireland will be only the third country to do so. The Labour Party amendments may unwittingly weaken or water down the power of the convention. That may not be the intention but it could be the upshot.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Donovan has got to the core of what is at issue here. The <i>quid pro quo</i> is that a foreign court would enforce our decisions. The point Senator Costello is missing is that the authorities of the country with which the child has a closer connection, usually the country of the child's habitual residence, are better placed to take these decisions. What Senator Costello is saying is tantamount to claiming we should review the merits of the decisions of foreign courts. As Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, would we like it if the decision of an Irish court regarding a child whose habitual residence was here were to be reviewed in Monaco? Senators must accept that we are talking about whether to accept the convention. If amendment No. 2 was consistent with the convention it would have appeared in it.</P>
      <P>The convention may sometimes involve us in recognising and enforcing judgments of foreign courts. Equally, it may involve foreign courts recognising and enforcing judgments made in our courts with regard to children who have a closer connection to this country. It is important to recognise that the courts involved will have assessed the interests of the child in a different way in cases where a child is situated in Ireland or has closer connections to here or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>Senators must appreciate that if court decisions in other jurisdictions were to be reviewed on their merits here or decisions of our courts were to be reviewed elsewhere, then the convention simply would not work. The Senator's amendments qualify the convention and this is not permissible. There is no point in our pretending to sign up to the convention and then trying to qualify it, or in other countries doing the same.</P>
      <P>Senators must accept that the <i>quid pro quo</i> is that foreign courts will enforce our decisions. It is particularly important Members note that without this convention they may not do so. The benefit from our point of view, with regard to the children who have a closer connection with this country, is that foreign courts will enforce our decisions and that without the convention they might not.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us refer to my first amendment. Article 23.2 of the convention gives some protection because it states the grounds where we can refuse recognition and enforcement. The convention already recognises the possibility of what I sought to focus on in my amendment. Some protection is given in Article 23.2 to cases where recognition can be refused if it is deemed appro<Col N="1290" /> priate. It is important to require the courts to have regard to this provision. That is not qualifying the legislation or saying that the courts in our jurisdiction will make their own decisions. I am simply drawing the attention of the courts to this section.</P>
      <P>In my last analysis there is only one purpose of this legislation, to try to improve the welfare of children. I am sure that decisions made by foreign courts will be enforced in this jurisdiction 99% of the time. I am also sure that decisions made in this jurisdiction will be enforced in foreign courts that are contracting parties. Is there anything wrong with drawing the attention of the courts to the fact that this article is in the convention and that they should take cognisance of it?</P>
      <P>My amendment is not qualifying. It is highlighting, focusing and telling the courts that the best interests of the children are paramount. We want to ensure that this convention results in protecting the children of our country.</P>

      <P>Section 2 of this Bill states: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Convention shall have the force of law in the State&rdquo;. However, it does not specify the area. It is very different to have legislation that has a broad framework and is enabling. It is important to specify where the interests of children could be examined by the courts and to bring this matter to the attention of the courts. There is nothing in this legislation that even suggests that. We should state this in the Bill and ask the courts to take particular cognisance of Article 23 when it is a question of enforcement or the recognition of a decision.  </P>

The text of legislation focuses on the core of the particular aspect of policy. All legislation is like that.

It does not mean that you are undermining anything or wrong to present legislation that focuses on and highlights particular provisions.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's argument. I know we will not go any further with my amendment because I cannot see her accepting it. However, my amendment is important and if it is left out we could find ourselves enforcing and recognising decisions made by a foreign jurisdiction in the future. Perhaps we will rue in the future that we did not insert an amending provision in this legislation to protect against those decisions. They may cause us difficulties in the future.</P>

That report was published on 15 January 1997 and this date should be inserted in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there was an interim report or a previous document published. However, it should be tied down in greater detail than at present, which would improve the legislation. It would also make it easier for researchers and others trying to find the seminal document. This is an excellent report by Professor Paul Lagarde on the background and framework of the convention. The first question a librarian would ask someone looking for a report would be the date it was published. The publication date would be of considerable advantage in dealing with this matter, which is important in terms of interpreting the convention.</P>

Unfortunately, some of its reports lie gathering dust but many of them are taken into consideration when legislation is being drafted. I have never seen a particular Irish Law Reform Commission report or its publication date referred to in legislation. My colleague's amendment is unnecessary. The Lagarde report is unique.

This amendment gives the Bill the necessary clarity, by simply including the words &ldquo;the 15th day of January, 1997&rdquo;, which is the date on which he published his report.

In the circumstances, I do not accept the amendment, as it is clear from the section what report is being referred to. There is only one explanatory report.

      <P>In page 8, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" />&ldquo;(3)The Central Authority shall take steps to inform the public of its services.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the establishment of the central authority. The purpose of the central authority is &ldquo;to perform in the State the functions conferred on it by this Act or by virtue of the Convention&rdquo;. I presume that should read &ldquo;and by virtue of the Convention&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;or&rdquo;. Will the Minister of State refer to that in her reply? The section goes on to state that the Minister can perform the functions herself or himself prior to the establishment of the central authority.</P>
    <P>The central authority is envisaged as the body that would deal with the whole operation of this legislation and the convention. As I said before, the purpose of this legislation is to deal with children and families. It is very important that its provisions, resources, supports and the funding available to help families ensure their children get the best deal out of the convention be publicised as broadly as possible. In past cases where lawyers were employed at great expense, the availability of free legal aid was not highlighted sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I am not qualifying the legislation but pointing out the provisions that need to be highlighted because they will affect people. People regularly move between states and this legislation will be used on a much wider basis than would have been the case ten or 20 years ago. Families and children travel to a much greater degree now and it is very likely that there will be an increase in the number of contracting countries and the number of incidences in which there will be reciprocal matters to be dealt with by the courts, decisions made, measures taken and enforcement orders dealt with. It is important that the services to be provided by the central authority are highlighted and publicised as widely as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a reasonable amendment. Many State services advertise to the public, although not as many as we would like. As this is a complicated area involving families where abduction may occur, it is important that the services to be provided be public friendly, so to speak, and clearly known. Proactive steps should be taken by the central authority to ensure that the public is aware of its existence and function.</P>

      <P>There is a distinction between the central authority dealing with child abduction and the new central authority dealing with the protection of children. The numerous functions of the central authority under the convention are specified in the various articles. Article 30 is relevant to this amendment. It requires central authorities to co-operate with each other and to promote co-operation among the competent authorities in their states to achieve the purposes of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This last provision will have practical importance because it will require the central authority in the state to inform the various other authorities of its functions and to ensure that in this connection there is a delivery of the service that may be <Col N="1295" /> necessary. This may extend, for example, to such matters as the need to provide a report on the situation of the child or to consider the need to take measures for the protection of the person or property of the child. The measures of protection may include the placement of, or the provision of care, for a child. These matters are fundamental to the operation of the convention.</P>
    <P>It will be the duty of the central authority to engage in communications, largely on an inter-central authority basis, and, in the State on an institutional basis. It follows from this that the central authority will, as a matter of course, be engaged directly or indirectly in information exercises provided for in the convention. There is no need to make it mandatory on the authority to inform the public about its services. We can rely on it to use its good sense and discretion in the light of experience as to whether and what type of information needs to be given to the public about its services. We should avoid being prescriptive about the role of the authority because it is set out in the convention and this is given the force of law by section 2 of the Bill. For these reasons I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>What plans has the Minister of State to establish the central authority? Section 9(2) states, &ldquo;Pending the appointment of the Central Authority the Minister shall perform its functions&rdquo;. Despite the specific requirement in the convention that the two central authorities in contracting states co-operate, and the provisions regarding their mutual role in that respect, we may end up without a central authority.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed with the Minister of State's preference for not having a specified requirement included in the Bill. She says we should not be mandatory or prescriptive but should leave it to the good sense or discretion of the authority. What is meant by that? Our function here is to legislate, not to leave it to the discretion of anybody.</P>

      <P>The convention does not specify the role in terms of communicating to the public the provisions of the central authority and, given this, enabling legislation should do so. Our function is to ensure that best practice on the implementation of the Hague Convention in relation to the protection of children is put in place. We will be negligent if we do not direct the central authority, which will have the major role in dealing with the central authorities in other countries, in the conduct of its business. A major function of the authority is to communicate its services to the public so that all those who may be affected by the convention will know of the role of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is too vague on this aspect. I hope she will indicate when the central <Col N="1296" /> authority will be established because we do not want it to function by ministerial diktat <i>ad infinitum.</i> We also need to know that the authority will let people know what it is going to do.</P>

      <P>There is much merit in Senator Costello's remarks. Will Irish, English and international law change the old maxim <i>ignorantia juris neminem excusat</i>, ignorance of the law excuses nobody? I have often heard defendants plead ignorance of a law or by-law in the District and Circuit Courts, but it affords them no defence.</P>
      <P>I understand the Senator's concerns about the need to publicise rights and so on. Most weekends in my advice clinics I meet many people, especially the elderly, who are unaware of their basic rights, for example, with regard to their pension and savings entitlements. This Bill covers an international convention that deals with probably no more than 3% or 4% of the population. One way to publicise it is for the Houses to promulgate the passing of the legislation. Even if advertisements were placed in the national newspapers and local newspapers such as the<i> Southern Star</i> or the <i>Kilkenny People</i>, people would still wonder what was involved two years later.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the central authority will mean that the important agencies, such as the courts, probation officers and health boards are aware of its existence. This will assist most of those affected by this legislation. If, for instance, a couple in Germany separates and one partner moves here to live resulting in a civil law dispute over custody, maintenance, access or whatever else, it is my experience that most such people are very well informed, including in their knowledge of the law.</P>

Under the convention it will be the duty of the authority to engage in communications. When we ratify the convention we must establish a central authority and implement the provisions in the convention governing it. We will consider when the central authority should be established. When <Col N="1297" /> we ratify the convention, we must have the central authority in place. However, we must also be practical.</P>
      <P>During debate on legislation in recent years we have spoken about authorities such as the new Equality Authority or the National Disability Authority and the question of the date of establishment always came up after the passage of the legislation.

The Senator can rest assured that when we ratify the convention, we must have a central authority in place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5: </P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(4) A solicitor shall not provide a service which may be obtained free of charge from the Central Authority without first informing the client that the service is so available.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the previous amendment and is designed to publicise the extent of the services available from the central authority. This arose in the child abduction case where I understand a solicitor embarked on an expensive case without availing of the civil legal aid available. It is important for solicitors to inform their clients if there is a free service available before they embark on an expensive international set of proceedings, as happened in the child abduction case.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to clarify what level of free legal aid will be available from the central authority. Proceedings which involve two contracting states can be expensive if difficulties arise. At least one client incurred considerable expense in the child abduction case, although legal aid would have been available if the solicitor had bothered to inform the client. This amendment would prevent that happening in the future. We should ensure that families are protected against the possibility of expensive court proceedings when the State can provide funding for them. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the level of legal aid available to such families.</P>

There could be a serious gap in the information available to a person affected by this legislation. They may have to pay expensive fees or costs when they do not need to do so, particularly if the central authority provides the service. If the central authority was allowed to advertise its services &ndash; the Minister of State will not allow that because she did not accept the previous amendment &ndash; it might not be necessary to seek to include this type of amendment in the legislation. This amendment attempts to inform the public of an important fact which could save <Col N="1298" /> them a lot of money. An example was given in another case where a client or appellant had to pay expensive costs when they did not need to do so. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will come to that in a moment. A solicitor would not be involved with the central authority on a day to day basis. A solicitor would be involved in a prior hearing of the court, so there would not be a need to be directly involved in the workings of the central authority. Perhaps the Minister of State might verify that.</P>
      <P>Tomorrow evening my apprentice, a young bright girl from west Cork, will receive her parchment in the Four Courts. This has led me to think about how long it is since I qualified. I have been qualified for 23 or 24 years and I have not yet met a client who asked if they had to pay. If they cannot pay, one must ascertain if they are entitled to free legal aid. The judge will decide, based on certain criteria, if a person can afford to pay and, if so, he or she will not get free legal aid.</P>
      <P>There is a fairly comprehensive system of free legal aid, perhaps not in rural areas where I practise but in Dublin in particular where barristers make a better living than Senators or Deputies from the free legal aid system. The figures reported in the newspapers are frightening. It would be foolish for any solicitor, where free legal aid is available, not to advise his or her client because he or she might not get paid. If a solicitor does not get a free legal aid certificate before a court hearing and tells the judge afterwards that he or she had four days in court with Joe Soap and gave him so many hours of advice for which he cannot afford to pay, the judge will tell the solicitor to forget it. A barrister or solicitor would be foolish not to advise a client about the availability of free legal aid, particularly if there is a likelihood they will not be paid. It has happened to me on a few occasions that a person was not able to pay.</P>
      <P>I remember going to Clare on one occasion to defend a neighbour's son in a relatively minor matter as they were afraid he might get a custodial sentence for a silly act. He could not afford to pay me as he was a student. I took it on the basis that I win some and I lose some. I did it out of the goodness of my heart. If payment comes from a source, whether it is free legal aid or otherwise&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was my mistake. If a person is entitled to free legal aid, it is the solicitor's fault if he does not inform them. From my experience, 99.9% of people will say they cannot afford to pay and will ask about free legal aid. Sometimes people will look for free legal aid although they are not entitled to it. If a client has money and they can afford to pay, they will not get free legal aid. The criteria are quite strict in this regard.</P>

      <P>The assumption in this amendment is that a solicitor would provide services of the type prescribed in the convention to be carried out by the central authority. The special functions so prescribed are not of the type which could be provided by a solicitor. Examples of the functions of the central authority, as set out in Chapter 5 of the convention, are to co-operate with other central authorities and to promote co-operation between relevant authorities in their own state. That is provided for under Article 30.1. Another function is to provide information on laws and services relating to the protection of children under Article 30.2. A third function would be to facilitate communications between national authorities about the exercise of the jurisdiction to facilitate mediated solutions and to provide assistance in finding out the whereabouts of the child in Article 31. A fourth and final function would be to provide directly or through other relevant authorities a report on a child situation or request a competent authority to take measures for the protection of that child under Article 32. They are four examples of the functions of the central authority which could not be carried out by a solicitor.</P>
      <P>It is clear from these provisions and other provisions of the convention relating to the functions of the central authority that its role is inter-institutional with its own authorities, such as the health boards and the Garda authorities and the central authorities and competent authorities in other contracting states. To clarify the issue for Senators Connor and Costello and outline what Senator O'Donovan has said, it is not a role which could be carried out by a private professional such as a solicitor. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Senators raised concerns in relation to costs and so on which are matters for the Legal Aid Board. However, the normal rules will apply. As Senator O'Donovan pointed out, if there is a need to go to court &ndash; under the legislation that court would be the District Court which would be at the lower end of the scale in terms of fees &ndash; in relation to an order, etc., parallel to what the authority is doing, one would be talking about the District Court and the application of normal legal aid rules. For obvious reasons I cannot accept the Senator's amendment because it states that a solicitor shall not provide a service which may be obtained free of charge from the central authority. This is not a role they could carry out. Therefore, the amendment is incorrect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said. However, it is not clear where the distinction lies between the role of the central authority and that of the legal service. One can imagine a situation where a decision on a child has been taken in a foreign jurisdiction. Naturally, the family would consult with their family lawyer or another lawyer, whether a solicitor or a barrister. It is natural that when dealing with a foreign jurisdiction legal services might be sought by those concerned. I do not accept what the Minister of State says that the central authority deals with everything. The central authority does not deal with everything because there are always points of law. We are talking about the enforcement of measures and decisions in other jurisdictions. If this is exclusively the role of the central authority, why do we not communicate and publicise that fact widely so that lawyers cannot get in on the act? Perhaps there should be a prohibition on lawyers getting involved. Where an expense might be incurred and where a service is already being provided by the central authority, there should be an onus on the lawyer to inform the family seeking his or her services &ndash; this service could be expensive because we are talking about international jurisdictions &ndash; that the service can be provided by the central authority.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if what the Minister of State is saying is accurate, that is, that the legal profession has no role to play. She is saying that the role of the central authority could not be provided by a solicitor. There are aspects of the role of the central authority which could be provided by a solicitor because there are legislative aspects to the work of the authority. Solicitors deal constantly with health boards, the Garda and the provisions of the law. If someone in this country is dealing with a country in the European Union or in central Europe, they would want to employ someone with the necessary expertise to represent them. In such an instance, the normal choice would be the family lawyer. The same applies if one is ill where the family doctor is the normal choice. Can the Minister of State give some idea of the personnel who would liaise with a family in this type of situation? Who would communicate to them the full provisions, services, supports, funding and legislative back-up which they might need to satisfy themselves that the matter is being dealt with adequately? It is not clear that there will be any level of communication through the central authority for those who need it most.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has not outlined how the central authority will work. She has just made a couple of general statements on the issue. This is a human situation, dealing on a person to person basis. There is concern about children which involves legislative decisions such as enforcement orders in foreign jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should spell out how the provision will work, including the child abduction issue, so that the Senator will see the differences between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> Under the Child Abduction Convention, central authorities arrange for the institution of legal proceedings on behalf of an aggrieved parent with a view to obtaining the return of the child. Unless the contracting state has made a reservation to the convention, any legal assistance is provided free of charge by the central authority. Consequently, the administrative burden and the cost of having to engage a lawyer to initiate legal proceedings in the contracting state in question is removed from the applicant. However, the applicant is free to engage his or her own lawyer to initiate such proceedings if he or she wishes without recourse to the central authority. While the Irish experience has been that in some cases the parents choose to go to the trouble and expense of engaging a lawyer, the reality is that in the vast majority of cases they leave that to the central authority. This relates to the Child Abduction Convention.</P>
    <P>Under the 1996 convention, applications to courts for recognition and enforcement orders will be a matter for the parties themselves rather than the central authority. Consequently, the individual litigant will not be able to rely on the central authority to institute proceedings and will in most cases have to engage a lawyer to apply to a court in the contracting state where he or she wishes to have the order recognised and enforced. In that case, under the convention, the task of the lawyer will be greatly facilitated in that he or she can proceed in the certain knowledge that the courts in all contracting states are operating under the same rules and not under varying national requirements as happens at present. Thus, if a lawyer applies to the courts of another contracting state, for example, to have an Irish custody order recognised and enforced in that jurisdiction, the rules governing that court's determination of the matter will be those set out in chapter 4 of the convention. The foreign court will be required to recognise and enforce the order except in exceptional cases to which Article 23.2 applies. In addition, the foreign court will be obliged to apply a simple and rapid procedure. These provisions will also benefit Irish lawyers in advising clients regarding the enforceability of Irish orders in other contracting states.</P>
    <P>The Senator is saying that in his opinion a solicitor can do what the authority can do. For example, we are talking about the protection of the child. The measures of protection may include the placement of or provision of care for that child, therefore, the central authority would be in contact with the relevant health board in terms of taking the child into care. That is not a role in which a solicitor could become involved; it is an inter-authority role. That is a fairly clear example of what I am talking about. This is not a role which could be carried out by a solicitor, therefore, if one engaged a solicitor to deal with inter-institutional work, he or she would advise people to contact the central authority whose role that is. It is clearly a different role.</P>

      <P>While in the ordinary course there is merit in construing sections of legislation in Courts Acts with the relevant provisions in other legislation for the purpose of construction and collective citation, I am advised that the amendment sought by the Senator is not required.

The subsection provides for the collective construction and citation of certain sections of the Bill within the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts and since the Bill was passed by the Dáil the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 2000, has been enacted.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 6, after &ldquo;subject&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in particular to Article 23.2 and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I proposed a similar amendment on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to protect against the situation in which a different ethos existing in another jurisdiction might not be in the best interest of a child, in terms of an enforcement order or recognition of some decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I disagreed about the intent of the measure. However, my intention is not to interfere in any way with the provisions of the Hague Convention. The amendment does not seek to qualify the provisions of the convention as the Minister suggested. The purpose is to focus on what needs to be done. As I said, the purpose of all legislation is to focus on particular areas that need to addressed. Article 23.2 gives a level of protection where the enforcement of a decision taken in another jurisdiction would not be in the best interests of the child. My amendment would ensure that is brought to the attention of the courts, which is appropriate for us as legislators.</P>
      <P>The difference in approach to child care and the welfare of children in terms of the legal profession and the laws in another jurisdiction is the only serious drawback in the legislation. Legislation in relation to children's welfare is in different stages of development in different jurisdictions. As I said earlier, the Children Act, 1908, is still operative. Senator O'Donovan said it related to criminal rather than civil matters. However, the 1908 Act deals with many civil matters.</P>
      <P>Ireland is backward in certain areas in relation to the protection of children. The fact that the criminal age of responsibility in Ireland is seven years rather than the norm in other countries indicates how backward the country is in that regard. Progress has been made, but the legislative provisions in some areas are still backward and I hope they will be updated in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increasing number of countries are becoming contracting states under this legislation and the disparity between legislation in relation to the custody, welfare and protection of children will be greater all the time. Undoubtedly, difficulties will arise and we will find that decisions made in other jurisdictions are not in line with best practice in this jurisdiction. If that happens, there should be a focus on the protections that are available to ensure that the interests of the child are paramount. The amendment does not materi<Col N="1306" /> ally qualify any legislative provision incorporated in the Bill or the Hague Convention. It seeks to draw attention to decisions in foreign courts that may not be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Costello's case is well made. The amendment would not in any way interfere with the legislation; it would only reinforce part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 23 specifies six instances where recognition may be refused. These provisions were carefully drawn up by international experts because they were aware of the necessity for exceptions to the general recognition rule. This is the area about which Senator Costello is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is not open to a contracting state when implementing the convention to qualify these rules or to give a higher priority to certain rules when implementing the convention. If every contracting state adopted such a course, the benefit to be derived from the convention would be totally undermined. However, the amendment tabled by Senator Costello is unnecessary because the subsection to which it relates provides that, in deciding whether to recognise and enforce a foreign measure, the District Court must act pursuant to chapter 4 of the convention, which includes Article 23.2. It is not necessary to highlight Article 23.2.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello is concerned that the court would ignore or forget about the article if it is not highlighted in the Bill. However, it is unrealistic to think that a court might ignore or forget about Article 23.2 when it is considering a foreign measure. The court must act pursuant to chapter 4 of the convention which includes Article 23.2. It is not necessary to highlight this aspect as suggested in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the Minister and I differ. She said that the amendment would qualify the provisions, but my view is that it would not be a qualification. It only highlights this aspect. The function of all legislation is to highlight certain important provisions. The amendment would not interfere with the thrust of the convention and it would not in any way change the provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to state that the measure is incorporated in the convention. The function of this enabling legislation is to direct attention to the convention's provisions. The core of the Bill is how the central authority will operate and the legislation dwells on that aspect. Why should it not also dwell on the protective measures? The purpose of the Bill is to protect the interests of the child. I disagree with the Minister's interpretation that it would be in any way an interference with the Hague Convention if the Bill directed the attention of the courts in this jurisdiction or the central authority to areas where there might be a difference of approach in relation to the wel<Col N="1307" /> fare of children and which might not be in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>This would not interfere with the legislation. It only highlights the provisions in the Hague Convention which are considered important. The amendment only directs attention to them. I expect the central authority will be to the fore in carrying out its duties and providing services. However, this does not mean that the services should not be publicised as widely as possible to all those who are likely to benefit from them. Likewise, the people who will benefit from the services need the maximum amount of protection within the parameters of the Hague Convention and the amendment highlights where that protection exists.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and her officials for guiding the remaining Stages of the Bill through the House. I also thank Senator Costello and other Opposition Members. There was a full and frank discussion on a number of amendments. Part of the Opposition's criticism was that it has taken a long time to enact this legislation. However, it is important to note that Ireland is only the third state to ratify the Hague Convention. It is timely that Ireland is to the forefront in that regard. The Bill is child centred. Extreme difficulties have arisen following the abduction of children. These involved protracted rows which ended up in the courts and that is not in the best interests of children. The legislation will minimise the difficulties in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I also thank the Minister of State for coming to the House on budget day. It is a difficult task at any time, but particularly so today. I also thank her officials for their work on this Bill. It is fine legislation and all the points raised during the debate were dealt with courteously and in considerable detail. The Minister of State was willing to elaborate on all the points raised.</P>
      <P>As Senator John Cregan has said, we have been critical that the Bill was not introduced earlier when it could have been. Nevertheless, he was quite right in saying that we will be the third state to ratify this convention and I suppose that is good. The provisions of the Bill are very welcome and I have no doubt they will be beneficial to many people here. Again, I thank the Minister of State.</P>

The Minister of State showed her usual knowledge of the brief and her concern about the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have a new task for the Minister of State. Will she go back to the Department and try to do something about the Convention on Human Rights which has been languishing for far too long?

What was important this morning was that the protection of children was central to everything about which we talked. It has always been at the heart of the concerns of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, which was responsible for drawing up the convention that led to this legislation. A positive aspect of everything the convention is about and what we are about is the protection of children. I thank Senators on all sides for the usual positive and interesting debate on this important legislation and for their contribution in making a difference to the protection of children.</P>

    <Title>Council of Ministers' Agreement on BSE: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to discuss this issue in this House today and I am sure that all Senators will contribute in a constructive way to this important matter. The debate allows me to describe, in some detail, the approach taken by the Government in controlling and eradicating BSE, to ensuring that the health of consumers is protected and assuring the quality and safety of our beef. It also provides me with the opportunity to address public concerns in relation to BSE arising from recent events in Europe where a number of issues, including the higher number of cases of the disease in France, the recent confirmation of cases in Spain and Germany and unilateral actions by some countries, have seriously affected consumer confidence in these and other countries. Furthermore, it gives me the opportunity to outline the measures being taken at EU level to deal with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will be aware that BSE was identified as a disease in cattle when it was first reported in <Col N="1309" /> the UK in November 1986. The first case of BSE here was confirmed in January 1989. In that year, a total of 15 cases were confirmed and for the next six years, the number of cases remained at between 14 and 19 per year. From 1996, the number of cases increased and for this year to date, the total number of cases stands at 126 with three further cases detected under the programmes of testing animals from depopulated herds.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the higher numbers this year, I am confident that the comprehensive range of measures we have in place is proving effective. In the first instance, the overall incidence of BSE continues to be extremely low with a total of 561 cases since 1989 in a cattle population in excess of 7.5 million each year. This compares with a total of more than 177,000 in the UK and a peak of more than 37,000 confirmed cases in 1992 alone in a cattle population of 12 million. To put our position into perspective, the disease incidence here represents 0.0012% of our total cattle population.</P>
    <P>The higher number of cases here this year was foreseen in the recent report of the European Union's scientific committee which predicted a temporary increase in numbers for the next couple of years from animals infected prior to the measures introduced in 1996 and 1997 taking full effect. That committee also concluded that the Irish system was optimally stable from 1998, meaning that the measures in place since then prevent the agent of BSE from reinfecting cattle.</P>
    <P>Most experts agree that, notwithstanding the temporary increase in the numbers of cases, the increasing age profile of BSE positive animals detected is of more significance. To date, no animals born after 1996 have been detected with BSE, and an ever increasing proportion of infected animals are six years of age or older. This supports the scientific steering committee's conclusion that the Irish control system is optimally stable, and we have the various control measures in place to protect consumers.</P>
    <P>From the earliest stages, we have had an extensive range of surveillance and control measures to deal with BSE and these were very significantly revamped in 1996 and 1997 in the aftermath of the announcement of the possible link between BSE and the new variant CJD. The Irish control and eradication system is among the most comprehensive in the world.</P>
    <P>These controls which operate at a number of levels have been widely publicised and include the culling and destruction of all herd and birth cohorts of animals infected with BSE; the removal and destruction of SRMs from all bovine and ovine animals and a comprehensive and effective range of measures which ensures that ruminants could not be exposed to rations containing meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>In addition, all cattle presented for slaughter at meat factories are subjected to an ante-mortem inspection by veterinary officials of my Department. Animals showing signs of ill health which give rise to a suspicion that they may be affected <Col N="1310" /> by BSE are returned to the farm, put down and tested for BSE. All casualty and emergency cattle presented for slaughter are, in any event, rapid tested for the disease and carcasses are retained until a test result is received showing that BSE is not present. I will outline later the further measure we will be taking in the light of the conclusions of the Agriculture Council earlier this week.</P>
    <P>The events of recent weeks in Europe which gave rise to unilateral actions by France, Spain, Austria, Italy and Germany are symptomatic of the tremendous political pressure being brought to bear in member states to introduce measures which they see as necessary to reassure their consumers. It must be remembered that these concerns were not based on any new information or scientific developments as regards BSE or CJD but rather on a desire to demonstrate that actions were being taken.</P>
    <P>It was critical, in the light of these events, that the Council of Ministers should move quickly to re-establish a Community approach to dealing with BSE by adopting a series of supplementary measures to help to restore consumer confidence in beef. In the first instance, the Council met for 17 hours on 20 and 21 November, following which it issued a statement emphasising the wide range of measures already in place to control BSE and noted the importance of effective implementation of these measures. The Council welcomed the Commission's proposal to extend rapid screening tests for cattle at risk and to extend it to categories of cattle aged upwards of 30 months.</P>
    <P>The Council also considered the national measures adopted by a number of member states. It was agreed that these would be evaluated by the EU Scientific Steering Committee and a decision would be taken by 30 November either on their admissibility or a further strengthening of Community measures.</P>
    <P>The Council reconvened on 4 December to consider further Commission proposals which included the following: a temporary ban on the feeding of meat and bonemeal to all farm animals, a requirement that all animals over 30 months are tested for BSE, a requirement that the current list of specified risk materials be expanded to include the entire intestine of bovines of all ages, a &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not been tested for BSE, a flexible handling of intervention to address the fall in producer prices, raising the advances for beef premia from 60% to 80% and requiring the testing from 1 January 2001 of all &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; animals from 1 July 2001 for all animals over 30 months.</P>
    <P>We have consistently stated that we believe the correct approach to managing this situation is to adopt an EU-wide, science-based approach. This is preferable to and certainly more effective than sporadic, un-coordinated, unilateral actions by individual countries on, at best, dubious scientific grounds. On that basis, we welcomed the pro<Col N="1311" /> posals while seeking to ensure our particular concerns were addressed.</P>
    <P>At Monday's meeting and following prolonged and intense negotiations, the Council reached a series of conclusions which I believe are critical to protecting public health and restoring consumer confidence in beef at EU and other levels. The conclusions also provided for the introduction of support for the beef market. They covered a wide range of issues among which were the extension of the ban on the use of meat and bonemeal in feed for cattle and sheep to all animal feed on a temporary basis, agreement on a framework for the lifting of national measures by certain member states, agreement to the Commission decision for a rapid BSE detection test for bovine animals over 30 months and the need for Community funds for financing tests, animals over 30 months can go to the food chain only if tested.</P>
    <P>The Council noted the proposal to carry out purchases for the destruction of livestock over 30 months in order to provide an alternative outlet for such animals. The compensation payment to producers for such animals would take account of the different types of animals and markets and the measure will attract 70% financing from the European Union and 30% from the national government. The Council also decided that it is essential to introduce intervention, the details of which will be decided at the beef management committee on 12 December 2000. The Council took the view that beef producers are likely to be adversely affected by the market situation and called on the Commission to report on the situation and to make proposals to the Council which undertook to act on these as a matter of urgency. The Council called on the Commission to examine the question of alternative proteins for farm animals and to bring forward any appropriate proposals.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the divergence of views among Ministers, it was essential that this particular Council reached a successful conclusion and that the full range of issues which had arisen from the most recent BSE crisis were adequately addressed. In my view, the agreement provides an improved framework for protecting human and animal health and restoring consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>We now need to finalise the arrangements at EU level and to proceed with implementation of what is agreed. The Minister has already announced his intention to introduce an expanded testing regime at the earliest possible date before the EU do so. There are various logistical and operational aspects to be addressed in putting a major testing programme in place and I am hopeful that these and the financial aspects can be finalised quickly.</P>
    <P>As regards the ban on meat and bonemeal in all animal feed, I should clarify the position on this aspect. For many years, we have had a comprehensive range of controls in place to ensure that ruminant animals in Ireland do not have access to feeds containing meat and bonemeal. <Col N="1312" /> One of the facts to emerge from recent events in Europe is the difficulty that some member states have had in relation to the implementation of their meat and bonemeal controls. This relates largely to their failure to eliminate the possibility of cross contamination of ruminant feeds in feed mills which were incorporating meat and bonemeal into feed for pigs while at the same time manufacturing ruminant feeds.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, meat and bonemeal has been subject to stringent controls both in terms of its production and its use. These controls have been inspected by a range of external bodies, including the FVO and veterinary services of countries to whom we export beef products, all of whom have deemed them to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>As regards production, the controls required that the material used to make the meal meets certain standards and excluded all risk organs known as specified risk materials, SRMs, and that the product was manufactured to approved scientific standards based on time temperature parameters &ndash; heating to 133ºC at 3 bar pressure for 20 minutes.</P>
    <P>In terms of use, there have been strictly applied controls involving the licensing of any person manufacturing, incorporating, storing or feeding this meal. In addition, manufacturers of feed for cattle and sheep were forbidden from using meat and bonemeal. Non-ruminant feed rations containing meat and bonemeal could not be manufactured on the same premises as ruminant feed.</P>
    <P>Full-time Department staff have been based in rendering plants and a series of mission visits by the EU Food and Veterinary Office indicated satisfaction with Irish BSE controls, including those on meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>Neither the EU Scientific Committee nor the FSAI's BSE sub-committee has recommended a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal for non-ruminant feed. However, and in view of the difficulties being experienced in many other member states which do not have comparable controls to ours and the central role played by the product in the wider BSE issue, the Commission proposed and the Council accepted that meat and bonemeal should be banned from all farm animal feed for six months.</P>
    <P>The Minister voted at the Council for this proposal, which will apply across the European Union. However, the difficulties in implementing the proposal here should not be underestimated. Heretofore, some 140,000 tonnes of commercial meat and bonemeal are produced each year. In the short term, animal waste will have to be processed and stored at a significant cost and the policy represents a major potential risk to the environment. This reinforces my view that we need urgently to put in place arrangements for ultimately disposing in Ireland of all BSE material and other animal wastes. In effect, this means thermal treatment facilities of some sort. Without such facilities, we will soon face environmental and waste management problems of an unprecedented scale.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> As the Minister said last week, it is nonsensical to expect that we can have the economic and the social benefits of a multi-million pound livestock industry without having suitable arrangements for dealing with the animal waste generated by such an industry. We are the only country in Europe without such facilities. I was heartened by the contributions on this issue from all parties in the Dáil last week. At face value, these suggest that all now accept that incineration facilities are essential. I only hope that this consensus will continue to apply at local level when proposals to deal with this issue are brought forward. One often finds that one is for it nationally but not locally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be one of the people to object in my county.</P>
      <P>Details of the &ldquo;purchase for destruction&rdquo; scheme have not been fully elaborated. I regret that it has become necessary to consider such a regime given the range of measures we already have in place and our reliance on the livestock sector. However, we will be participating at EU level in the further development of this proposal which will attract 70% financing from the EU.</P>
      <P>This policy has to be viewed in the contexts of consumer protection and the market situation. On the one hand, it has been accepted that cattle over 30 months will not be allowed enter the food chain unless they undergo and are negative to one of the rapid tests. On the other hand, there are logistical problems to testing all such cattle in the short term, while there is also reduced demand for beef products. The Commission is accordingly proposing the purchase for destruction of cattle over 30 months which have not been tested and also envisages extension of this programme to tested animals if the market so requires.</P>
      <P>The details of the scheme have not been finalised and it is not possible to say at this stage whether it can be limited to certain categories or regions. I might add that we estimate that there are 1.8 million cattle over four years of age in the national herd.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the debate will, I expect, relate to food safety and the assurance we can provide to the consumers of Irish beef, both at home and abroad. I have referred the comprehensive range of measures in place in Ireland to ensure the product of Ireland's cattle and beef sector reaches the final consumer with the maximum guarantee as to its safety. It is only by ensuring that correct measures are in place and that they are properly implemented that we can give the necessary assurance about the safety of our product. It is only when the consumer recognises that this is the case, and feels confident in the final product, that the market can be restored to normality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that food safety is an absolute prerequisite for any food producing industry. The <Col N="1314" /> Irish beef sector recognises this and has fully embraced and supported the measures put in place over the past years to deal with BSE. There is a lot at stake. Last year beef exports were worth close on £1 billion, excluding European Union export refunds. Direct payments to the sector amounted to £450 million in the year and will increase substantially under Agenda 2000 over the next few years. There are about 100,000 farmers whose livelihoods depend on the industry at primary production level, with a further 5,000 employed in the processing sector.</P>
    <P>Following the BSE developments in 1996, Ireland succeeded in regaining all of its major markets throughout the world. We exported to over 60 countries, many of which have sent their experts here to examine our systems on the ground and have found them to be acceptable. Unfortunately, our continued access to some markets, notably Egypt, has become entangled with concerns as regards the BSE situation in Europe.

      <P>Unfortunately, our continued access to some markets, notably Egypt, has become entangled with concerns as regards the BSE situation in Europe. We are making every effort to ensure our continued access to this market as evidenced by the visit by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to Cairo immediately following this week's Council meeting.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that our producers are facing particular difficulties and that the sector will suffer disproportionately in the current crisis. The Minister brought this to the attention of his colleagues on the Council this week. We will be seeking to ensure that the undertakings in relation to adequate market support will result in an effective and meaningful intervention arrangement. We will also be pressing the Commission to evaluate the consequences of the current crisis for our producers and to make appropriate proposals to deal with these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a control and eradication system which is among the most comprehensive in the world. It has been examined and endorsed on a number of occasions by the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission and others. <Col N="1315" /> In addition, Ireland is recognised by the World Animal Health Organisation as having a low incidence of BSE and our cattle have been in high demand in markets throughout the EU and elsewhere. Given our high level of exports, our systems and controls have been subjected to in-depth examinations by a number of the countries to which we export product. We also operate our controls in close association with the FSAI, with whom we are in constant contact. Our arrangements will again be audited by the FVO next week.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, we are not complacent as regards BSE. We are open and transparent about the situation and we will take further measures as appropriate to protect consumers and restore confidence. At the same time, the relevant experts and I take some comfort from the fact that the fewer number of BSE cases aged five years or less this year tends to confirm the views of the scientific steering committee that we can expect to see a reduction in the number of cases from 2002. A very clear pattern has emerged in that regard.</P>
    <P>It remains the Government's clear objective to eradicate BSE at the earliest possible date. We are fully aware that the protection of the consumer and the well being and importance of the beef industry are at issue. I must emphasise that there is no resistance in the industry to new controls which will improve the situation. It recognises that without consumer confidence the sector has no future. In the meantime, the various controls in place will be strictly enforced and enhanced as appropriate by measures such as the ban on meat and bonemeal and the BSE active surveillance programme to provide appropriate protection to consumers at home and abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for facilitating this very important debate for which I have been calling for some weeks. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for giving us a comprehensive overview of the BSE problem.</P>
      <P>Without doubt BSE is the biggest national crisis facing this country. Our taxi drivers may have their moans and teachers may lobby about their percentages but, from a national perspective and taking a long-term view, the BSE crisis is the biggest issue facing this Government. I have no doubt that it will cost the country a huge amount of money. So many people's livelihoods depend on agriculture but the most important people in this debate are the consumers, the people who buy the product at home and abroad. Our national Exchequer will lose revenue. I will approach this topic from this angle and that of primary producers this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of the beef industry to the economy cannot be understated. Beef accounts for well over 50% of our agricultural output and makes up to 90% of our total agricultural exports. Nowhere else in Europe does beef production form such a vital element of agricultural activity. <Col N="1316" /> The fact that Irish beef is accepted throughout the world is a testimony to the quality of our produce. No other beef producing nation has such optimum conditions for rearing quality grass fed beef. Our natural environment gives Irish producers a special place in the beef market. The low fat and high nutritional content of Irish beef, which has been vindicated on several occasions but only recently by Teagasc following research work at Grange, is something of which our farming community can be proud.</P>
    <P>Since BSE re-entered the headlines throughout Europe Irish beef has been served a blow. In less than a fortnight cattle prices have fallen by up to 15p per lb. The farming organisations estimate that £600 million has been wiped off the Irish cattle herd. In the interests of cattle farmers Ireland must lead the way in terms of minimising the risk of BSE contamination of our beef.</P>
    <P>We are here again discussing the BSE crisis. The consumers are a very important part of this debate. This time the panic has spread in Ireland, France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Fingers are being kept crossed that beef consumption in the UK and Ireland will continue to survive unscathed but I doubt this will be the reality. The effect on cattle prices in Ireland is the same as it was in 1996 which is not so long ago. We all remember the BSE crisis of 1996 because Ireland's dependence on the export market is huge.</P>
    <P>In 1996 primary beef prices fell by 15p per lb. but the price of cows did not fall as much. Unfortunately, the price of cows is going through the floor now and prices are lower than at any time during the 1996 period; the price drop has already gone far below 1996 rates. That year prices continued to fall throughout the summer but they did not have the same severe effect as the present price drop. At that time, export refunds were worth 64p per pound, compared with 37p per pound today.</P>
    <P>Three or four weeks ago, Dawn Meats was speaking to farmers about the possibility of establishing supplier groups. There are many producer groups throughout the country producing top class beef. The Department and the Minister have urged this from time to time. Cattle were put into sheds this year on the basis that 97p or 98p per pound would be paid. These farmers are facing a very severe winter and spring.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the then Minister, Deputy Yates, took the issue of compensation to Europe. We have seen no instance of similar action in this crisis. He got compensation of a slaughter premium of £50 per head. He also got £50 per head in the special heifer premium scheme. That was all additional money. I note the Minister of State waving a sheet at me. However, the reality is that it was extra compensation which the then Minister, Deputy Yates, fought hard for in Brussels and succeeded in getting. That is what we need to put in place to restore confidence in the agricultural industry. Hundreds of farmers are meeting in the <Col N="1317" /> Minister of State's constituency and others and they are hugely concerned. An observer at a meeting last night told me of the dejection of farmers at the lack of action in relation to a special compensation package.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, recently announced a package of £4.70 on a suckler cow and a £3 a head special beef premium. This will not compensate for the huge drop in income suffered by the agricultural industry. I know the Minister, Deputy Walsh, cannot be here today. I urge the Minister of State and the Department to do everything to bring in a proper compensation package.</P>
      <P>I will refer to some of the other issues raised by the Minister of State in his comprehensive address. I welcome the positive position he has adopted in relation to incineration. The reality is that we have to deal with the 140,000 tonnes. It is up to the Minister of State to move on the incineration issue because this cannot be allowed pile up or be exported. I understand this was welcomed on both sides of the Dáil. Given that the Government has the necessary backing for this action, it should not be afraid to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State touched on several aspects of the consumer issue. We have failed, no matter what Bord Bia or the Department might say, to spell out to our home consumers, never mind the export market, the safety of our beef. The truth is that the young beef sold across the counter in butchers' shops in Dublin or the country cannot have BSE. However, the ordinary consumers shopping for their Sunday joints this week are worried. They read newspaper headlines such as &ldquo;Increase recorded in BSE cases expected&rdquo; and &ldquo;November's figures worst ever recorded&rdquo;. What are the consumers to think? We have failed, as a nation, to properly explain the safety and high standards of our beef. Across the country, people are changing to alternative foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1318" /> The Minister of State spelled out in his speech that, according to all the research that has been done, the young beef sold in butchers' shops is as safe as it possibly could be. We have failed to tell that to consumers and to alleviate their fears and worries. The Department and the Minister have failed to address those newspaper headlines and the adverse publicity the BSE situation got this week.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone to Cairo to try to convince the Egyptians of the safety of our cattle. I hope we will get some word of how that meeting went before the end of the debate. I am amazed, given the existence of e-mail and faxes, that there has been no word from the Minister. That means there must have been some failure. If the Minister does not succeed in this regard, the Taoiseach should move on it. The record of this Administration in relation to guaranteeing export markets has not been as good as some Senators might tell us. If the Minister fails in this regard &ndash; which is quite possible because there has been no indication to the contrary &ndash; the Taoiseach should intervene and, if necessary, travel to secure this market. The stock we have in this country needs markets such as Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries.</P>
    <P>We are facing a major crisis. We need to be more open and transparent, rather than have consumers questioning whether we are showing the figures or are afraid of testing. We should not be afraid to give the best meat and produce to our consumers. I know this is a very difficult, tricky and involved exercise. I hope Members on both sides will not use this debate to make political points. I hope the rest of the debate will be constructive and I am delighted it is taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to these statements on BSE. This has been very serious for our cattle population, especially in terms of cattle prices and the livelihoods of farmers. It is important to ensure consumer confidence in our beef.</P>
      <P>The deadly seriousness of the BSE disease was brought home once again when it was discovered for the first time in French, German and Spanish cattle. This has led to hysterical consumer reaction in these countries and hurried decisions by their governments to ban certain animal feeds. The potential impact on demand for beef and the implications for Ireland's primary industry have been underlined by the Government's decision to introduce the BSE test for all cattle over 30 months in an effort to assure consumers that the Irish product is safe. This costly exercise is necessitated by specific evidence that bonemeal foodstuffs are responsible for the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has already operated a strict herd slaughter policy along with clinical testing in factories and the disposal of risk material. The additional measures, to test all cattle over 30 months, to remove all cattle over 30 months not tested for BSE from the food chain and the new improved testing methods will go a long way to <Col N="1319" /> assure consumers that Irish beef is BSE free. I applaud the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for his swift and decisive action in supplementing the comprehensive range of controls in Ireland by expanding the surveillance control programme for BSE in advance of the EU Commission's requirement to do so. This underlines the necessity to proceed with the utmost care with policies framed at EU and national levels. Policy must be responsive, but it must also be open and transparent, otherwise consumer confidence will not be restored and that will not serve the interests of farmers and other producers.</P>
    <P>The EU Commissioner with responsibility for food safety, Mr. David Byrne, has developed a deserved reputation for level headed and careful regulation in this highly sensitive area. The best guarantee that EU policy can respond effectively is to ensure that it is endorsed by member states rather than being pursued in haste at unilateral level. Farmers' representatives have pointed out how vulnerable the industry is to collapses in demand, as indicated by cattle prices. The Government decision to introduce universal testing reinforces the idea that strengthened controls can reassure consumers.</P>
    <P>Farming methods have become so industrialised that farmers must not be surprised if successive problems impact on credibility. This area also requires careful regulation to restore the trust of consumers. Some farmers behave irresponsibly, but thank God they have abandoned ways of making quick profits by using growth promoters and such like. It did not look well to see two farmers prosecuted for injecting cattle with illegal substances to enable them secure more compensation. While they got away lightly, it is right that such farmers should be penalised. Heavy fines and penalties should be imposed for such activities.</P>
    <P>Scientists and industry spokesmen point out that the number of BSE cases in Ireland is tiny compared to the size of the national herd. The Minister of State said the disease incidence here represents 0.0012% of the total cattle population. This minimal percentage reflects the stringent controls applied over the past four years. The age of cattle is crucial as it allows for testing of the scientific theories about how the disease is prevented. The Minister of State's assertion that cattle born since 1996 have not proved positive to testing for BSE is welcome. It augers well for the future of our industry and exports as it means that we will have no BSE problems in future years.</P>
    <P>If that picture were to change we would face a more damaging crisis of confidence. The latest episodes reinforce the case for the urgent introduction of EU and national controls on the basis of strict scientific criteria. EU Agriculture Ministers have agreed to ban the feeding of meat and bonemeal to farm animals in an attempt to halt the spread of BSE. However, when they met in Brussels last Monday night they were at odds <Col N="1320" /> about how much compensation farmers should receive for loss of income due to the crisis. The Minister voted in favour of the meat and bonemeal ban, but he told the meeting that the imposition of such a wide-ranging ban would have considerable implications. It is proposed that the compensation payment to producers should take account of different types of animals and markets. This is very important. Previous compensation packages for brucellosis or TB breakouts would not adequately compensate farmers affected by the BSE crisis. Nevertheless, I congratulate the Minster on securing the proposal to 70% fund a compensation package from the EU.</P>
    <P>A sudden change in the status of meat and bonemeal presents us with an enormous environmental problem in terms of dealing with the slaughter of animals and with a product that will inevitably be stockpiled. There are no incineration facilities in Ireland for this produce and it is doubtful if sufficient capacity is available elsewhere in the EU. I am pleased to note that the EU Council of Ministers has called on the Commission to examine the question of alternative proteins in animal feed and make proposals in that regard. The replacement of animal proteins will present serious problems, but protein is essential in any animal feed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the ban on meat and bonemeal, the Ministers agreed to remove from the food chain all cattle over 30 months which have not been tested for BSE. This is important to ensuring consumer confidence in beef. Beef sales have collapsed and many EU countries have banned meat imports from member states, which will hurt Irish farmers very badly. Given that we produce so much beef and the small size of our population, we must export 90% of our beef production. This makes our beef sector highly vulnerable to market downturns, consequently this crisis has already impacted severely on the Irish beef market and it is expected to deteriorate further. Cattle slaughters have fallen significantly and the backlog of cattle on farms is beginning to take on serious proportions.</P>
    <P>This is very serious when one considers the early start to this year's winter. Cattle have been housed in sheds since September because of the very inclement weather. This has never happened before. While fodder stocks were high due to a good harvest, at least 40% of the winter supply has been fed to cattle. If this weather continues it could cause farmers serious problems.</P>
    <P>The decision by Egypt, which is Ireland's biggest export market, to suspend import licences on all EU beef was a serious blow to Ireland. However, I was delighted to read the headline in today's newspaper, &ldquo;Walsh confident Egypt will relent&rdquo;. The article states that the &ldquo;Minister for Agriculture was confident last night, following talks with his Egyptian counterpart, that Ireland's £200 million beef trade with Egypt will be restored&rdquo;. He is coming home from Cairo today but I am sure he will ensure the restoration of such an important market for our beef industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Senator Tom Hayes made a reasonable contribution, but he said the Minister would fail. The Minister has never failed. We congratulated him on the Agenda 2000 negotiations which secured great benefits for Irish farmers and Irish agriculture. This achievement should not be overlooked. The best thing I remember about the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is his statement that he was in Dublin Airport when he was not there. He is a remarkable man because he can be in two places at the one time. The Minister will definitely tell the truth and he will do a good job to ensure&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing with this problem adequately. Animals born after 1996 have not proved positive to BSE testing. Testing on animals over 30 months is important to ensure the eradication of this disease and consumer confidence in the beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Other Senators will be aware that I have taken an interest in this topic since I have been in the Seanad and I have not heard the consumer mentioned so many times as today. I have frequently asked for debates on this issue from a public health point of view, but I did not have any success. We are in a serious situation. When <Col N="1322" /> I spoke on this issue a couple of weeks ago I said what Des Geraghty said last night, namely, that the pharmaceutical and computer industries may take wings from here, but the one industry which will stay here is the beef industry. I cannot understand why we have dealt so badly with this situation and with so little transparency or concern for the consumer either at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>There is no good blaming other countries for the situation in which we find ourselves. There is no point saying the Egyptian ban would not be in place if BSE infected animals had not been found in Germany. We must look at it from our own point of view because there is no other country in Europe which has more to lose and is losing more than our own.  </P>
      <P>In 1990 meat and bonemeal were banned in animal feed for ruminants. However, that ban was not enforced strongly enough. I realise we do not know the history of this disease so we are learning as we go along and probably will for the next 20 years. The lack of enforcement of that ban, which led to contaminated bonemeal being made for pigs and poultry and then the subsequent feed, which might have had only one or two grammes of infected bonemeal, being fed to cattle, meant it was 1996 before a proper ban was in place. I do not know how long I have been asking for a total ban on meat and bonemeal, which has now been introduced by our Commissioner, David Byrne. Last week I said he was doing a great job and he deserves all the praise we can give him. He got a brief which was supposed to be easy but it must be one of the most difficult in the Commission.</P>
      <P>We must be seen to take this meat and bonemeal issue seriously. It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, has a herd of pigs on a farm where there was also a dairy herd and which were fed meat and bonemeal. I am sure the practices on that farm are excellent but, from a publicity point of view, it was appalling as far as consumers were concerned. Only 17 farms throughout the country have these licences. I do not know how many hundred farmers produce pigs, but they must be furious that this small number of people continue to feed meat and bonemeal to their animals because they will now have trouble selling pigmeat.</P>
      <P>In 1996 we took the situation more seriously because the UK admitted it had ten cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. I was sorry to hear the leader of the IFA say on television that the correlation between new variant CJD and BSE had not been proved. How long did it take us to prove that tobacco smoking caused cancer? If there is a good suggestion it is causing it, we must go along with it until someone tells us otherwise. To try to dismiss that there is any connection is extraordinarily foolish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the age was given every time we say how many animals have died in a month because animals under 48 months have not died for a long time. One would not expect any animal born after <Col N="1323" /> 1996 to be infected. This is an older animal disease, particularly an old cow disease. No one will buy old cow meat because we cannot let it get into the food chain. It is used for mince, burgers and pies, which are the foods the most vulnerable of consumers, children, are likely to eat.</P>
    <P>I do not know what we will do with this mountain of meat. While the purchase for destruction scheme is good for animals over 30 months, we must remember this will be applied across Europe and if we start killing everything over 30 months at the same time, we will have an appalling glut of meat in Europe. Perhaps the Department, when it is in discussions, could concentrate on the animals most likely to be at risk, such as those which were given feed in the early 1990s, and try to get rid of the old cows which are at the end of their useful life. If they prove to have been infected we should test their progeny. We must do this in a logical manner, otherwise there will be a huge glut of meat which cannot be frozen and put into intervention. We must apply this measure rationally.</P>
    <P>The Enfer test, which this country established, is excellent. This test is quick and, if applied within four hours of the animal being slaughtered, it will indicate whether the animal was infected. We must consider what to do within abattoirs or meat plants. If one animal is infected, what will be done about subsequent animals and the machinery which has been used on them? What will be done with the saws? We must take this issue into account because it matters more to us than anywhere else in the world. If we do not take deal with the matter, we will suffer most.</P>
    <P>The Enfer test is very good but it only detects animals which are infected and animals which are likely to show the disease within three months. It will not indicate any more than that; therefore we must encourage more immediate research in this area. There is an excellent unit in UCD where Dr. Mark Rogers should have all the support he needs. This is vital. What progress is being made in testing live animals, which is very important? We cannot wait for others to deal with this issue. It is a pity we did not introduce this test earlier. The Swiss introduced a similar test during the summer which shows prions, called prionics. They are now six months ahead of us. It is unfortunate that we are not dealing adequately with this issue which is so important to us.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Enfer test is designed for older animals. It is not designed for young animals, a factor which we must keep on researching. I am pleased that we are eventually beginning to test fallen animals. We must ask if these animals fell because they were staggering and if that is why they broke their legs. It was very difficult for anyone who discovers they have BSE on their farm, despite the compensation scheme. However, we must establish what an animal dies from; the farmer cannot say the animal had pneumonia and died. All animals must be <Col N="1324" /> tested and we must establish what they died from if we are to restore consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>I do not have cattle or even diseased old cows, but I believe the scheme which is being offered is generous. We should not just talk about controlling this disease &ndash; we must eradicate it. We can do this. We are an island nation and we can definitely get co-operation from Northern Ireland to tackle this issue.</P>

      <P>We must try to eradicate this disease.</P>
      <P>There are unfortunate reports about other methods of transmission. Vertical transmission has been almost ruled out because, where this transmission to the calves was suggested, the cows were so diseased they would have transmitted anything, or there is the possibility that the calves when young got meal that was affected. I believe we can dismiss that theory. There is a report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that the EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr. Franz Fischler, has scientific confirmation that BSE can be transmitted when the excrement of infected animals enters the water table. Given that we have been burying animals &ndash; we are aware of the drama in the west where an animal had to be dug up &ndash; we must research this aspect immediately. We must research whether prions can be distributed in ground water. This is a dreadful matter and we cannot let that statement stand.</P>
      <P>There is also the possibility of further mutations. It was reckoned that a mutation within a cow which got into meat and bonemeal and the feed chain in the early 1970s started the problem. I do not know if this is true but I suppose it is as good a theory as that of scrapie. Any such statements are serious, particularly if they come from the EU Commissioner. We should have people checking on the sources of these statements because many animals have been buried throughout the country in the past four years. When these animals were buried, it was thought there would be no problem. If these statements are true, it is a very serious matter. We must refute these statements if there is evidence to do so. If the statement is true, we must carry out research to see what can be done to clean up the ground water.</P>
      <P>We cannot just have a PR exercise. This is such a serious issue that we must tackle it as forcefully as possible. It is important to remember also that it is not just an Irish or European problem. When the UK exported meat and bonemeal to the Continent, a considerable amount of it was packaged and distributed internationally. However bad the problem may be for the developed world where there is more than enough to eat, imagine what it will be like in under-developed countries if it gets into their herds. The outcome will be astonishing.</P>

      <P>This is a most serious situation. We must eradicate the problem on this island, not control it. When we begin to test these cattle, the numbers will increase for a few years. However, this will mean short-term pain for longer-term gain. Old cows are the real problem at present. We must begin to deal with this issue by enforcing the legislation. We must appoint more environmental health officers and Teagasc staff to deal with this problem. This is a very important industry which is seriously damaged at present. We must take the lead in dealing with this serious issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss the whole beef industry, particularly the BSE issue. I was very interested in what Senator Henry said because I am aware of her great concern in relation to this issue, particularly from the point of view of public health. Her contribution was both consistent and enlightening.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the beef industry is vital to our economy. Some 50% of agricultural output comes from the beef industry, of which we export 90% to approximately 55 or 60 countries throughout the world. That gives an indication of the importance of the beef industry. It is because of that importance that we must take the issue so seriously.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry is correct that containing or controlling BSE is simply not good enough. We must get rid of it for once and for all and not have a repeat of what has been happening with TB for so many years. That is simply not on. We must face up to the reality that if we adopt that approach, we will not have a beef industry in five years' time.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State outlined the history of BSE as far as we know it. It was first recorded in the UK in 1986, while the first case was recorded in this country in January 1989. The degree to which BSE has been monitored in Europe indicates that the incidence of the disease is by far the greatest in the UK. I understand that there have been approximately 177,000 cases of BSE in the UK out of a herd population of 12 million. In this country there have been in the region of 560 cases out of a herd population of 7.5 million. Other countries have also recorded cases of the disease.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the accuracy of the figures relating to the incidence of the disease. Senator Henry referred to &ldquo;fallen&rdquo; animals. Why do such animals fall? Do we have accurate knowledge of the real situation that obtains in other countries? The current BSE crisis has come to the fore mainly because of problems in France and Germany. How accurate are the figures emanating from those two countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of difficulties being experienced in other countries we should not try to ignore our responsibilities, particularly in view of the fact that Ireland is a major exporter of beef. Given that our agricultural and food industries and the <Col N="1326" /> economy in general are extremely dependent on beef exports, we must eradicate BSE once and for all. The quicker we do so the better.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted in this country in relation to combating BSE are, by any standard, quite stringent. One of the best moves we made was to ensure that when a case was reported the entire herd from which the animal came and its cohorts were destroyed. That was a very drastic but positive step. Its effectiveness is borne out when one considers the incidence of BSE recorded in the UK this year. In the region of 90% of the cases recorded in the UK during 2000 were from herds in which there had been outbreaks of BSE in the past. The action to which I refer is what is required in order to eliminate the disease.</P>
    <P>I was interested by the call made last evening by the chief executive of the Food Safety Authority for all cows over four years of age to be destroyed. That would be a drastic move but the scientific evidence and information available &ndash; limited though they may be &ndash; show that we have not had a case of BSE in an animal born after the ban on the use of meat and bonemeal was imposed. It was on that basis that Dr. Wall of the Food Safety Authority made his proposal, which deserves serious consideration because drastic action is needed if we are to overcome this disease. I am not suggesting that we should kill all animals over four years of age but we should give careful consideration to Dr. Wall's remarks.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Henry's observation that there is a need for further research. I accept that considerable research is being carried out into BSE but it is not enough. We are not getting results, we do not understand the disease or how it is transmitted and we do not know how to deal with its aftermath. Several Members referred to a case in Galway where an animal infected with the disease was buried. At the time in question, the burying of that animal appeared to be the right thing to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the traditional method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. The farmer spread lime in the burial pit and used the proper utensils in accordance with general practice.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that animals infected with BSE must be slaughtered and incinerated. Anybody who says that we cannot incinerate them is living in cloud-cuckoo-land and engaging in pure buffoonery. We must build an incinerator in this country in order to allow us to control the disease. I will not contemplate any arguments that suggest otherwise. We will make no progress if we allow the buffoons to emerge victorious on this issue. It is time people realised the seriousness of the BSE crisis and the importance of the beef industry to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public health is the most important aspect of this issue. It is particularly important that anybody who consumes beef or any form of food can do so confident in the knowledge that they will <Col N="1327" /> not experience any adverse effects. All food must be treated in the same way. Problems exist <i>vis-á-vis </i>the consumption of beef which have arisen as a result of spurious claims, questionable scientific research and irrational media coverage. People should be cautious about what they say when discussing this issue. We do not want to scare members of the public and give them the impression that their health is in great danger, particularly if that is not the case. That is why it is so vital, as Senator Henry pointed out, that further research is carried out. We must ensure that people report on this matter in a proper and constructive fashion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the moves announced at the Council of Ministers' meeting earlier in the week. The European Union is going in the right direction but we need to go further. I accept the Minister of State's comment that the EU wants member states to move as one on this issue. However, I am not prepared to wait for Europe on it and I believe we must move on it ourselves. We must ensure that people across the globe can buy Irish products, confident, in so far as is possible, in the knowledge that they are safe. I do not believe that it can ever be stated that any product is 100% disease free. However, in so far as is possible, we must state that Irish products are safe.</P>
    <P>There are a number of further issues on which I wish to comment. I am concerned about the attitude of the EU Commission to the measures put forward at the Council of Ministers' meeting. Does the Commission intend to implement these measures in full?</P>
    <P>If we are to address this disease and the problems associated with it in a serious matter, we must take into account all the measures to which Members have already referred. However, we must also ensure that the industry survives this crisis in a way which will allow it to continue to operate. In my opinion the beef industry is about to be affected by a serious shock with which we must be prepared to deal. We must bring producers, processors and consumers together to formulate a course of action because everyone has a stake in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>I suggest that a tripartite approach must be adopted. It is vital that compensation should be paid to producers on foot of the difficulties they are experiencing at present. Those difficulties are not of their own making. Having said that, however, we must ensure that rogue farmers are removed from the food production process in Ireland. People who inject their cattle or tamper with them in any way&mdash;</P>

If we do not adopt a serious approach to this matter, the perception will develop in other countries that we are not serious about eradicating BSE. Our competitors will use whatever means they can to undermine confidence in Irish produce.</P>
      <P>Meat and bonemeal should be banned totally and permanently for ruminants and non-ruminants. This will present us with a problem of disposal added to the problem of disposing of slaughtered animals. Incineration is the only way to dispose of this waste material and we must move in that direction. However, until we have adequate incineration facilities we will be faced with the problem of rehandling the increased volume of waste material.</P>
      <P>Extra testing will reveal more cases of BSE. The increased number of cases in the past 12 months was to be expected but the number of cases will double or even triple in the next two or three years. What are we going to do with waste material in the interim? Other countries will have to dispose of their own waste. As beef producers we must take responsibility for the disposal of waste material from the beef industry and not ask others to do it for us. Ireland is a major beef producer and must act as such.</P>
      <P>We must move beyond the measures being proposed and implemented at present. We need more research and information and we need to incinerate our own waste material.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members wish this debate was not necessary. We are discussing a national crisis in one of our most vital industries. There are 100,000 beef producers in the country and the trade is worth hundreds of millions of pounds in export earnings. I am reluctant to use the word disaster to describe the present situation. I hope it will not get worse.</P>
      <P>Ireland has introduced some of the best and most comprehensive measures in the world to deal with BSE. We took those measures in 1996, on the initiative of the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Ivan Yates. The same procedures were not followed in the other EU member states. Most of those states were in denial about BSE in their own territories and took little or no action. The inaction of France, for example, a country with a huge agricultural sector, was disgraceful. Germany, although a powerful industrial country also has a large agricultural sector. That country was also in denial with regard to BSE. Other EU countries had instances of BSE but they did not wish to admit this was the case and they did not introduce procedures for dealing with the disease. A BSE animal has been allowed to get into the food chain in France and this has triggered the current crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the major sufferers from this crisis and we must take every possible step to reassure consumers. I join in the condemnation of the sections of the media which are interested only in scaring people. A food scare story is a great story for the <Col N="1329" /> section of the media which has no moral qualms about what it says. I read recently that customers in supermarkets in Italy even avoid the meat counters, so greatly have their fears been aroused by media comment.</P>
    <P>The problem is a serious one and I compliment the Government on the steps it is taking to deal with it. However, the position of the Minister for State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, is embarrassing. The Minister of State has done a good job. In the last three years he has toured the country promoting food quality assurance schemes. Nevertheless, he has been found to have a farm &ndash; and I am sure he farms very progressively &ndash; which uses meat and bonemeal. The Minister of State has done nothing illegal, but a terrible message has been sent to the country and to consumers. If the Minister of State had the true interest of the industry at heart he would leave his office of his own volition. If he is unwilling to do that he should be removed from office by the Taoiseach. This is a harsh thing to say but we are in a drastic situation. Such an action is one of the harsh and costly measures we must take. As part of the cost of this crisis someone whose name is, unfortunately, embarrassing to the industry should take action to reassure the consumer.</P>
    <P>Like the crisis of 1996, this one impacts most of all on farmers. I am a farmer myself. Like most of the Members taking part in this debate I was elected to this House on the Agricultural Panel. We must be cognisant of the interests of farmers. In 1996 I was part of an Administration which put in place two major measures and drew down from the EU 850 million in one tranche and more than 550 million in another in a Europe-wide scheme to deal with the BSE crisis. We were fighting a lone battle for funding at that time. Britain did not make a good case for funding at the Council of Ministers, nor did France and Germany who denied they had a problem. Ireland single handedly made a successful case for funding. More than £400 million, including £75 million from the Exchequer, was paid in compensation to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The current crisis will cost Irish farmers more than that of 1996. The Minister of State made no mention today of a compensation package for farmers, except to say the question will be dealt with at the Council of Ministers meeting on 12 December. Will the Government insist that Irish farmers receive compensation similar to what they were paid in 1996 when 75% of losses were compensated for? Is it the policy of the Department to seek that level of compensation, and how confident is the Minister of State that it will be granted? The Minister will do most of the negotiating but the Minister of State will be there too.</P>

      <P>A new slaughter scheme was introduced earlier this year which pays approximately £22.60 for each animal slaughtered and mostly affects slaughterings which started on 1 <Col N="1330" /> September. Does the Minister of State agree that payment should be increased to £100? I hope he will reply to this question. Last September and October 60% of the special beef premium was paid and 40% remains to be paid. Will the Minister bring forward another 30% of those payments and pay it before Christmas to all farmers who are entitled to it? Neither the Minister nor any official in the Department has made such a promise since the crisis began. Will the Minister ensure that much is done as a gesture to people who have suffered a serious financial loss?</P>
      <P>If there is to be a destruction scheme for cattle aged 30 months or older, will the Minister give a guarantee that farmers will receive 100% compensation for the animals? The suggestion from Brussels is that 60% or 70% will be paid and each member state should make up the difference. However, the bottom line is that if animals aged over two and a half years are to be removed or destroyed, farmers should receive 100% compensation for them.</P>
      <P>Farmers are part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which included a promise regarding a revision of the valuation of reactor animals. There has not been a meaningful revision of the price of such animals for many years. The revision was promised last February and it was to be completed by September. However, there has not been a word about it from the Department since then. In the factories, a reactor cow is now almost worthless. The Department pays a predetermined amount of compensation, but the price in factories is almost worthless. Given that many other groups are striking for increases that are entirely outside the PPF, it is time that a promise made to the farming community under the programme was delivered. It is a small issue and I ask the Minister of State to deal directly with it and other matters in his reply to the debate because farmers want fair value.</P>
      <P>A food quality scheme review group was set up under Professor Joe Buckley this time last year. It was initiated by the Minister of State's good colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and it was charged with reviewing schemes that are currently in operation in the light of future requirements of consumers and the food industry. A major report was to be produced and it was due to be published this month. It may have been given to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, but I would like to see it. Is the Minister of State now too embarrassed to publish it? Where is the report? Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, will indicate when it will be available and if he, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, will publish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;also to the point. It was a serious contribution and it was taken as such by most Members, with one or two exceptions. There is no such thing as a political BSE animal. If we represent an industry, we must do so together. It is fair to say that the views expressed by Members were based on seriousness and concern.</P>
      <P>It is clear that BSE has serious consequences, which include the potential to cause serious human disease and health and welfare issues for animals and farmers and a serious economic impact. In relation to serious human disease, the nature of the illness caused, new variant CJD, and particularly its ability to manifest itself in young people, is devastating in the cases to date. The extent of the disease, which may take years if not decades to develop, cannot be guessed at this stage. Consequently, preventative measures must be taken. I compliment the Minister in this regard and although Members' contributions will vary, I hope that aspect will be welcomed. I listened with keen interest to the excellent contributions of Senators Tom Hayes, Henry, Rory Kiely and Gibbons.</P>
      <P>Regarding the serious health and welfare issues for animals and farmers, while only the occasional cow in a herd is affected by BSE, the requirement, in the interests of the public and consumers, to slaughter the whole herd has devastating effects on the welfare of other animals but also on the state of mind, health, welfare and finances of the members of the family farm.</P>
      <P>In terms of the potentially serious economic impact of BSE, the policy of slaughtering the whole herd has a substantial cost in terms of the State's finances. However, this cost pales in comparison to any loss of trade in a £1.5 billion beef industry that is over sufficient by 90%. Consumers abroad have competitive choice in the marketplace. If we are to be successful, we must match and exceed that choice through a quality product that is safe.</P>
      <P>While the consequences of BSE are evident, remedies are not clear. However, at this juncture, consumer safety and health must be the only consideration in dealing with BSE. The loss of income for farmers must pale in comparison because there will be no industry if consumer confidence is absent. This week, the EU Ministers for Agriculture announced some measures to deal with BSE. These include testing all animals over 30 months of age for evidence of BSE and the exclusion of all animals over 30 months that are untested or prove positive. They also involve the exclusion of meat and bone meal from all ruminant and non-ruminant animal diets, including pigs, poultry and fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> It is worthwhile examining the impact of these measures, for example, the testing of slaughtered animals aged over 30 months. The measures will result in increased costs for farmers at production level through processors, retailers and consumers. These costs are estimated at approximately £20 per animal, but they do not include the knock-on costs of the transportation of samples or staffing. However, in the context of the risk to humans from a lethal disease that may not be expressed for years, it is necessary to incur these costs.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary to incur costs in the interests of animal health and welfare and also, ultimately, in the interests of the economy which is still dependent on this sector. While many other sectors add value to imported materials, the agricultural sector is largely based on indigenous resources. Apart from health considerations, which take precedence, the sector must be protected because it is such a valuable contributor to the national commercial interest.</P>
    <P>While most people will agree with the proposed measures, some, including me, may ask if they go far enough. Is it sufficient to test only animals that are 30 months or over? Current slaughter trends obtained from the industry suggest that over 60% of cattle at slaughter are over 30 months while 40% of steers and heifers are under 30 months. These figures exclude older animals such as cows and young bulls slaughtered at 16 to 17 months. The net effect of a 30 month slaughter policy will be that a potential customer in the butcher's or supermarket will find that up to 40% of meat will be untested for evidence of BSE. This will cause further confusion. Also in the meat industry, it is regrettable, but a fact, that where there is provision for an exclusion or exemption, there is an opportunity for exploitation and abuse.</P>
    <P>A number of references have been made this afternoon to rogue farmers, bad practices, malpractice and so on. Such farmers have to be rooted out &ndash; they have no place in food production and in farming. Whatever steps are necessary should be taken now. I have long proposed sterilisation of that land forever as a penalty.</P>
    <P>Without all animals committed to the food chain being tested for BSE at slaughter, how will the customer or an inspector be able to ascertain with certainty that a cut of meat in a retail outlet came from an animal that was under the age limit for testing? To give further public assurance, to avoid loopholes and to promote trace back, I suggest that every bovine animal entering the food chain should be tested and found negative for BSE. We have to go all the way.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge, however, that no test is 100% sensitive and specific in identifying all positive and negative cases. Unfortunately, some very rare cases, although negative, will test positive; worse still, some cases that are positive will test negative. Therefore, the test itself must be supported by other measures. I also recommend that testing be supported by an intensive ante-mortem inspection for evidence of clinical abnormality. I <Col N="1333" /> am well aware there is ante-mortem inspection but it has to be intensified and moved on.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost confidence in the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and Deputy Davern, regarding the banning of meat and bonemeal from diets and I will leave it at that. This country has gone a long way in the interests of public health by a slaughtered out policy. In addition, the specified risk material regulation, the so-called SRM, in force since 1997 and amended in 2000 has ensured a substantial measure of public health protection by removing BSE risk materials from the food chain by rendering and exporting them for incineration. These materials include the brain, spinal cord, spleen, eyes, tonsils and ileum which are removed from slaughtered animals at all ages. Other offal deemed non-risk has been processed, rendered and fed to some non-ruminant animals as meat and bonemeal.</P>
    <P>The second measure announced by EU Ministers for Agriculture, that no meat and bonemeal will be fed to any food production animal, must be welcomed. This decision leaves no opportunity for equivocation or different standards which again would cause public confusion. That all animals entering the food chain will have no meat and bonemeal included in their diet will add considerably to public assurance.</P>
    <P>Incineration is a further important aspect on which I called for a debate this morning. There is a disquieting consequence of the above mentioned decision in that a way must be found to dispose safely of a significant proportion of each animal slaughtered, that is, offal. Collectively, these proportions are enormous. In simple terms, for every three cattle slaughtered, there will be approximately one tonne of offal to be disposed of. From the annual kill of about two million animals, there is about two thirds to three quarters of a million tonnes of offal or 140,000 tonnes of rendered material to be dealt with. It is not appropriate to put such organic materials into landfill dumps to the detriment of water supplies from leachate.</P>
    <P>It is time to acknowledge the suitability of incineration over other methods as a means of waste disposal. The public has set its mind against incineration. It is a fact that modern incineration is a relatively clean industry where incinerators comply with industry standards set by the EU and the EPA. There is relatively no risk from an incinerator that is properly planned, constructed and controlled, with its operations monitored to those standards. The risk to the environment from disposal by burial is far greater.</P>
    <P>The practice to date has been to export SRM material for disposal by incineration abroad. By expecting other jurisdictions to solve Irish problems, we are failing as citizens of the world and we are failing the environment. We cannot be environmentally isolationist any more than we can be commercially isolationist. By depending on others, we are not in control as we can or might be expected to be, as a sovereign State in <Col N="1334" /> our own right. As a nation, we should take responsibility.</P>
    <P>We have to support the measures being taken and go further. In the context of BSE, no cost can outweigh the benefit of protecting public health and the value to the economy of the beef sector which is under siege from a disease contributing significantly to public health and consumer fears and concerns. The obligation of the media is to be correct and factual and not to scare with frightening headlines. I commend Mairead McGuinness on her contribution which is exceptionally good at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to the House. I was <Col N="1335" /> delighted to hear Senator Callanan speak of the need to do something and the willingness to say no price is too high to do whatever we have to do. Senator Gibbons said something similar. To be behind a butcher's counter and on the shop floor and to have a customer come up to you and say they trust you &ndash; it does not matter what business you are in &ndash; is such a valuable asset. Picture what would happen if that customer turned up and said they had lost trust and confidence in you. If you say that about a shopkeeper or a butcher, picture what would happen if that was said to a nation.</P>
      <P>That is why I want to focus on the scale of the customer reaction in Germany and France to the BSE crisis. It is very instructive to concentrate on the scale. We are here today because of an abuse of trust by the authorities in those two countries. They overplayed their hand recently in reassuring their customers that their countries were BSE free. They said it over and over and when the problems were occurring on these islands they said they did not have that difficulty and they reassured their customers. Look at what has happened now that they have lost that assurance. When it was found they were not BSE free, the reaction of customers was exactly as I described. They reacted savagely, not just because of the risk of BSE but they felt they had been had, lied to and misled. They lost confidence and trust in the Government. They felt misled by the previous assurances not just of that Government but of a number of Governments which had not trusted them with the whole truth.</P>
      <P>Those Governments are now paying the price of that lack of and abuse of trust, and so are we, because we will all be involved in trying to repair this damage for a very long time to come. There is no more point in blaming customers for overreacting than there is in blaming Governments whose abuse of customers' trust gave rise to that reaction. The water has flowed under that bridge now, and there is nothing we can do about it other than cope with the consequences. That is what we must do now, and that is why I am glad we are having this debate. This is the time to do so.</P>
      <P>In coping with the consequences, it is useful to bear in mind causes. The lesson is very clear. One cannot play around with the customer. That is the one message we must get around here. One cannot go halfway down the road with the customer. If one is lucky enough to have the trust of customers, one abuses that trust at one's peril. That is how we should approach this matter from now on. Far from wringing our hands about the far-reaching effects of the new measures, or seeking to water them down, we should welcome them with open arms. We must do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear the words being used in this House today, and to see the sense of realism that has prevailed in this country over the past few days. For the first time since the BSE crisis first <Col N="1336" /> reared its head in March 1996, we have clear, unambiguous and decisive measures on the table.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Council of Ministers, including our Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Walsh, for their promptness and courage in facing up to the problem. They saw clearly the right road to pursue and they took it. We should be as clear-sighted as they in facing up to the consequences of the new rules. That worries me because, as a nation, we have not always done that. We have had a habit of fudging and dodging and hoping that the rules do not apply to us.</P>
    <P>The ban on animal feed will certainly cause Ireland enormous problems which will be extremely costly to resolve. We heard that spoken about today. Overnight what was a relatively valuable asset has been transformed into the very opposite &ndash; a serious liability. It is not just that we do not have the asset anymore. We now have a liability. We are faced with creating quickly a mechanism for disposing of hundreds of tonnes of animal by-products in circumstances where the only practical option is to destroy the material, presumably by incineration. Given the way we, as a nation, have managed to dodge the incineration problem for almost 30 years, it will be quite a trick to whistle up incinerators overnight. I am not sure how we are going to do it. One can already hear sounds in this House about the difficulties that will pose. Further pressure for incineration will come from the new need to dispose of complete carcases because, as we apply the policy of killing animals over 30 months that have not been tested and not cleared for BSE and these measures present us with massive problems of compliance, there is a danger that some people will feel we should duck them or that we should dilute them or avoid them in some way. The best future for the beef industry in Ireland and right across Europe is to carry out these measures fully and faithfully and to the letter of the law because, as the Council of Ministers rightly decided, whatever the scientific niceties may be, the hard facts of the marketplace dictate that only these drastic measures will reassure customers.</P>
    <P>If I have mentioned customers six or more times in this discourse, it is because it is crucial that we recognise that, while we can pass any laws we like and say anything we like by way of reassurance, if we are not trusted, if customers do not believe us, it is all useless. It is only by grasping this nettle that we can rebuild the confidence that customers must have if we are to succeed in the beef industry.</P>
    <P>The scale of this crisis makes this a European crisis more than a national one. We should be pleased that, for the first time, the problem is being dealt with on a pan-European scale rather than being restricted to a handful of countries. We should not go down the road of blaming other countries for where we are now, especially since it was in these islands that the BSE problem first occurred four years ago. Equally, at local level, we should regard this as a national crisis rather <Col N="1337" /> than purely an agricultural one. I am not sure that that is quite understood in other spheres yet, where people think it has nothing to do with them because it relates to farmers. It really is a national crisis and it is a very serious one. The scale of money we will have to spend as a nation at this stage is vastly different from the cost of our commitments only one week ago. That has occurred quickly, and it has caught us by surprise. Whatever it costs to put this right we should pay, and pay gladly, rather than taking what I would call the ultimately suicidal route of half measures that do not succeed in fulfilling their objectives.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for heads on a plate. It is a time for cool heads. We must find a way to handle this. That is why I have been rather disturbed at some of the point-scoring and politicking we have heard over the past few days. This is a time for the country to pull together as a unit in the face of one of the most serious threats to our national prosperity in this generation. It is not a time for sectoral bickering nor for political infighting. It is a time to grasp the nettle. We must do that firmly and with commitment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister and I welcome this debate. What I have heard gives me some assurance that there is an understanding of the importance of the crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, to the House. It is important that this debate should be balanced and allow people to highlight what they see as problems resulting from the BSE crisis that has hit not just Ireland but the other countries of Europe.</P>
      <P>The problems have been outlined and we have been talking about the measures we should and should not take. We should take immediate steps to ensure customer confidence.</P>
      <P>We have spoken about the destruction of animals over a certain age. We should realise that much of our stock is too old. I refer particularly to suckler cows in certain areas which attract subsidies, for example, a cow that produces a calf every year. That is what concerns some farmers. We must look at the bigger picture and enable farmers to get into younger stock rather than keeping cows of eight, ten or 12 years of age. That will eliminate the problem.</P>
      <P>We must look at change in a wider light. All stock over 30 months must be tested for BSE. That is right. However, we must consider the disposal of stock over a particular age if we want to ensure that farmers get into younger stock which carries less risk of BSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a farmer and from speaking to other farmers I know that we must look at the question of compensation, though not necessarily monetary compensation. For example, farmers who have young heifers should be enabled to take one calf from that heifer at two to two-and-a half years old and the heifer will be prime beef in the market. That would ensure stock numbers can be maintained and it would enable the removal of much of the older stock from the herd. There <Col N="1338" /> must be an incentive to enable farmers to reduce the age of the stock.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of stock disposal. If testing is introduced and it is shown that a number of stock have to be disposed of we will have to consider incineration. Local authorities everywhere have tried to do something about waste disposal. Waste disposal is fine but a percentage of it will have to be done by incineration. As public representatives we are told that nobody wants an incinerator in their region, but we have to look at the bigger picture and ensure incineration is introduced as a means of disposing of the unwanted stock.</P>
    <P>We must have rapid test results. If cattle are going to the factories and are being tested, the results must be available without delay. This may require more training and expertise, and the employment of more technicians and veterinary officers in the factories.</P>
    <P>We must look also at the position of farmers who have sick animals and cases of BSE. In some instances farmers with a sick animal called out the vet but in many cases the vet could not identify the problem. It was only after further expertise was brought in and tests were carried out that the problem was identified as BSE. When an animal shows any sign of ill health a vet should be called as a safety precaution.</P>
    <P>The question of depopulation of the herd will have to be looked at carefully. There are many cases where beef units being set not to one but to two and more farmers where stock can be together for part of the year and taken back to the farms for summer grazing. That issue will have to be considered. More attention will have to be paid to where stock is moved to for winter feeding. In the event of a breakdown we must know exactly where the stock have been, the adjoining farms and the risk to adjoining farmers. The removal of stock from one farm may not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the banning of meat and bonemeal. It must be banned. Inspectors must be put in place to check that meat and bonemeal is not used in feed compounds. Only when such checks are in place can we guarantee that it is not being used. The bag containing the rations may state the ingredients used but that may not be good enough for the customer. We must be able to say that not alone is the manufacturer stating the ingredients in the feed but it must also be subject to on-the-spot regular checks by Department officials.</P>
    <P>The slaughter of BSE stock should be carried out at only one designated factory at some location in the country. Customers must be certain that BSE stock was not slaughtered at the factory from which their meat comes.</P>
    <P>To address the age aspect we may have to provide that if stock is not disposed of before reaching five to seven years old there may be no compensation. In the event of such a threat farmers would move to dispose of stock before that age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> The loss to farmers because of this scare has been substantial. Many farmers have bought stock on the assumption that cattle would be 95p per pound plus and possibly £1 per pound. This was the price predicted by the experts but farmers will have to accept much less, possibly £100 a head less. How can those farmers remain in farming if the losses are that substantial?</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the product the customer buys in the butchers is of the highest quality. The customer has the final call. Whether we like it not the customer is right. When the customers buy meat, they must be certain that everything is above board.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the swift action taken to ensure the confidence of the consumer is maintained. The customer must be sure that what they are buying is of the highest standard. For many years this country has been known to produce quality meat, with the rare exception of an odd cowboy. For those found guilty of misdemeanours in relation to the production of stock nothing is too severe, including the loss of headage payments for a number of years. The threat of a lifetime ban would ensure that no one got involved in any wrongdoing in the production of beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of technicality, conflicting reports and hype surrounds this issue. The bottom line is that people are very seriously affected by this matter. The fundamental issue, and Senator Quinn originally referred to it, is the confidence of the consumer or customer and the producer being right at all costs. It is not an understatement to say this is a national crisis which has huge repercussions across this country, not just for the producer but for all rural economies.</P>
      <P>The approach adopted by the Department to deal with this issue will be fundamental to the lessening of the impact on rural communities. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, referred specifically to the measures being put in place. It is very important that the question of a compensation package is dealt with in a very serious way.</P>
      <P>I come from a rural background and I appreciate what it is like to live on a farm. I know what it is like to work with cattle, cows and calves. I also know how much trauma is inflicted on a farming family when their herd is wiped out. Recently neighbours of mine, a young couple with six very young children, had their herd wiped out. This had a traumatic effect on those parents and their children. To say it was traumatic is not an overstatement. These cases and the families concerned must be dealt with in a very compassionate way. To ease the burden of such a trauma and the financial impact, the level of hardship should be reduced. The onus is on the Department to ensure that a proper compensation package is put in place. It should alleviate any financial hardship and not aggravate the personal trauma and hardship that many people suffer during this type of crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of interesting points were made. The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, clearly identified the number of BSE cases. We have had 561 cases since 1989. He said that the number this year to date was 126 cases, with a further three detected, giving a total of 129 cases. He also said the number is much higher this year but that the European Union Scientific Steering Committee had predicted a temporary increase. I wonder if <Col N="1341" /> the Department &ndash; forget Europe &ndash; had a strategy or research in place. Can the Department identify why we have had such a dramatic increase in BSE cases this year? It seems an extraordinarily high proportion given that we only had 19 cases in previous years. I can understand to a certain degree why there was an increase and why the EU steering committee predicted it. However, I am not sure this jump in numbers was expected.</P>
    <P>Figures have been bandied about which I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, will clarify. His colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, suggested that there are 1.8 million cattle over four years of age in the national herd. It was also suggested that there are 750,000 cattle over 30 months. Perhaps my mathematics are not good. I do not understand how we could have 1.8 million cattle over four years but only over 0.75 million over 30 months. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, will clarify this for me and present the correct figures towards the conclusion of this debate. There is a huge discrepancy in the figures that are being bandied about and they need to be clarified.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on the Department to deal with this crisis. It must identify where BSE occurs and attempt to control and eliminate it. Various Council of Ministers meetings have been held and Ministers have introduced and agreed on a number of proposals that will be implemented in each European state. It is very important that they proceed with their work. It is vitally important that any grievances from the European member states are heard and that no state should look for a derogation. To date a number of member states have attempted to do this.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of thousands of tonnes of bonemeal in the European Union and there is a temptation to use it. It is very important that proper controls are put in place to ensure there is uniform application of the agreement and that the bonemeal is not used. It is vital that no member state does its own thing on this issue.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions have been made. I agree with the destruction of all herd and birth cohorts of animals infected with BSE. It has also been suggested that all animals over 30 months should be tested for BSE and that, as and from 1 January 2001, all at risk animals and from 1 July 2001 all animals over 30 months should be destroyed. There is a fundamental issue here. If all of these animals must be destroyed then that is the course we should take. I hate the thought of animals being slaughtered but if it is necessary to make our food chain safe then it must happen. If it must happen then the producer must be fully compensated.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to how we will dispose of these carcases at the end of this culling process. In the past, we exported the carcases to Germany for incineration. That is fine when there are only a few carcases. However, it is suggested there will be thousands of carcases as a result of these <Col N="1342" /> measures and we will have to deal with them in a practical way. It is vital that we confront the fundamental issue of incineration, which is the only realistic way to dispose of these carcases properly.</P>
    <P>Let us hear the counter arguments. What do those who make those arguments propose? Do they propose to continue the burial system under the same conditions that have existed heretofore? Is that a better alternative to incineration? I would like to hear people's views on that issue. In my view, incineration is the safest and best way in the long term. We will have to look at that prospect very seriously. There will be a lot of public discussion of the issue, which will possibly heighten tensions in certain areas. However, the bottom line is that we have yet to hear a better proposal.</P>
    <P>We saw recently in Galway where a beast was buried, moved to another farm, reburied and then dug up and left in a yard. We cannot allow such a situation to occur again, particularly if the numbers increase to the dramatic levels that are being talked about. We have watercourses, spring wells and lakes all over the country. It would be very dangerous to take any course other than incineration.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan referred to the traceability issue. A few farmers have given the farming community a bad name, which is unfortunate. The overwhelming majority of farmers are decent, land loving and animal loving people. The bad publicity is unfortunate. However, at the end of the day, the consumer will decide. If the consumer does not have sufficient confidence in the meat produced in this country to consume it, we might as well not bother producing it. That is the reality. There is a responsibility on the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to ensure confidence is restored to consumers, which will mean the product will be purchased and the producer can continue in production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome today's debate. The beef industry is currently in crisis, brought about by consumer reaction to recent reports of increased outbreaks of BSE in cattle herds in France, Germany and Spain. These countries had, up until now, failed to accept that BSE might be a problem in their cattle herds and had refused to take adequate measures to reassure customers of the safety of their beef. The result of this is that consumer confidence is shattered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an EU member, our beef industry is under serious threat, despite the fact that we have taken strict control measures to ensure our beef is safe. Coming from a constituency where almost all farmers are involved in beef production to some degree, I assure the House that the effects of this crisis will be felt throughout the community. Every day I hear stories from farmers who have seen the value of their stock fall by up to 25%, <Col N="1343" /> and in many cases have stock ready for sale that is unsaleable at present.</P>
    <P>We can only overcome this crisis if we can restore consumer confidence by ensuring the beef we produce is of high quality and free from BSE. The scientific steering committee of the European Commission has endorsed our control measures as being the most effective for assuring consumers of the safety of the beef we eat.</P>
    <P>I welcome the achievement by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, in negotiating with other EU Ministers a ten point plan to help overcome the current crisis. The proposals for a complete ban on meat and bonemeal, a rapid BSE detection test for all cattle over 30 months and the removal from the food chain of all animals over 30 months that do not test BSE free will help dispel consumer fears and restore confidence in beef as a healthy food.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, the livelihoods of many beef farmers, particularly those who winter finish cattle, are under threat because of this crisis. Many of these cattle have fallen in value by £100 or £150 per head and the projected profit, according to independent Teagasc experts, is, at best, £50 per head. It is vital that some form of compensation is put in place quickly for winter finishers. If we are to hold onto the high price markets that demand consistent supply of good quality beef throughout the year, those farmers who finish cattle in winter, when costs are at their highest, must be protected.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to continue his good work in negotiating an effective compensation package for Irish beef farmers and to seek to have intervention buying opened as soon as possible to help reduce the backlog of beef that is building up on Irish farms. It is important that the intervention price is set at a level that will reimburse farmers for the cost of feeding cattle over the winter months.</P>
    <P>The proposal that all animals over 30 months not tested and found BSE free should be slaughtered is sound and should be implemented. For this proposal to be implemented, we will have to agree to incineration. I ask all representatives to consider this in the national interest and not to play party politics with this issue. This is very important to the farming community, especially winter fatteners and beef farmers. We export up to 90% of our beef. Other people are also affected by this. The factories are practically closed and their employees, two weeks before Christmas, are not sure if they will have jobs next week because of this crisis. This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here all the ingredients of a major agricultural crisis. Farmers are at their wits' end not knowing what is down the road. The consumer is frightened about the quality of beef that may be on the market, now and in the future, and factory workers are uncertain about their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The media and the scientific community have questions to answer. Nowadays we are prone to accept as gospel everything the scientific community comes up with. In this instance science is like astronomy &ndash; astronomers and astrophysicists can trace the evolution of the universe back to the big bang, but they do not have a clue about what happened two seconds or three seconds before singularity, as they like to call it technically.</P>
    <P>In this situation, there are many unanswered questions. If an animal gets into the food chain, as has happened, and the human variant CJD emerges in an unfortunate individual, why is there not a greater outbreak of the disease in the human form? Occasionally one cow goes down with BSE but nobody has explained why more cows do not contract it in that locality. I am sure the cow in question did not get only a teaspoon of meat and bonemeal or whatever foodstuff that caused the BSE. The feed was fed to hundreds, perhaps thousands of animals. These questions have not been answered. The incubation period of the human form of the disease can be ten years for one individual and 20 years for another and there are too many unanswered questions. The media and the public are taking as gospel the scientific assumptions, despite the fact that there is much to be proved.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to play down the importance of the work of the scientific community on the disease, but I want more definitive answers. The public knows nothing about the science of what is happening. They read hysterical reports in the media. The beef industry is in crisis, but we need more research. The Minister should devote more funds to this area and instigate a major scientific research programme to secure definitive answers in the near future.</P>
    <P>We cannot go on like this. We thought we had seen the last of the 1996 crisis. Continental countries who thought they were free of the disease at that time now appear to have it on their doorstep with the result that mass hysteria and public concern is re-emerging here. The concern is well justified, but the industry is too big and too many livelihoods are at stake. Families dealing with the crisis face huge trauma. This morning on the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo;, a man and his wife explained how they dealt with an outbreak of the disease. They detailed the history of the episode in graphic terms and it was very moving. I ask the Minister of State to concentrate on scientific research into this area to get the answers before we become involved in more mass hysteria over the disease.</P>

      <P>This is a timely debate. Other speakers said that there is the potential for a severe crisis. It takes very little to generate fear and <Col N="1345" /> distrust among consumers and in this instance we are walking a fine line between consumer confidence and alienation.</P>
      <P>The focus of the debate is on food safety and the assurances we can give to consumers, at home and abroad, that the beef we produce in this country is 100% safe. The Minister and the Department have introduced many measures to address the BSE scare since it emerged in 1996. They must be complimented on regaining the markets we lost as a result of the crisis. It is unfortunate that we are linked with the rest of Europe in terms of the Egyptian market.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that France and Germany have been caught out eventually and have had to accept they have a problem like every other country in Europe. They reneged on their responsibilities when Ireland and other countries were trying to assure people at home and abroad that their beef was safe.</P>
      <P>A sense of perspective is required. The Minster of State said this country has a relatively low incidence of BSE by comparison with our neighbouring country. Since 1989 there have been 561 cases here out of a herd population of 7.5 million each year. This compares with 177,000 cases in the UK &ndash; there were 37,000 cases in 1992 alone &ndash; out of a herd population of 12 million. This means that only 0.0012% of our total herd has been infected. However, it only takes a very small percentage of infection to instil fear in the public.</P>
      <P>While we have taken responsibility for BSE over the years it is time we took responsibility for the disposal of all our waste, including animal waste. Whether we like it or not, we must consider seriously the installation of a thermal treatment plant, an incinerator. That is the only way we can fulfil our responsibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Council's decision to accept that meat and bonemeal should be banned from all animal feed for a period of six months. I agree with Senator Caffrey that many questions must still be answered. I come from a county which has a poultry industry. When will we be given 100% assurance that our poultry industry will not suffer from a condition similar to BSE? We have not been given that assurance. Senator O'Brien mentioned that the county depends on the beef industry, but it also depends on the poultry industry. My fear is that a condition similar to BSE or CJD in humans will manifest itself in the poultry industry. Perhaps we could get clarification on that issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for giving me time to speak on this important issue. This is the major challenge of our time which we must face. The fact we are an island nation separated from Europe may give us an opportunity to deal with this major problem. We should be able to contain our problems within the State. The Minister of State said it is our intention to eradicate the problem. That is the challenge we face and we now have the opportunity to do so. We had to deal with problems such as tuberculosis in the past. <Col N="1346" /> We must deal with this problem in a more stringent and serious way.</P>
      <P>I know farmers will pay the costs but we must make strong decisions to restore consumer confidence. We should be able to do that in co-operation with our friends in the Six Counties. We should deal with this issue firmly. We should be able to include the necessary safeguards recommended by the Commission. There is a need for fair and considered compensation for farmers when implementing the necessary changes.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Irish craft butchers, including small butchers with their own abattoirs, issued a statement about their produce and they came across extremely well. They have good quality meat. It is important to assure housewives that the craft butchers know the young heifers and cattle which are killed on a weekly basis and that stringent controls are applied. There is a need for consumer confidence. People will respect traditional butchers who have given a service over the years and it is important to build on that.</P>
      <P>There is a lesson to be learned about the food chain and how one thing affects another. We should consider incineration as the answer to our problem of getting rid of waste from the beef sector in the long term. We must come up with a solution which will not backfire in the future. Incineration appears to be the way forward. Issues such as our health, the food we eat, the quality of our water and the decisions we take about waste management are interrelated. We must make the right decisions to guarantee our most important export for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, in welcoming the budget,</P>
      <P>acknowledges in particular, the fact that the Minister for Finance has, following intensive discussions and negotiations with the Social Partners including the ICTU, delivered, as promised, a pay and taxation deal which compensates for the erosion of value caused by inflation and which has also delivered the first moiety of the PPF taxation commitments;</P>
      <P>notes that the agreement of the Minister to the fast-forwarding of the implementation of the Benchmarking outcomes has been of particular importance to public sector employees including teachers; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>recognises that the flexibility of the PPF Review process in proposing these adjustments will imbue increased confidence <Col N="1347" /> among trade unions and the general public in the partnership approach so crucial to economic development and stability.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to respond to the budget which is being debated currently in the other House. I framed this motion last week in anticipation of a budget on the basis of what would be required. I was quite serious about this matter and made public that I was prepared to table the motion and let it stand or fall on its merits. I also said that if the budget did not deliver on the measures required, I would have no option but to speak and not move the motion.</P>
    <P>A large number of issues were riding on this budget, one of which related to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. There was a huge commitment in relation to this at the beginning of the year when workers throughout the country were voting and worried about many aspects. A crucial issue was inflation. At many meetings throughout the country this issue was discussed and voted on. Workers in different unions received ballot papers and we told them that, in the event of inflation going out of control, we would trigger a review clause in the PPF. We did precisely that.</P>
    <P>I welcome a number of issues in today's budget on the pay and taxation deal. In terms of the taxation deal itself, I sought that the budget would give at least one-third of the commitment under the PPF. The commitment under the PPF was for a 10% tax improvement in the net position of workers, therefore, one-third of that would be just over 3%. I also sought an improvement in taxation to compensate for the erosion of value created by inflation and a pay element in relation to the erosion.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise what was done in the budget. At the time of the PPF agreement, it was expected that inflation would be in the region of between 2.5% and 3% per annum. It is currently 5.5% per annum. Therefore, there was a difference of 3% in the erosion of value. We have now got a deal which includes a pay element of 3%. Effectively, the pay element will compensate for the erosion created this year. There is also a taxation element which is slightly more than 3%, depending on how much is allocated to the PPF. The full PPF requirement, plus in excess of 3%, has been delivered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been as good as his word. The Government has honoured its commitment to us in August and again last month. In a statement on 10 September, in particular, the Taoiseach announced that it was the Government's intention to meet part of the erosion of value created by inflation through tax measures in the budget. This has been delivered. The pay and tax deal which we as trade unionists were negotiating with the Government for the last three or four months has been delivered.</P>
    <P>Last June I asked the Government to take action on inflation in three phases, first, to <Col N="1348" /> acknowledge there was an erosion of value created by inflation; second, to agree that it would develop a compensation package and, third, that it would enter into negotiations in that regard. It fulfilled its promises and it also indicated its support for changes in respect of pay.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion relates to the fast forwarding of the implementation of the benchmarking outcomes, which is of particular relevance to public sector employees. I refer here to teachers and others. I wish to outline the impetus behind this part of the motion. Under the terms of the PPF, the first payment recommended by the benchmarking review body would not be paid until mid-2003. We made the case that, because of the growth in the economy from an expected 5.6% to approximately 10%, there should also be movement in terms of bringing forward pay rises. We recommended that the way to do so would be through the fast forwarding of benchmarking.</P>
    <P>As the budget confirms, the benchmarking outcomes will not be paid until the middle of 2002 but they will have retrospective effect from 1 December 2001. A quarter of the final figure will be paid at that time and, more than likely, at least another quarter will be paid later in 2002. It is important that people, particularly public servants, teachers, etc., are made aware of what this means in terms of the total pay package under the PPF. Until last Monday, the cash terms of the PPF were worth 19.2%. The additional 3% agreed last evening brings the figure up to 22.77%. In addition, two quarters of the benchmarking outcomes must be included in that.</P>
    <P>In order to estimate the final percentage pay increase under the PPF one must be both optimistic and pessimistic. To consider matters in a pessimistic light, the worst deal that teachers will obtain under the benchmarking review would be an increase of 10%. If one is optimistic, they could get as much as the 17% or 18% obtained by Members of the Oireachtas. Let us consider what will happen if teachers obtain an average of between 12% and 16%. If they obtain 12%, 3% will be payable from 1 December next year and a further 3% payable the following year. They will, therefore, obtain 6% under benchmarking and 22.77% under the PPF, giving them a total increase of almost 30%. We must make it known that the cash value to teachers of the PPF will be in excess of 30% when its various elements are implemented. I recognise that the demands I made on behalf of teachers and members of other public sector unions for the fast forwarding of benchmarking have been met.</P>
    <P>The third part of the motion refers to the adjustments referred to in the first two parts which will &ldquo;imbue increased confidence&rdquo;. It was crucially important that the social partners &ndash; the Government, employers, the trade unions and the voluntary sector &ndash; would be able to show that flexibility exists in the programme to allow adjustments to be made. This shows that the part<Col N="1349" /> nership process works and that people can have an input.</P>
    <P>A great deal of discussion took place earlier in the week about what people knew about the contents of the budget. The Minister for Finance can take credit for the fact that there was full engagement by him and his Department with negotiators representing the employers, the trade unions and the voluntary bodies. He met everybody, we put our cases to him and many of the things we were seeking have been delivered in the budget. Such a process must be followed in the future. Until the other economies in western Europe adopt such a process, they will not achieve proper stability. We have moved matters forward in an extremely effective way. I ask the Government to ensure that the partnership process is protected and that it is allowed filter down to Departments and have an effect on the way they conduct their business.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to discuss the exact details of the income tax provisions in the budget. However, I wish to refer to a number of other issues. Some of the non-pay elements of the PPF have been delivered in recent months. One of these is the issue of maternity leave. There was a huge demand from many people for the extension of maternity leave. The Minister announced today that paid maternity leave will be increased from 14 to 18 weeks, which is a major and welcome improvement for pregnant women in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I wish to make particular reference to the approach the Minister has taken to child care. I am in favour of many aspects of the Minister's approach but I do not agree with using child benefit to improve people's lot. The Government chose the most expensive yet easiest option and, in view of the difficulties that arose last year in respect of individualisation, I do not blame it for doing so. However, I would have preferred if the Minister had introduced tax rebates or chosen another approach. The elimination of benefit-in-kind for the provision of child care and crèche places for the children of employees as outlined in the budget &ndash; I accept that a specific explanation was not provided &ndash; is a major step forward and will be welcomed by many people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to remove the extraordinary anomaly in the school transport system &ndash; this has kept Deputies and Senators busy for many years &ndash; whereby a nine year old living two miles from school could not avail of school transport whereas a nine year old living three miles away could do so. When I worked as a school principal I had an argument with a CIE inspector who calculated that a child who was badly in need of transport to school was five yards short of living three miles from the school. To resolve the problem I knocked down the car park wall with a sledgehammer, drove my car inside and told the inspector to measure the distance from there in order to obtain the extra five yards.</P>
    <P>Housing policy is an issue of major concern to the trade union movement and many workers. <Col N="1350" /> Some months ago I brought to the attention of the Minister an anomaly in the Bacon report which conferred a certain tax benefit on people buying a house but which would be lost if they derived income from letting a room. The only way young people in the UK and other European countries can afford to buy a house is by allowing work colleagues or friends move in and pay some money towards the mortgage. I am delighted with the section of the budget entitled &ldquo;Rent a Room&rdquo; which allows this to be done properly and correctly. I assure Members that this will allow more young people to consider buying a house because they will be able to invite a work colleague or friend to share the house, legitimately charge them rent and obtain a tax rebate of up to £6,000.</P>
    <P>The extension of the schools psychological service will be widely welcomed and is a crucially important development. For many years I have said that membership of unions such as my union, the INTO, was almost as much a requirement as being a member of a professional body or an accountancy body and that union members should be entitled to tax relief on their subscriptions. I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide a flat rate allowance of £100 at the standard rate of tax in respect of trade union subscriptions.</P>
    <P>The anti-inflation measures included in the budget are crucially important. The reduction of 1% in the rate of VAT and the reduction of excise on petrol by 2p will not have a major impact, but it signals that an important step has been taken. Next month's figures will show that the increase in the price of tobacco products from last year's budget will be subsumed which will give a plus of 0.8% while the reductions to which I refer will provide almost another 1%. This means there will be some improvement in the economy at a time when the euro has strengthened and when world fuel prices have stabilised.</P>
    <P>The budget is well timed for workers. Our stated expectations have been fulfilled and on that basis I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of things strike one about this motion. The first is the successful career in prophecy embarked upon by my colleague, Senator Joe O'Toole. This motion, acknowledging concrete facts to be put in the budget, giving the example of benchmarking and being quite specific in certain aspects, was placed on the Order Paper on 1 December while the budget waited to be delivered until 6 December. However, Senator O'Toole is proved to be correct, showing that one should not throw stones at persons who have their own crystal ball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion aroused some controversy and this was, in some ways, a good thing. The matter was reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times </i>and a number of other newspapers, although in all the references to the motion there was no mention of its distinguished seconder. There are not many occasions on which the proposed deliberations of the Seanad merit such press attention. We are <Col N="1351" /> lucky to have a person of Senator O'Toole's eminence and intellect in the Seanad, who occupies such a significant role in the trade union movement and who, outside this House, has been engaged in significant and far reaching discussions with Government. It is not without significance that Senator O'Toole is elected by one of the university constituencies. This is precisely the kind of representation intended on the panels but it is the universities which have presented the House with this opportunity.</P>
    <P>In preparing the budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, a remarkable and fascinating personality, was not given entirely free rein. The Cabinet meeting of the other day had all the hallmarks of a successful fire-proofing operation by the Government to ensure that no spectacular false moves were made.</P>
    <P>The principal elements of the motion are the pay and taxation deal which compensates for the erosion of value due to inflation. Senator O'Toole has indicated ways in which the Government performed a delicate balancing act by giving money back to the taxpayer while countering the possible inflationary measures. When I was an economically illiterate undergraduate I associated benchmarking with the Ordnance Survey. I now understand it means an attempt to introduce a degree of comparative fairness between different occupations and in that sense it is very welcome. The final element in the motion is the successful survival of this kind of bargaining mechanism between the different elements in society. If we want to see the economy continue to thrive, this is the road along which we must go.</P>
    <P>We must also display fairness and a bias towards the least advantaged in our society. This budget does not go quite far enough. I welcome the initiative on homelessness. I have not had the opportunity to read the Budget Statement. I listened to a little of it on the wireless while I was packing &ndash; I go abroad tomorrow on Seanad business &ndash; and I was struck by the Minister's announcement that the provision for the homeless has been doubled from £20 million to £40 million. This is a very good initiative which is socially positive.</P>
    <P>I am glad the road hauliers are being helped by the funding of their principal organisation. I congratulate the Minister on the green element of some of his provisions. These include the encouragement of people to use more environmentally friendly energy sources and the reduction of tax on low sulphur fuels. However, the Minister might examine the question of the brit disc measure recently introduced in the United Kingdom by which Irish haulage companies are expected to pay £10 sterling per day for the privilege of travelling across the road network of the United Kingdom. This is in addition to the vignette, which continental countries operate. The vignette is substantially cheaper than the brit disc and covers most European countries. Some other countries recoup money by an extensive toll <Col N="1352" /> system. At the same time foreign lorries, particularly English ones, pay nothing going through this country. The Minister should look at the possibility of introducing a parallel tax so that we get back something from foreign hauliers for their use of our road network.  </P>
    <P>I am glad to see an improvement in the position of carers. The House debated this issue a couple of weeks ago, prompted by lobbying from the Carers' Association. The Minister has gone some way in meeting the requests made at that time and I am glad an extra 5,000 people will qualify for carer's allowance. This should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to Luas, the transport system, wheelchair accessibility of bus fleets in provincial cities and so on. Why did he make no mention of the metro? Clear and specific funding must be put in place for this. There is no reason why the metro element of the public transport system, which was fought for in this House, should be postponed until 2016. It could be in operation by 2007 or 2008 but if this is to happen proper budgetary allocation must be made now.</P>
    <P>There should also be specific provision for speech therapists. There is a dearth of speech therapists and tragic situations have been brought to the attention of the House on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of money is being made available for sport. I would like to see funding for an ice skating rink. The other day the newspapers gave extensive coverage to a forthcoming ice hockey match in Belfast. In Dublin, the capital city, both ice rinks have closed for commercial reasons. We have people who are extremely adept at this sport and it would be very useful if money were earmarked for it.</P>
    <P>I am now waving, possibly in contravention of Standing Orders, some of the submissions I have received regarding the budget and which I do not have time to mention. I have an enormous dossier, containing submissions from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the auctioneers and valuers, representatives of the motor industry and so on. I can only imagine the headaches the Minister must have had when putting together the budget. I look forward to making a more extended analysis of its impact on all the areas of concern early in new year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I am happy to second this motion, which shows the relevance of the Seanad. It is a matter of some satisfaction to us on the Independent benches that we have so significant a player among our number. We also have a very excellent representative of the capitalist class, Senator Feargal Quinn, appropriately on my right hand side while Senator O'Toole is on my left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Seanad on budget 2001. I thank Senator O'Toole for proposing this motion and compliment the Senator on his foresight, as others have done. Senators heard my colleague, <Col N="1353" /> the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, deliver his Budget Statement in the other House and will welcome the chance to put their comments on the record. However, I was struck by the clarity with which Senator O'Toole spoke. I am happy to present the Government's position with regard to the key points he made and I intend to refer to some of the issues he raised.</P>
      <P>The central message is that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and partnership works. It has the flexibility to deal with all the issues central to the development of the country with regard to the social partnership. The budget is designed to secure our continued prosperity, to improve our quality of life, to promote a fairer society and to reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform. Irish living standards have been raised to the EU average and we can make further progress on this through the sensible management of our economy. However, this is dependent on maintaining a disciplined approach to how we reward ourselves and, in particular, the delivery of the commitments set out in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement reached on Monday night between employers and the ICTU, public service employees will receive an additional pay increase of 2% with effect from 1 April 2001 and a non-pensionable once-off lump sum equal to 1% of basic pay on 1 April 2002. As a result, public service employees will receive ongoing pay increases under the PPF amounting to 18% over 33 months, and nearly 22% in the case of those benefiting from the 3% early settlers agreement, in addition to the once-off lump sum of 1%.</P>
      <P>When the PPF was negotiated, public service unions and employers agreed to establish a public service benchmarking body to compare pay and jobs in the public service to those in the private sector. The benchmarking body was established last July and is to report by 30 June 2002. The body's recommendations are to be based on in-depth and comprehensive research and analysis of pay levels across the economy and one of its central tasks will be to situate public service pay levels in an appropriate position by reference to existing pay levels in the rest of the economy.</P>
      <P>As a result of last Monday's agreement, one quarter of whatever increases may be recommended by the public service benchmarking body will be implemented with retrospective effect from 1 December 2001, as Senator O'Toole said. The balance will be implemented on a phased basis to be agreed between the parties in discussions which are to commence immediately following receipt of the benchmarking body's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final implementation will take account of the desirability of implementing the benchmarking body's recommendations as speedily as possible after receipt of the report; the level of increases involved; any successor to the PPF which might be agreed between the social partners, or whatever other arrangements may be in place on the expiry of the programme; and the <Col N="1354" /> need to respect any links which the benchmarking body might establish between levels of pay and other developments. This represents a significant improvement in the arrangements for implementing the outcome of the benchmarking process. It had been agreed under the PPF that no payment would be made before 1 July 2003.</P>
    <P>The importance of these changes is that they have been negotiated within the framework of social partnership and the PPF in particular. The Government has made it clear all along that it cannot countenance claims by any single group outside this framework. I am aware that secondary teachers who are represented by the ASTI have been reluctant to participate in the benchmarking process, although I am not entirely clear why this is so. Their claim is based, at least in part, on a comparison to pay rates in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking process is designed to examine public service pay and jobs by comparison to the private sector and the benchmarking body will make recommendations thereon. In any event, the agreement to bring forward the effective date for payment of the first phase of any increase which may emerge from benchmarking should be considered very carefully by ASTI members. Parents would find it difficult to understand why the ASTI should not now re-enter the partnership process and avail of the benchmarking mechanism along with the other two teacher unions. Senator O'Toole also referred to maternity leave, the elimination of benefit-in-kind on crèches and school transport. I will refer to these issues later.</P>
    <P>Many of the factors which led to a rise in inflation are outside our control. However, we recognise that it has been a cause for concern, particularly for ordinary workers and pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard that last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The main international economic organisations forecast that inflation will fall substantially next year and beyond. Our estimate is that it should fall to an average of 4.5% next year. Nonetheless, to demonstrate our commitment to tackle inflation, a number of measures will be introduced. These include cuts in indirect taxes, measures to encourage consumers to save rather than to spend and direct tax measures to increase participation in the economy.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of VAT will be reduced to 20% from 1 January 2001. The impact that a cut in VAT will have on the retail price of cigarettes will be offset by an adjustment in the excise duty rates on tobacco products to leave retail prices unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increases in the price of crude oil and currency fluctuations have caused difficulties for the road haulage sector. The Minister's decision to cut the excise duty on auto diesel by 6p per litre, giving a VAT inclusive reduction of 7.3p, will be welcomed by this important sector of our economy. The reduction will have effect from midnight <Col N="1355" /> tonight and, with the 1% VAT reduction, it will give a cumulative tax cut of 7.8p per litre from 1 January. This will also mean a major saving for other diesel users. The excise duty on unleaded petrol will also be reduced by 2p per litre, giving a cumulative VAT inclusive saving of 3p per litre by January next. The full year cost of these VAT and excise measures is £349 million and they will take 0.5% off the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>Tax measures are not the only way to tackle inflation. The slowdown in house price inflation this year and the tax measures announced today will lower the rate of inflation next year. We also need to use the tax system to promote saving instead of spending. Incentives have already been put in place for pension saving both through tax changes and by giving savers greater choice and control over their money. The Minister announced measures to encourage medium-term savings in the credit unions today and he is considering extending these to other financial institutions in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the Government is to reward work and enterprise. The amount of tax deducted from our wages is a disincentive to work. We are determined to reduce that disincentive. Our record in tax reform is clear and we have again delivered far in excess of our commitments. Taxpayers will benefit by £1,231 million &ndash; almost three times the amount promised under the PPF for this year &ndash; from income tax and PRSI measures. These include an increase in the basic personal allowances by £800 single and £1,600 married to £5,500 and £11,000 per annum respectively and by increasing the PAYE allowance from £1,000 to £2,000 per annum. Today's measures will remove 133,000 taxpayers from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The measures also include widening the single person standard rate income tax band by £3,000 from £17,000 per annum to £20,000 per annum, with a consequential increase for double earners. The married one-earner band will increase by £1,000 from £28,000 per annum to £29,000 per annum, with transferability of bands between spouses thereby increased also to £29,000. As a result of this band widening, the proportion of income earners on the higher rate will fall to 23%. There is also a reduction in the standard rate and the higher rate of income tax by 2% in each case, that is, from 22% to 20% and from 44% to 42%. This fulfils the election pledge the Government parties gave in relation to income tax rates in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The contributions ceiling for the self-employed and proprietary directors will be removed and the rate of PRSI for this category reduced to 3%. Most of the additional revenue generated by the removal of the ceiling will come from those on incomes over £100,000 per annum. The ceiling on employee PRSI is being increased to £28,250 per annum, which reflects the normal earnings-related increase. The class A rate for employees is being reduced from 4.5% to 4% at a cost £63 <Col N="1356" /> million in a full year. This is another important gain. The ceiling on employer PRSI which is currently £36,600 per employee in this tax year will be removed. This measure will bring in £159 million in PRSI in a full year.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the measures on indirect taxation, savings and, most importantly, the significant income tax reductions show the Government's commitment to bringing inflation down. The direct tax measures go further than our commitments under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and illustrate our determination to maintain the partnership process, as Senator O'Toole acknowledged. The budget contains many other measures and I will not have time to deal with them all. However, I wish to draw the attention of the House to a few of the measures.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources will be, rightly, devoted to persons with disability. I am happy to say the living alone allowance will be extended to all recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance, unemployment supplement and blind persons pension. In addition, up to now only a reduced rate disability allowance was paid where the person's partner is in receipt of a full rate social welfare payment. This limitation will be removed. I am sure that is very much welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>We are also upgrading transport services for people with physical disability. Some 140 wheelchair accessible buses are due for delivery to Dublin Bus shortly; new wheelchair accessible DART and Arrow rail cars are coming on stream. I am assured that Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will have a fully accessible bus fleet by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Some £28 million extra will be allocated to services for those with intellectual disability next year &ndash; £35 million in a full year. This will bring total spending to £450 million next year which represents a very significant improvement in residential, day and respite services. An additional provision will also be made to increase the maximum grants under the disabled persons grant and the essential repairs schemes.</P>
    <P>Carers perform a very valuable role in our society, a role which this Government continues to support by its decision to relax the income disregards which apply in relation to the means test for carers allowance. This will allow an additional 5,000 carers to qualify for the allowance as well as helping many current recipients. In addition, the annual respite care payment will be increased to £400 and this will be doubled where a recipient is caring for more than one person.</P>
    <P>Up to now, medical expenses relief currently could be claimed in respect of a relative where the claimant qualifies for a dependent relative allowance. In recognition of the problem facing many families, the rules will be amended to allow people to claim such relief where they are paying on behalf of a dependent relative whether they qualify for the dependent relative allowance. Where a person is employed to care for a family member who is incapacitated, a carer's tax allow<Col N="1357" /> ance is claimable. The amount allowable will be increased from £8,500 to £10,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The care of our children must be our priority. The Government has decided on the largest ever package of supports for children and their parents. A major programme for supporting child care in all parts of the country has already been put in place. The national development plan includes £250 million for child care and the Government subsequently allocated another £40 million. In the coming year £104 million of this will be spent. Child benefit is widely accepted as the best way to help parents and eliminate child poverty. I am delighted to see such a major increase announced today. Child benefit rates for first and second children are being increased by £25 to £67.50 per month and by £30 to £86 per month for third and subsequent children. The new rates will be brought forward to June which is three months earlier than usual.</P>
    <P>Other key elements of our initiative include the following. The period of paid maternity and adoptive leave will be extended by four weeks to 18 weeks and the four week period of unpaid leave will be doubled. As a result of these changes, from early April next, a mother can take up to six months leave in the period surrounding the birth or adoption of her child &ndash; a point very forcibly acknowledged by Senator O'Toole as being important.</P>
    <P>Foster parents play a vital role providing a home and support to vulnerable children. An additional £9 million is being allocated in the context of restructuring the existing payment and support system. The CAT rules will also be changed to ensure that foster children can inherit from foster parents as if they were a natural parent. The Civil Service child care initiative will be introduced with an allocation of £10 million capital to allow for the provision of up to 15 crèches throughout Ireland over the next two years.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package announced today amounts to £850 million in a full year &ndash; twice the size of last year's and most increases are being brought forward to next April. The package includes the following. Personal social welfare recipients will receive an extra £8 per week and couples on full rate social welfare payments will receive an increase of at least £15 per week from next April. Income thresholds for the receipt of the family income supplement are being increased by £25 per week from next April. This will result in average payments of £56 per week for existing recipients. The contributory pension for widows aged 66 years and over will be brought up to the same level as the old age contributory pension over the next two years. As a result, the widows in question will receive a special weekly increase of £2.90 bringing the widows contributory pension to £102 &ndash; a total increase of £12.90 next year.</P>
    <P>We all owe a debt of gratitude to the older members of our community. Much of the success we enjoy today stems from their efforts. This Government has made income support for pen<Col N="1358" /> sioners a priority. Pension rates were increased by a total of £18 per week in the last three budgets and today the full personal rate of old age and related pensions is being increased by a further £10 per week. This will bring the rate of old age contributory pension to £106 per week, significantly exceeding our commitment to paying £100 per week to old age pensioners by 2002.</P>
    <P>At the same time, 5,000 pensioners are being taken out of the tax net by an increase in the income tax exemption limits by £1,000 for a single person and £2,000 for a married couple. Furthermore, the medical card and the benefits of the social welfare free schemes will be available to all those aged 70 years and over, something I greatly welcome.</P>
    <P>Housing continues to be one of this Government's priorities. The measures we have introduced have been designed to improve access to good, affordable housing. Aimed at increasing the supply of housing, these measures are beginning to show results. Housing output increased by 20% since 1997 to 46,500 units last year. The year 2001 will see over £1 billion spent on local authority social and affordable housing. A total of £346 million is being provided in 2001 for investment in water and sewerage services.</P>
    <P>Up to now, rent relief allowed for under 55s has been significantly less than for the over 55s. The Government has decided to increase the rent allowable for under 55s by one-third from £750 per annum to £1,000 per annum for a single person and from £1,500 to £2,000 in the case of a married couple. In the case of widowed persons, the rate will be the same as the married rate of relief both for those under 55 and those aged 55 and over. I note the point made by Senator O'Toole. The special rent relief or the special rate for those wanting to rent a room is a very significant move by the Government and is something we would all welcome. I sincerely hope it helps younger couples and people taking out mortgages to find the necessary resources to purchase a home for their families.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to tackle the tragedy of those who find themselves homeless and is providing major funding to improve services in this area. Capital funding is being doubled from £20 million to £40 million over the next five years. This will provide additional accommodation for homeless persons, particularly transitional accommodation to facilitate a move-on process out of emergency accommodation. Local authorities will receive an extra £6 million a year towards increased subventions for hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, we all agree that we need a modern, efficient road network and a public transport system that delivers what the customer demands. That is why over half of the £40 billion national development plan is targeted at infrastructure needs. Over the life of the national development plan £6.3 billion will be spent on roads with £620 million being provided for the national road network in 2001. Over £2.25 billion <Col N="1359" /> has been allocated in the national development plan for public transport infrastructure. This will mean a major improvement in service to commuters.</P>
    <P>An additional allocation of £11.5 million in 2001 is being provided to address infrastructural deficiencies around the coast. This will assist the fishing industry by upgrading harbour infrastructure and allow for the exploitation of important marine tourism and leisure opportunities. Bord lascaigh Mhara will receive an extra £4 million next year for the development of the sea fisheries sector, including inshore fisheries, deep water species exploratory development, market development and aquaculture.</P>
    <P>There are a number of tax measures which I would like to mention. The business expansion scheme was first introduced in 1984. It is a tax based incentive designed to stimulate investment in small unquoted companies. The scheme provides individuals with tax relief for investing in these companies and qualifying companies can raise up to £0.25 million. The companies must be engaged in certain activities such as manufacturing and certain tourism services. The scheme was reviewed in 1998 and amended so as to refocus the relief on to its original intention which was providing capital for smaller start up companies which could find it hard to raise finance elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget, the Minister has decided to extend the business expansion scheme until the end of 2001. This will provide an opportunity to review the scheme thoroughly to determine how it is operating following the amendments made in 1998. It will also need to be determined whether, in the current economic climate, this scheme can continue to play a useful role.</P>
    <P>The Minister also decided that from 6 April next year the county enterprise boards will be able to certify certain activities such as manufacturing, internationally traded services and commercial research and development for the purposes of the business expansion scheme. As the county enterprise boards deal with small start-up companies, this should improve the accessibility of the scheme for such companies.</P>
    <P>The standard rate of corporation tax from 1 January 2001 will be 20%. For small and medium sized firms the 12.5% rate applies to the trading income of a company where that trading income does not exceed £50,000 per annum. From 1 January 2001, the ceiling will be increased to £200,000.</P>
    <P>The write-off period for the annual wear and tear capital allowance is being reduced from seven years to five years on a straight line basis with effect from 1 January next. It will also apply to business motor vehicles. The car value threshold for both new and second hand cars will be increased to £17,000.</P>
    <P>A number of tax measures are being introduced in order to promote investment in farming. Farmers, like other business sectors, will gain from the general increase in the annual capital <Col N="1360" /> allowances for investment in plant and machinery from 15% to 20%. The general 25% stock relief and the special 100% stock relief for certain young trained farmers will continue for a further two years from 6 April 2001, subject to conformity with EU state aid rules. The time period will be extended for reinvestment for roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes where farmland is the subject of a compulsory purchase order for road building. The flat rate of VAT charged by unregistered farmers to registered traders and the associated VAT rate for livestock will be increased to 4.3% from 1 January.</P>
    <P>Probate tax will be abolished at a cost of almost £30 million in a full year. This was referred to in the debate here last year. I am glad the Minister has abolished that tax.</P>
    <P>The Government is supportive of employee share schemes. Favourable tax treatment is already provided for approved profit sharing schemes, employee share ownership trusts and save as you earn share schemes. This favourable tax treatment is given to encourage share ownership among employees and to encourage greater co-operation at the level of the firm.</P>
    <P>The Government, in accordance with provisions in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, has established a committee to consider the whole area of employee financial participation, including gain sharing, share option schemes and the existing schemes. The committee is made up of representatives of ICTU, IBEC and the relevant Departments. A considerable amount of work has been done by the committee and the whole area will be considered further in the preparations for the Finance Bill. I very much welcome this. It is something in which I am deeply involved. I am aware of the enormous benefit of such schemes in terms of employees' feeling of ownership in companies and rewards for their very substantial contribution to their profitability. I look forward to the committee's report. I hope it will be as imaginative as some of the schemes being put forward. I am sure the Minister will look closely at this in advance of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I was very happy to hear the Taoiseach announce last Monday that, as part of strengthening the partnership process, the national centre for partnership and performance was being established. Through the centre, IBEC and ICTU will develop joint proposals to promote partnership in the workplace and to support and facilitate gain sharing and profit sharing on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>This budget represents another important step in the implementation of this Government's programme and delivers on the commitments we entered into when we came into office. It has been designed to support and maintain social partnership and reward work and enterprise. It will help secure continued prosperity in the years ahead. It is expected that GNP growth will slow from an estimated 8.6% this year to an average of 6% for the period 2001 to 2003. Employment should grow by about 2.5% annually, with unemployment declining a little further. The Govern<Col N="1361" /> ment also intends to run significant budgetary surpluses beyond 2001, in line with economic good sense and with our obligations under the stability and growth pact. We will continue to set aside at least 1% of GNP annually to build up the National Pension Reserve Fund. I agree with Senator O'Toole when he says that the partnership approach is crucial to economic development and stability. This budget supports social partnership. I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>When I saw Senator O'Toole's motion last Friday evening I had but one regret &ndash; that was that he was not a member of the racing club with which some Members of this House are associated. If he were, we would never back a loser because he seems to have the inside track. To take the racing analogy a little further, the Minister ran rather freely over the budget course last year. When he came to the individualisation fence, he fell badly, and there was a crowd on the plinth outside the Houses telling him where he went wrong.</P>
      <P>This year he was on a much tighter rein. I will give him credit for having one hand on the rein himself but to listen to Senator O'Toole one would think he was holding the other rein. The trade unions rightly pointed out that soaring inflation meant that employees saw the value of their pay rise under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness eroded. For that reason I welcome the measures which have been put in place over the past week to save the PPF. I must warn the Minister, however, that although that will ease some of the problems, it will not be enough to fix all the problems of industrial unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real threat to our economy is rising inflation. While the Minister for Finance must be applauded for the many tax cuts in his budget, he may have gone too far when one takes into account the state of the economy and the high rate of inflation. Cutting the top rate of tax will prove to be particularly inflationary, giving large gains to the better off and a boost to the overheated housing market. The Minister has failed to convince people that inflation has peaked. He cannot be trusted in this matter. His previous forecasts in relation to inflation have been totally skewed. Last year he forecast that inflation would rise no further than 4%; we saw it rise to 7%. Today he has told us that the rise in inflation will be only 4.5%. The Government has introduced what it calls anti-inflation measures to deal with this problem. With the exception of the reduction in the price of diesel, which I welcome, the rest of these measures are cosmetic. The Minister hopes the 1% reduction in the rate of VAT will be passed on to the consumer and not absorbed in higher retail margins and that if that happens the wisdom of a cut in the <Col N="1362" /> rate of VAT will be in doubt. There is, therefore, already a doubt in relation to the anti-inflation package. If inflation cannot be controlled, it will put pressure on wages and prices as we move into the new year. I will be surprised if, within the next 12 months, Senator O'Toole and his colleagues are not back with the social partners to hammer out a further wage increase.</P>
    <P>In formulating his budget, the Minister for Finance must have been aware of the ESRI report which shared the view of many economists that tax cuts or increased public spending would increase demand in the economy. This demand would push through into the labour market, resulting in higher wages and consumer prices and, in turn, increased inflation. Together with the strengthening of the euro in the past few weeks, this could have a serious effect on the competitive nature of international markets in the future.</P>
    <P>What is more surprising is that, with a budget surplus of £6 billion, social welfare recipients receive an increase of £8 per week. Much has been said about the elimination of poverty in society. I am sure the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Fr. Healy of CORI will be disappointed at this increase.</P>
    <P>There are measures in the budget which I welcome. I welcome the Minister's change of attitude, his death bed conversion, in relation to the credit union movement and the provision of £1 million for housing. I welcome the increases in child benefit and old age pensions, especially the relief for elderly persons &ndash; I put myself in that category &ndash; where a husband and wife can earn £17,000 tax free.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has been described as something of a soothsayer. I hope his crystal ball will remain in good working order because we need it to continue in good shape for all sorts of reasons which have nothing to do with the racing club. I gather from what he has said that we can feel assured the PPF is safe.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said this is his fourth budget in a series of five, but it is probably the last before the next general election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very able Kerryman at my back. The Minister had the largest surplus in the history of the State and it could have been seen, therefore, as a giveaway budget. The sudden rise in inflation to more than double the level anticipated and the wage increases set in the PPF, leading to the recent efforts which I hope will be <Col N="1363" /> successful, have meant that the Minister's efforts today were geared more at easing discontent than dishing out a really welcome treat. I was informed by a prominent member of the main Government party on the way in here that, given the bruising which the Minister suffered last year as a result of individualisation, this budget had the Taoiseach's fingerprints all over it. Given that the economy is overheating and inflation is rising, there is a danger it could fuel inflation and, despite the Taoiseach's best efforts, matters may not materialise as intended.</P>
      <P>The budget has done nothing to mitigate the worst effects of the three Bacon reports. It is a statistical fact that house prices continue to rise. The budget has failed on the housing cost front. I am sure there will be an opportunity to say more about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not seem as if a year has passed since I spoke on the last budget but it is my privilege today to address the fourth budget of this Administration. Today the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, presented to the nation a budget that is caring in nature, especially for those on low incomes. It is the Minister's intention to see through set targets during our term in office and, with one budget remaining, it seems likely he will do so. This will be the first time in the history of the State that any Government has achieved its financial goals.</P>
      <P>We are still experiencing a fall in unemployment, which is down to 4%, and the living standards of our people continue to improve. These are clear indicators that our policies are working. Under the leadership of the Taoiseach, the Fianna Fáil Party along with its partner, the Progressive Democrats, has been shown to be a Government with strong policies, never evading its responsibility for the overall financial good of the nation, even when those policies seem unpopular. During our term in office we have nurtured and fed the Celtic tiger to such an extent that Ireland now ranks as one of the fastest growing economies in the western world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the downside in growing economies can be a rise in inflation. However, the <Col N="1364" /> Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has taken steps to curb this problem. I would rather think that the Celtic snail is an endangered species.</P>
    <P>Under this Government the management of the economy is in safe hands. I have no doubt that at the next general election in a year and a half the people will take this into account. It gives me great pleasure on travelling through the length and breadth of the country to view the prosperity of the nation. Young people now have a better opportunity to avail of third level education and senior citizens enjoy a standard of living that was not possible a decade ago.</P>
    <P>This is a budget for the elderly, children, carers, workers, those with a disability and those in business. It is all embracing. Elderly persons will receive an increase of £10 in their income, a married couple on a contributory pension will receive £20. Those over 70 years of age will no longer have to worry about a visit to the doctor as they will have a medical card and will receive medication without any cost to themselves. This is a major step forward. As one who worked in the health service for many years I am aware that elderly persons have put off visits to their GP due to the costs involved. This decision by the Minister for Finance is the most progressive step I have witnessed in my ten years in the House as regards attention to the medical needs of the elderly. I compliment him on his initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>Children are the future of the nation. Today's decision to increase child benefit by £25 for the first and second child and £30 thereafter is welcome. This is a recognition of the contribution made by mothers, in particular, to whom this benefit is usually paid. We have all been lobbied in the past and particularly in the past 12 months regarding the plight of carers. I have spoken at length on this topic and have always objected to the means test. A married couple can now earn £250 per week before a means test is applied. That is a major step forward. This increase of £100 per week for a married couple will enhance their opportunity to receive carer's allowance. The amount for respite care has been increased to £400 and can be paid where two people are being cared for.</P>
    <P>It is vital that incentives are introduced to encourage people to return to work. It has been said, rightly or wrongly, that people will not go out to work because they are better off depending on the social welfare system. That those on low incomes of up to £144 per week will be exempt from tax is a major step forward. As many as 77% of workers will now be on a 20% tax rate. That is a major achievement for this Government. The benefit it will bring to people in employment will be seen over the next 12 months. People will get proper compensation for employment.  </P>
    <P>We must always take responsibility for the disabled. Over the years disabled people have not been cared for and have been second class citizens, but in recent times their plight has changed dramatically. I welcome today's announcement <Col N="1365" /> that the living alone allowance will be extended to everyone in this category.</P>
    <P>Transport cost reliefs have received very little attention in the debate on the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most progressive step in the budget. I estimate that a fisherman who uses 15,000 litres of fuel per week or spends eight to ten days at sea will gain up to £1,500 per week as a result of the introduction of today's measure. People in the haulage industry will make comparable gains. This is the most important decision taken in recent times in the interests of industry generally and the transport industry in particular and I compliment the Minister for Finance on it.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on many aspects of the budget. This Government has shown itself to be a good manager of the national coffers and innovative in its thinking. It has also shown itself to be the most caring Government that we have had in modern times.</P>

      <P>Forget about that. Could Ernest Blythe have foreseen a day when a Minister for Finance would have a surplus of 5 billion euros? This is probably the last time we will talk in old fashioned Irish pounds because next year we will be talking in euros. I think we will reach 7.8 billion euros with another surplus. I mention this because this is a budget that we must welcome in so many ways. There are so many give-aways.</P>
      <P>The economy, however, is a very delicate flower and needs to be well looked after to ensure it remains healthy. I listened to the Minister for Finance today when he stated his four budget objectives. Three are to improve our quality of life, promote a fairer society and reward work and enterprise through ongoing tax reform. He has done a great deal in these areas. His first objective is to manage our economy to secure our continued prosperity. This is the delicate flower I referred to and the one thing we must look after. Have we done that?</P>
      <P>A little while ago I telephoned my home and I was informed Motorola in Swords has announced that its company is being sold and that there is a danger posed to, if not a conclusion of, 600 jobs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As many as 750 jobs in Swords may be lost in one go. Let us remind ourselves how delicate our economy is and of the responsibility on us and the Minister to make sure he looks after it. We should then see if there are any dangers in that. We have a great deal to thank the Minister for and, as Senator O'Toole said, we have a great deal to congratulate him on.</P>
      <P>I want to focus on two areas. I notice that the Minister has abolished the ceiling on PRSI to be paid by employers in respect of high earners, which is currently £36,600. This means there will be a cost to an employer when they wish to attract talent. A lack of talent is a problem in this country. We need to attract talented high earners. Suddenly, the Minister has put a tax of 12%, a higher rate than before, on anyone earning more than £36,900. That is the delicate plant I am talking about. I worry that some of the steps he took today do not look to the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a lot away today but we are used to it by now. He showed all of the abandon of a young boy throwing confetti at a wedding. The level of his give-aways is at the highest end of people's expectations. It is almost as if the Minister thumbed his nose at all the people who urged restraint. We should consider exercising some restraint.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the inflationary pressures that Senator Doyle talked about. I will judge this budget by how effectively it diverts people's resources from spending to saving. This was the big challenge faced by the Minister. Political factors directed that he be generous, whereas economic prudence calls for him to put brakes on the economy. Encouraging savings is the obvious way to meet this paradox. That is why, for several months, I urged the Minister, as I always have, to consider introducing quite dramatic incentives for people to save. I looked at his speech and discovered very vague terms. Under current conditions interest rates are lower than the rate of inflation and there is no incentive to save. That is even before taking account of the impact of DIRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

      <P>People are losing money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. It is no wonder that our national savings rate has dropped by almost one-third over the past two years. I have heard very little mention of this and no mention of it in the budget. This means that all of the money released by the Minister today will overheat the economy. Of course we love having more money and welcome it. However, we should look to the future and see where we are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been alone in urging the Minister to take the savings route. All kinds of alternative schemes have been suggested and they have the same aim, to make a big gesture to people by giving more of their money back and, for the good of <Col N="1367" /> the economy, making them an offer they cannot refuse. I wanted to hear the Minister say there would be savings incentives so generous that people would be encouraged to save rather than spend. I listened to the Minister's speech and waited patiently for him to announce massive savings incentives, but I waited in vain. There was a pittance in the direction of credit union savings. There is a promise to talk with deposit taking institutions before writing the Finance Bill. There is also a clumsy way to jump backwards in the suggestion that the lowering of capital gains tax two years ago is relevant to increasing savings now.</P>
    <P>I waited for the big attention grabbing gesture. I was sure the Minister would do something quite dramatic like saying that if a person saves £100 a week rather than spending it they will not have to pay tax on it. I looked for signs that would encourage people to hesitate before rushing to spend their money. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The triple digits on car registrations in Dublin remind us of the incentives to spend rather than save.</P>
    <P>This is a give-away budget. It takes no cognisance of the need for restraint, the need to hold back inflationary pressures or the need to dampen the clearly evident overheating of our economy. In framing the budget the Minister's motto could have been eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow you will certainly regret it.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that this nation will regret such a lopsided budget and in the medium term it will cost us dear. I love so much of the budget and I congratulate the Minister on many of the things he did. All of the Senators have said the same and I will not repeat what they said.</P>
    <P>I talked earlier about a delicate plant. I am a gardener. I planted celery for years but could not succeed in growing it. One day, I read in a gardening book that to plant good celery one should sow the seed in ground prepared two years previously. I suggest the Minister needs to be more of a gardener than he has been tonight. I would like him to think about how he can prepare the ground today to ensure those seeds will flourish in the future.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Finance Bill. The Minister has hinted he is going to do something about savings. I would like to see him do something dramatic in that regard. If he does, the ground might be much healthier in the future and our economy will have a much better chance of surviving.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, which goes back a long time, every budget has its own distinct flavour which leaves a taste in the mouth long after the budget details are forgotten. The infamous budget of Ernest Blythe has been referred to. The budget I remember best was that chilly January night when VAT was put on children's shoes. The philosophy underpinning that was that women with small feet might buy children's shoes. As a wearer of a size three and a half shoe, <Col N="1368" /> that budget is the one that has lasted longest in my mind. This budget will be remembered for the frantic efforts that are being made to find the hole in the middle of the doughnut &ndash; those with that approach have been very vocal this evening.</P>
      <P>I do not read this budget as a scatter gun budget. I see it as an exercise underpinned by a very clear philosophy on how the economy must be nurtured, nourished and left in a good condition for the next generation. I also see it as a very caring budget that makes long overdue decent provision for the elderly, children, the disabled and the weaker sections of society. That is the outcome of a well thought out strategy, worked out in conjunction with our social partners, to whom this country owes a great debt of gratitude.</P>
      <P>I will refer mainly, although not solely, to the taxation measures introduced in the budget. Cutting tax has been a primary focus of my party since its inception. We argued from the outset that work ought not be to taxed as a luxury. We also identified the fact that if Ireland, a small, open economy, was to remain competitive in an increasingly challenging world, our labour costs had to be kept at a reasonable rate, otherwise, we would price ourselves out of badly needed markets.</P>
      <P>The philosophy underpinning these tax cuts is motivated solely by the aim of giving people back some of their own money, which I think is the decent thing to do. However, there is also a deeper and more long-term strategy, which is to protect and preserve jobs. Mention was made this evening of what has happened in Motorola. That is a sharp reminder that industry is very mobile nowadays and what we have today might not necessarily be here tomorrow, unless we take proper measures in relation to wage and tax control to ensure we remain competitive and retain badly needed inward investment to underpin the economy.</P>
      <P>There is a very clear philosophy underpinning the tax provisions in this budget. I welcome the fact that 26 points have been taken off tax since 1989, which is highly significant. As a long suffering member of the PAYE tribe, who were crucified at times when other people were paying no tax, I am very glad something is being given back to PAYE workers and that they have some discretion over how they spend some of the money they earn.</P>
      <P>This is more than a budget underpinning a brittle economy, that we want to develop and keep strong, and a social partnership that is central to the continuation of this economy. It is about promoting and fostering a healthy society. Measures in the budget, such as the increases in child benefit and the old age pension, will seek to minimise, if not eradicate, poverty and develop a fair and healthy society, where there is not a huge gap between the haves and the have-nots. None of us would like to live in or fashion a society which had such a huge gap; it would not be a healthy place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> I am particularly pleased with the proposal to give medical cards to everyone over 70 in our society. That will make a major difference, particularly in the area of primary health care. I know a number of senior citizens who put off going to a doctor because they cannot afford the fee. I also know a number of elderly citizens, particularly women, who do not get their drugs or medication from the pharmacy because the costs are so high. This measure will make a major difference to their health and lives. It is to be highly commended and I very much welcome it.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increase in old age pensions. It has often been said, and more honoured in the breach than the observance, that this generation of old age pensioners laid the foundations on which our economy rests. It would be a very poor and threadbare society which did not give some measure of gratitude to such people. I am very pleased with the provisions that have been made for the elderly under a series of headings in this budget.</P>
    <P>I will not discuss every provision of the budget. We all pick out the pieces which resonate with our own concerns. This is a particularly good budget.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the beginning about people who are frantically looking for the hole in the doughnut. Inflation is the new bogeyman. A number of measures announced today are aimed specifically at containing and reducing inflation, as far as it is within our remit to do. When I was praying for the conversion of Russia we heard about reds under the beds. The prophets of doom now talk about inflation. I think we will be able to deal with inflation if we continue along the route of this budget, which I welcome and support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the recent talks that have sought to improve the terms of the social partnership. We warned this time last year that this partnership agreement would run aground because it had not taken into account the obvious and dramatic increase in inflation taking place at that time. Now, at least, some progress has been made to try to deal with the change that has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said at that time that the inflation rate would be 3% and kept repeating that mantra during the year. He has now admitted that it will be in the region of 5.5% or 6%, although he has never accepted the real level of inflation, which is 7%. He is predicting in the budget that it will be 4.5% next year. That is a long way from the benchmark under which the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was negotiated over 12 months ago. I am not satisfied that the benchmarking, which is due to be in place by 2002, will be adequate to deal with <Col N="1370" /> present industrial relations problems. It will not satisfy the ASTI, for example.</P>
    <P>With regard to the budget, another year has elapsed but we are not any wiser as to the Minister for Finance's strategy. As much as its predecessor, this budget is skewed in favour of the well off against those at the bottom of the pile. The top rate of income tax has been reduced by a further 2%, from 44% to 42%, which benefits those on higher incomes disproportionately.</P>

      <P>Anybody who can count will see how those at the higher income levels will benefit disproportionately from the budget. It was made clear on the television news tonight.</P>
      <P>Individualisation has been continued which means the single income family will suffer disproportionately in terms of tax take by comparison with the two income family. The discrepancy in terms of taxation at the higher rate will increase to £11,000, where two income families will continue to be taxed at the lower rate up to a combined income of £40,000. Corporation tax will be reduced from 24% to 20%, which will be of major benefit to the business sector.</P>
      <P>The national drugs strategy has been allocated a meagre increase of £2 million, despite the massive drugs problem that has never been properly tackled. A sum of £0.75 million has been allocated to deal with disadvantaged primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am especially disappointed that there has not been more for homelessness. An allocation of £20 million over five years amounts to £4 million per annum, which is very inadequate considering the scale of the problem. Once again the budget is skewed towards the well off.</P>

      <P>The budget has an extraordinary potential to increase the risk of inflation, which is undermining the prosperity that has allowed the Minster for Finance to engage in what can only be termed a spending splurge. It has already been described as such by economic commentators, never mind his political opponents. I am not convinced it is anything other than a pre-election spending splurge to attempt to buy votes. However, the Minister will fail in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to a clear philosophy and well worked out strategy underpinning the budget. I have no doubt it is to get the Government re-elected. She also referred to the importance of generating a healthy society. It should be <Col N="1371" /> the aim and determination of any Government in its spending policy, especially at a time of budget surpluses, to create a healthy society. However, that will not be the effect of this budget.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is on the increase due to the inflationary effects of the Government's spending policies. Despite our economic success, couples and families on what would have been considered a good income cannot afford to find the money for the inflated price of a first time house. It is virtually impossible for a single person.</P>
    <P>On RTÉ television today the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs was asked about increasing the fuel allowance. He said the allowance would not want to be put too high because when payment stops in April it would be too much of a shock to people. That sums up the attitude of the Government. I am sure Members on the Government side of the House meet pensioners on a weekly, even a daily basis, as I do, who cannot survive without the fuel allowance, who are dependent on it and who find it almost impossible to keep their houses warm.</P>

      <P>The Minster for Finance's booklet accompanying his Budget Statement cites examples of how people will be affected by the budget. Among them is &ldquo;Caroline&rdquo;, who is single and employed earning £11,500 per annum and who will gain almost £500. &ldquo;Paul and Mary&rdquo; are a retired couple, Paul being 68 and Mary 66 years of age. He has an occupational and old age pension. After the new tax year they will be outside the tax net and will gain £1,540 as a result of the tax and social welfare changes. &ldquo;John and Orla&rdquo; are married. John is employed earning £35,000 per annum while Orla works at home. They have two children and they will gain £1,803. There are other examples given.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the global figures. These examples illustrate the bottom line figures. &ldquo;John and Síle&rdquo; are a married couple with two children. John is self employed in his own business and earns £40,000 per annum. Síle is a school teacher and earns £30,000 per annum. They will gain £3,670 from the budget. It is a fallacy to suggest that the budget is skewed in favour of the better off.</P>

      <P>Since I started working I have always believed that if one worked hard one would do well and if one paid one's taxes one would reap the rewards. That is what the budget is doing today.</P>
      <P>If we want to judge the budget against quality of life measurements we can point to a safer environment, a better society for children, ourselves and older people and a better distribution of the tax burden. Children, mothers and families will see huge increases in child benefits. I remember when child benefit was £25 per month. It is being increased by £25 per month, or by £30 for the third and fourth children. A family with four children will get £307 per month in child benefit, tax free. One would have to earn between £4,800 and £6,000 per annum to realise that. People do not realise there will be the same increase in 2002 and 2003. By the end of 2003, £117.40 and £146 will be paid directly to the mothers of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paid maternity leave has been increased by four weeks to 18 weeks. An additional eight weeks unpaid leave has also been provided. People joke that eight weeks unpaid leave is not any good. However, an additional eight weeks is <Col N="1373" /> worth a lot to any mother who has had a baby and she will not have to worry about entitlements. It is good for any mother to be able to take six months off and then to take additional parental leave if that is her desire. Perhaps the Minister of State might raise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the issue of maternity leave for politicians which has not been addressed. Many people in this House might need it.</P>
    <P>Notice has not been taken of the medical expenses. I take credit for the provision in the budget which allows for routine maternity expenses to be written off against tax. This change will be introduced by the Minister in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The top rate of tax has been reduced to 42%. A single earner can earn up to £20,000 while paying tax at 20%. The first £144 of earnings per week will be exempt from tax.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the initiative of renting a room. People often ask how they can afford to buy a house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

      <P>The room for rent initiative is one of the smartest things the Minister has done. It allows people to benefit from making rooms available in their principal private residence. It allows them to declare the income which can be used for assessment purposes and for paying back mortgages. It also means we are moving into a regulated market and out of the black economy where people paid rent to people who did not declare it. A sum of £6,000 is more than £100 per week. It is a tremendous initiative which I welcome.</P>
      <P>VAT has been reduced by 1%. The price of diesel and petrol has also been reduced. Probate tax of 2% has been abolished.</P>

      <P>The carer's grant has been increased by £10 for people over 65 and by £8 for people under 65. The respite grant has been increased to £400 per annum. That will make a huge difference to people. Many people could not believe they received a grant of £300 last year. It meant they could put someone in a nursing home or go away for a weekend to get away from the principal duty of caring. We have increased that grant to £400. These are the initiatives which make a difference to people's quality of life.</P>
      <P>Some 450 extra child care assistants will be provided in the primary school system to work with children with special needs. Some £1.75 million will be provided for computer and related equipment for children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are focusing on people with disabilities, <Col N="1374" /> carers and older people. Any person over 70 years of age will be automatically entitled to the medical card. They will also get ESB and telephone allowances and a television licence. The disregard for the fuel allowance has been increased from £30 per week to £40 per week. This means more people will receive the fuel allowance. As Senator O'Meara said, that is an important allowance which will now be paid for a number of extra weeks.</P>
    <P>An island grant of £10 has also been provided. Last week a member of the Fine Gael party said that Fianna Fáil had reneged on its promises and that it would not introduce this grant. I am glad he has been proved wrong and we have been proved right. We promised this grant and we are now delivering it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to discuss the specifics of this budget. Senator Cox has enunciated most of them and that is the second time this evening we have heard them. I welcome most of the measures in the budget as far as they go. However, the budget is based on the premise that everything will continue exactly as it has done in recent years.</P>
      <P>There is a danger inherent in that philosophy because the Celtic tiger economy is riding on the back of the technological revolution. We are vulnerable because we do not have a mix of traditional industry, which other nations have, to cushion us in the event of a collapse in a sector of our economy. If, this time next year, the pendulum swings the other way and the pound is at £1.10 sterling instead of 78p, in what type of competitive position would we find ourselves? The current exchange rate suits our industries.</P>
      <P>I spoke recently to a managing director of a company in the west who employs 200 people. However, he is expanding his business in Poland by a further 200 people because our wage structure is too high. We must be careful about that. There was a report this evening that there could be job losses in Motorola. Such developments may snowball if we are not careful. Wage inflation must be contained or we will lose our competitiveness and the premise on which the budget is based will collapse. We must keep people working. I told the Minister for Finance when he was in the House a few months ago that unless people keep working this economy will not keep progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is currently on its knees. Where would this country be if we were dependent on the agricultural sector? Could we afford the type <Col N="1375" /> of confetti we saw today in terms of the dispersal of money? Many of the measures are well placed but there is no emphasis on saving, which is important. The Minister is adopting a spending philosophy and there is no emphasis on saving. It does not encourage people to save. The Government has lost the message in the belief that things will continue as they have done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Caffrey for sharing his time with me because otherwise I would not have had the opportunity to speak. I welcome all the goodies in the budget which were anticipated. People will not be quite as grateful for them as the Minister thinks because many people expected this to happen. It is good that Senator Quinn said what he did. He spoke about inflation last April and suggested we should debate it on a monthly basis. I wish we had because we might not be in the mess in which we now find ourselves.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought the widow's contributory pension up to the same level as the old age contributory pension. I lobbied him on this matter given that women who had to retire from the workforce because of the marriage bar could never reach the right level. I am extremely grateful to the Minister for introducing this measure.</P>
      <P>I am pleased in relation to the provision for medical cards for those over 70 years of age. However, I find it extraordinary that every year the number of people in receipt of a medical card decreases. Five years ago, 37% of people had medical cards and this has reduced to 30%. Why did he not increase this on a pro rata basis? The same people are getting medical cards, which is extraordinary. It is all very well to give people increases, but it is extremely difficult if they lose benefits, such as the medical card.</P>
      <P>I am pleased DÍON will receive additional money because they do incredible work in England. I am pleased also in regard to the Consumers' Association. Having considered the current BSE problem and how consumers were ignored, it is beneficial to have that organisation as a watchdog. I am pleased that there will be a greater effort to build hostels for the homeless. There should also be hostels for those who leave prison and have nowhere to go because there is a serious problem with re-offending.</P>
      <P>Apparently sport is for men only because, except for those who play camogie, there is no money allotted to women's sport. Perhaps the Minister will reconsider this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a recognition that a general decrease in VAT would mean the price of tobacco products would decrease. The Minister has recommended that this can be changed by way of an order. I wish he had managed to get the consumer price index throughout the EU changed so that tobacco could be taken out of the equation and there could be a decent increase in its price. Apparently the price of cigarettes is the only issue <Col N="1376" /> which affects young people and I wish the Minister would do something about it.</P>
    <P>I wish there had been an increase in third level grants. Having supported individualisation last year, I am pleased this is continuing. I support the child care benefit but I wish the tax relief was given to those who employ individual child minders as this would enhance the status of these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF" hpid="Mr. Glennon Mr. Glennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Chambers.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator O'Toole, on his foresight and initiative. I hope this is something in the north Dublin air, spreading from the south west, and when it gets to the north east of the constituency, things will really take off.</P>
      <P>I am sure he will forgive me if I preface my contribution to this debate with an expression of sympathy to his and my neighbours in Swords, 750 of whom received news today that their jobs were no more. This is as a result of the global strategic alliance between Celestica and Motorola, resulting in Motorola being taken over by Celestica. Ironically, Celestica is also based in Swords and, in fact, is almost a next door neighbour of Motorola. The good news is that of the 1,400 employees of Motorola, 750 jobs are being saved. Nevertheless, it is a sad day for Swords when 750 jobs are lost.</P>
      <P>This news broke within the last 24 hours. I have had several discussions today with the Tánaiste and there is an attractive severance package in place. However, the only really attractive severance package in this day and age for any employee losing their job is alternative employment. I hope and I am confident given the jobs market, particularly in the IT sector, that it will not be too long before the 750 workers obtain not just their generous severance package, but also the only real compensation of alternative employment.</P>
      <P>Having diverted somewhat from Senator O'Toole's motion, I now wish to address it specifically. The motion proposes an acknowledgment that the Minister for Finance following consultations with the social partners has delivered, as promised, a pay and taxation deal which compensates for the erosion of value caused by inflation and which has also delivered the first moiety of the PPF taxation commitments. The legal phrase is <i>res ipsa loquitur</i>, the facts speak for themselves. In light of today's budget, I do not know how anyone could disagree with that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to contribute in particular to the second part of the motion. It proposes that we note that the agreement of the Minister to the fast-forwarding of the implementation of the benchmarking outcomes has been of particular importance to public sector employees, including teachers. Given the week we have had, which included for me the unhappy experience of receiving an official delegation yesterday of 12 leaving certificate pupils from my home town of <Col N="1377" /> Skerries, classmates of my daughter, who were rightly concerned, it is time the ASTI recognised the difficulties it is causing for examination pupils in particular and the manner in which its standing in the community is being diminished as a result of the stance it has taken.</P>
    <P>The PPF machinery was tested severely over the last number of months. Its strength came to the fore in the last couple of days. The flexibility which is such an integral part of this agreement, and which for me was the acid test of the agreement, came through with flying colours. It is time the ASTI in particular took on board the lessons of this week, not just of today but of Monday night. The sight of secondary school pupils with examination commitments having to march to Leinster House and to the ASTI offices to access their constitutional right to education highlights a very sad week for that sector. I urge the ASTI to take time out, reflect on all the events of this week and to come back to the consultation table to use the successful machinery which exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the totality of today's budget. This is the benchmark of the work of the PPF and Government. The way in which the budget is set out is a recognition to the Irish people that we have brought ourselves this far and that we are in a position to address the issues and share the prosperity of our nation in a proper and planned manner. It recognises the strengths of the unions, employers, the general public and the whole concept of the PPF.</P>
      <P>It is a tremendous document which deals with every sector. It is an investment in the future strength of our economy and it recognises our achievements of the last two or three years. In light of what the previous speaker said in relation to the importance of the Government's relationships within the PPF, it outlines to the ASTI that it must play its part in the prosperity set out in the partnership arrangement. I ask the ASTI to participate in what is considered to be the best way forward for the State.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers criticised the lack of commitment to savings. Senator Quinn made a number of strong comments in that regard. In my opinion, the Government will address that matter in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The need to recognise the needs of the disadvantaged as part of the PPF is addressed in terms of the investments outlined in the budget. In addition, the budget recognises the work done by those who provide foster care. There are 70 families in County Mayo who care for young people from very disadvantaged backgrounds. These families have made a major commitment and received very little by way of remuneration. The budget recognises their commitment and makes provision to invest in this area in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget also recognises the great work done by families who have cared for elderly and young relations. That is an important develop<Col N="1378" /> ment. I welcome the removal of the disregards and the means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and the Members who contributed to the debate. Independents' Private Members' time has been used for the past three years to have a debate on the evening of the budget. Prior to that we never had an opportunity to discuss the budget in the House until long after its introduction. I suggest that, with the agreement of the Leader, we should have a longer debate on the budget in the future. Three hours should be set aside to allow Members to make more rounded contributions.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of points I did not have an opportunity to make earlier. It is tragic to learn of the job loses at Motorola which will have an impact on the lives of people living in north Dublin and on the economy in Swords, the capital of Fingal. I hope that immediate pressure will be exerted to bring alternative employment to the area.</P>
      <P>I did not deal with a number of issues in my initial contribution. Two issues with which I should have dealt came to the fore through the machinery of the ICTU and at my union's conference earlier this year. These two issues relate to tax breaks and have particular relevance to the points raised by a number of speakers. The first of these is that emphasis should be placed on people at the lower end of the scale and that the threshold should be raised for those entering the taxation net. In addition, there is the issue of reducing the number of people on the higher rate.</P>
      <P>In a recent debate I demanded that the Government should at least commit itself to removing from the tax net everybody either on or below the minimum wage between this budget and next year's budget. I stated that the way to do this would be to increase the threshold to £150 per week this year and increase it further next year. The Minister took some of my advice and has increased the threshold to £144 per week. More importantly, however, he has given a commitment that by the next tax year everyone on or below the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net. Members of the Labour Party have been calling for such a move for some time. We would have liked to see it achieved this year but I recognise the Minister's commitment to doing so by next year.</P>
      <P>Last year I made the point that there are great difficulties involved in considering the movement of people in and out of the higher tax band. If one removes people from the tax net altogether, the percentage on the higher band actually increases. The more people are removed, the more difficult it is to obtain an accurate indication of the overall picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had thought that the Opposition would have picked up on the fact that the Minister cleverly referred to the proportion of income earners in his budget speech. I acknowledge, first, that this is a clever piece of manoeuvring but, second, that it is the correct way to proceed. That is the way <Col N="1379" /> matters should be dealt with in the future because we will be able to identify the proportion of workers who are outside the tax net, the proportion who are on the lower tax rate and the proportion on the higher tax rate. By obtaining those three figures we will be able to chart people's movement. It is important to note that, after the implementation of the budget, only 23% of income earners will be on the higher tax rate. That is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has referred on a number of occasions to the issue of share options. The Minister indicated in his budget speech that he will listen to the advice of the social partners on whether to include provisions on share options in the Finance Bill. I look forward to hearing the views of Senator Ross and others on that matter at a later date. I agree with the Senator that movement should be made on this issue and I promise to present his point of view to the social partners.</P>
    <P>The fact that only 23% of all income earners are on the higher rate of tax and that, by next year, no one earning the minimum wage or below will be in the tax net are two welcome developments. I also welcome the decision to continue to invest 1% of gross national product in the national pensions reserve fund each year. That is good housekeeping and the Minister's actions will <Col N="1380" /> be applauded by those who benefit in the years between 2012 to 2020.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's point about the need to provide incentives to encourage people to save. However, I cannot suggest a mechanism which will encourage people to save more money. I can suggest many things which would encourage people to move their savings from one product into a more attractive product.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the suggestion that making extra money available will fuel inflation. I reject that suggestion outright. People should remember that there is already a huge amount of money available in the economy. The budget involves the redistribution of wealth. Since the money is in the economy in any event, giving it to workers or taxpayers will not necessarily fuel inflation. Some of the economists who are quick to comment on the workings of economic models should consider that point. The reality is that a couple who went out and drank four pints on a Saturday night found they could only afford to buy two as a result of inflation. If these people get more money they will simply return to drinking more pints. That will not fuel inflation.</P>
    <P>In the 1970s we could not redistribute wealth because we did not have the money to do so. I welcome this redistribution which is good for the economy and for workers.</P>
