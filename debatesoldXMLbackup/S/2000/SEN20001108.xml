      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to disclose the outcome of the February investigation into the high number of deaths from brain haemorrhage in the docklands area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Cregan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to grant an extension of time to personal assistants of people with physical and sensory disabilities who are currently employed on community employment schemes.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to include County Kerry in the new proposed national gas lines for the country.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected Senator Costello's and Senator Cregan's matters which will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Kiely may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes; No. 2, the Insurance Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages to be taken today at 2.30 p.m.; No. 15, motion No. 31, to be <Col N="482" /> taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business to resume thereafter, if not previously concluded. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. It would be nice this morning to be able to send our congratulations to the next President of the United States but I think that would be a little previous. Many of us in this House have personal experience of recounts where a fraction of a vote is the difference between victory and failure. Obviously we can empathise and sympathise with the two candidates this morning as they live through that ordeal.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I ask for an urgent debate on the report by Mr. Seán Cromien into the education system. It is a report which, in some ways, is an indictment of the education system and also contains some far-reaching and radical proposals. Those of us on this side of the House would like a debate on that report next week, if at all possible. Does the Leader have a date for the proposed debate on Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the call by Senator Manning for a discussion on the report on the Department of Education and Science. I have not read the report because it has not been made available so far but it is crucially important. We should remind ourselves that much of the time that is wasted in the Department of Education and Science is in dealing with queries from Members of the Oireachtas. That is not a reflection on Members. It is an appropriate part of public representation but it raises major questions as to the way we do our business and gain information, and the way information is made available to us. The report raises many questions about the decision making processes in the Department that have to give rise to concern to everybody, whether they be parents, teachers or decision makers at many different levels. It is crucial that we should have a debate on this report. It is not clear whether the report will be published; I am not sure if Senator Manning is aware of that. I could not get confirmation that it will be published but I look forward to it.</P>
      <P>Every time there is a discussion on the budget or social partnership many people, including my colleague, Senator Ross, talk about the lack of consultation with Members of the Oireachtas. Every group in the country is putting forward pre-budget submissions, including teachers, trade unions and other groups, yet Members of the Oireachtas tend to sit back and let their parties do that. We have had some good debates, and one very recently, on the whole question of the economy, etc. We should have something in the nature of a pre-budget discussion in this House. Over the past few years we have had a post-budget discussion which has been very helpful, but it would be important for people to put their views on the line beforehand. I ask that this be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> On a second related issue on public representation, I understand the Buckley report on the salaries and allowances for senior civil servants, the Judiciary and Members of the Oireachtas is currently with the Minister for Finance. Many of the hopes of Members of the Oireachtas are dependent on that report. I note the Government's proposal to extend the working hours of Members of the Oireachtas. Members will not object to this proposal but it should be debated in the context of seeking extra reward as any other group of workers would do in an efficient and open manner. We should debate this issue. Members of both Houses have nothing to hide and we should prepare the ground for making the demand. Whatever comes from the report will hardly be enough as I have never represented a group of people who were happy with the outcome of any negotiations. Unless this case is extraordinary people should be setting themselves up to work out what they will be unhappy with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have looked at the situation in Northern Ireland at various levels but there are technical issues which should be made clear to Members. We are aware of David Trimble's position and his direction to Ministers, but we are not clear on what is happening and what can happen at sub-ministerial level of the North-South bodies. It is not clear whether they can continue, whether their agendas have been set for a year or so, or whether their work comes to a halt. These and other technical issues are worth discussing so that Members can put forward views on how this process might be moved forward. People in the North are as despondent as I have seen them for many a long day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Manning, I had expected we would be congratulating one of the candidates in the US election and we sympathise with them on the knife-edge recount which has arisen. We can at least congratulate Hillary Clinton on her fine victory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome victory and we thank her and her husband for the enormous contribution they have made during their period in the White House. I hope Bill Clinton will not be lost to politics and that whoever takes over in the White House will give him a role as some kind of roving ambassador with a wide remit which allows him to use his considerable talents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the comments of Senators Manning and O'Toole on the education system and it would be worthwhile debating this issue. I am not sure whether Seán Cromien's report is in-house or not and I am not too happy with some of the comments regarding the setting up of more agen<Col N="484" /> cies and quangos on how the Department should do its work. We need a root and branch examination of how the Department focuses on policy and the structures of education rather than the approach taken by Seán Cromien. It is worth debating this issue and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the banking system? I do not call for this debate in terms of the issues we have discussed in the past such as the scandals, DIRT and so on, but in terms of the banks' decision to reduce services to the community. The major banks are withdrawing from the community and customer services are being considerably reduced. We should hold a full debate on what is happening. The situation is similar to the threatened withdrawal of post office services but the banks are withdrawing from both urban and rural areas. This development will have serious consequences, particularly for the elderly, businesses and overall community services.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator O'Toole's comments on the budget. Every year we highlight the fact that the views of Senators are not given proper consideration in terms of the budget. Prior to the budget is the time for us to hold such a debate. The Labour Party has produced a fine document entitled New Direction, New Priorities and I would welcome the Leader's putting this document before the House so we could have a discussion on what directions might be taken &ndash; whether we go down the road the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has gone down over the past number of budgets involving tax reductions for the well off, or whether we provide adequate services for those who need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>An important debate has begun regarding Ireland's position in world affairs. I am referring to our status in Europe and the protection of our independence. This issue also involves our relationship with North America and other countries. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, made a particular contribution to this debate and raised some relevant questions which should not be ignored. There is the question of our international obligations and our future peacekeeping role.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the response to the Minister's statement in Boston that the public also wants to engage in this debate. It behoves this House to be part of that debate because there is a feeling abroad that much is happening without guidance or leadership because events are taking place so fast. Senators have a particular role in this issue and I ask the Leader to arrange such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call for an urgent debate on education. I asked for such a debate some weeks ago and this is an urgent matter. In particular I ask the Leader to make Seán Cromien's report available to Members. It is available to journalists as one can read about it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> The report seems to be a damning indictment of the Department of Education and Science. What is particularly difficult to swallow is that there seems to be a policy vacuum within the Department and that the most disadvantaged children suffer most. This is an urgent matter and I urge the Leader to ensure we obtain copies of this report so that we do not have a debate in a vacuum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators who called for a debate on Seán Cromien's report. It is particularly important that both Houses debate the proposals contained in the report regarding the restructuring of the Department and the tackling of the defects and deficiencies identified by the report.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in the context of a day-long debate on education we could also debate teacher training. A recent report on this issue highlighted the new insights into how learning takes place and what kind of intellectual skills this and future generations of young people will need. It is important at this juncture that we seek to examine the effectiveness of our pre-service and in-service teacher training system. For years Senator O'Toole and I have highlighted the lack of proper investment in pre-service and in-service teacher training. This is a good time to debate this issue as we have a report to hand with up-to-date information. It is also a good time to seek political and general support for reform of the Department and of teacher training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to take on board the pre-budget submission of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group which has asked him to amend two sections of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act, 1997, which deal with corporate and individual donations to charities? It is estimated that such amendments would cost the Exchequer £27 million but would generate a badly needed income of £120 million for voluntary groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite to the House the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs policy, Deputy Eoin Ryan, to inform us of the measures his Department is taking to counteract the use and abuse of drugs? We have known for years of the drug problem in large urban areas but a problem is developing in my area involving the spiking of young people's drinks in pubs, a practice which gives rise to serious physical and psychological effects in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over recent days there have been huge flooding problems all over Ireland. It is about time we asked the Leader of the House to find out how we can make a co-ordinated attack to rectify the consequences of flooding which occurs on a regular basis. Floods in Kilkenny have repercussions in Waterford and they might start in Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Nobody has ever analysed exactly why floods occur or the global warming issue which we must consider. A task force should be set up. No doubt throughout the country there are county councils and urban district councils which are not working hard enough to get to the root of the huge problems. The damage done by flooding does not go away when the floods recedes. Unfortunately it remains with us. I ask the Leader to find out if a task force can be set up to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The other issue I wish to raise relates to yesterday's inquest resulting from the unfortunate death of a young man who fell overboard from a ferry travelling between Wales and Ireland. When there is a plane, rail or car crash anywhere people immediately ask for an inquiry into the cause. The only result of the unfortunate incident to which I refer is that the Government has been called upon to provide a better helicopter service along the east coast, but nobody has asked the ferry companies to do something about it. I ask the Leader to inquire what can be done to improve safety. Why should the ferry companies not have some responsibility to provide helicopter cover for the thousands of people who travel between Ireland, Britain and the Continent? The ferry companies have got away with it seemingly by saying that the responsibility for safety on these carriers lies with the Governments of Ireland and Britain. I ask the Leader to urge the Minister responsible for transport to do something to get the ferry companies, who carry millions of people across the Irish Sea, to accept some responsibility for the safety of people on board their vessels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear everything Senator Lanigan said, but I think he did mention flooding. I want to raise the issue of the recent flooding and compensation. One welcomes the announcement yesterday by the Minister responsible that some programme of compensation will be put in place this year for people who have been adversely affected by the floods. This is a rather complicated issue. Last year there was severe flooding, especially in the midlands. The Government indicated then that there might be compensation for losses incurred by people in their homes, on their farms, in their workshops, etc., but when the floods subsided and the issue went away no compensation was forthcoming.</P>
      <P>We should ask the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Cullen, to come into this House to discuss this matter with us. We will make the point to him that half promises made last year to people who sustained damage should be included in any programme of compensation which might be implemented this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to lend my support to Senator Kett's request for representations to be made regarding the tax treatment of voluntary contributions to charities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="487" />
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the House discussed the flooding issue at length yesterday on the Order of Business. It is important for the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to come into the Seanad to discuss the flooding issue, particularly in the places currently affected. In south Tipperary the local authorities are very annoyed by his comments over the weekend. The reality is that proposals were lodged on his desk for Clonmel on 20 September 1999 and for Carrick-on-Suir in November 1999. Whether he knows it or not, they have been on his desk all that time. They are the proposals agreed unanimously by members of the local authority. He should come in here so that we can explain that to him.</P>
      <P>I welcome the announcement yesterday of a compensation fund. I would agree wholeheartedly with Senator Connor that we cannot forget about the floods when they have subsided. We have had experience of this flooding in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and other smaller places in County Tipperary and the south-east over the past years. I was unavailable yesterday and therefore I ask the Leader of the House to remind the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, of these issues. We need to address this issue and not forget it when the flooding has subsided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague's proposal to amend the Finance Act's treatment of charities. I also support Senator Costello's call to bring the Minister for Finance to the House to speak about the general services which have been withdrawn from rural communities and small towns by some of the major financial institutions. It would be an ideal opportunity for the Government to give some commitment to either the credit union groups or some of the people still providing the basic services to rural communities. It is important that some action is taken to underpin these communities. The collection of motor tax and other taxes provides a great opportunity to strengthen the services which sustain communities of that size in the long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Costello for a debate on banks and banking. If I heard him correctly, it is not the DIRT aspect of it which he wishes to discuss but rather the fact that they are closing many branches throughout rural Ireland. If we are serious about combating exclusion and marginalisation, we should do something about this and perhaps follow it up by having a meeting with them. A debate would be a useful precursor.</P>
      <P>I have raised a number of times in the past the question of a single regulatory authority. If he could, I would like the Leader to enlighten us this morning. Two weeks ago the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, stated in this House&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After what happened yesterday, the tribunal has no regulatory authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="ÜfcMr. Coghlan ÜfcMr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;that shortly the Minister for Finance would be taking this matter. I gather that since then there is some doubt about that. I am not aware of the Government decision but perhaps the Leader might enlighten us as to when it will be taken and who will take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls of Senators Lanigan, Connor and Tom Hayes for a debate on the flooding issue. Not only do we need to bring in the Minister responsible for the OPW but also the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, who has made several announcements regarding the imposition of extra responsibilities on local authorities. He has made between ten and 13 announcements about extra responsibilities regarding recycling, social exclusion, waste management, etc., but extra money is not being allocated to local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is placing a great strain on local authorities by asking them to deliver services without providing finances. This is an urgent matter. In view of the fact that the majority of local authorities are meeting to discuss their Estimates, I ask that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government should come into the House and spell out in detail his plans to back-up with funds the recent announcements about responsibilities he has placed on local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Senators' call for a debate on flooding. I have stood here on many occasions seeking a debate on flooding, particularly in my county where roads, houses and large tracts of land were washed away. It is amazing that when the winds blow from the east all of a sudden, everybody stands up and calls for a debate on this issue. Every week my county suffers from that kind of climate. I welcome the call for this debate. We would want to look at County Kerry in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Cathaoirleach asked me to put down a matter on the Adjournment relating to the gas grid, which I did. I am very disappointed <Col N="489" /> that it has not been taken. I again call for a debate on the new gas grid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I invited Senator Kiely to submit a matter on the Adjournment. I can assure him that it will be taken tomorrow evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make sure I never run foul of you, a Chathaoirligh. I would not like to end up in that situation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come here to discuss his thoughts on electoral reform. I am reminded of this because of what happened overnight in the United States. We face a problem in regard to prisoner voting rights. We have practically no absentee voting. In two of the America states there is absentee voting, while in every other state there is compulsory absentee voting &ndash; in other words, you have to do so by post.</P>
      <P>After this morning's results, of which we are not sure, we realise how tenuous our electoral situation is. We have never seriously considered Sunday and absentee voting. Look at what would happen here if we ended up in a situation where the balance depended on such a tiny fraction of votes. Undemocratically, we have not been allowing people to vote who would otherwise be able to vote. I bring this up because it is topical, but it will be too late if we continue to put it off. There is a demand among people other than those who are allowed to vote at present.</P>
      <P>I raise the question of tobacco smuggling. This is serious from the points of view of revenue, law and health. If there was uniformity in Europe in regard to tobacco taxation, it would remove the incentive for tobacco smuggling. The Minister for Finance should be interested to know that 1 million is lost with every lorry load of tobacco smuggled across borders in Europe. The Minister for Health and Children would also have a vested interest in making sure there was a uniform tobacco tax. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be even more interested because this sort of crime is so strong that it is creating gangs and behind the scenes warfare. There is a need for something to be done. I urge the Ministers concerned to give it serious consideration and to come in here to give us their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to be associated with the congratulations to Hillary Clinton on her election as a Senator for New York. It bears testimony to the great work her husband has achieved in his eight years as President of the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on electoral reform. I am sure that would include the various panels in the Seanad as well. It is not quite right to say Sunday voting has never been considered &ndash; it was considered by all parties in Government. <Col N="490" /> Saturday voting, when people and students are home from their place of employment and education, may possibly be more practical if people want the highest number of voters available in their particular district, ward or local authority area.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Keogh and Quill called for a debate on education and the report which is about to be published. I will arrange a debate at the earliest possible time and will endeavour to have it in the next two weeks. In response to Senator Manning, I hope to come back to the House tomorrow morning with a date and time for a debate on Northern Ireland. Senator O'Toole and many other Senators called for a pre-budget debate. This is a very useful proposal and I will see what I can do to facilitate the request.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the Buckley report, the review which is taking place of the Dáil and the Seanad and the complete change in working hours and work patterns which is imminent whereby we will not sit until 11 p.m., midnight or 1 a.m. but will start the day's work at 10 a.m. and conclude at 7 p.m. Rather than sitting two or three days per week, we will sit four days, affording us opportunities to discuss European reports, everything that is relevant to the future of our country, amending legislation and changing policy for the future. I agree with Senator O'Toole and we should have a debate on the review of the Seanad. We had such debates during Senator Manning's and Deputy Wright's time as Leader and during this term. One more debate before we make our proposals to Government would be a good idea. I hope to have that debate at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Chambers and Coghlan called for a debate on banking and the changes whereby the major banks are proposing to reduce the number of premises by up to 40% in the coming years. The majority of Members are also senior members of local authorities. I call on such Senators to meet the challenge in their local authority areas, particularly given the good example shown by the practice which has started in the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's constituency in Meath, by starting real decentralisation in their own counties with the one stop shops. It is a marvellous opportunity to use these bank buildings.</P>
    <P>As sure as night follows day, these banks will close because it is all about profits and Internet banking. That is where the future lies in the financial world. We, in the Oireachtas, have since 1987 assessed more successfully than most other countries the change that is happening. Given how advanced we are in terms of technology, we should lead the way as we are doing in Westmeath. We hope to acquire some of these bank buildings for our one stop shops. They are magnificent buildings and one would not build them for 50% of the cost for which they will be acquired. If a bank closes in Castlepollard, as is the case at present, I will do everything I possibly <Col N="491" /> can to ensure our one stop shop will be located in that magnificent building. This is a window of opportunity which we, as local authority members, can grasp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to give full technical effect to the provisions of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, relating to the national salmon resource. The 1999 Act, enacted in December of last year, provided for a complete overhaul of the management, organisation and service delivery of the inland fisheries sector. In the period of almost one year since the commencement of the Act, the new boards are in place and full rollout of the new framework is under way.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that one of the principal innovations of the 1999 Act was to provide for the establishment of the National Salmon Commission on a statutory basis. The commission has the function of assisting and advising in relation to salmon conservation strategies and management. On coming into office, I moved immediately to put the commission in place. In March I signed the order establishing the National Salmon Commission and appointed the chairman and 20 ordinary members. These members are representative of all the stakeholders in salmon, that is, the commercial sector, the recreational angling sector, the aquaculture sector and processors. It also includes the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the salmon tagging scheme is to provide information on the catch of fish by the commercial and recreational fishing sectors. The real time management information provided by the tagging programme will help us to quantify salmon in a new way. The data provided by tagging and a radically upgraded national fish counter programme will critically inform future salmon conservation and management strategies. Section 24 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, provided for the making of regulations to underpin the salmon tagging scheme following <Col N="493" /> consultation with the National Salmon Commission and 30 days of public consideration.</P>
    <P>At its inaugural meeting in April the commission agreed the publication of the draft regulations. Following detailed consideration by the commission and the 30 day consultation period, the commission advised that I should sign the regulations with an effective date for implementation of 1 January 2001. In giving its advice the commission had also consulted the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute. On receipt of this advice and in light of the public consultative process, I decided to sign the regulations and move ahead with the preparations for the introduction of salmon tagging from 1 January. Prior to final settlement of the regulations in the summer, the Parliamentary Counsel advised that it would be legally necessary for offences and penalties to be provided for in primary legislation rather than by regulations which had been provided for in the 1999 Act. This advice was subsequently endorsed by the Attorney General. Accordingly, preparation of this Bill was immediately put in hand. I signed the overall regulations in August with a commencement date of 1 January 2001.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to brief the Seanad on progress made and matters arising from the 1999 Act. My predecessor undertook to establish an eel strategy review group to report and advise on the strategic development and general regulation of the eel industry. Terms of reference for this group are being finalised and I will be appointing the membership of the group shortly. The 1999 Act provides for revised composition of the central and regional boards. While maintaining existing boards of elected fisheries representatives on the regional boards, the Act provides for nominations and appointment of key sectoral stakeholders. I invited nominations for appointed members of the boards in March. More than 180 candidates were nominated for seven regional boards by 33 organisations.</P>
    <P>The 1999 Act provides also for closer links between fishery co-operatives and regional boards. I have already finalised appointments of the membership of the management committees of the eight co-operatives and I look forward to a new era of effective local initiative by anglers working through the co-ops, together with the regional boards.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority has been to secure the co-operation of all players in the tagging and counting of wild salmon as an essential management tool. The tagging system is simply a data collection scheme designed to provide a verifiable count of all the national catch. Tags and logbooks will be available free of charge under the regulations and additional tags will be made available to holders of licences subject only to compliance with the regulations. The data will inform conservation and management strategies. Tagging is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end, which is decision-making based on real and comprehensive information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> My principal policy objective is to increase returns of salmon, thus enhancing the availability of stocks for tourism and domestic sport angling to the national benefit. It is without question, however, that all sectors must play their part where catch and escapement data show that stocks are under threat. No sector will be relieved of the obligation to reduce their share of mortality in salmon in catchments at risk. I emphasise that tagging is only one practical step on a new road to restore salmon stocks. There is a great deal more to be done on a range of complex challenges facing the salmon resource. Accordingly, I invited the salmon commission in early summer to give me advice and analysis on the following key priorities: expanding and upgrading the national fish counter programme; enhanced spring salmon conservation strategies; catchment management strategies; the water quality challenge; incentivising reduction of commercial fishing effort and predation. We need to move ahead with this wide-ranging agenda and other salmon conservation priorities informed over time by the accurate statistics which tagging and counters will provide.</P>
    <P>There have been reports recently on proposals for a buy-out of commercial salmon licences for six figure sums. These proposals have no official status. There is a long-standing body of opinion here and abroad which sees the buy-out of commercial licences as the key to restoration of stocks. The situation is far more complex in reality. Experience internationally is mixed, frankly. I am awaiting the consensus advice of the commission in the first instance but I underline that overall policy will be informed by all the factors at work. It must also reflect the legitimate entitlements of commercial fishermen as stakeholders in the resource. Significant restrictions have already been imposed on seasons and fishing days for drift and draft nets.</P>
    <P>At present we are co-financing two pilot schemes at catchment level for voluntary set-aside of commercial fishing engines for salmon. These two schemes are based on matching contributions by other stakeholders and I have asked the regional fisheries boards to encourage the development of similar projects based on consensus and local contribution. Funding is available for such schemes subject to value for money considerations, local stakeholder contribution and demonstrable benefits for salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I also commend to Senators the long-standing salmon management model in place in the Foyle where, based on real time stock data and spawning targets, fishing effort by commercial and angling interests is managed each season.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for a system of on the spot fines in relation to fisheries offences. This system will operate in a similar fashion to the on the spot fine system for minor traffic offences. It will result in more efficient use of resources and reduce the costs and administrative burdens associated with taking prosecutions for minor offences. I am taking the opportunity <Col N="495" /> presented by this Bill to provide for a comprehensive system of on the spot fines building on the provisions in the 1999 Act which provided for such a system in relation to the tagging scheme.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the necessary technical amendments to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to create offences and penalties in relation to the salmon tagging scheme. The more serious offences which attract higher maximum penalties are provided for in four new subsections. Necessary consequential amendments are provided for in relation to on the spot fines and consequential disqualification orders.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the next year for elections of members to regional boards shall be 2005, which restores the standard five year period. It is intended that the elections in 2005 will be held in December which has been the norm, for practical administrative reasons, since the establishment of the boards under the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the terms of office of the appointed members can be extended up to the time of the next election thus providing for continuity of board membership.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is an amendment proposed by the Attorney General in relation to staff members of boards who are appointed board members. Under the 1959 Act, no member of the regional board shall be eligible for paid office with the board. The amendment clarifies the position of staff appointees in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the restoration of several subsections of the 1980 Act which were inadvertently deleted by the 1999 Act.</P>
    <P>This short Bill provides primarily for technical amendments to give effect to what was intended in the 1999 Act in relation to the salmon tagging scheme. I hope the Seanad can agree that the tagging scheme, backed up by effective and reasonable sanctions, will deliver vital management information to inform conservation strategies from now on. The information on the catch of wild salmon will be used as an input to the sustainable and equitable management of the salmon resource involving all the legitimate interests.</P>
    <P>The national salmon tagging scheme is the most innovative and the single most important initiative in the conservation of wild salmon stocks. I hope the House will endorse it with enthusiasm. On the spot fines will be introduced. Everyone who is genuinely interested in the salmon angling resource wants to end poaching and other illegal activities which have been tolerated for far too long. This scheme provides a mechanism for the rigorous enforcement of the law with regard to poaching and other offences. The money collected in on the spot fines will go directly to providing resources for the fisheries.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="496" />
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome some aspects of this Bill which are overdue. The control of salmon stocks has been a major problem for many years.</P>
      <P>The River Moy in Ballina is one of Europe's outstanding salmon rivers. For decades, there was considerable netting by a private commercial company on that river but due to local and anglers' opposition to netting, the activity was discontinued three or four years ago. It was generally believed that the amount of salmon being caught by anglers would increase dramatically as a result because thousands of salmon were being netted on the Moy every summer. For several years, the Minister reduced the period of netting until it was finally discontinued completely. Nevertheless, the number of salmon caught by anglers in the last two years has decreased. No one can give an explanation, scientific or otherwise, for this. When netting was discontinued it was assumed that anglers would enjoy a bonanza on the River Moy but this has not happened. If nothing else, the Minister's efforts to introduce tagging may throw some light on what has happened and this aspect of the Bill is welcome.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a commission to look at salmon and salmon stocks is also overdue. It has been left to voluntary and other organisations to control the salmon system and salmon management has been neglected. I do not know if mismanagement has caused the fall-off in salmon numbers. I can only speak of the river with which I am closely associated. However, I understand a similar pattern is emerging throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wise to alert everyone to the possibility that this depletion of salmon stocks could continue and have an adverse effect on our angling tourism business. Angling is a major tourist attraction. In the Moy valley region, which encompasses the River Moy, tourism is a major element of the local economy. Many hotels, guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments would not be in existence were it not for the number of angling tourists who come every year from Germany, England and throughout Europe. We must preserve this valuable resource.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the introduction of on the spot fines for offences, although I have always been sceptical about them. One of the problems is enforcement. It is fine to introduce laws and regulations, but their enforcement is a problem. Enforcing traffic laws, for example, is much easier than enforcing laws on the high seas and rivers, but even that is difficult at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of enforcement leaves much to be desired. We read reports of local court cases where fisheries officers have been intimidated and harassed. The whole system has gone from bad to worse, although it is possible that on the spot fines could regularise the position. In the past some fisheries officers were badly injured in the course of their duty. This is intolerable and should not happen, but I know of particular cases <Col N="497" /> where it happened. The Minister's innovative approach in this area is welcome and I hope it will be successful. It will only be successful if the enforcement matches the commitment. Ultimately, what happens on the ground will determine the future of the industry.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill only deals with technical aspects of the fishing industry, it contains a number of important elements. Unfortunately, it will not do much for the general fishing industry about which many of us are concerned. The commercial fishing industry is in a state of chaos. Some small fishermen are giving up fishing and there is an increasing number of huge fishing boats. This is welcome, although there is no major benefit in their fishing off north Africa. A Mayo man, Kevin McHugh, has one of the largest boats in the world and he and his family deserve great credit for the initiative they have taken in the industry. However, due to the laws in Ireland, he is forced to go to the other side of the world to fish. It is doubtful that this will bring any benefits to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>We want, as I am sure the Minister does, a situation where an increasing number of smaller fishermen have viable livelihoods. However, this is not happening because of the depletion of stocks, particularly salmon stocks. The livelihoods of smaller fishermen are disappearing. There is a huge coastline in counties Galway and Mayo, and elsewhere in the west, but the number of families who were sustained in the past by the fishing industry has never been quantified. Many people have taken up other employment and this is commendable, but most of them are from families who were traditionally involved in fishing over many generations. Unfortunately, many of them are now disillusioned with fishing.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is designed to make some modifications to the current legislation, is welcome. The Minister has the interests of the fishing industry at heart but he needs to engage in more radical thinking. The Bill is not intended to be radical, although the on the spot fines are a new development. We will have to wait to see their effect on the illegal activity that has always gone on in this industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of eliminating poaching. I will be the first person to congratulate him if he achieves that objective because poaching is endemic in society, particularly in certain areas. It is not as prevalent as it was because the Celtic tiger economy has diverted people's energies elsewhere. The need for money is not as great as it was because there are other forms of legitimate employment. Poaching as a profession is losing its appeal and this initiative from the Minister could sound the death knell for large-scale poaching.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the reverse law that appears to operate in the salmon business. The end result in this area never appears to be logical. I asked a fisheries officer last week if he could throw any light on the dichotomy that exists. He said that the run-off from hills and mountains as <Col N="498" /> a result of deforestation into rivers is upsetting the spawning beds. This aspect also needs to be considered because spawning beds have been dislocated in many areas.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the North Mayo Fisheries Board created three new pools in the River Moy in Ballina. The famous ridge pool is world renowned as a fishing pool and the thinking was that if more pools were created on the same basis, they would be equally prolific in terms of salmon. However, that has not happened. The ridge pool remains the premium pool while the artificially created pools have not attracted any salmon. Nobody can throw much light on this phenomenon or explain why pools that were created to be identical to the ridge pool have not been as prolific.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult science and the Minister is making a brave attempt to come to terms with some aspects of it. Fishing is of vital importance to people along the west coast and tourism areas, such as Mayo and Galway. It was the lifeblood of the tourism industry. Once April arrives, one will meet angling tourists in all parts of County Mayo. It is one of the few resources we have and we need to preserve it. I am sure this Bill will help in that regard.</P>
    <P>I commend the National Salmon Commission. I am sure this body, which has a dedicated brief, will put forward good ideas. We also have the fisheries boards, but the election system leaves a lot to be desired. We all know the members of these boards are elected by vote but some of the candidates seem to have little experience in the areas they are trying to represent. Perhaps the Bill will help to regularise that position. I know that 80% or 90% of the members of the regional fisheries boards are committed to their jobs. However, a percentage of them seem to be passengers who have no interest in or commitment to the industry.</P>
    <P>There is no clearer example of the vagaries of the democratic system than what is happening at present in the United States. Such vagaries also extend to local organisations and sometimes they throw up rare results. The Minister does not intend to make far-reaching changes to the election procedures of the regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>I left home yesterday at 2 p.m. and I did not arrive here until 11 o'clock this morning, so I did not have time to study the implications of the Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="499" /> Senator Caffrey mentioned the fisheries boards and said that while most of the members are highly qualified, some are not. The Minister said there were 180 nominations from 33 organisations. He may recall that in my part of the country one highly qualified member failed to be nominated by the Minister. I hope this man will be accommodated in the future because he has a wealth of experience in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this technical Bill is to amend the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, and the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to provide for offences and penalties in respect of the new tagging scheme which is due to commence on 1 January 2001. The Office of the Attorney General examined the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, and advised that offences and penalties should be provided in primary legislation rather than by regulation, which was the basis of the fines and offences in the 1999 Act. Consequently, the Bill provides for an amendment to incorporate the Attorney General's advice.</P>
    <P>The offences covered are in respect of the wild salmon and sea trout carcase tagging scheme, which is due to commence on 1 January 2001. Regulations to provide for the tagging scheme were made in August 2000 under the enabling powers of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999. The Act provides that regulations may provide for offences and penalties in respect of breaches of the regulations. The legal advice suggested it was preferable to provide for offences and penalties in primary legislation rather than secondary legislation. The power to provide for these offences and penalties was exercised in the making of the regulations. It became necessary to introduce this Bill to provide for these in primary legislation.</P>
    <P>The tagging system was introduced after the Minister appointed the National Salmon Commission to consider, consult and recommend to him the introduction of the tagging of all angling and commercially caught wild salmon and trout. The commission was appointed in April 2000 and is representative of all the main players in the salmon industry, including the Federation of Irish Salmon and Sea Trout Anglers, representatives of rod anglers and trout anglers, the Irish Salmon Growers Association, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation Limited, the Irish processors and exporters association and the net inshore fishermen. The membership also includes fisheries boards representatives, the Marine Institute, the ESB and the cross-Border body, the Foyle-Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.</P>
    <P>The chairman, Professor Wilkins from the National University of Ireland, Galway, also chaired the salmon management task force whose report in 1996 set out the blueprint for the salmon conservation and management strategies. Among the many recommendations of the task force was the introduction of the wild salmon tagging system to achieve time conservation and manage<Col N="500" /> ment of the salmon resource and an equitable share of salmon stocks. The commission agreed to the publication of the draft salmon regulations with a 30 day statutory period to allow for public consultation and for detailed consideration by the commission of the framework for implementation of the tagging of rod and net salmon caught during the licence season.</P>
    <P>The preparatory work for the national salmon tagging scheme was ongoing for three years and it was time for decisions. At the end of the consultation period, the commission supported the tagging system. The purpose of the wild salmon tagging scheme is to provide for a verifiable system of counting catches by the commercial and recreational sectors. The information provided by the tagging schemes, together with other information sources, will inform the development of policy on the management and sustainable development of the national salmon resource.</P>
    <P>Among other measures used was the provision of the fish counter programme on many rivers assisted by grant aid from TAM. Some 35 such counters were introduced up to 1999. The initiative was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Woods. The Rosses Anglers Association was fortunate to receive funding to provide such a counter which will give valuable information about the number of fish going up the rivers and into the lakes owned by the Rosses anglers.</P>
    <P>I pointed out during my contribution on the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, that this association had developed a great leisure and tourism resource in north-west Donegal. This has been developed mainly through its own resources. I call on the Minister to ensure that more funding is made available to the fisheries boards to assist organisations, such as the Rosses Anglers Association, to develop their resources and to provide additional tourism infrastructure.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the Dumping at Sea Bill a few weeks ago I pointed out that the Northern Fisheries Board had carried out a survey of the water quality in Dungloe Bay. It showed increased pollution in the bay and this led to a genuine fear that e.coli would move up the river into the Rosses anglers' lakes. I have continually called on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to provide funding for a sewage treatment plant for Dungloe sewerage scheme. This plant would help the water quality in the bay. Apart from protecting public health standards and the different leisure facilities in the bay, it would protect the fish stocks and the Rosses anglers' lakes and would provide further development of aquaculture in Dungloe Bay. I am glad that is one of the items on which the Minister has asked the National Salmon Commission to advise him.</P>
    <P>Despite my pleas, the Department of the Environment and Local Government still refers to the priorities and needs set out by Donegal County Council, which are out of date, being almost two and a half years old. I ask the Minister to impress on his colleague, the Minister for the <Col N="501" /> Environment and Local Government, the need to cut out this bureaucratic behaviour, to take political decisions and not to wait for guidelines by local authorities and officials. When a genuine need arises there should be some way of providing funding.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, provided for the establishment of a commission to advise the Minister on salmon management policy and on setting a total allowable salmon catch and quotas for the taking of salmon in line with the recommendations of the original task force. The tagging system will be of benefit because it will provide valuable information which will underpin future salmon conservation and management strategies.</P>
    <P>Anglers and commercial salmon interests have a part to play in the protection and management of the salmon stocks. The protection of the wild Irish salmon stocks is in our hands. The tagging system will help to conserve our stocks and create a quality brand for wild Irish salmon and raise awareness of the uniqueness of this resource. The report of the reform of the CFP, published last week, states that we need sustainable development of our fish stocks and fishery resources. Many fish stocks are being over-fished, which is not tenable. Short-term gain will create long-term pain for coastal communities that depend so heavily on the fishing industry. We cannot achieve what is required on our own with regard to many species, but I hope it will be possible with regard to salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>Many people are anxious about the tagging scheme. Senator Caffrey referred to the fears expressed. The main reason for the tagging system was to stop poaching. The Department wants to use the scheme as a good national information tool to gather information on the number of salmon going up river to spawn. The scheme is based on a catchment management principle. Senator Caffrey said that in the past poaching was a very important part of the economy. What fines will apply to the public? With the reduction of stocks and the price of salmon in recent years the public's only access to wild salmon stocks may have been through supplies from poachers. What is the position on offences in this area?</P>
    <P>The tagging system will be introduced on 1 January 2001. It will apply only to the wild salmon and sea trout. A gill tag will be used and it will be an offence to be in possession of untagged wild salmon or sea trout. Logs will have to be kept detailing the daily catch and the disposal of same. Imported salmon will have a tail rather than a gill tag. I welcome the scheme and hope it is a success. However, we have been a long time trying to catch up with developments elsewhere and finding ways to conserve stocks.</P>
    <P>The area I come from, together possibly with north County Mayo, would be synonymous with salmon, especially ten or 20 years ago. As a child I remember the buzz in the fishing port of Burtonport during the months of the salmon catching season. Unfortunately, that has virtually disap<Col N="502" /> peared and consequently Burtonport has been reduced in status, mainly because of the fall-off in the salmon stocks and possibly also by the development of the pelagic fleet.</P>
    <P>Burtonport and the surrounding islands off the County Donegal coast had huge traditional fishing, especially in salmon. That developed into the white fish industry, but in recent years very few fishermen are fishing out of Burtonport. Of those who have continued to fish some have progressed to using super trawlers and are fishing from other ports, especially Killybegs. Consequently, Burtonport was left behind. I would like to see it revert to previous glory days because it had an important part to play in the economy of the surrounding areas, such as Gweedore. In recent years these coastal communities have had to turn to tourism more than the fishing industry. Unfortunately, they have received very few resources from the State or the EU.</P>
    <P>The cost of diesel is also badly affecting the fishing industry. I am glad the Minister met the representatives of the association. I hope he will be successful in persuading the Minister for Finance to provide some way out in the budget for those fishermen who are still fishing. The price of diesel is three times higher than a year ago. This, together with the quota system and the lack of supply of fish, is causing difficulties. I hope we can continue to develop and ensure a continuous supply of fish to the factories, especially those in Killybegs, Burtonport and Kincasslagh. They provide the bulk of employment in west County Donegal.</P>
    <P>A member of the National Salmon Commission circulated to drift net fishermen a survey on a number of issues, especially the level of stock contributions, a request for their views on the future and their options with regard to the continued fishing of wild salmon stocks and a set aside or a buy-out system. The number of salmon caught in recent years has fallen dramatically. It is uneconomic for a small fishing boat to go to sea for the one month in the year when a salmon licence is available. Many fishermen answered the survey and I am sure the preference that will emerge will be for a buy out scheme.</P>
    <P>A fisherman's life is difficult and dangerous and he must work unsociable hours. EU restrictions have curtailed the activities of traditional fishermen. They see the buy-out scheme as a pension for the future without having to sustain long hard hours at sea with little return. I am glad the Minister referred to the scheme and that he has asked the commission to advise him on an incentive system for fishermen.</P>
    <P>The commission members I have spoken to have expressed a preference for the set aside scheme. The Minister mentioned two private schemes, one in County Kerry and the other on the River Blackwater in Munster. The purpose of these schemes is to check the numbers of fish going into the rivers and to get an accurate record for catch purposes. The regional fisheries boards are encouraging other private schemes. While I <Col N="503" /> accept the need for management and conservation, some kind of buy-out scheme should be introduced to provide for small on-shore and drift net fishermen who have traditionally fished our waterways but are now faced with the loss of their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>Many reasons have been given for the reductions in salmon stocks. The Atlantic salmon stock has fallen to 15% of the population of the early 1970s. The trend will continue unless remedial action is taken. Apart from possible over fishing, other reasons have been given, such as the building of wharfs and dams on EU rivers. ESB records at Ballyshannon show a huge drop in the number of salmon swimming up stream.</P>
    <P>Acid rain has also been blamed for the disappearance of the Atlantic salmon stock, especially in Norway. In addition, salmon have contracted disease from escaped farm fish. Farm varieties also risk endangering the genetic and ecological integrity of their wild cousins.</P>
    <P>Seal culling has also become a dramatic issue in County Donegal, especially around the Killybegs area. Many Irish in-shore fishermen blame seals for the reduction of salmon stocks. This has been extensively covered by articles in the <i>Marine Times</i> by George Gallagher, its special correspondent. He is also a draft net representative on the Northern Regional Fisheries Board. He is fully supported by the other members of the board. He raised the matter with the Minister when he recently attended the Fish Ireland 2000 exhibition in Killybegs. Mr. Gallagher and many fishermen who sent letters to the editor of the <i>Marine Times</i> have called for a proper organised seal cull to protect their livelihoods, gear, nets and hundreds of tonnes of top quality seafood. I have read some articles in which Mr. Brendan Price of the Irish Seal Sanctuary disagreed with that, questioned the reason that the seals are so close to shore and wondered whether there are other reasons. I am glad the Minister mentioned that aspect in his contribution.</P>
    <P>It is time for a mature debate on the best way to manage the fishery to ensure the survival of both seals and the livelihoods of those living in coastal communities who depend on fishing. If difficult decisions are not made soon, we are likely to see the seal population ravaged by famine and a complete disappearance of a way of life. The in-shore fishermen of Donegal and Mayo are awaiting the response of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to this serious issue.</P>
    <P>Various other technical matters are referred to in the Bill, such as the on the spot fines for offences. The enabling provisions for on the spot fines for fishery offences will result in more efficient use of the fishery boards' resources, particularly in the area of the State's legal costs associated with taking prosecutions for minor offences through the courts system. I welcome the Minister's statement that any funds collected from these fines will be reinvested in the fisheries. <Col N="504" /> This is unlike the use of the £50 traffic fines. We are all caught on a regular basis now and we would like to see that revenue put back into the roads structures, particularly in the counties along the west coast which have roads of a very poor standard.</P>

      <P>I do not have time to raise some of the other points I wanted to make. The date set for the commencement of the wild salmon tagging scheme is 1 January. The advice of the overwhelming number of members of the National Salmon Commission is that it is vital that the Bill is enacted quickly, certainly before the end of the year, to ensure the enforcement of the tagging scheme. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will not be a long one. I commend the Minister on the Bill, which I welcome, but I also criticise him because he is not aiming high enough. He said, &ldquo;Tagging is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end, which is decision-making based on real and comprehensive information.&rdquo;  That is great as far as it goes but picture what could happen if the Minister aimed higher. If he were to say that tagging is aimed at lifting the Irish salmon business to a category which is much higher than anybody else. I was in Germany yesterday with a group of supermarket interests and the one Irish product they talked about was salmon. I was in France two weeks ago with a group of supermarket interests and the one product they were talking about was fish, not just salmon but a whole range of seafood.</P>
      <P>We have a marvellous opportunity here. What can we do to lift the Irish fishing business into a different category? I want to give an example of what happened in the case of beef. In the 1980s, some of us in the business recognised customers' concerns about beef. Those concerns came about because customers, particularly city dwellers, were hearing advertisements on the radio from pharmaceutical companies suggesting products that could be injected into an animal, whatever it was, to improve their health. Some of us in the business tried to find a way of tracing the origin of those animals, and those companies were able to include the name, address and photograph of the farmer who supplied that beef. When the BSE scare occurred some years later, those companies benefited enormously because customers trusted them. They knew more about the traceability of the beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine what could happen if we were to do something similar in regard to salmon. I know that will not be easy and that it will not be achieved in one Bill. It will not even be achieved <Col N="505" /> with the stroke of the pen in law, but it is something at which we could aim. Imagine the reaction of restaurateurs and fish mongers in France, Germany and elsewhere if they were able to state the origin of the fish on their menus and display boards. That is possible.</P>
    <P>Some of us who have been tagging whole fish for the past year know it is an expense. We know it is difficult but we found that the customers' response to whole fish being tagged is very favourable. It tells them a great deal more than they would have been told previously. We should set that as a target here. I mention that because I do not get a sense of the Minister aiming high enough in this area. I approve of everything he is attempting to do but I would like him to set higher objectives for Ireland as a whole. We should reach for the stars. We may not get there quickly but we will get some of the way on that basis.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on some of the problems the Minister will face. The biggest problem is the old-school view of fishermen who say that computers are worthy but that they do not want to go that way. That is similar to those who say that they know plastic bags do not help the environment but let somebody else do something about it. This is a job of convincing those fishermen who are of the old school who are not into computers or tagging or anything of that nature.</P>
    <P>We have to push very hard on technology. I talked to some of those involved in the fish business and they tell me that the tagging guns are slow, cumbersome and difficult to handle. They also tell me that the clip on to the gills system is not reliable, therefore tagging is the right system. It is possible to do the other but it is not reliable and it is too easy to get out of control. We should invest in determining whether there is a better system so that we can come up with one that is faster. An example was given to me of somebody coming into Burtonport on a Monday night with a load of fish whose customer in Dublin was asking for it as soon as possible. That fisherman had to delay the delivery by four or five hours because he had to tag all the fish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not been the case for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be various reasons for not being able to move fast enough in this area but in the case of fish, speed is of the essence. Fishermen cannot delay four or five hours and miss the plane to Paris or wherever. The people who are in the business in Europe are fussy about what they want. They know that if they do not get the right fish, particularly in the case of smoked fish, they will get a musty smell from it if they are not careful. They will get a sand taste from it if it is from certain rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation we have to set higher targets. The Minister has taken the first steps but I would like to hear him say that this is only the first step <Col N="506" /> towards the higher objective of lifting the fishing industry to a level that will be unique in Europe.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear other speakers, who are much closer to the sourcing of fish than I, talk about that this morning. It is achievable to reach a level in Europe whereby customers will set out to buy Irish fish because we have set standards higher than anywhere else in the world. That is possible and the Minister should indicate at this stage that this is where we are going, even if this is only a first step.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill. There is a lovely seanfhocal that I remember from school days that I like to quote on occasion: Éist le fuaim na habhainn mar gheobhaidh tú bradán &ndash; listen to the sound of the river if you're going to catch a fish. The Minister has been listening to the sound of the river and the sound of the industry but I would like him to listen to the sound of the market places. If he does that he will find the fishing very good and the fishing industry will benefit from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. I am pleased this Bill has been initiated in the Seanad and it derives from the previous, more substantial legislation. I come to this issue unashamedly as a game angler which informs my perspective on the Bill. I have fished most of the waters in the west, south-west and midlands. During the summer I fished the Erriff and Lough Beltra which are premier locations and I am always treated well in Mayo. I also fished the Blackwater outside Kenmare and Lough Caragh.</P>
      <P>A statement was made on the Order of Business yesterday regarding flooding to the effect that if anglers were allowed a substantial input into catchment management they would prevent arterial drainage from taking place. Arterial drainage was seen as the way to prevent flooding but that is not the case. It can make flooding worse as it brings water to places at a faster rate and flood plains are not allowed to operate. Apart from getting into the technical area, fishing is a resource of great magnitude in terms of the national economy and tourism. In addition to its economic value, fishing is also a spiritual resource and there is a serious obligation on us to protect and enhance it and to ensure we pass it on to the next generation.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that within a generation greed was allowed to destroy some of the premier resources which had stood unchanged and in pristine condition since the ice age. Pig farmers in Cavan and other areas were able to destroy these resources through greed and the State has a serious obligation to ensure that cannot continue to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always argued that the imperatives of providing jobs and economic development in depressed rural areas were such that one could <Col N="507" /> sacrifice the natural environment. That approach was understandable but times have changed significantly and the culture must catch up with that change. The obligations are being imposed on us by the EU in terms of environmental standards and that is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I could go on at some length on the impact of fish farming but I am sure that would not be helpful to the Minister given his constituency. There is no reason fish farming and game angling cannot live side by side but unfortunate lapses have had significant environmental consequences. If this issue had been properly managed some of the penalties paid and the job losses in the tourism industry would not have arisen. In some respects, the way this issue was managed was similar to how BSE was handled in Britain. I am not suggesting that the risk to human health is of a similar magnitude but there was a process of obfuscation to avoid responsibility and not to allow the scientific evidence to come to the fore.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. The issue of tagging has been raised but I wonder how it will operate. When we went to the Erriff this year the literature advised us that the tagging system was coming into operation. Game anglers will have to carry their tags and that is worthwhile. I agree with the Minister's views on tagging and counting which provide the scientific support to implement the required management, but I have some difficulties about the practical operation of the system, taking into account some of Senator Quinn's comments.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the spring salmon which has been one of the greatest tragedies. There are very few places left where one can fish for spring salmon. Lough Beltra, the Blackwater in Cork and the Slaney are some of the few places left and the stocks of spring salmon are very low. There is a scientific or perhaps an international political question as to how this collapse in the stocks of spring salmon took place. This is not just evident in Ireland but in other countries, including Scotland.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey spoke about the Moy and asked why, when nets were removed, the number of fish caught by rod and line did not increase. This involves a broader issue in terms of what is happening on the high seas and internationally. In that context, one must applaud the work of Orri Vigfusson of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund and others in trying to introduce some coherence. There is a case for more significant international co-operation and effort but that is a wider question.</P>
    <P>Catchment management has been a contentious issue. I was in favour of such management when few others were, even those in angling circles. I support this idea as there is a need to bring some coherence to the issue. There is also a need for an objective set of guidelines as to how catchment management should operate as there are wide differences between how different catch<Col N="508" /> ment areas are managed. We accept that there are physical and practical differences.</P>
    <P>Anglers are among the primary stakeholders in any catchment and it is essential their views are taken on board when it comes to management. Many angling clubs are poorly organised and have traditional rights to waters on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis going back many years. However, it would be unfortunate if, because of this situation, it was decided that some big brother could take the water from them and lease it back. The potential for serious conflict is evident if such an approach is taken and I would hate to think that big brother could take away from angling clubs interests which have existed for generations. I do not think this is what the Minister has in mind but it is important to ensure it cannot happen. Traditional rights are at stake and were it not for the vigilance of local angling clubs &ndash; I have to declare an interest as I am involved in such a club &ndash; some of the excesses which local authorities and other potential polluters wished to carry out would have taken place unhindered and more serious damage would have been caused. Fisheries boards are also vigilant in this respect.</P>
    <P>Many clubs operate on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but that does not mean they have not been important in terms of the vision of what fisheries should be and how it should be managed. As a landowner with land adjoining the River Liffey, I am aware that angling clubs are among the greatest custodians of riparian rights. If one lives close to an urban centre it is becoming increasingly difficult to farm land because of vandalism and other anti-social behaviour. It has always been the case that a member of the local angling club out fishing the waters informed farmers about problems, animals stuck in rivers or fences being down. Anglers have performed an important function in that respect. In the past there has been a great synergy and a great association between landowners and angling clubs and I would hate to see that being taken away.</P>
    <P>There is also a widely held perception that anglers do not want to pay for anything. The origins of that perception are evident and it is easy to see how it arose, but it is totally wrong. Many of the angling clubs charge their members fees and they have been very involved in the use of European funds to develop access and to develop the waters for which they are responsible. They have dipped heavily into their own pockets to do that and, therefore, it is not correct to say that anglers want their sport for nothing. They are prepared to pay for it provided they can see that the sport will be maintained.</P>
    <P>There are many conflicting interests at play in the catchment with which I would be most familiar, that is the River Liffey. At the top end of the catchment there is a requirement to provide Dublin city with drinking water. That is obviously important but one gets to the point of asking at what stage is it wrong to extract ever greater volumes of water to fulfil a need in the knowledge that some 30% of that water is being lost through <Col N="509" /> the system? This brings us back again to the economic requirement to up-grade the facilities to ensure that the water is not wasted.</P>
    <P>The other point is that there is no penalty for wasting water. If it is a frosty night in Dublin and everybody decides to leave on their taps they can do so with impunity, but it does have an environmental effect and there is the question of sustainability of the catchment and the flora and fauna in the catchment.</P>
    <P>Further downriver the River Liffey is regarded as a discharge point for waste. The local authority sees it as a source of water and a dustbin for waste. It receives discharges from sewerage systems, which were inadequate and, thankfully, are being up-graded. In the middle of all that there is a general commitment to retain the fish life within the water. It seems to me that, if the two positions are not inconsistent and irreconcilable, at least there is a difficulty about it and that brings us back to the will with which we approach these matters.</P>
    <P>I have had some experience of angling in Rotorua, New Zealand. One aspect of angling there, which struck me forcefully, was the degree to which there was an obsession with the health of the fish life and with the quality of the water and with ensuring the resource was properly managed. When an angler arrives in New Zealand, his or her angling equipment will be disinfected at the airport. One must declare such equipment and it is an offence not to do so. If one catches fish, they must be gutted at the waterside and all the waste disposed of safely. One cannot sell fish, which is a critical aspect of all of this. If one is a game angler in New Zealand, it is impossible to sell the fish. One may bring the fish back to the hotel, guest house or wherever one is staying or give them to friends, but one cannot sell them. That is related to the question of the prevalence of poaching, which obviously has to do with the commercial value of the fish. There may be some recreational poaching. Thankfully, that is one of the more welcome side effects of fish farming, that perhaps it has removed the incentive to clean out a pool or fishery. Therefore, there are useful international models which could be looked at and implemented in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Returning to water with which the Minister would be familiar, I have made the point before that 30 years ago on the Corrib I can recall people who came to this country, hired a car at Shannon Airport, stayed a month, had a gillie every day on the lake and spent large sums of money at a time when there was little money around. My point is that that is extremely mobile tourism investment. If the sport is good, they will go to Alaska, the Falkland Islands, Russia or New Zealand. Particularly in those poorer areas along the western seaboard with which the Minister will be very familiar, those visitors are of enormous benefit. Not only are they the big spenders but they will not leave environmental degradation in their wake unlike some large movements of tour<Col N="510" /> ists into Ireland, although that is obviously a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>There is a minor point which is worth mentioning. It is only a textual point but it is important because frequently we have got into difficulties even about the position of commas and their significance in legislation. In Part I of the Schedule, the description, under reference number 5, is, &ldquo;Unauthorised entry on several fishery&rdquo;. I suspect it should be a plural noun, although I may be wrong. I suspect it should read &ldquo;fisheries&rdquo;, but that is only a minor semantic point and perhaps it is something at which the Minister can look.</P>
    <P>The question of catchment management is summarised well in the autumn edition of the newsletter of the National Association of Rod-Anglers, which refers to the essentials based on the experience of the Vartry Catchment Committee. It is worth itemising what it stated. First, the involvement of angling clubs is essential to the process and it should be voluntary. Second, there should be an emphasis on fishery management within any catchment regime, while accepting and respecting the rights and interests of all stakeholders. Third, no stakeholder group within the project should be allowed dominate by reason of economic or political influence &ndash; that is an important aspect. Fourth, to be successful, the project must improve the quality of the water as well as lifting the quality of angling.</P>
    <P>That point relates to an issue which was very evident on the River Liffey when we discussed the water quality management plan for the river at county council level. At that time I tried to include putting a lid on extraction from the River Liffey as an objective of the plan because it did have an effect on the quality of the water. Lo and behold when the consultants reported on the greater Dublin water management system, they said that the primary management of the River Liffey should be to do with water extraction, which is a reality but which is disappointing.</P>
    <P>The fifth point made in the NARA newsletter is that the ultimate responsibility for catchment management lies with the regional fisheries board. I would agree with that. Sixth, catchment management should be driven by the conservation, rather than the economic imperative. That point is similar to one stated earlier. Seventh, anglers, because of their experience and expertise, should be actively encouraged to be involved in the process. Finally, compromises and concessions to advance the process of catchment management are best decided within the project group and in a spirit of solidarity and most stakeholder groups should seek such concessions through political lobbying, as was the practice in the past.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable presentation of the angling perspective on catchment management. For instance, one of the areas where much of the work has been done by Dr. Ken Whelan of the Marine Institute is the Burrishoole fishery and that is another one of the places I was fortunate <Col N="511" /> to visit during the year. That is a marvellous example of what can be done by positive State intervention, as indeed is the Errif fishery. It is worth recording that that was a State initiative. These are two of the prime fisheries in the west which are well managed by the State. There is a high level of scientific input, they provide excellent sport and are well organised. The people involved in those initiatives are to be congratulated. That activity is covered in the Bill, where it states that the central board can delegate to the regional board those types of activities and on the River Errif I think it has been transferred from the central board to the Western Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I hope the Minister will take into account some of the points made and ensure that the resource is protected, which is the primary objective. We must ensure that successive generations can enjoy that resource to the benefit of society as a whole. Then everything will be in safe hands.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is a case, to return to what I said at the outset, to be made for the establishment of a set of guidelines. I note that in his speech the Minister spoke about implementing provisions by primary legislation rather than by regulation. I can understand that because there have been difficulties in the past where the courts have intervened and said that they should be implemented by primary legislation, but this is not what we mean. We mean a general set of guidelines which inform the people involved in these catchment bodies in order that at least they have some parameters within which to work.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister. I hope the legislation is successful and that the objectives he set will be achieved.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his portfolio as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, especially since he is a man from the west and understands the fishing industry. This is a short technical Bill and I will keep my contribution short because a number of other speakers wish to contribute.</P>
      <P>This Bill follows from a previous Bill that was before us 18 months ago. I would like to be associated with the congratulations to the Minister for bringing this Bill, which I support, to the House. I am delighted we are only taking Second Stage today and that we will have more time to reflect on it before Committee Stage when it will come back before the House. I compliment the Minister because it is a very important Bill. I come from a county which has great fishing rivers, probably among the best fishing rivers and lakes in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation and I would like to dwell on the election of regional boards, the tagging of salmon and on the spot fines. The Bill mentions specifically that on the spot fines will be <Col N="512" /> ring-fenced and the money will go back into the system. The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>There are no exchequer costs or staffing implications associated with the Bill. The enabling provisions for on-the-spot fines in relation to fisheries offences will result in more efficient use of the resources of the fisheries boards and will reduce the State's legal costs associated with taking prosecutions for minor offences through the court system.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how this extra work will not be a cost at some stage to the fisheries boards, the fishermen or to somebody. On Committee Stage we might be able to go into that in more detail. I believe this will have cost implications. If the provisions of this Bill are rigorously applied, there will be fewer court actions and there will be less strain on the resources of the fisheries boards. There will, however, be a cost in implementing the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the members and staff of the regional and fisheries boards on the tremendous work they have done over the years. They have had to take some difficult decisions and everything has not been rosy for them over the years. It is only now that the majority of people appreciate the work they have done and are doing. One only has to travel the length and breadth of the country to see the work they have done on the spawning beds and on the tributaries to the lakes and rivers. We see the fruits of this work in our trout stocks and the way in which the stocks are being built up. In addition, we now see that in some parts of the country fish life, which was no longer evident in some lakes, has returned. The fisheries boards, both the central and the regional, are to be complimented and congratulated because they have done tremendous work over many years and have not got the credit they were due.</P>
    <P>We are not only talking about fishing but about a whole industry which includes accommodation, boats, gillies, fishing tackle shops, transport and seafood. This is a huge industry. The Minister was right to bring this Bill before us. As Senator Quinn has said, maybe he is not aiming high enough but it is a start. This legislation is highly commendable and we will only see the fruits of it in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on bringing it before the House. Maybe at some stage, he might be able to explain to us the costs involved as a result of the extra provisions in this legislation because, I believe, there will be a strain on resources, whether those of the central or regional boards, the Exchequer or others. The implementation of this legislation will involve a large amount of work. While there may be a cost involved, it will be a very worthwhile exercise. I would like to be associated with the welcome to this legislation.</P>

It is gratifying to <Col N="513" /> see that in the short time he was in this House, he recognised that it is a good place in which legislation can be thrashed out and that is what I intend to try to do today. Although it is the Minister's legislation, we cannot always agree on everything.</P>
      <P>I would like to say at the start &ndash; confession is good for the soul &ndash; that I have caught salmon using every method known to man, legal and illegal, all my life. Why would I not?</P>

      <P>&mdash;where the landlords owned the rivers and the rights. The poor people along the side of the river, like my family and hundreds of families like us, were deprived of catching even one salmon for their basic needs &ndash; a bit of food. Back in the mid-1930s, my next door neighbour got a year in jail because the bailiff came in and found a salmon cooking in the pot. To this day, that man has not returned home from America. He went straight from jail to America. The family was so ashamed that he had got a year in jail. It was absolute codology. That is the situation we came from and I would like to see legislation address itself to the ordinary people who were trampled on because they took a few fish from a river.</P>
      <P>I remember about 12 years ago there was a review of fisheries in County Kerry. A gentleman from the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources was the chairman of that review board &ndash; it was not a review but I cannot think of the proper name for it &ndash; which was assessing whether it would expand the salmon fishing industry or cut it back. We put our case forward. The people with the licences for draft netting and netting the rivers put forward their case. The one thing which became clear was that it was the small timers like me who had continually put back money &ndash; small amounts admittedly &ndash; by putting small smolt back into the river.</P>
      <P>Not one penny was ever put back into the rivers by the landed gentry. Some 35 years ago boatmen employed by those who owned the fishing rights on the River Laune in Killorglin received 6p for every salmon caught. There were four men in each of the eight boats on the river and these people were making £50 per week. One can imagine the number of salmon being taken from the river. The nets were so full that the men could hardly pull in the salmon. I have no sympathy for these people for whom the rivers were being protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I caught salmon by every method possible because I grew up beside a river. My father loved to angle and fish for salmon. We also fished by other methods to which I have a number of witnesses. I was approached at Mass on one occasion <Col N="514" /> by a man who said that there was a fine salmon over in bun a dá abhainn. What a nice name for a pool in a stream of water. There were two rivers, the Landers and the Goulanebeg, and there were always salmon in the huge pool where these two rivers met. The pool was deep at the top and shallow at the bottom. It was called bun a dá abhainn which means the bottom of the two rivers. I said to the man that when the Mass was over we would head over there. He asked should I go home to change my clothes. I said I would not because I knew the place, there were rocks in the middle of the river and we would see where the salmon was lying. He asked if I had a pike and I said I had not. That man was surprised to see me take off my shoes, roll up my trousers and creep into the river. After approximately five minutes, the salmon was out on the bank. That man is alive today and can tell that story. I loved tickling salmon, because that is how it was done. Many people from the Senator's part of the country were able to tickle salmon. A famous woman from the Minister's part of the country used to tickle salmon.</P>
    <P>One could fish legally for just £3, which was ridiculous. I got my first draft net licence for £3 to prevent others from taking the salmon in a certain manner. If something is to be done about tagging and replenishing salmon the netting of rivers must be stopped, no matter what the means. Netting in a confined space in a river, regardless of the supervision, will clean out that river. We are still concerned about the landed gentry who own stretches of our rivers and have the titles to these rivers. The River Laune in Killorglin is still owned by one family who have the total netting rights to that river, which is wrong. If no salmon are being caught in Lough Lein or up the River Laune, there is no point blaming the Ballydavid or Dingle fishermen. There is a great difference in having a mile of net at sea. Does Senator Ryan believe a mile of net off Ballydavid will prevent every salmon from going up the River Laune? The Department might say that fishermen are using 20 miles of net. That is a physical impossibility. A civil servant in the Minister's Department said to me that fish were blocked from coming up the Shannon by a huge salmon net. I never heard such rubbish. If one had a net long enough to put across the mouth of the Shannon, one would not have gone 200 yards before part of the net would have either drifted up or down with the tide. By the time one was half way across, the net would have one pulled either up or down the Shannon. It would be impossible to spread a net across a tide.</P>
    <P>I want to put the Minister on the right track in this regard. The landlords and landed gentry also controlled the old boards of conservators. Ordinary people such as myself, Senator Chambers and Senator Caffrey were not on these boards.</P>

      <P>In 1979 the then Minister, Mr. Power, set up the regional fisheries boards. I was a member of one of the first boards for a year and saw what was taking place. Slowly but surely these boards have changed and are now better boards. They are controlled by ordinary people who appreciate the value of our fisheries.</P>
      <P>This is not the first occasion we have discussed salmon tagging. There have already been two dismal efforts to tag salmon. First, they let go the smolt and inserted a small sharp tag in the middle of the forehead. When the salmon was caught and passed through a machine it would bleep if the tag which was inserted was in the salmon. The tag was then removed and put in a jar. This contained a mine of information. Thousands of pounds were spent on that scheme which was eventually forgotten about. The next time the procedure was tried, a real tag was inserted in the fin of the fish. I saw these tags fall into the sea. When a salmon was pulled out of the net, this tag, which was approximately half an inch square, would catch in the mesh and fall off the net. The Minister should ensure that proper tagging facilities are put in place.</P>
      <P>I welcome on the spot fines. All fishery offences should be included, not just those for salmon and trout fishing. Bringing fishermen in 200 miles and charging them if they do not have a proper ladder on board or if the name or licence number of their boats are too small is unreal and should not be tolerated. The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources made a mistake and brought a fisherman in 200 miles to Galway. The man lost three days fishing for which the Department did not even apologise. This was a disgrace and I referred to this incident here on several occasions. The man did not have the proper paperwork on board his boat because the Minister's Department had not issued him with the proper paperwork. He had been fishing for six months without the proper paperwork. That man should have been fined £100 on the spot, but given the right to appeal. The Bill does not appear to grant a right of appeal to people who receive on the spot fines. Fishery inspectors and Department officials are not always right. A period of 21 days is allowed for the payment of on the spot fines. There should also be a right of appeal.</P>
      <P>No one in this House could criticise Deputy Fahey's achievements since he became Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. The fishing community is behind him in everything he is doing. He is a fair-minded, common sense Minister.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what Senator Fitzgerald has said. However, I am not convinced of the wisdom of on the spot fines for unscrupulous Spanish fishermen fishing 200 miles off the Irish coast. I am sure they would be quite happy to pay £200 or £500 and never be seen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must protect our waters 200 miles off-shore from all abuses to our diminishing stocks.</P>
      <P>Between now and Committee Stage, will the Minister clarify whether angling, as defined in the Schedule, includes tickling? I suspect that what Senator Tom Fitzgerald and other skilled people can do may not be defined by the Bill as an offence. I cannot see how tickling can be called angling. People with the extraordinary skills of Senator Fitzgerald are probably immune to the law as it stands. Perhaps we should, in the interest of preserving rare skills, make an exemption and allow anyone who can tickle salmon or trout to do so. It is an extraordinary skill, the existence of which people do not believe until they have actually seen it. However, in spite of Senator Fitzgerald's attempt to portray himself as a law breaker, I suspect he did not break the law.</P>
      <P>We can all identify with the theme of Senator Fitzgerald's remarks. For most of my adult life the anomaly has existed that those who live adjacent to some of the best inland fisheries in the country were not allowed to fish there because fishing rights remained with families whose members, in some cases, had not set foot on this island for two generations. They used these fishing rights commercially, to sustain themselves without ever visiting the area or doing anything to sustain the fishing stocks. Fishing rights were seen as part of the inalienable, God-given right of that class to make a living at other people's expense.</P>
      <P>Issues arise in a debate such as this which are worth examining. I have no reason to take issue with the technicalities of this Bill, nor am I competent to do so. The subject of fishing, inland or marine, raises issues concerning how one should behave and the question of rational economic man which is much beloved of the officials in the Department of Finance who produce our models. Many of those involved in the commercial fishing of salmon did not believe there was any point in conserving stocks and refused to recognise the evidence that what they were doing was about to end their livelihoods. While no one is sure why Atlantic salmon stocks have dropped so dramatically, the fact that Senator Bonner says they are down to 15% of what was there 25 or 30 years ago ought to give us a grave warning. The resources of this planet are finite.</P>
      <P>The Irish fishing industry has built the largest fishing boat in Europe which is operating off the west coast of Africa and doing to African fisheries what we have already done to our own. I do not begrudge the man who had the enterprise, resources and vision to buy that boat but the principle of using such a boat off Africa is as wrong as doing so off Ireland would be. Fisheries cannot be protected without regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis lauded the value of positive State regulation and much of what he said is true. <Col N="517" /> However, his party leader is most eloquent in decrying the idea of regulation as an interference with the free market. If we had allowed the principle of the free market to apply to fishing we would have no fish left. Senator Dardis was correct in saying that our salmon fisheries have been almost destroyed by greed. A party which is driven by telling people they can have more in their pay packets by reducing tax is very close to endorsing greed as the central driving force in Irish politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be the first time he did not. Like myself, he must be quietening with maturity. Senator Dardis is right in what he said about greed. In a hundred areas of life it is clear that systems do not work without State regulation. Fishing is a classic example of this. It may be said that fishing is a commonage but this is only the case if we do not give ownership of it to someone. The problem with fishing in Ireland has been that those who had an interest in it did not have ownership of it. Recreational anglers are a wonderful force for conservation because their principal motivation is not maximising catch to make money. They have an interest in sustaining stocks.</P>
      <P>While Senator Fitzgerald had many wonderful things to say, the degree to which he ignored the depredations of large-scale drift net fishing was disingenuous. Drift net fishing caused harm and would have done more harm without regulation. It still poses a threat and must be regulated and dealt with. The conservation of salmon stocks is extremely important and must be dealt with. It will not be possible to satisfy everybody. The lifestyles of many who are involved in fishing cannot be allowed to continue if there is to be a future for fishing.</P>
      <P>A number of people have mentioned water. The country's enormous economic development has placed huge burdens on our water environment. The cause of the problem is not industry. It is urbanisation and the use of our surface and ground water as a free resource. It is irrational to spend a fortune treating water which is to be used to flush toilets. This practice could be changed by proper building regulations. One should not used water which is intended to be drinkable to flush toilets or wash dishes. It is possible to put together a system that prevents that and it should be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1: </P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;and the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1990,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1988, the Insurance Act, 1989, and the Insurance Act, 1990,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment which seeks to delete &ldquo;and the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1990&rdquo; and to substitute the correct terminology. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the collective citation for the Acts from 1909 to 1990 is accurate. The Bill should state, &ldquo;the Insurance Acts, 1909 to 1988, the Insurance Act, 1989, and the Insurance Act, 1990&rdquo;. The 1989 Act updates the previous Acts and the collective citation should be changed to reflect that fact.</P>

      <P>I have had this matter examined in great detail by the key officials in the insurance division of the Department. I understand the 1989 Act refers to export credit insurance only. It is not intended, when the Insurance Acts are referred to collectively, that they should include reference to export credit insurance legislation but rather, solely and specifically, to the legislation concerned with the supervision of the insurance industry. Accordingly, it would not be relevant or appropriate to include export credit insurance in this area. That has always been something the State has carried. It is a separate issue. It is more of a financial mechanism than a protection system. It would not be appropriate to have it included in this Bill. Consequently, I will not be able to accommodate this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My only concern is that other Insurance Acts, which are part of the collective citation, also refer to export credit insurance but the Minister is not ruling them out. I do not understand why he should make an exception of the 1989 Act. The Minister does not seem to have problems with a number of other Acts. Why has he focused on the 1989 Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act referred to deals specifically with export credit insurance <i>per se</i> and this Bill deals with the supervision and delivery of insurance products on the island of Ireland. We cannot legislate for something outside the island of Ireland. Export credit insurance refers to business which takes place outside the country. It is a State-run operation. We are talking about regulating an industry which has undertakings and intermediaries and interacts with the consumers. The legislation deals with all three different groups. Its sole purpose is to ensure absolute transparency in the information available to the consumer from the undertakings through the intermediaries. Export credit insurance does not come into it. The consumers we are dealing with through this legislation would not seek export credit insurance. Consequently, it would be unnecessary and unwise to include export credit insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point. As many of the other Acts deal with export credit insurance, this Act, although it deals exclusively with it, should also be included. Why should it be excluded <i>in toto</i>, when we are talking about a collective citation of all the Acts from 1909 to 1990, if it deals with something which is dealt with in the other Acts? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of having other Acts included is that products would be available under particular aspects of insurance cover from undertakings. Some of them may be in the export area and products would be available to consumers and companies in this country. The export credit Acts are not included in this citation and it would be unwise to do so. The State has extracted itself from this area and we do not want to create any confusion. We want to ensure everyone understands that we are talking about the inhabitants on the island of Ireland, the undertakings operating in the delivery of insurance products and services on the island of Ireland and the intermediaries through which these products are sold to the consumers.</P>
      <P>We must be specific and ensure that a protection, including a clear mechanism and parameters, is extended to the three different groups. That is the purpose of this legislation. Consequently I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>m</i>) by the insertion of the following after the definition of &lsquo;prescribe':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;&ldquo;pure protection product&rdquo; means an insurance policy whose purpose and function is to provide payment of a specified amount on the happening of a specified event and where the insurance policy has no element of cash return or value other than on the happening of such specified event;',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subject of pure protection products was discussed on Second Stage. As the Minister of State is aware, there is no material benefit to the consumer from the disclosure of commission on such products. The commission is the cost incurred by the insurance company in having its products sold to the consumer. In the case of pure protection products this cost is a set figure across the board among all companies. If it increases the consumer will pay the extra cost. If it decreases brokers' income will be reduced and they may go out of business.</P>
      <P>Declaring commission on pure protection products to the consumer will confuse him. He will think he can get a better deal elsewhere, but he cannot. Pure protection products are not like motor or other forms of insurance. Given the figures recorded on Second Stage and the fact that the average consumer has cover of only £50,000, we should be mindful not to discourage consumers from taking out life protection products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a definition of pure protection product in the Insurance Act, 1989, presumably with a view to excluding those products from the disclosure regime to apply in accordance with section 7 of the Bill. The House will recall that in replying to Second Stage I indicated I would give further consideration to this issue and to the issue of whether protection products should be included in the disclosure regime. However, that is an issue for the disclosure regulations. I would prefer to make whatever provisions might be necessary, including definitions, in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that I have not made a final decision on this matter. There are still compelling reasons for disclosure of commission in respect of protection products. In the first instance, the consumer of these products has as much right to the information as the consumers of other life assurance products. Second, I fear that an incomplete regime of disclosure would create a lacuna, creating a shifting of remuneration from investment products to protection products. Third, it <Col N="521" /> is mandatory in certain cases, especially on the financial institutions with regard to certain products they provide by way of mortgages and otherwise, that protection products are required. Consequently, I see no difficulty in creating a market balance where the products will be required. In the modern, enlightened economy people will protect themselves by whatever mechanism they can and there will be no reduction in the range of protection products being sold in a growing economy.</P>
    <P>While I am prepared to consider the text of Senator Coghlan's amendment when considering this matter in the context of the disclosure regulations, I am unable to support the amendment at this time. However, on Second Stage I gave a commitment to give the matter further consideration. I have done that and have held discussions within my Department. We are still discussing the matter. We have had indications from the industry, including intermediaries, that it is happy with the way we are proceeding. I will give the matter further consideration within the context of disclosure operations before reaching a conclusion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 37, before &ldquo;at any time&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in a case where the information concerned was concealed by the fraud of the defendant,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 proposes to amend section 3 of the Insurance Act, 1989, to the effect that no summary proceedings shall be commenced later than five years from the date on which the offence concerned was committed. That appears to be an abnormal period of time in which a penalty can be imposed. Is the District Court or Circuit Court to be involved? It would appear to be an appropriate penalty in the context of the Circuit Court but not the District Court, which normally prescribes that summary proceedings be commenced within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an extension is to be provided to the District Court, whose jurisdiction is mainly concerned with summary prosecution, this amendment proposes that the type of offence subject to this provision would be specified and that it would be a serious offence. That is why my amendment proposes to add the words &ldquo;in a case where the information concerned was concealed by the fraud of the <Col N="522" /> defendant&rdquo;, that being of a serious and deliberate nature. If the penalty is to be imposed by the District Court, the time permitted to issue summary proceedings appears to be in excess of what is expected of the remit of that court. In such circumstances the provision should be more constrained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 proposes an amendment to the 1989 Act. It seeks to permit summary proceedings to be taken against a person accused of an offence under the Insurance Acts, either within two years of the offence being committed or within six months of the offence being discovered, subject to an overall limit of five years since the offence. This amendment is deemed necessary in light of the experience of my Department in recent years. The six months provided in the 1989 Act has proved impractical, even when an offence is detected immediately. More time is needed to gather the evidence to prepare proceedings. In addition, unfortunately, in the nature of insurance it may be much more than two years before an offence comes to light. For example, a couple could buy a product as protection on their lives, one could die after two, three or four years and on death it could be discovered by the other party that the product was not what it was thought to be in which case the matter would have to be investigated and, where necessary, prosecuted. In view of this, a certain balance must be offered to the consumer to allow for the evolution of time. Five years is the maximum, which is fair in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The question of which court would hear the proceedings would depend on the value of the prosecution claim. If it is a certain figure it must be heard in the District Court, if above that it must be heard in the Circuit Court. It would be an arbitrary decision, depending on the prosecution at the time.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Costello would create difficulties in proceeding with prosecuting offences. For example, fraudulent concealment would have to be proved, again delaying matters to the point where the provision would be inoperable. The onus of proof of concealment would be on the plaintiff, which may not be established until after the time period allowed, in which case prosecution would be impossible.

      <P>I support Senator Costello's amendments. The amendment is correctly worded. It states that the Minster will maintain responsibility but if he wishes to pass it on to somebody else, he may do so. If we are to produce a Bill which will last a long time, that is a freedom the Minister would welcome. Looking at good management practice in the long-term, that is something that could be delegated but it is in the hands of the Minister to delegate it. This is an amendment the Minister may consider.</P>

      <P>The Senators, by virtue of the amendment and through their contributions, have rightly highlighted areas where the Minister currently exercises authority but where, in the future, it may be more appropriate to have these functions carried out by a body independent of the industry and any possible political interference. That would be in line with international best practice. Such a change, however, is premature at this time. We cannot presume that which will happen in future legislation. We must maintain the continuity of new legislation with existing legislation and maintain that balance and consistency.</P>
      <P>When proposals are brought forward in the future concerning the single financial regulator, it will be appropriate at that time to make the necessary arrangements to assign all these and other functions to any new regulator or authority. There is also no need to provide for the appointment of a single regulator in this legislation in advance of a decision on this matter and in advance of the subsequent legislation. We cannot do that. The necessary arrangements for transfer of powers can be made relatively easily in the new proposed legislation. Consequently, it would be unwise and imprudent to second guess that which might come forward in the future. We must maintain the consistency and, regrettably, I will not be able to accept these amendments.</P>

We are not second guessing anybody. The Minister told us categorically that the regulator was about to be introduced in the very short-term rather than down the road. We were trying to be helpful to the Minister and to take away the extra burden he has imposed on himself in relation to all these onerous and specific tasks relating to re-insurance. Clearly that is the way it will go, regardless of whether we like it. It has to go down the road of a regulator so either a person or a body will be doing these functions. We might as well introduce it here as good practice in the legislation and perhaps it will hasten the Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste in getting their act together.</P>

Life assurance policies have to be underwritten according to risk, namely, the health of the consumer, whether he or she smokes or has a history of family illness. Despite the best intentions, therefore, actual information is not available before the consumer can accept the policy. To have the availability of the full information with the cooling off notice is adequate for the consumer as he or she still has ten days in which to cancel the policy. This could be extended to a longer period, if the Minister so wishes, to ensure that the consumer has adequate time to consider the full costs of the policy. PIBA, IBA and the consumers association are in agreement on this point and, accordingly, I commend this amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> Section 108 of the Insurance Act, 1936, refers to the provision of policies and copies thereof in Irish. However, this Bill restricts that provision to the English language. The simple approach would be to accept my amendment, namely, that the information be provided in both official languages rather than English alone.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, is trying to provide equality between both languages under the constitutional requirements and is to introduce a Bill to that effect. In light of this I would have thought the Bill before the House would provide that information be provided in both official languages of the State. Has the Minister of State consulted the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on this issue and how does this provision fall into line with what he has been working on? My amendment would improve this provision.</P>

      <P>I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment. I was involved in a Supreme Court case 30 years ago where the court's decision depended on whether the wording was taken from the Irish. The case involved a ministerial order from 1938 and the case was in 1971. The Supreme Court's decision rested on the meaning of one word and the case was won on the basis that the Irish language version in the Constitution was taken as the correct version.</P>
      <P>If this is the law of the land and the Irish language takes precedence in the Constitution, there is a need to explain why documentation should be provided only in the English language. There may be a valid reason why this should be the case. However, in a nation which values its heritage I would not like to see a provision in a Bill that information should be provided only in the English language and that the English language should be the language on which decisions would depend. I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment.</P>

Ach tuigeann siad go léir nach teanga oifigiúil í an Ghaeilge ar mhór-roinn na hEorpa nó do Choimisiún na hEorpa agus sin mar atá ó 1 Eanáir 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment provides that insurers offering insurance in Ireland will automatically have to make documentation available in Irish and English. The existing provision means that documentation must be made available in Irish on the request of the client. Since 1936, Irish law has required that when a policy holder completes a <Col N="528" /> proposal for insurance in Irish, documentation from the insurer shall be provided in Irish if the policy holder so requests.</P>
    <P>The third insurance directive opened the entire European market to European Union insurance companies. Any new conditions to be imposed on insurers in any part of the EU would have to be justified, otherwise they could be seen by the Commission as a barrier to the Single Market. It could be difficult to justify the condition proposed by the amendment since only a small number of people in Ireland are likely to opt for receiving documentation in Irish. We have made official inquiries to the Irish Insurance Federation and have confirmation that, since 1989, only three people have asked for documentation to be provided in Irish.</P>
    <P>I share the Senators' concerns as I have a deep commitment to the native language. These concerns may be alleviated by the knowledge that insurers operating in the Irish market are required to provide documentation in Irish when a policy holder seeks to complete the proposal form in Irish. The same applies to State bodies. If someone contacts a State body to obtain information it is mandatory for that body to provide that documentation in Irish and also to provide officials who can converse with the individual in our native language. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware there are concerns about the cost of insurance. Due to mergers and acquisitions in Ireland and within the EU the number of players in the insurance market is shrinking. In other words, the number of insurers carrying the liabilities, collecting and reinvesting the premia and paying claims is constantly shrinking. We now have bigger companies but fewer competitors and this amendment could have a detrimental impact on competition and price. I am seeking to avoid any measures which might discourage new players from entering the Irish market.</P>
    <P>As Ireland is a key exporter of insurance services, our overall national interest does not lie in introducing new barriers to trade but in supporting the free operation of the Single Market. Within the system we operate under the Constitution and under the 1936 Act the right exists for an individual to have business translated into and transacted through the Irish language. Any company operating in Ireland is obliged to provide such services and this protects the interest of the language and the right of the citizen and the consumer. Taking these reasons into account, we have to be positive and practical in how we frame legislation. If accepted, this amendment would create an impediment which might discourage further competition and the availability of products and options for consumers. As legislators that would be an unwise step to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Minister of State that only three requests for documentation in Irish have been made since <Col N="529" /> 1989. In those circumstances the use of both Irish and English would seldom occur. However, has any other legislation put before both Houses included a provision to the effect that information specified in insurance policies or copies thereof, shall be provided in the English language unless there is a specific request otherwise? This is an exclusive statement which inserts into legislation that no insurance company can provide information in Irish unless requested, even if it wishes to do so. That is my reading of it. The Bill uses the words &ldquo;subject to section 108 of the Insurance Act&rdquo;, but that section makes provision for a case where somebody who fills out the form in Irish requests the information in Irish. Unless that request is forthcoming, does that mean that the company is not in a position to provide information in both official languages of the State?</P>
      <P>I do not remember ever seeing a provision of this nature. It is unique in legislation which has come before us and I wonder why the Minister feels it should be here in this form.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Costello said. I am not sure if there is other legislation where we specify this but, as Senator Mooney pointed out to me, subsection (2) of section 43C certainly incorporates options for people.</P>
      <P>The purpose of section 43C(1) is to ensure that products for consumption by the citizens of Ireland must be provided in the English language, the idea being that we would attract competition into the marketplace. If that competition comes from the European Union, rather than have the documentation provided in the official language of the country of the company providing these new products and creating confusion in the Irish market, there would be an obligation in Irish law for them to provide the products in the English language in order that everybody could understand them and consequently that such companies could not tell the European Union that Ireland was discriminating against them by not letting them produce the products in the official language of the country of such companies. Under the principle of subsidiarity within the directive, we have the right to do that and we have chosen to do so here to ensure there is no doubt whatever about future opportunities for new companies whose products come on the market, but they must fulfil this condition in doing so.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation. I had not understood the objective of this. This is to stop a German company, for example, coming into Ireland and stating, &ldquo;Here is an insurance policy. Never mind that it is in German but here is what it means.&rdquo;  It forces a company from a country which uses another language to provide an English translation. I had not understood that and now I understand why the Bill stipulates that it be provided in the English language.</P>
      <P>On Senator Mooney's question, I am not sure he is correct. If a person asked that German company for an Irish language translation of the product, for instance, and the company refused, I do not think the company would be breaking the law. I do not think companies are being forced by law to provide everything in the Irish language and therefore Senator Mooney is probably not correct.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I apologise. If the Senator was being rhetorical in suggesting that the law should make such provision, I do not think we could support it. It seems to me that if every commercial organisation trading in Ireland was forced to deal with every customer in a second language, it would be hugely costly. In the light of inflationary pressures, it would not be feasible.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation. I understand it correctly now. I would like to believe that a company would respond to its customers by providing them with products in whatever language they wanted, even if that language was not Irish. That would make good commercial sense. I understand the objective of the Bill and I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Mooney said was correct. My interpretation of section 108 is that if an Irish person completing an insurance form requested that the communication be in Irish, then the insurance company would be obliged to communicate in Irish. That was my reading of it. I do not know whether that is a fair practice. I am sure that Senator Quinn, as a businessman, would find it difficult to deal with all such people who might write in Irish to his company regarding its business, although I am sure that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>It seems that the legislation, in section 108, is quite restrictive in requiring that a person who completes an insurance form must be dealt with in the Irish language if he or she so requests. That is the person's right under the Constitution. The Minister will probably clarify it to that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it the case that the Bill provides that every company, including Irish, European and English companies, entering the Irish market shall, unless <Col N="531" /> there is a specific request to the contrary regarding the Irish language, provide all its information only in English? Is that the interpretation to be taken from the words &ldquo;provided in the English language&rdquo;? That is the matter about which I am not sure.</P>
    <P>Is there a restriction on companies providing it in another language? If companies so wish, may companies now choose to provide it in Irish, English or German, for instance, or does the legislation state that it must be provided at least in English, that English is one language in which it must be provided? That is not clear from the Bill because the 1936 Act states specifically that the Irish language must be the only language in which a person is dealt with if the person makes such a request and completes the form in Irish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the interpretations outlined in the Senators' contributions are absolutely correct. Senator Mooney is correct when he stated that citizens have the right to request that business be done in the Irish language and companies are expected to oblige them by doing that. Of course it would be very difficult to prosecute for not doing so under competition or EU law because Irish is not an official language of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn is absolutely correct. It is a matter for the companies to choose to provide the documentation in Irish if they so wish. As he will be aware, there is a large amount of commercial activity in Gaeltacht areas. Údarás na Gaeltachta has a strong record of industrial activity and has been successful in the Gaeltachtaí around the country. I do not live there myself and therefore I cannot confirm this is the case but I presume the people who do business in that area complete documentation in Irish in order to make sure they maximise their market penetration.</P>
      <P>On the point Senator Costello raises, the legislation states that a company must provide documentation in the English language. That means they must do that and can be prosecuted for not doing so and forced to do it. There is nothing to prevent them from providing documentation in another language used in the European Union if they so wish. It is a matter for them to decide what the market will absorb or the capacity to attract business which the use of another language would have in the market in a particular functional area. If there are enough Germans in Ireland who want to do business in German, I presume there will be companies which will want to provide documentation in German and the same can be said of French and other languages. I am not sure about that but certainly they must provide it in English. We are protecting the consumers of Ireland by specifying that it must be in the English language <i>per se</i>. Then it is a matter for the company to decide whether it wants to provide it in other languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Section 43C(2) means that they may provide documentation in another language if requested to do so. That is in answer to a question raised by Senator Costello or Senator Mooney. That is exactly what it means. If they wish to provide documentation in another language if requested to do so, they may provide that documentation. Therefore it gives them the right and flexibility to do so. The legislation acknowledges that this situation prevails and that the companies can do so. However, we must be specific. The legislation is specific in that at a minimum English language documentation must be provided by all companies providing insurance cover in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue this and I fully appreciate from where the Minister of State is coming on this matter. Am I correct in saying it is a rather sad acknowledgement of the commercial reality that, in the very competitive area of insurance and assurance provision, the law will now require of companies within the European Union, among the many legal obligations they have, that the language of their product shall be in English? That is what is being enshrined in Irish law. That is essentially what this is about.</P>
      <P>It should not pass without recording not so much the death of the Irish language but a somewhat stark commercial reality that 99.9% of the people use English as their preferred language and that in order for commercial activity to operate, the Government, the instigators of the legislation, has faced this reality that it must be in the English language. There is not much point, as Senator Quinn said, having it in German, French, Danish or any of the other official languages unless it is so requested. In terms of a company competing in the Irish market, it must be in English. I feel somewhat sad that is the reality.</P>
      <P>I wonder &ndash; the Minister of State touched on it briefly &ndash; about prosecutions in light of the precedent that has been set in other areas where citizens dealing with Departments have taken the Government to court to ensure that, if they so prefer, their business will be dealt with through the Irish language, which has equal status with the English language in the Constitution. Without anticipating anything and speaking rhetorically, one wonders whether a citizen will decide to test this in the courts if an insurance company does not comply with a request for documents to be in Gaelic.</P>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the discussion but, like Senator Costello, who commenced this by tabling his amendment, I confess it is the first time I have seen this in any legislation coming before this House, that is, that English has become the preferred language of business and commerce. This is no reflection on the Minister of State and the Department but I think it is an acknowledgement of the commercial reality in which this legislation will operate.</P>

      <P>I understand the sentiments expressed by Senator Mooney but we should see this as a positive strength of Ireland. English is the universal language of the world. It is said that the English brought their language to Ireland and that we gave them the literature attaching to that language. They might not be prepared to accept that, but the great literary figures we have had in the English language over the years certainly stand to our credit. It also shows our universal strength in that we are outstanding users of the English language, we can communicate with the world and we are clear in our communication. We have used this to maximum capacity in terms of our economic growth over the years. Some of the great industries in Ireland today are basically here because of our capacity to use, communicate, market and to do business quickly throughout the world in the English language. That gives us a great intro no matter where we go and it opens up many opportunities, not only in Europe where there is a diversity and multiplicity of languages but elsewhere.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, our Irish language gives us a special badge of identity, a special uniqueness, and it is important that we maintain and sustain that. As a result of that, the Constitution, the 1936 Act and the goodwill we hope still prevails in the commercial community for sustaining the language, those who want to use that language on a regular basis should not be debarred from doing so. We must be practical. I see this as all inclusive rather than exclusive and I am confident it is good legislation.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 14, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following new section: </P>
      <P>43DD.&ndash;Regulations under section 43D shall prohibit an insurer from seeking, obtaining, using or retaining information relating to genetic testing of an insured or proposed insured.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this to be one of the more important amendments being proposed because it deals with a relatively new and important issue, that is, genetic testing of an insured or proposed insured. My concern is that the insurance industry could effectively create something of a genetic underclass by insisting on information in relation to the genetic testing of an individual in order to determine their liability and creditworthiness for insurance on the perception that genetic testing would provide reliable information on a person's <Col N="534" /> likelihood to contract a particular illness or disability. A development of that nature would be reprehensible. I am trying to deal with it both in terms of the industry seeking that as a prerequisite for insurance and using or retaining on a database any information that might become available on an insured or proposed insured person.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's ministerial colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, also raised it in the context of the equality legislation brought before the Houses when he was Opposition spokesman. He tabled a similar amendment to the legislation at that time reflecting his concern about genetic testing being a prerequisite for certain insurance products. In that respect, it is a concern which has been expressed not only by the Opposition side but also by the Government side.</P>
    <P>Previously, some in the insurance industry would have seen cancer as something which made a risk virtually uninsurable, yet modern medicine means that roughly 50% of cancer diagnosed is cured and people go on to live a normal life. It would be the thin end of the wedge if we were to use genetic testing as a criterion of which the insurance industry would take advantage and thereby probably rule out, as it would see it, a large percentage of the population from the benefits of insurance at a very early stage.</P>
    <P>It is an important issue which needs to be reflected in legislation. We need to put down a marker and this legislation is the area in which to do so. It would be worthwhile if the Minister seriously considered this amendment and took it on board, perhaps not precisely in the terms we have here. Perhaps a provision of this nature could be introduced on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment. It is a most important issue. The Minister of State may have seen letters in<i> The Irish Times</i> recently from the department of genetics in Trinity College, Dublin, and the department of genetics in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, urging us to introduce legislation preventing insurance companies from asking for genetic information from any of their clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several reasons this is extraordinarily important. Even in diseases which have a genetic background, approximately one third of them are due to <i>de novo</i> mutations, so one third of the cases which arise will not be familial. The next problem is that those who have a familial history of some condition may decide not to undertake testing because they will be asked by an insurance company if they have had such a test. It might be advisable for them to have the test because they could perhaps change environmental conditions in their lives which would mean they would be less likely to develop this genetic condition. It is most important if someone has a genetic predisposition to something like, for example, polyposis of the colon that they undertake testing. If people <Col N="535" /> change their diet and undertake a regular colonoscopy it may ensure they will be less likely to develop the condition.</P>
    <P>The third reason the amendment should be accepted is that some people may come from families who have a serious genetic condition which cannot be altered and which may not develop until later in life. If people are forced to have genetic screening they will know that they are likely to develop the condition in 20 or 30 years' time. Huntington's disease does not manifest itself until people are in their forties. If people in their twenties were obliged to have such testing, it would be very difficult if they knew they were likely to develop the condition for which there is no cure to date.</P>
    <P>In an edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> Professor McConnell and his co-workers, together with Dr. Andrew Greene and his co-workers, pointed out that it is only in the United Kingdom this issue is being pressed and that many countries in Europe and many states in the United States of America do not seek genetic testing. Given that there are many parent companies in this country of companies in the United Kingdom, it is most important to make it plain that this requirement will not be acceptable because it would have a deleterious effect on the health of Irish people. I know insurance companies are entitled to take into account various risks, but there is also community risk.</P>
    <P>Environmental factors are much more important than genetic factors. We would all like to blame our various ailments on our genes but they are far more likely to be due to environmental factors such as smoking, eating and drinking too much and so on. These factors are far more likely to militate against health insurance. If legislation such as this is not enacted, we will be asking people to disclose the most private details of their gene make-up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Senators reasons for tabling this amendment and the discussions on the issue are timely. The issue of genetic testing is of great importance because it brings together a number of very serious public policy concerns, which have been alluded to by Senators Costello and Henry. These include public health issues, with which Senator Henry often deals professionally and otherwise, and the privacy of personal data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may be aware that I responded in the Dáil last night to a question on the Adjournment on this issue. Let me repeat that I have asked my officials to begin a process of consultation with interested public bodies to examine the issue surrounding the possible use of genetic data by the insurance industry with a view to determining what action would be appropriate. The officials were consulted by the insurance industry about a proposed code of conduct to be followed by the industry in Ireland in relation to the use of gen<Col N="536" /> etic tests, which I understand is quite encouraging in its terms. I am confident the code of conduct, after due consideration and deliberation, will be equitable and fair to everyone.</P>
    <P>While I share many of the Senators' concerns, I cannot accept the amendment at this time. When the process of consultation undertaken by my Department is completed, and taking appropriate account of the insurance industry's code of conduct, I will consider what action will be necessary at that time. I read the letters in <i>The Irish Times</i>, to which Deputy Henry referred, and I appreciate the fact that Senator Costello tabled this amendment, which is timely. As Minister with responsibility for science, I will have another detailed look at this aspect and, as Minister with responsibility for commerce, I will look at it from the insurance industry point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that the Minister's Department will have further consultations on the matter. Can I take it from what the Minister said that following consultations and examination of the issue, the code of conduct will be put on a statutory footing and not self-regulated? It is acceptable if he gives a commitment to come forward with proposals to both Houses in relation to the outcome of the consultations. I would welcome his response in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot look at this matter from the narrow point of view of insurance only because we are talking about consumers. Consequently, the broad gamut of activity within the Department, which is a large Department covering a huge number of interests in the consumer area, must be taken into account. The Director of Consumer Affairs would have a detailed interest in this whole area. Therefore, I have asked my officials to examine this activity. There will be discussions within the Department and every aspect will be examined. When I receive the relevant report from my officials on the code of conduct issue, I will make a decision on what action should be taken.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 18, line 36, to delete &ldquo;offence.'&rdquo;and substitute &ldquo;offence.</P>
      <P>(2) The court may decide if it is in the interests of justice to do so that an insurer who fails to comply with a provision of regulations made under this Part may thereby be disentitled to repudiate liability under the contract of insurance concerned, notwithstanding default or omission on the part of the insured.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking to make it an offence for insurance companies and brokers not to give information. If we say that non-compliance could limit their ability to repudiate a contract of insurance, this is <Col N="537" /> something about which they would think far more seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to introduce an additional penalty for insurers who fail to comply with the disclosure regime, viz. that they would not be able to repudiate liability in respect of that contract of insurance even if the insured had failed in his or her obligations. I am opposing the amendment because I fear it would increase litigation and add to the costs borne by ordinary policyholders. In such cases it would presumably be necessary to satisfy the court that failure to comply had occurred. Moreover, in every case where an insurance company was attempting for good reasons to repudiate a claim, such a provision would encourage the invention of accusations of failure to comply. In other words, we would be compounding the legal process and creating confusion. This would have adverse consequences on costs and the length of time it would take to conclude litigation and would add to the costs borne by ordinary policyholders. I do not believe such legislation would be positive.</P>
      <P>However, I have some sympathy with the idea underlined in the Senator's amendment. It appears that occasionally insurance companies use quite minor oversights by their clients to repudiate full responsibility in the event of a claim. This is one of a number of consumer issues which merit further consideration once the Insurance Bill and disclosure regulations are in place. My Department, with the Director of Consumer Affairs, will be looking at this issue which will have to be dealt with in subsequent legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the latter part of the Minister of State's response. He will be aware that on Second Stage I provided an example, based on personal experience, of precisely what he has outlined, whereby an insurance company used a minor element of its policy under exclusions to deny liability. This is in the travel insurance area. Since I made those remarks I have had discussions with representatives of brokers. I was talking about insurance companies, not insurance brokers. There is a clear distinction which, as the Minister pointed out, is somewhat blurred in the public mind. I am pleased to hear what the Minister has said and I hope he will follow through on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mis-selling of travel insurance is a scandal. It has been discussed by the Consumers Association of Ireland and by various Departments but nothing has been done about it. Unscrupulous insurance companies operating outside this country are selling travel insurance to consumers who often feel obliged to purchase the products and do not examine the small print. These clients often find their claims rejected for the most minor details. It is sometimes said that the devil is in the small print, and the consumer often suffers because of this. I am pleased the Minister has <Col N="538" /> indicated his intention to tackle this problem, which is not confined to travel insurance. I look forward to his proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsequent to remarks I made on Second Stage, representatives of the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, which has been in regular contact with the Minister, put forward a number of suggestions on the question of disclosure of information. I do not speak for the brokers' association but in the absence of my colleague, Senator Cox, I undertook to raise its concerns during this debate. The Professional Insurance Brokers Association acknowledges the positive response it has received from the Minister in its dealings with him. He has accommodated the association in so far as he can on a wide number of issues which have been of concern to it.</P>
      <P>The issue I raised on Second Stage is also of concern to the association. It is the question of restrictions on giving advice on products similar to products for which a broker holds an agency. Brokers argue that it is unsatisfactory to ask brokers to restrict themselves to give information as the consumer will assume he is being given advice. They argue that it is contradictory to use the term &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; in relation to an independent broker. They go on to make the point that independent brokers give general advice in relation to mortgages and death claims and advise people to contact solicitors, make wills or seek legal advice in relation to separation or divorce. They argue that this is part of the added value a consumer receives from a broker and often protects the consumer from a larger institution.</P>
      <P>I cited my experience of contacting a number of UK companies. I discovered that if, for example, an investor has an interest in investing in the European market and contacts one of the large unit trust companies which have a range of financial products tailored to an investor's particular interest, under UK law the company can only offer information in relation to the range of products. When the investor asks which product he should invest in, the company is precluded by law from giving that specific advice. I was reminded of my colleague Senator Quinn in that I have often asked the advice of one of his employees in Superquinn as to which product I should choose and I have always been offered some indication, although a product may not actually be endorsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction between information and advice is blurred. I would accept the bona fides of independent brokers in this area. There should be some flexibility when clients approach them seeking to purchase insurance products under this <Col N="539" /> legislation. The law, as proposed, would restrict them considerably and could cause problems.</P>
    <P>I cited the example of Senator Quinn's company to illustrate that most people who are not familiar with a product, whether insurance or food, tend to seek advice. This section could cause difficulties for intermediaries. I ask the Minister to clarify the question of disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>Does the Bill propose that advice will no longer be acceptable if a consumer goes to an independent broker? Will brokers be required to operate within very strictly regulated guidelines in relation to how they sell their products?</P>

      <P>Section 43F(1)<i>(a)</i>(v) of section 7 states that an insurer may provide a written statement which shall specify details of any additional amount payable by reason of sex, age, medical status, place of residence or any other matter.</P>
      <P>Is this not an invitation to introduce extra loading? In what circumstances is an insurance company entitled to impose an extra loading in relation to sex, place of residence or medical status? This section appears to imply that such loading can be justifiable. Will the Minister clarify the circumstances in which additional loading could be imposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised. I thank Senator Mooney for his kind words. He referred to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, which was a Central Bank Act guided through the Oireachtas by the then Minister for Finance. The Act defined investment instruments, investment intermediaries and the different status of each intermediary. In insurance law we have no option but to ensure that we maintain consistency with that Act.</P>
      <P>The status is a matter of choice for the professional who is giving the advice and acting on behalf of the various companies as an intermediary. An insurance agent must have not more than four authorisations from four different companies to operate as an agent. An insurance broker cannot have less than five to be a broker. A restricted investment intermediary is restricted in terms of what he or she can do. However, there is nothing to suggest that they must be in that category. It is a matter for them to decide what risk they want to take, what investments they want to make, what services they want to give, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Act was to be inclusive rather than exclusive. The idea was to include everybody who wanted to purvey products, protection policies and investment opportunities. The Act was careful to ensure that there was no exclusion and that if there was a differentiation, it was clear. This was to ensure that people were not disenfranchised or discommoded and that their livelihoods would not be eroded. This was the reason for the Act. It defines the different types of investment people, whether agents or <Col N="540" /> brokers. It defines the types of policies and instruments and it also defines the investor. We must ensure that this legislation conforms with that Act.</P>
    <P>Regarding the point raised by Senator Costello, I did not know that there was loading based on one's sex. There is a downloading or a mitigation of premium for women who can avail of special &ldquo;lady cover&rdquo; policies because they are considered to be more responsible and have fewer accidents. Certain incentives are provided by companies to encourage women to take that type of cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not mention downloading. It refers to an additional amount payable by reason of sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>To which section is the Senator referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 7, section 43F(1)(<i>a</i>)(v) on page 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be an indication of extra loading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding regulations of non-life insurance, section 43F(1) of section 7 states: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of section 43D, regulations made under that subsection may provide in relation to non-life insurance:&rdquo;. This means the regulations that will be introduced can refer to all these issues. People must be told that there is a loading on them. We want to ensure that there is total sustainability and transparency. Under the subsection, the regulations may require disclosure of details of loadings attributable to the client's sex, age, medical status, place of residence or any other matter.</P>
      <P>The notion of rating risk according to sex and age is familiar. There are indications that insurance may also be able to rate risk according to place of residence and credit rating. At the least, if insurance were to use such ratings in the future, the clients must know about it as a result of this legislation. The provision relates to disclosure. It will require disclosure where the factors of sex, age, place of residence etc. are used because they are part of the underwriting criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no power to intervene in the underwriting. The Department, the Government and the State are debarred in that regard because of the European Commission's directive that the market must rule. The Senator asked about loadings. The company must decide the risk it is fit to carry on any particular individual or policy in a particular case. It also has a responsibility to ensure that it has a sufficient liquidity ratio and the necessary <Col N="541" /> reserves to meet any subsequent liabilities or claims the client may make against it.</P>
    <P>My job as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce is to ensure that there is competition in the market, that there are underwriters and undertakings which are prepared to provide cover, that these underwriters and undertakings have the necessary resources, that is, liquidity and cash resources, to make the necessary payments if claims are made against them and that they are able to provide cover at a reasonable price commensurate with the liabilities they expect to have. The market rules as such and I cannot intervene or interfere in that area. It is a matter for the company.</P>
    <P>From their experience in the marketplace, they are able to decide where the risk is greatest. They have the right, if they wish to exercise it, to make decisions within certain parameters. This provides them with market research information based on the market and the frequency of claims from a particular area for a certain reason, for example, in terms of a type of person or vehicle. They make their own decision but they must operate within the European directive. We cannot interfere with their decision.</P>
    <P>The section is an enabling provision to allow us to make the necessary regulations. It refers to what can be done at any particular time to ensure full and absolute disclosure. Each citizen has the right to know if he or she is being discriminated against under any particular guise or if he or she is being charged a particular price for a specific reason. If he or she considers that there is an unnecessary loading, he or she must be told the reasons for the loading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State's point about the disclosure of any extra loading that might be imposed by an insurance company. However, the Bill selects and identifies certain areas in that it refers to an additional amount payable in respect of certain matters. The Bill focuses attention on those as relevant or appropriate areas that might be subject to extra loading.</P>
      <P>If it was considered proper in terms of accountability and disclosure &ndash; I understand there must be full disclosure of any information where there is extra loading &ndash; rather than selecting sex, age, medical status or place of residence, why was the section not couched in terms of an obligation under the regulations on the company to give a written statement giving details of any additional amount payable by reason of any matter? It should not refer to only a few areas which are highly questionable in terms of equality legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection of those areas appears to be discriminatory on the basis of the language used in the provision in terms of identifying them as deserving of loading. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this matter and to accept that there can be full disclosure of information and account<Col N="542" /> ability without specifying areas which are highly contentious and volatile. These areas could be misused by insurance companies if there is a focus on them as ones that might be deserving of extra loading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am on the right line in relation to the provision of information under section 7. The Professional Insurance Brokers Association said that, as indicated on many occasions, providing policy specific information to the consumer before a policy is underwritten is not practical. It can only be generic until the risk is underwritten. It continued that providing this information at point of sale would lead to misunderstandings and it would be preferable that all up-front information supplied is generic. Inevitably this will happen over time anyway.</P>
      <P>Although there is no reference on this information from the PIBA, I assume it relates to Senator Costello's point about section 43F. I do not share that view. I do not see what is wrong with a client who wants to take out an insurance policy going to an insurance intermediary and being told they must buy a pig in a poke. The pig may not be fully in the poke until such time as one signs up but that is the best offer in the meantime. I am sure the Minister had discussions with the insurance brokers on this issue and I am curious to know their concerns. They seem to dress up their argument as an attack on consumer rights and interests. I do not agree with that conclusion. I know Senator Costello's point is specific to section 43F of section 7, but perhaps the Minister will outline his views on the issue of disclosure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept and understand Senator Costello's point. However, we must be clear about what we intend to do. The disclosure regulations envisage that some of the information given at the point of sale will be generic with a choice of specific information before commencement of the cooling off period. We are pleased the industry does not appear to have a problem with that.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney that the product is only generic from once it is repeated. There are always new products coming on stream and it is important that our legislation ensures that maximum information on those products is available to the consumers so they can make an informed choice before making an investment or taking a risk with a product. After that it may become generic if it is tweaked by another company and a new similar product is put on the market. It may have advantages or disadvantages, depending on the relativity of that product to the client at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello said we are assisting the industry to create these loadings. However, that is not the case. This situation has prevailed for a number of years. It was not obvious to the client that there was a loading. They knew they were <Col N="543" /> paying a higher premium than people of a similar age or profession in another part of the country. As a result of complaints to the Department, we took up the matter with the industry and we received a response which outlined factors such as location, accident frequency, highways, where people lived, what they used their cars for, the distance they travelled, the type of jobs they had and the risks involved. Decisions were then taken to load amounts on people. Perhaps after our efforts, some of this information was made available. However, some of it may not have been obvious to anyone. Unless a person knew what he or she was looking for, he or she may not have got the answer he or she wanted.</P>
    <P>We have had many meetings with the industry. Since I came to office in October 1997 I have met the top management of most of the companies. I have dealt with the industry, the federation, the different associations and professional bodies, the brokers association and the agents. I have addressed the annual general meetings of every organisation, which was not done before. We met the organisations in the industry over the years and we told them what we wanted to achieve. We tried to bring everyone on board and we have succeeded in doing that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation is to eliminate any latent or hidden reason for loading additional amounts on people by ensuring inclusion under the disclosure regulations. That will give comfort to the consumer and it will make the cost of the product or premium more transparent. It will ensure that the undertaking which is providing the cover, the intermediary who is conveying the cover and the consumer who is the beneficiary of the cover will know from where they are coming, what it costs and the reason it costs that amount.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister of State and I do not want to labour the point unduly. However, I am concerned about generic disclosure and listing specifics. If the Minister of State selects four areas which may attract additional loading, which he has done, he is telling the insurance industry that written information must be provided on the reason extra loading is required in these four areas. However, there is almost a presumption that they deserve extra loading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could equally add profession to the list of sex, age, medical status and place of residence. The fact that someone is a docker or a Senator is relevant. Why does the Minister of State not include profession? Marital status could also be included. The fact that a person is single or married is relevant in many non-life insurance policies. Why has the Minister of State selected four areas if he is talking in generic terms? Why can the Bill not state: &ldquo;details of any additional amount payable by reason of any other matter&rdquo;? That gives disclosure on generic terms. It is unfair to draw attention in the legislation to four areas <Col N="544" /> which may attract extra loading. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider this matter between now and Report Stage when he might introduce an amendment.</P>

      <P>I will think about it between now and Report Stage. I respect the Senator's point and the contribution legislators make when enacting good laws. I have tremendous regard for Seanad Éireann which has not received due regard for the huge contribution it has made to making good laws.</P>
      <P>Section 43F(1)(<i>a</i>)(v) states: &ldquo;details of any additional amount payable by reason of sex, age, medical status, place of residence or any other matter&rdquo;. If a person goes into an insurance company in the morning and applies for cover or an investment product, he or she must give information on his or her sex, age, medical status, place of residence and many other things. If a person is a certain age, he or she must have an optical test. If a person suffers from a particular disease, he or she must disclose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person does not disclose it, he or she invalidates his or her insurance cover. A client may presume he or she is getting cover at a reasonable price based on the status of that client and the detailed information provided. However, he or she may discover he or she is paying an unnecessarily high premium. We want to be able to say to the industry through the disclosure regime that it must tell people it is loading them because they are of a particular sex or age.</P>
      <P>As regards the motor industry, insurance is provided at a particular price for people aged between 17 and 19. However, there is a different price for people between the ages of 19 and 21, 21 and 23, 23 and 25, 25 and 30, over 30 and over 40. Age is important. According to the industry, the risks for a married man within those parameters may be lower. A single woman within those parameters may be a lower risk than a single man in a corresponding age bracket. This is the way the insurance industry regulates itself in adjudicating the premiums it charges for the different covers it provides. Within that context we want to segment the information disclosed about these costs. We want the individual to have the right to ask why they must pay the price set, whether it be for cover for a house in a particular location, a motor car in another location or some other type of cover or investment product required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under equality legislation the insurance industry must justify such loading with actuarial data. It must be able to say actuaries have done the research, have computed figures and, based on their advice and information, they have concluded that X, Y or Z must be charged for systems one to three, or whatever. Unless we specify, we will not be able to create the subsidiary <Col N="545" /> legislation through the regulations. Reference is made to any other matter because there may be other eventualities, reasons or cases. We do not want an escape clause.</P>

      <P>Am I right in suggesting that one must look at the overall package, to use the insurance term, in the context of the proposed addition of section 43F to the Insurance Act, 1989, as distinct from considering one aspect of it? All of the other areas, for example, the amount of the discount and the amount of commission, pertain to questions raised with insurance intermediaries by clients rather than insurance companies. I do not suggest there is anything incorrect in Senator Costello's approach, but it is on the basis of these being the questions the insurance companies ask of the clients, whereas the package as a whole relates to the obligations of the insurance industry to the client. Does the Minister of State concur that the client, the consumer, is ultimately being protected by the package in its entirety, rather than one element of it?</P>

      <P>Expressing its concerns, the Insurance Brokers Association refers to &ldquo;a considerable blurring at the margins of investment and insurance products&rdquo;. It goes on to point out that insurance intermediaries only sell insurance products, not pure investment products, for example, stocks and shares. Insurance products also carry a benefit on death, while non-insurance investment products do not. While the association would agree that the same regulator should cover both types of activities, it believes the regulatory regime should be tailored according to the risks involved and the proposed regulatory rules are still tending towards over-regulation of independent insurance brokers. Does the Minister of State have any comment on that? Is he concerned that this legislation is weighted against the independent brokers who, in the main, are operating in one person businesses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> I hope I am not incorrect in assuming that the Minister of State's background was as an intermediary of sorts where he had to pay his overheads and raise his family. Nobody likes regulation and where consumer interests are concerned they always tend to regard it as being over-regulation. Could the Minister of State reassure insurance brokers that the heavy hand of regulation is not bearing down too heavily on their sector, to the detriment of the industry as a whole?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want effective, fair and equitable regulation. I do not want to over-regulate. We have looked at this in great detail. I believe it is accepted across the country that while the insurance industry was self-regulating it did not work. A number of high profile cases led to tragic consequences for the good name of Ireland, the insurance industry and people acting as brokers in Ireland. We want to eliminate that for the future.</P>
      <P>We have looked at the legislation of other countries, which is more detailed and aggressive than what we propose. We have considered this over a period of three years, which has allowed for fairness to all and the opportunity to change. We believe we have achieved a consensus between the legislators in both the Dáil and the Seanad and in the industry, including the brokers and agents. Ultimately, I do not want, nor have I wanted, to impose something on people. I wanted them to come through this process in partnership with us to ensure that we would be fair to all. By and large, that is what has happened. All legislation has advantages and disadvantages, but they are all relative.</P>
      <P>Section 16 defines the terms of insurance agents, insurance brokers, insurance intermediaries, insurance undertakings, investment instruments, insurance policies, investments in limited partnerships, the investment business firm, the investor and the limited partnership. What are termed &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; people have the special privilege of not having to demonstrate capital adequacy to anybody, be it the State or the consumer. This privilege is extended to them under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, on the basis that they will only advise on and sell the product of producers for whom they hold appointments. They have direct appointments from product producers and they specialise in promoting those products. They sell those products only and cannot transgress from that by virtue of the status they hold. That is their decision. Nobody placed them there. They decide that is what they want to be. It allows for competition in the marketplace. Senator Coghlan understands such competition very well and I am sure he agrees with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a blurring between the client and the product designer and producer. We have decided to deal with it through the disclosure regulations <Col N="547" /> and we are confident we will remove that grey area and ensure there is a sustainable product with absolute transparency to consumers.</P>

      <P>In page 25, line 36, after &ldquo;appeal to&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;an arbitrator appointed by the Minister and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, it is envisaged that there might be a need for an arbitrator and there is provision for one to deal with situations where a broker may believe he is unjustly treated. I feel strongly that an appeal to the High Court should be the last resort and, accordingly, this amendment provides for an arbitrator to be appointed by the Minister. It makes good sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment from Senator Coghlan is to provide intermediaries with an avenue of appeal to an arbitrator as an alternative to the court in respect of conditions imposed by the Central Bank. These conditions apply equally to fully authorised firms as well as those firms in a transitional period until they are fully authorised. In other words, the Central Bank has an option, through the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to allow these companies to become authorised firms, and there is also a transitional period. We all have to crawl before we walk. We get an opportunity of coming into the marketplace and subsequently we become fully authorised.</P>
      <P>The conditions that may be imposed are in place to protect consumers. Experience has shown that the power to make such conditions is, unfortunately, necessary from time to time to protect clients. The purpose of these provisions is to ensure equality of treatment as between firms that are authorised and those that stand authorised and are therefore free to transact business pending the acceptance or rejection of their application to become authorised firms. It is then reasonable that both types of firms should be subject to the same conditions. We would not want somebody to see an opportunity to make a killing over a short period, during which period they were not authorised but stood authorised. They could collect a lot of money from many gullible people and may head for the Bahamas or somewhere else with it. We would have a serious situation on our hands, so it is important that there is absolute equity and that nobody is given an opportunity to escape the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These conditions are already imposed by the Central Bank, under the Investment Intermediaries Act, and it is important that we continue to maintain the consistency through the Insurance <Col N="548" /> Bill. Consequently, is oth liom nach mbeidh mé in ann a leasú seo a ghlacadh.</P>

We would have to create a new system. Who would be the arbitrator? How many people would be needed to run that office? It is something that would be unwise and unnecessary to create. To return to what Senator Coghlan said, as time evolves it may be proven that we need to go down this road and if that is the case, perhaps it is something we could consider in the future.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay matters, and I am sure the Minister is pleased that Senator Coghlan has once again used his undoubted logic in this area. Am I right in saying &ndash; Senator Coghlan would have expertise in this regard &ndash; that the main thrust of the objection of the Professional Insurance Brokers Association is based on cost and that it is not necessarily about the principle of this section? It is about the fact that they will have to appeal a court decision to the High Court. Will the Minister indicate whether he believes that this concern is valid? On my reading, the insurance brokers' proposal, as so well enunciated by my colleague, Senator Coghlan, is based on cost, not necessarily on an ideological objection to the existence of this law.</P>

      <P>Is it expensive? Taking this argument to its natural conclusion, if an appeal is launched against someone falling below the statutory obligations of an intermediary and if they have to appeal to the High Court, can the Minister indicate whether there are valid concerns, as expressed by the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, that such a burden would prove to be too prohibitive and may result in the intermediary not only going out of business but having his or her livelihood threatened as a result of incurring enormous legal costs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had the arbitrator, the right to go to court would still exist. We can avoid all that because investment intermediaries, people in the insurance area, would be in contact with the Central Bank, and the Central Bank would be in contact with them, and it is only when that contact has broken down that action would be taken. The Central Bank would be a little like the Companies Office. The person would be notified of the transgression and given an opportunity to respond, and if he or she responds positively, his or her file is closed and everything is in order. If the person does not respond the Central Bank would have no option but to proceed down the courts line. If the person responds, the Central Bank would give the person an opportunity of producing the extra information required to fulfil the statutory criteria that is necessary to hold the right to operate in the particular area of activity. Consequently, I am confident, from my experience of dealing with the Central Bank over the years, that court would be a last resort. Court should be a last resort at all times and we hope that the number of occasions that will arise will be few. Obviously, depending on the gravity of the offence, some cases may be for the District Court while others may be for the Circuit Court. The appeals would be to the superior court, so again costs would come into it but we hope that will be in few cases rather than in many.</P>

I understand what Deputy Coghlan is trying to achieve but I am not sure that the Central Bank could be regarded as an independent arbitrator in this case. That is Senator Coghlan's concern.

When I stood up earlier I intended to say that the Central Bank would be the arbitrator, in other words, it would act in an environment of arbitration, but it will be the regulator and it will have to be fair to everybody, although, by and large, it has been fair over the years. Before we go down the road of appointing an arbitrator &ndash; I accept Senator Coghlan's sincerity in this matter &ndash; we would have to have a thorough review of the legislation we are proposing here to ensure that all analogous situations would be covered. If it was proven that there was difficulty or friction with the regulator over a period of three, four or five years, we would have to examine that, but as of now it would be foolish to create a dual option when we will have a new regulatory environment under the Central Bank in which there will have to be trust and communication before anybody contemplates litigation. I am confident this can be addressed over time but it is not necessary to insert that caveat at this stage.</P>

      <P>In page 25, line 52, after &ldquo;or approve&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the insertion of &lsquo;and such supervisory authority shall further ensure that all such registers are also published by electronic means'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> These amendments seek to bring a long-standing legislative practice into line with advances in technology and stated Government policy on using information technology to conduct the nation's business. This has been policy for some time.</P>
    <P>The long-standing legislative practice concerns ensuring that certain information is, by law, open and available to the public. The word &ldquo;available&rdquo; is important. Long before the Freedom of Information Act, the need was recognised in many Acts to underpin the public's right to certain information. One mechanism for achieving this was by requiring State bodies to publish annual accounts and in this House I have sought to ensure they do so speedily. Since I started asking this question in 1993 most legislation includes a time limit within which such reports must be published.</P>
    <P>Another objective was to require the State or other bodies to keep a register of particular information and to make that register open for inspection by the public. The need for keeping such registers continues but the means of doing so have changed. When registers were first introduced, it went without saying they had to be kept at one physical location and that if members of the public wanted to inspect the register they had to go to that location. As a result, the place of inspection was limited in practice but so was the timing. Given that registers are normally kept in an office it was unreasonable to expect it to be possible to view them day and night, so they were open for inspection only during normal business hours.</P>
    <P>Limitations of place or time no longer need apply as a result of new technology. Through electronic publishing the location at which the information is inspected is no longer limited. Similarly, electronic publishing makes information available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year. Access is further facilitated by the fact that neither the act of publishing information nor accessing it on the part of the public is expensive, rather it is very cheap compared with other methods.</P>
    <P>Whatever legislation specifies that a register of information should be made available to the public should also specify that the register be published by electronic means. Not to do so would be to place an unnecessary barrier between citizens and the information and there is no basis on which that can be justified.</P>
    <P>I made these arguments two weeks ago on the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill. The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, accepted my argument and amended the Bill. I made the case that if someone in Killybegs wished to see information on the register and was interested in what was happening in Dunmore East he or she would have had to go to Dublin to look at the information if it was not available <Col N="552" /> electronically. The Minister recognised and accepted this point and I hope the Minister of State will do so with regard to this Bill. This is particularly the case as it is Government policy to do as much of the State's business as possible through the use of information technology. The case stands for itself, it is accepted policy and I urge the Minister of State to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn makes a good case and I have given much consideration to this amendment. We have discussed this amendment in the Department and in the House and I have listened to the case made by the Senators which has much merit.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 seeks to require the supervisory authority to publish the register of investment business firms electronically. This is a sensible proposal. The present provisions of the 1995 Act permit the authority to so publish the lists. I understand it is proposed to publish the lists on the Central Bank's website in the near future. Thus, in practice, Senator Quinn's point will have been met.</P>
      <P>There is a difficulty in compelling the supervisory authority to publish such lists because of the risk of inaccuracies which are beyond the supervisor's, that is the Central Bank's, control. For example, a producer may fail to inform the supervisory authority of the discontinuance of an appointment. In other words, someone on the list may hold an appointment on the electronic system but technically and legally that appointment could have been discontinued and the authority may not have been notified. This could create some difficulties for me.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 40 seeks to require product producers to publish lists of their appointed investment product intermediaries electronically. I am confident that most product producers would be in a position to do so, particularly with the assistance of their representative associations. Nevertheless because I am anxious to encourage as many insurers as possible to compete in the Irish market, I am reluctant to impose conditions beyond those strictly necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given much consideration to this matter. I do not wish to agree to the amendments only to <Col N="553" /> find myself in a legal conflict on Report Stage. I propose to examine these amendments in detail before Report Stage when I will accommodate them if possible.</P>

      <P>Section 25(6) of the 1995 Act defines an investment product intermediary. Those so defined are required to go through a formal process of authorisation. This amendment seeks to make such a process of authorisation unnecessary in the case of two types of tied agent.</P>
      <P>The first category comprises tied insurance agents for whom an undertaking takes full and unconditional responsibility. Since the authorised undertaking is prepared to take that responsibility, the consumer can deal confidently with such intermediaries.</P>
      <P>The second category covers credit institutions dealing as tied agents. Since credit institutions are already subject to an authorisation process, a second one would be redundant, unnecessary and unfair.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 26, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)A life insurance broker will operate as a &lsquo;defined' activity investment product Intermediary within the meaning of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, section 4(2), paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>).</P>
      <P>(ii)A life insurance broker may give advice in the course of carrying on his/her profession or business where the giving of such advice is a necessary part of providing &lsquo;best advice' to his/her clients during the normal course of carrying on his/her profession or business.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment which contains two parts is, first, to get rid of that appalling acronym RAIPI, which we all agreed we would like to do on Second Stage. It is to change the term from restricted activity investment product intermediary to defined activity investment intermediary. The word &ldquo;defined&rdquo; is more appropriate and it makes more sense because the insurance broker's activities are &ldquo;defined&rdquo; but they cannot or should not be &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;, as this is in conflict with a broker's independence and I would strongly wish to maintain that. We want to provide for a level playing pitch, an idea to which we all subscribe, and that is also behind the thrust of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the second part of the amendment, an independent insurance broker must be able to continue to give advice to his or her clients as he or she does at present. I commend Senator Mooney's earlier remarks on another section regarding the independence of the insurance broker. We all subscribe to that and, like me, the Minister of State, in view of his own past, would also appreciate that. We do not want to lower the standards in any way but it is vitally important regarding the provision of a level playing pitch that we do nothing to infringe the independence of the independent broker. The independent <Col N="555" /> broker is an important person in the community, particularly in provincial towns and rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been put to me that this Bill will impinge on clients getting the full range of independent advice from insurance brokers. They will need to choose between being restricted activity investment product intermediaries or fully authorised investment product intermediaries. If they are in the first group of restricted activity investment product intermediaries, they will not be able to give advice on the products of companies for which they are not agents. Even if a client asks whether another form of insurance might be better they will not be in a position to give advice on it even if the brokers will be paid for this advice. Surely this worsens the position for the client.</P>
      <P>If all brokers are to become fully authorised investment product intermediaries they will need to invest far more in what they are doing. They will need quarterly management accounts and clients will need to pay considerably higher fees to them.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has informed those people who contacted me about this issue that the restricted activity investment product intermediaries will be allowed to give advice only regarding products from product providers for whom they hold agencies. Surely this is not in their clients' best interests.</P>

      <P>I support both parts of the amendment. The Minister agreed on Second Stage that the acronym RAIPI is undesirable and he was interested and anxious to find an alternative. Senator Coghlan has provided an alternative here, using the term &ldquo;defined&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;. It does seem to accurately cover the meaning and, therefore, I would support the change.</P>
      <P>The concept of independent advice should be retained. It is desirable with regard to general financial advice rather than a restriction. The elements of the amendment are worth accepting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 29 and 36 seek to provide an alternative to the current title, restricted activity investment product intermediary, and to address the issue of giving advice. On the first issue, it might be useful to recall the thrust of the provisions, which transfer regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries from a system of self-regulation, which we all agree is no longer acceptable, to regulation as a result of this Bill by the Central Bank under the system which already applies to all other types of intermediaries. Therefore, we are levelling the playing field in that regard. A separate regulatory category for insurance brokers is, therefore, not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some concerns have been expressed about the term &ldquo;restricted activity investment product intermediaries&rdquo;, commonly known as RAIPI. <Col N="556" /> This term was introduced by the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and has been used since then as a result of being in that Act by intermediaries in the wider investment industry who deal in a restricted range of investment products, in other words, they have chosen to operate only in this range of investment products.</P>
    <P>These individuals and companies have incurred expense in setting up their systems using this title. To change the title at this late stage would impose added expenses on them. It is worth noting that there have not been complaints from them about the title. Therefore, while I have no objection in principle to a change in this title, I do not propose at this stage to accept amendments to alter the title in this legislation. A much wider consultation process would be necessary. In the event after such a process it was decided to revisit this title it could be addressed in other legislation, such as the Finance Bill. In other words, there is nothing to stop us considering this in the Finance Bill. As a matter of fact, it would be the place to change it because it originated in the Department of Finance, through the Central Bank. If it is to be changed, it should change it. I must maintain the consistency in this legislation with the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>The system of supervision proposed here does not seek to regulate what may be said between an intermediary and his or her client but rather what an intermediary may sell to a client. In other words, we are not going to impinge on what they say to one another but the regulations lay down parameters within the status under which they are authorised and they decide to go into that structure.</P>
    <P>The proposed system envisages that intermediaries may offer for sale only the products of producers from whom they hold an appointment. This is to ensure that the consumer may purchase an investment product confident that the intermediary is acting within his or her area of expertise when selling this particular product. In other words, the consumer will now know that this is the area in which the intermediary operates, the product has the full support of the undertaking which created the product and this intermediary is a professional competent to deal in and market this product and to take an investment.</P>
    <P>If the intermediary believes that his or her competence goes beyond the existing appointments, he or she can apply to the Central Bank for a change of status. It is a matter of an application and conforming to the regulations and criteria. If they conform, they have the confidence and the capital adequacy, they put themselves forward and there is no limit to what they can do within the financial environment in which they operate. To do this, the person would have to demonstrate a wider competence and the existence of financial resources adequate to protect the consumer, popularly known as capital adequacy. Clearly, the extent to which intermedi<Col N="557" /> aries may offer products must be related to their knowledge of the range of products available in the marketplace. Furthermore, the consumer must be in a position to pay for such products confident in the knowledge that the intermediary is financially solvent.</P>
    <P>It would need much further consideration and consultation and it would be unwise for us to make a change in an insurance Bill when this is a financial situation referring to the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. If we need to change it, there is the Finance Bill and the Senator can test that again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from where the Minister of State is coming and the desire of the Government machinery and bureaucracy, if one likes, to maintain the line he has outlined. It goes against every grain, every fibre of my being to accept a restriction. That is why I used the word &ldquo;defined&rdquo;. Equally, I cannot accept a limitation on the independence of professional people doing a good job serving their communities, which they have done for so long. These are people who are not only professional but who are bonded, have indemnification and all the necessary insurance to cover them in these situations. I cannot accept this. The Minister of State said he would like to do business with us and I always like to do business with him, but sadly on this occasion I cannot. I must press this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said he is anxious to protect people from brokers who may be acting beyond their professional competence and financial abilities. I suppose <i>caveat emptor</i> comes into things sometimes and people may want to get advice. It is rather restrictive that they cannot say someone is an agent for A, B, C, D and E, but that they rather like the look of F.</P>
      <P>It seems unfortunate that the broker will have to apply to be in a different category before they can give this advice. After all, the person will pay them for the advice. It is not as if they are going in and something is being stuffed down their throats. I would have thought it was very restrictive but the Minister of State's knowledge of the insurance industry is greater than mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Coghlan, I have great difficulty with this. In many ways, it seems to go back to the old days of protectionism. I wonder if the Competition Authority has expressed a view in regard to this. When I started in business first, the supplier was very strict about what one could do with his products and whether one could sell somebody else's product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember in the old days a petrol station would have four or five different pumps. I do not think anybody remembers that now. When one pulled into a petrol station, one could decide whether to take Esso, Shell or Texaco. In Britain, they have just passed laws doing away with the <Col N="558" /> tied house where the supplier of the beer would not allow anybody else's product to be supplied.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there is a good comparison here but Senator Coghlan made the case, which was supported by Senator Henry, that someone who holds a licence is able to say they are licensed for something but that they would like to recommend or comment on something else. Maybe I have misunderstood this but it seems to be like the very old-fashioned restrictions on trade to protect those who are already there. I may be wrong and would be happy if the Minister of State corrected me on that. The amendments tabled by Senator Coghlan are worthy of support and I do not quite understand the old-fashioned, out-of-date restrictive clauses that would come about if these amendments were not accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from where the Senators are coming and would like to be able to accommodate them. Of course, the right of the individual is paramount. These individuals, these professional people, have decided on the status they want, whether as an agent or a broker and whether they are restricted under the existing legislation and the rules laid down. The Investor Compensation Act, 1995, is a very fair Act and some of these people only have to pay £200 per annum for their bond to the Central Bank. The consumer is protected.</P>
      <P>The parameters within which they can operate are to protect the consumer from those who in the past, as we all know, took a lot of money from people and did not invest it where they said they would and who gave the advice across the board. People trusted them, the money vanished and they vanished with it to a foreign shore. Based on that, we have to be absolutely certain that the rules are clear. People opt into the system and must meet certain criteria. They must have a certain competence to deal with the products they are purveying or selling to the public. If they have further resources and capital adequacy, they can move up the value chain, have a broad option and sell everything they wish. I think it is fair.</P>
      <P>We are not restrictive, we are inclusive. We are giving everyone a chance, including the small person coming into the market to compete with experienced people. This is a good thing and we want that competition and to be able to give different types of advice at local level. I fully accept what Senator Coghlan said about the importance of the insurance broker in the provincial town. They are highly respected and trusted people who provide an outstanding service. However, we must ensure that those dealing in this area meet the criteria laid down lest the State be asked to carry the can for the innocent consumer.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister of State, these people have not decided but rather this Bill is boxing them in. It cuts against the grain and totally goes against the provision of a level <Col N="559" /> playing pitch. This Bill favours the big player in the marketplace. The Minister of State means well and I do not want to take from his bona fides. My reading of this and my contacts with these professional people tell me that this is the right approach and I am absolutely sincere and genuine about it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I compliment Senator Mooney and Senator Quinn. Senator Mooney put it very eloquently earlier when he spoke about not placing a limitation on the independence of an independent broker. That is what this does and the reason I tabled the second part of this amendment. Sadly, I must press this amendment.</P>

      <P>The language of this section reflects the original drafting of the Insurance Act, 1989. However, the intention behind this provision in the 1989 Act was somewhat different. The intention in this Bill, in inserting this provision into the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, is to ensure that receipts must issue when, but only when, there has been a payment of some kind. Accordingly, the amendment to lines 15 to 17 makes it clear that a receipt is to be issued where a payment has been made.</P>

      <P>This is a very important area. It takes into account the many requests made in this House on Second Stage. Senators will be aware that I gave a commitment on Second Stage in this House and on Report Stage in Dáil Éireann to examine the provisions of this Bill regarding cash handling by certain intermediaries. I am satisfied that the amendments I am now proposing represent a balanced compromise, meeting the legitimate concerns of such intermediaries while safeguarding the interests of consumers.</P>
      <P>This amendment will permit non-life insurance intermediaries to handle cash. In the case of life insurance intermediaries other than tied insurance agents, they will be permitted to handle cash provided the circumstances in section 25G apply. This will safeguard consumers by limiting cash handling to circumstances where the insurer is standing behind the intermediary.</P>
      <P>Section 25G provides that a premium paid to an intermediary shall be treated as having been paid to an undertaking when it is in respect of a renewal invited by the undertaking or a new policy proposal accepted by the undertaking. Earlier amendments Nos. 32 and 33 copperfasten all payments. In the case of tied insurance agents, the consumer is safeguarded because the insurer is responsible for any act or omission of its tied insurance agent in respect of any matter relating to a contract of insurance offered or issued by the undertaking with which the tied agency agreement related.</P>

      <P>In page 33, before section 29, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>29.&ndash;Section 31 of the Act of 1995 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6)(<i>b</i>) (inserted by section 61 of the Investor Compensation Act, 1998) of the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" />&lsquo;(<i>c</i>) Notwithstanding paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of this subsection, the</P>
    <P>supervisory authority may dispense with the requirement to ensure the publication of a notice of discontinuance where the investment product intermediary satisfies it that such publication may be detrimental to the orderly and good conduct of its business or may undermine the confidence of clients in the investment product intermediary or for any other reason.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This relates to a discontinuance notice. There are many legitimate reasons that a broker may decide to discontinue a line of business, such as illness or retirement. It may be a commercial decision to concentrate on the core business. Regardless of the wording of such a notice, it will be misconstrued as wrongdoing in rural Ireland. The Minister of State knows this and he agreed with me on this matter on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, it is likely that these notices will appear frequently due to the number of brokers who will now be regulated under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. This will take away from the impact of the notice which is necessary where wrongdoing occurs. My amendment suggests that this notice should only be published in cases of suspension of a broker due to non-compliance with the supervisory authority's regulations. The Minister of State knows in his heart and soul that the amendment makes sense.</P>

      <P>I am not sure about my heart but my head is different. The purpose of the amendment is to dispense with the need to publish discontinuance notices with the agreement of the supervisor. I understand the sincerity and motive behind the Senator's amendment. Discontinuance of appointments may occur for ordinary reasons but notices may give the wrong impression of the intermediary. However, the 1995 Act requires the intermediary to publish the notice himself or herself. The product producer is only required to do so when the intermediary fails to do it.</P>
      <P>For example, if I was an intermediary and I do not publish, the undertaking for which I was an intermediary is obliged to publish the fact that I have discontinued operations. Accordingly, on the one hand, the intermediaries have control over the content of the notice but, on the other, the purpose of the requirement to publish is to inform consumers locally, regionally and nationally. Providing such information for consumers is obviously of overriding importance. Accordingly, I regret that I cannot accept the amendment &ndash; this system favours the individual intermediary.</P>

      <P>Senators will recall that I gave a commitment to re-examine this matter in the light of the debate on Second Stage in the Seanad. The existing provision excludes travel agents and tour operators from the scope of Part IV of the 1995 Act because they are already subject to a regime of authorisation and bonding under the Transport Act, 1982. I cannot interfere with that in this legislation.</P>
      <P>However, in light of the excellent arguments made in this and the other House, I have decided to provide that tour operators will be subject to the requirement to issue receipts when acting as insurance intermediaries to ensure equity in the system and to satisfy consumers that they have paid for and been given insurance. They will have a receipt for it. I ask the House to agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that I have raised the issue of travel insurance previously. He has brought travel operators within the scope of the Bill in terms of limited transparency. They must now provide proof that one has taken out an insurance policy. However, that is not the main problem and I hope the Minister of State will consider, or ask his officials to consider, the operation of travel insurance.</P>
      <P>I hope he will also come to the conclusion in the absence of arguments to the contrary that the conditions attached to a significant amount of travel insurance are not in the best interests of the consumer. This issue has almost become an obsession with me but nobody appears to be taking the ball and running with it. It is being kicked around between various Departments and people are either afraid of taking on the travel industry or they are not interested in making it a priority. In the context of the Minister of State's obvious commitment, which has been proven again during this debate, to protect consumer rights, I urge him to ask his officials to consider the workings of travel insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth putting on the record the startling fact that salmon stocks in the Atlantic are 15% of what they were 25 years ago. I accept there may be more reasons than overfishing. I have often said in this House that we are doing things to the planet the consequences of which we do not understand. I have spent a lot of time warning the House about the favourite myth, namely, that there is no scientific evidence that something does something. That means we cannot prove a negative, therefore, we assume it does not happen. The fact that we have not proved that various environmental effects or risks have damaged fish stocks does not mean it has not happened, it means we cannot prove cause and effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that various environmental factors, including acid rain, may have done some damage but it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the single greatest reason salmon stocks have <Col N="566" /> dropped is overfishing and incorrect fishing. At what stage, in terms of depletion of stocks, will we reach a critical mass below which it is unlikely that salmon stocks will be able to reproduce and return to a strong position? I have heard it said about other fish stocks, such as herring and cod, that if the figures decrease further they would not be able to reproduce, even if negative factors were eliminated, because of the number of injured offspring. The figure cannot be much less than 15%. How close are we to that critical mass below which it is unlikely that fish stocks will be replenished, even if we do everything right?</P>
    <P>One of the remarkable things about inland fisheries is the degree to which there is a sense of ownership by all the partners. It is time we moved away from the idea of private ownership of inland fisheries, if that still exists. It is a dated concept which bears no relationship to reality. The people who own it have no responsibility for it other than protecting their own economic interest, selling it off or hiring it out to someone else to use irresponsibly. There is a case for social ownership or control of this resource. If compensation must be paid, let it be done so we can move on. There is no possibility of a proper policy as long as we have relics of the old aristocracy claiming ownership of a fisheries resource to which they have contributed nothing and which happens to be an accident of history or worse.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I am concerned about the on-the-spot fines. As we have learned in driving, while the £50 fine concentrates the mind slightly, one of the great things about it from the point of view of the individual is that as long as he or she keeps paying them, there is no question of a district justice or judge asking the prosecuting garda about any previous convictions. There is no cumulative effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know points will be accumulated on a person's driving licence. There is a case for a similar cumulative effect for on-the-spot fines in this area. Otherwise, people will chance their arm and pay the £50 because it is simpler and does not involve a record. Although they will lose out, it will not deter anyone who believes their economic interests are still better served by chancing their arm and paying the £50 when they get caught. It will concentrate our minds if we believe we will lose our licence if we break the law by driving too fast. There is a case for a similar cumulative effect in this area.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued that I must produce a licence on demand if I go fishing for salmon. It would be regarded as an outrage to demand a driver's licence, although there is provision in the law to do it. I do not understand why drivers should not be required to produce their licences on demand. If salmon fishermen can do it, everyone else can as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> I am interested in the practice of enforcement and how the Minister believes this will happen. It cannot be easy to enforce such regulations. While the individuals who enforce the regulations have the force of law behind them, they do not have the authority of a member of the Garda Síochána. I know there are well documented cases of physical intimidation. How many people will be available to enforce the regulations and what is the ratio between them and the numbers of people expected to be involved in salmon fishing? It is important to sort out how many anglers will be involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said something which is not a reproach to the Minister but to ourselves. In this, as in a number of other areas, we have let things catch up on us. What has been said about the deteriorating quality of our water and our fisheries resources is true. Apart from their economic value, which is important, there is a degree to which this is an issue about conserving part of the diversity of our ecological heritage. That a country whose scéalaíocht rotates around the extraordinary imagined or real powers of the salmon would allow its wild salmon, which goes so far back into our mythology and is associated with the bradán feasa, to be wiped out would be a retrograde step for all of us.</P>
    <P>Some 15% is a big reduction. We should develop the angling and wild salmon industries as far as we can. However, in terms of our diversity and heritage, it is to a degree a betrayal of our heritage to allow something so precious and, as Senator Quinn said, a considerable economic asset to die. I hope we will proceed in this area.</P>
    <P>I am glad the legislation was introduced in this House. I hope the Minister mentions in his reply the possibility of a cumulative way of identifying repeat offenders. I know there will be paperwork but unless there is a penalty associated with multiple offences, many people will keep chancing their arm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill, which I support. The concept of tagging salmon and trout is not new as it was done in the past by the Department under the Salmon Research Institute. That institute is now part of the Marine Institute and it provides clear information on the need for conservation and restocking and expertise on measuring the stocks in the sea and those caught. However, until such time as we have a good research and auditing system, we will not be able to make plans to deal with the conservation of a species as important as our wild salmon and sea trout.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good Bill. It is innovative in its attempt to deal with a situation that has many aspects and involves many different sectors and traditions. It proposes a tactical approach to dealing with the responsibilities of the Department. The Bill will not entail substantial costs to the Exchequer, which is welcome. It will improve the efficient running and effectiveness of the fishing manage<Col N="568" /> ment sections within the fisheries boards, including the election of people to the boards and the extension of time to existing board members. That is a worthwhile and important aspect.</P>
    <P>Some of the finest Irish fisheries have been destroyed by over-indulgence, lack of management and the winner-takes-all approach. It has resulted in the destruction of something that has been in existence for generations, especially along the western seaboard. Those that have been managed well have survived but those that were plundered have never recovered. It is a strong indictment of us and our responsibilities towards the seas.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the National Salmon Commission and the recommendations for dealing with the overall management of salmon. Proper catchment management plans must be applied to estuaries, which are currently managed by a combination of different sectors. Through the salmon research agencies the Marine Institute has the opportunity to engage in management along the western seaboard. The balanced overall development, which has been a feature in Lough Foyle and in some places in Scotland, needs to be extended to all the different fisheries. Unless a proper catchment management plan is enforced we will not be in a position to provide the necessary protection for the long-term sustainability of fishing.</P>
    <P>Catchment management strategies have been talked about and some have been introduced. They provide the only hope for a proper long-term planned approach to fishing. It is difficult to know how to proceed. Fishermen will say that stocks in the seas are so low that it is unviable to fish. On the other hand, large boats with substantial quotas have been profitable and effective, which is right and proper.</P>
    <P>There is a serious need to look at the whole management aspect and the opportunity for young people involved in inshore fisheries. A quota similar to what is provided in agriculture should be made available. Surplus quotas which are for sale should be bought by the Department in a planned way to give young men who have a genuine interest, live in the areas and are prepared to put up their own money the opportunity to fish legally. It should not be done on the basis of big numbers, but as part of a managed approach. Bord Iascaigh Mhara has to an extent failed to provide such an opportunity for some young men who are or would like to be full-time fishermen in a sustainable way, not using large boats that would clean out areas.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on the substantial allocation of moneys to the small ports and harbours throughout the country. It is very worthwhile and contributes to sustainable development in terms of coastal and catchment management and in giving young fishermen the opportunity to use reasonable landing facilities. Part of the funding has been allocated under the national development plan, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The time has come for the State to be responsible for fisheries because private ownership has not worked. There is not sufficient ongoing investment, nor is there enough participation. At the same time the State must provide substantial resources for policing and managing rivers and lakes in private ownership. These are very valuable assets. At one time very little value was placed on the private ownership of fisheries. Some of the finest trout and salmon fishing in my constituency is owned by people who never had any financial stake in or commitment to the area. It is time the people were responsible for determining the future of these fisheries and for managing them in a proper and sustainable way.</P>
    <P>While this is not covered by the terms of the Bill, will the Minister indicate the progress made on the shellfish industry, which is experiencing difficulties at present? There is uncertainty in the industry, which is another aspect of the management of the fisheries and which needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the commitment by the Minister and the Minister of State to the fishing industry. It is important that the legislation is enacted and that we become involved in catchment management and in ascertaining where the future lies for fishing industry stocks to ensure that fishermen are sustained for the future.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne): I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions to this debate. In letting us know of their experiences, they have illustrated the valuable role the Seanad plays in the Oireachtas and in the formation of legislation. The support for the two main elements of the Bill, the wild salmon tagging scheme and the system of on-the-spot fines, is most welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said I may be setting my sights too low in raising the status of wild Atlantic salmon as a premium food item. It is my firm intention to enable the wild salmon industry to achieve its maximum potential on the markets at home and abroad. A comparison was made with traceability in the beef market. There is already an example of traceability in the market for farmed Irish salmon, which is operated by the salmon farming industry. All farmed salmon are traceable at the level of the packing box. The box is labelled showing the farm origin and the cage numbers.</P>
    <P>Farmed Irish salmon is a high quality product produced to a high standard. It benefits from the clean environmental image of Ireland. It is with great pride that I note the status and esteem in which it is held, especially in France where we have niche markets. It is my intention to ensure that the wild salmon sector moves towards a similar level of marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>The national salmon stocks remain vulnerable and I am maintaining all the conservation measures currently in place, including measures on the length of the fishing season, the weekly <Col N="570" /> close times, night-time fishing and the use of baits. I am encouraging the voluntary practice of catch and release by anglers, particularly in the case of spring salmon which is especially vulnerable to over exploitation in individual catchments. I also welcome the fact that owners of private fisheries, which include the fisheries boards, operate bag limits to prevent over-exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1999, provides that the regional boards shall encourage and organise, together with the inland fisheries interests, the voluntary development of catchment management plans. The Act provides that the boards shall have regard to the distinctive circumstances which pertain in each of the catchment systems. The particular role of angling clubs and associations in the sustainable management of fisheries is also recognised in the Act and regional boards are obliged to have regard to this role in the performance of their functions under the Act.</P>
    <P>I have provided for this year and next year substantial extra funding for catchment management projects in the regions. This year alone, £2 million of additional capital expenditure is being channelled through the regional boards. Many of these projects are being undertaken with the direct involvement of local clubs and organisations. The tagging schemes, which will commence on 1 January 2001, are in addition to the fish tagging programmes carried out by the Marine Institute. The Marine Institute has been operating a tagging programme for live fish with a view to obtaining data, principally on the life cycle of the fish. The new carcase tagging scheme has, as its primary objective, the provision of information on the annual catches of salmon by all sectors. As I stated, the scheme has been the subject of intensive consultation with the National Salmon Commission. The commercial fishing sector is fully behind the scheme, which will commence on 1 January 2001. All tags are made of plastic and are designed to fit easily through the gill opening and the mouth of the fish and to be snapped shut. The tags are designed for easy and simple use. The representatives of the commercial sector in the commission have examined the practical implications of tagging the fish and are satisfied that the scheme is workable.</P>
    <P>Currently there are two schemes of voluntary set-aside for salmon which are being co-funded by my Department. One of the schemes, which is on the Munster Blackwater, includes a group of draft net and salmon trout. One of the principal advantages of this scheme is that it reduces the level of netting in the areas of the River Blackwater in which salmon are particularly vulnerable to netting. The regional boards have been asked to encourage the development of similar schemes at catchment level, which are based on local contributions and value for money considerations and are part of other catchment-based devel<Col N="571" /> opments such as work on spawning beds and so on.</P>
    <P>The option of buy-outs presents significantly greater complexities than set-aside. One must always keep in mind that the objective is to ensure that more salmon enter our rivers to spawn and thus ensure sustainable development of the species. It is not necessarily the case that a buy-out of any individual commercial fisherman will result in an overall reduction in exploitation of the sector.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their welcome for the on-the-spot fine provisions in the Bill. We will have an opportunity to examine the matter in more detail on Committee Stage. I would like to clarify, however, that the provisions of the Bill will allow for a comprehensive scheme of on-the-spot fines for fishery offences in the area of inland fisheries. Some of the offences to be covered are specifically provided for in the Schedule to the Bill. However, additional offences will have to be provided for by means of regulations. The regional fisheries boards are fully supportive of this innovation and the money generated can be used by the boards to fund their general expenditure. The new system will be operated by the boards as part of their normal duties in relation to the protection of fisheries. This is an efficiency measure which will allow the boards to enforce fisheries legislation in a more efficient way. From the point of view of the alleged offender, it remains the case that such a person has the option of proving his innocence in court. Payment of an on-the-spot fine is an option he can choose to take to avoid the possibility of a prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for penalties in respect of a contravention of tagging regulations generally. The maximum fines on summary conviction range from £500 for a first offence up to £1,000 for a third offence in a period of 12 months. For more serious offences such as tagging an unlawfully caught fish, forging a tag or a log book or providing false information, the Bill provides for a maximum fine of £1,500 or up to three months imprisonment. Senator Ryan spoke about the cumulative effect, but if a person is caught and fined often enough, the bank manager will remind him of the cumulative effect. It is an interesting suggestion, however, and one that we will certainly consider. Living where I do, I am particularly concerned about the current level of stock. The purpose of the tagging programme is to inform policy decision-makers with hard data on the catches of salmon by all sectors. Tagging and the upgraded national fish counter programme will provide real information of the kind the Senator requested.</P>
    <P>The fisheries officers have the option of issuing an on-the-spot fine. If the officer is dealing with a persistent offender, he or she may choose not to issue an on-the-spot fine and institute a prosecution in the normal way. The on-the-spot fine <Col N="572" /> system will be operated by the board as part of its normal fisheries protection duties. The boards fully support the introduction of on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Chambers for his contribution during which he asked me a specific question on the current shellfish difficulties. While the Bill does not deal with that matter, I would like to take the opportunity to inform the Senator that I am concerned about the difficulty in the shellfish industry, particularly the biotoxin programme which has not been functioning to my satisfaction. Indeed, since mid-August I have held 18 high powered meetings to resolve the matter and I am happy the Marine Institute has been instructed to increase its number of officers for both testing and collecting of data. I have instructed my officials to carry out in open bays twice weekly testing as opposed to once weekly testing and to ensure that bays that are closed are consistently tested to determine if they can be open because as the Senator knows well, the current year has been particularly difficult and sales of mussels are not as good as they might have been.</P>
    <P>The customer is the most important element of this chain. I am concerned that the Food Safety Authority and I should sing from the same hymn sheet. Working together, the Marine Institute, the Department, BIM and the Food Safety Authority should be able to put in place by the end of the year a programme which will stand the test of time and will probably be regarded as an example to be followed by our European counterparts.</P>
    <P>I recently spent some time in New Zealand hoping to identify an early warning system which would be beneficial to shellfish farmers. We have a model in mind which I hope to put in place by 1 January 2001. Such a system will save farmers money as they will know not to harvest in a particular week but to wait until a bay is open. I hope this answers the Senator's question. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas a ghabháil libh go léir.</P>

      <P>I move: </P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to resolve the housing crisis and, in particular, for its failure to address the scandal of homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to the House for what he will agree is an extremely important debate on the housing crisis, <Col N="573" /> particularly homelessness. There is no doubt there is a housing crisis which is not being dealt with and which is growing by the day. There is also an unprecedented level of homelessness.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that housing is a social good. However, this view is clearly not shared by the Government which sees housing in a market and commodity mindset. We believe it is a fundamental requirement that good quality housing be available and accessible to as many people as possible and that every person has and should be considered to have a right to good quality, affordable housing appropriate to their needs. We would go as far as to suggest that this right be enshrined in the Constitution and, at the very minimum, in legislation.</P>
    <P>Housing has a particular relevance and significance for society. In light of this fact, market forces alone cannot be allowed to dictate its provision and price which they are doing to a great extent. We believe the State should intervene to ensure that in the interests of social justice and the common good, this right to good quality, affordable housing is assured for everyone who needs it and according to their needs.</P>
    <P>Land is one of the critical resources required for housing. For this reason, when the State intervenes on behalf of the community, such as in rezoning, planning permission or the provision of infrastructure by way of roads, sewerage and so on, this should not automatically result in significant and untaxed gains for landowners. However, these are not the principles which underpin the Government's housing policy.</P>
    <P>Housing is seen as a commodity by this Government. It regards housing as a market and, therefore, will not allow State intervention. This is particularly the view of the Progressive Democrats. We know that the house building industry is the commercial wing of Fianna Fáil and, as a result, it has been reluctant to intervene in the interests of house buyers. It has taken two failed Bacon reports for the Government finally to wake up to the need for intervention, as seen in the last legislation based on the Bacon report.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage of the planning Bill in the Dáil, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, admitted that a couple whose joint earnings were in the region of £40,000 could not afford to enter the housing market as first-time buyers. This situation is unprecedented in the history of the State. Home ownership, the aspiration of the vast majority of Irish people, is rapidly becoming, and has for many already become, an impossible dream. As a result, side by side with unprecedented economic prosperity, there is a crisis of home ownership and the exclusion of an increasing number of people from the aspiration to own their own homes.</P>
    <P>The inability to enter the housing market as home owners has left people exposed to the difficult area of renting accommodation from the <Col N="574" /> private sector. The Government's continuing failure to set up a structure to protect those in the private rented sector from exploitation, insecurity of tenure and so on, has added to the crisis.</P>
    <P>It is our contention that the housing crisis is at such a level that it threatens to undermine the economic prosperity which some would claim has caused it. The labour force shortage is regularly mooted as one of the potential threats to economic prosperity but is being exacerbated by the housing crisis. How can we expect to attract Irish people living abroad if they cannot afford to buy a house when they return, despite coming back to very good incomes? Similarly, how can we expect to attract foreign workers if they are unable to afford housing in the private rented sector and who more than often find, if they do manage to get rented accommodation, that they are unprotected and have no security in that accommodation?</P>
    <P>We are not suggesting this Government has single-handedly created the problem of rising house prices. This problem began before the Government took office but a few figures are worth citing. On average, the price of housing has gone up by £20,000 per year since this Government took office. In Dublin prices have risen by £30,000 per year. The average price of a family home when this Government took office was £84,000 but is now over £163,000. Figures indicate some stability in the past few months but this happened before and there is no reason to believe the price of houses will not continue to increase.</P>
    <P>In the same period, the number of applicants for local authority and social housing has increased from 26,000 to 50,000. If we accept that each application involves an average of three or more people, the figure becomes 150,000 people. This is a considerable figure by any standards and one which is not being tackled by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude is, &ldquo;Crisis? What crisis?&rdquo;  It is an attitude of denial. According to the Government, there is no crisis and over a considerable period of time the market will obviously meet the need. The market clearly has not met the need. Indeed, far from meeting the need, it has exacerbated the need.</P>
    <P>If we take the issue of land, for instance, in the first debates on this issue around the time of the first Bacon report, the issue was the release of land, the availability of land. It is clear that sufficient land is zoned and available for the development of residences but it simply is not being released. It is not being used but is being hoarded. This is finally recognised in the third Bacon report and the Government's response to it. Indeed the Labour Party supported the Government's moves to penalise those who were sitting on rezoned and serviced land, those who were effectively the investors in the market. However, it took the Government a long time to recognise that and despite the fact that it is nearly <Col N="575" /> six months since that legislation was enacted, there is no appreciable effect on the market, certainly from the point of view of those who are trying to enter the housing market.</P>
    <P>What should we be doing? Clearly the answer is that the Government must intervene for the reasons which I have set out. Housing cannot be seen just as a marketing commodity. That attitude has led to the current crisis. Clearly a number of interventions are necessary. I want to look at the need for a major initiative on, and a rapid increase in, local authority and social and voluntary housing. We all know from our experience as public representatives, particularly those of us who have experience as members of local authorities, that the social and voluntary housing project is extremely successful. There is local initiative and flexibility to meet the needs, particularly of those who, although they might qualify for the local authority housing lists, find themselves in a situation where they may never be housed. I am thinking particularly, for instance, of single people, returned emigrants and elderly people who will never be housed and who are reliant on the local authority.</P>
    <P>If this initiative is to take place, two things must be done. First, a national housing authority must be established. Clearly we are facing such an unprecedented need for house building and new dwellings that the need for serious intervention by a particular body, established with the specific purpose of driving and co-ordinating the provision of housing, must be taken on board. Our proposal is the establishment of a national housing authority which would be responsible, as other authorities are in other areas, for spearheading a plan to meet the need, estimated to be 500,000 new dwellings over the next ten years. One in every three houses which are needed by 2012, must be built over the next decade. Clearly that need will not be met, judging by the current pace of development. Therefore, it is critical that a single agency, with a single plan designed to meet this need, is established. Provision can no longer be left to the traditional sources of private house building and local authority housing. It simply will not work, hence the need for a single authority.</P>
    <P>On local authority and social housing, earlier this year the figure for applicants on local authority housing lists and various other forms of social housing, to which I referred earlier, was 50,000 &ndash; I would venture that that figure has increased and is closer to 60,000. Despite the fact that overall house construction has doubled in the past five or six years, the number in the local authority and voluntary housing sector has remained static. Clearly this need is not being met, despite the best efforts of the local authorities in this area and the popularity of voluntary and social housing programmes. It simply is not enough to meet the massive increase needed in <Col N="576" /> this area. Therefore, we propose a front-loaded programme for the construction of 50,000 local authority houses in this area.</P>
    <P>On the regulation of the housing market, as I stated, there is clearly a need for intervention, particularly in the private rented sector. My colleague, Senator Ryan, will deal with the area of homelessness which forms part of the motion. I commend the motion to the House and look forward to the debate here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. The issue of homelessness and, indeed, housing provision and how one deals with it is a classic example of the distinction between Boston and Berlin, which the Minister of State's leader so eloquently put on the record. In the United States one falls through the network and that proves one is a wimp and a failure, and that is what the Minister's party believes in. In the tradition for which we stand the belief is that those who fall through the net are the victims of an unfair society who deserve the resources of society to protect and defend them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's activities are in direct contradiction of the rhetoric of his party leader because he talks like a European social democrat while his party leader practises like a George Bush Republican. It is a contradiction which is increasingly being exposed to all of us.</P>
      <P>The document the Minister of State produced last May is a very commendable document. It is the best coherent strategy for dealing with homelessness which has been produced, and I accept that he produced it. However, he was three years in office before that document was produced. If that is our timescale to deal with a crisis, what do we do with the problems of society which are not crises?</P>
      <P>Let us be very clear. Living on the street or in a hostel or shelter is a crisis &ndash; the number of people in that position doubled between 1996 and 1999. It is a personal crisis for the individual and it is a collective crisis for a society which finds it acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have a stick with which to beat a Minister of State for the things he inherited, nor do I have a desire to defend things which happened prior to his term of office, but three years was too long to produce a strategy when all the issues were clear. For 20 years the entire voluntary sector was saying what needed to be done and, therefore, the issue which inhibited everything for so long, the issue of money, was the one issue which did not inhibit this Minister of State and the Government. It was about policy, strategy and implementation. We got the strategy last May and it is a good strategy, but the test of the strategy is implementation, which is astonishingly, offensively and painfully slow. It is astonishing that it took us until May this year to recognise that local authorities were play-acting with the issue of section 10 grants, that some people, in <Col N="577" /> the case of my own city, were paying as little as £6.50 a night and telling voluntary organisations and their members that the reason they could not pay more was that the Department of the Environment and Local Government would not agree to it. That was not true, but for years they were allowed to say things like that.</P>
    <P>Let me tell the House what has happened. One of the important recommendations on page 5 of the Minister of State's strategy is that local authorities and health boards in full partnership with the voluntary sector will draw up action plans. Cork Corporation had a few chats with the voluntary sector. They all made submissions and an action plan was then submitted to their members and approved without any further input from the voluntary sector and was sent to the Minister's Department. That was an action plan from the corporation. The Southern Health Board has been fooling around with consultations throughout the entirety of Cork and Kerry when the crisis in homelessness is in Cork city. It does not know what it thinks about it yet as it has to consult everybody in the health board about it. That is what we have to deal with.</P>
    <P>There is no sense of crisis. Some 5,500 people are, effectively, close to living on the streets in this country. The country is awash with money and caring agencies, like health boards and local authorities, are moving on this issue with the same sense of urgency they have regarding every other issue, that is, it will be done in their own good time under their own good auspices.</P>
    <P>That is the failure of this Government &ndash; the failure to drive the strategy it conceived. It is a strategy that was pre-written for it by the voluntary sector over 20 years. There is nothing in this strategy that has not been sought unanimously by the voluntary sector for 20 years. There is nothing in this strategy that every adviser that ever advised the Minister on homelessness did not know about.</P>
    <P>This strategy, which ultimately miraculously emerged, was not the issue. The issue was the unwillingness to implement such a coherent strategy at local level &ndash; a lack of imagination. The eternal problem was that for years local authorities said homelessness was not their issue but was the problem of the health boards. The immortal survey carried out by Dún Laoghaire Borough Council identified no homeless people in Dún Laoghaire because it did not know where to look for them as it was not its problem. This happened all over the country. We sorted that out after about five false starts. Having done that, we now have a situation where, because so much emphasis was put on local authority provision of social housing, supported housing, the health boards are trying to say it is not their problem any more.</P>
    <P>In the words of a senior official of the Southern Health Board, it was pulled kicking and struggling to a housing forum in Cork to discuss this <Col N="578" /> issue because it did not think it was one of its concerns. That is why Government is failing in this area. It is failing because it does not recognise that of all the issues of housing, the issue of homelessness will or will not be dealt with on a local level and it will be dealt with to the degree to which the voluntary sector is supported, involved, funded and listened.</P>
    <P>The Minister has listened to the voluntary sector. The tragedy is that people at local level in health boards and local authorities have not listened to the voluntary sector and have decided that consultation means once-off listening. They regard that as partnership. Partnership is a process of equality &ndash; it is not other people making inputs and then somebody else deciding. If we used the local authority and health board model of partnership in terms of our national partnership, it would mean that employers, farmers and trade unions would make submissions to Government and then Government would decide what they were all to get. Real partnership means negotiation and agreement to which everybody subscribes. It is the Government's job to make that sort of partnership work. If it does not make it work, we will end up with a problem running out of control.</P>
    <P>The other issue is resources. While it is welcome that funding has increased, it is worth pointing out that in 1992, 749 units of accommodation were approved at a cost of £2.74 million. In 1999, 163 units &ndash; almost one fifth of that &ndash; were provided at a cost of £7.84 million. The problem is maybe three times as big as it was in 1992 but the number of units of accommodation provided in 1999 is one fifth, or one quarter, of what it was in 1992 and the cost is going to be four or five times greater.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem in all of this is the absence of low cost accommodation. A strategy which does no more than stabilise house prices will still leave a huge section of our population excluded from the housing market, unable to pay either rent or mortgage. They will be the people from whom the individual tragedies and crises of homelessness will come. The Government's job is to stop that happening but that will not be done simply by producing a strategy. It is the Government's job to make that strategy work. So far, all the evidence shows that it is not happening.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy): Senator Walsh will move an amendment to the motion which I will commend. I am very pleased to come back to the House to have a further discussion on the housing issue, the Government's policy and its implementation. I will give the House as much information as I can on how that is proceeding.</P>
    <P>I reject out of hand the assertion made at the start of Senator O'Meara's contribution which sought to imply that the Government's only <Col N="579" /> interest in housing was as a marketable commodity. I utterly reject that approach. That is not the case. Government policy has been stated numerous times. I will not allow her, or any other Senator, to allege that is my policy as long as I have responsibility for this portfolio which I consider to be of the utmost importance.</P>
    <P>The people of greatest concern to me are the people who have no home. The people about whom Senator Ryan has just spoken are my greatest concern and I cannot say that I would argue with a lot of what he said on the homelessness issue. I hope the plans we have put in place, which I will outline, will come to fruition and all the people who are in that situation will be adequately provided for. The housing needs of families who do not have adequate housing and are on our waiting lists and of those unfortunate people who are sleeping rough are our, and my, major concern. We have taken an enormous number of measures to ensure they will be provided for. It is entirely wrong to make the assertion Senator O'Meara did. The arrogance of that assertion is astonishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No initiatives were taken during that period.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to deal with the crucially important issue of housing, to outline the main features of the Government's approach and to update Senators on the degree to which the Government's measures are yielding positive results in a period of extraordinary and unprecedented growth in housing demand. There is no recognition of the tremendous prosperity and growth in the country, the increase in the number of people at work, emigrants returning to live here and so on. This creates the demand for housing but this is not acknowledged by members of the Labour Party who continually knock and pretend they stand for something different from others. They forget they were in government a few short years ago and they did nothing on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is at the top of the Government's agenda. We never underestimated the scale of the needs or challenges we faced. We have taken decisive action on a broad scale, including altering long established tax instruments, introducing new tax incentives, expanding traditional programmes and fast-tracking key infrastructural developments. We will continue to take all necessary action to bring the housing supply and demand more into balance. We wasted no time in addressing the gap between supply and demand and our response to overall housing <Col N="581" /> needs forms a coherent, planned and strategic response. We must address social needs and help to create the conditions where those who seek to own their own home have a chance to do so. Housing is not a short-term issue and we must implement sustainable solutions which will last over generations.</P>
    <P>Last year's record housing output of over 46,500 new houses will be exceeded this year. The latest leading indicators of housing supply, coupled with progress made on the Action on Housing initiatives announced in June, suggest that we are now on target to achieve 50,000 housing completions this year and even further increases in coming years. We are building new houses at by far the highest rate in Europe in relation to our population and at an almost unbelievable five times the rate being achieved by our nearest neighbour, the UK.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Action on Housing supply measures is being pursued urgently. Action has been taken to ensure the housing supply measures are driven and co-ordinated effectively to bring forward land for housing more quickly. We have introduced incentives to guarantee an ongoing supply of serviced housing land. Action has also been taken to deal effectively with planning and infrastructural constraints in order to maximise the potential of available land. Getting the maximum benefit from the supply of building land is a key element of the Government's strategy and increased density is crucial to achieve this. We have, accordingly, introduced planning guidelines to increase residential density at appropriate locations.</P>
    <P>Eleven candidate residential strategic development zones with the potential to deliver 41,000 housing units have now been identified and are being subjected to detailed analysis. We intend to designate the first tranche of SDZs later this month. Project offices already established by local authorities to drive key housing related infrastructural projects in key areas are being strengthened and new project offices are being established.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in Action on Housing the Government adopted a number of measures, including changes to stamp duty, to ease the burden on first-time buyers and owner occupiers and to discourage speculative investment which was negatively impacting on the ability of first-time buyers to enter the market. We rebalanced the rates of stamp duties to improve the affordability of reasonably priced second-hand houses for first-time purchasers and to prevent investors pricing first-time buyers out of the market. A temporary anti-speculative tax was also introduced for a period of three years to discourage short-term speculative investment by those seeking to make a quick capital gain. Exemptions have been provided for landlords who comply with specific regulatory requirements, thereby indicating their <Col N="582" /> commitment to the long-term availability of the accommodation for renting.</P>
    <P>In spite of continuing high demand, the effects of increased output are being reflected in moderating house price trends since house price inflation peaked in 1998. The most recent house price figures available for the September quarter provide strong evidence of a moderation in the rate of house price increase, particularly new house prices. I hope to be in a position to publish very positive price trend figures within the next few days.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted by most reasonable commentators that the Government's actions have played a key role in achieving house price slowdown. This is a very positive achievement against the background of continued economic growth and low interest rates. Sustained increases in housing output and reduced investor activity are the key factors underlying this moderation.</P>
    <P>There is also firm evidence that first-time buyers are gaining an increasing share of the new housing market as the targeted tax measures to curb speculative investment take effect. This shift is due to reduced investor activity in response to the taxation measures introduced in Action on Housing and the sustained increases in housing output.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, we have significantly expanded the social housing programmes. We have, for the first time, provided a long-term framework for the funding of social and affordable housing through the inclusion of £6 billion in the national development plan. Funding under this heading and for housing related infrastructure was further increased by almost £1 billion in Action on Housing, reflecting the commitment of the Government to tackle social and affordable housing needs. This investment will ensure that the housing needs of almost 100,000 households will be met with Government assistance over the seven year plan period.</P>
    <P>The range and extent of measures to provide housing for those unable to access housing from their own resources have been improved and extended significantly by this Government. For example, the Government provided for an increase of 60% in Exchequer expenditure on local authority and social housing programmes this year compared with last year. This is by any standards a remarkable level of increase and ensures that there is no financial constraint on the delivery of the social housing programmes. The 133% increase in Exchequer funding for local authority and social housing programmes from what was provided in 1997 by the previous Government, which included Labour Party Ministers, clearly reflects the priority we afford to meeting social housing needs.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced for the first time a four year multi-annual local authority housing programme for the period 2000-03. One of the main reasons for introducing such a programme was <Col N="583" /> that the annual notification of starts at the beginning of each year was causing too much of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; situation. It also resulted in a bunching of the tenders being sought at the same time late in the year. The multi-annual approach will allow for greater forward planning and efficiencies of scale in delivering the increased local authority housing targets. There will be 6,000 local authority dwellings in progress at the end of this year, the highest level in a generation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>As part of the Government's Action on Housing, we increased the local authority housing programme by an extra 1,000 units each year from 2001 to 2006. This increase of a further 6,000 starts in the local authority housing programme means that funding is now committed for 41,500 starts over the plan period, front-loaded to meet existing demand more quickly. I propose to notify local authorities shortly of the allocation of 3,000 of these extra starts for the period covering the multi-annual programme up to 2003. The four year multi-annual programme will, therefore, increase housing starts from 22,000 to 25,000. I believe any fair-minded person would agree that this indicates the Government's clear commitment to increasing momentum in the programme, which seemed to be the theme of Senator Ryan's contribution.</P>
      <P>I want to draw particular attention to the fact that we are asking local authorities to front load their programme. I ask the Senators who tabled this motion to look at the record of the local authorities they represent. What response are Senators giving to the people on their local authority housing lists given the starts the Government allocated, the front-loading invitation and permission given to local authorities to build many more houses?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I issued a letter to the managers of each local authority some time ago asking them to indicate what they could take of the extra 3,000 starts being put into the system. A local authority represented by one of the Senators did not even apply. Senator Ryan should check that out when he goes home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are aware that the necessary funding for the capital programme is in place and that there is no impediment in that regard. In 1997 the number of house starts allocated to local authorities was 3,500. That figure has been virtually doubled, with latitude to front-load as much as possible. Local authorities can build an entire four year programme in one year if they organise themselves, and I invite them to do so. In this way people could be housed three years earlier than they might have been. This opportunity is available. Members of local authorities <Col N="584" /> should ensure their authorities make plans and begin construction. The problem will be solved by building houses, not by making speeches.</P>
    <P>The revised four year programme of 25,000 is pitched at the maximum level which we believe can be delivered. Suggestions that the programme should again be substantially increased may provide attractive catch calls but I do not know what they mean. We are building good quality houses at suitable locations. While the average size of schemes is increasing, it is still only 13 units per scheme and the high standards of design and location are being fully maintained. We have some scope to increase the average scale of local authority schemes without sacrificing quality or amenity. However, I am not in favour of going back to building sprawling local authority housing estates such as those built in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the main local authority housing programme, major regeneration programmes, which the Government is funding, are under way. These include the redevelopment of Ballymun and a number of large inner-city flat complexes. The regeneration and redevelopment schemes are designed to tackle the serious problems of multiple deprivation associated with some inner-city flats, including the serious drugs problem. I have travelled through a number of these areas, some in Senator Costello's area of the north inner city of Dublin. Arising from these visits, we have introduced a programme to accelerate local authority plans and that programme is under way. More than 760 new houses will commence construction under these programmes by the end of this year. This is additional to the ordinary local authority building programme.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Government recently announced an allocation of £40 million for the provision of child care facilities. A sum of £5 million was earmarked for child care accommodation in new and existing local authority housing. Local authorities are being asked to submit proposals to attract funding, ideally in conjunction with the provision of other community facilities in local authority estates. I understand many local authorities are well advanced in preparing these proposals.</P>
      <P>We have created the conditions whereby the voluntary housing sector will be able to deliver more than 15,000 additional housing units over the national development plan period. When I became Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the voluntary sector was practically on its knees. Funding had not kept pace with the increase in building and tender costs. Senator Ryan, who is closely involved with the voluntary housing organisations, is aware of this. A Labour Party Minister left the voluntary housing sector in a disgraceful situation but the problem was dealt with very quickly.</P>

      <P>I have tackled the problem further since then. The levels of assistance available for the provision of voluntary housing have been increased substantially on two occasions &ndash; in November 1997 and again in October 1999 &ndash; to take account of rising construction costs and to stimulate greater activity in the voluntary housing sector. I have spent much time encouraging local authorities, local authority management and local communities to become aware and to avail of the outstanding ability of the voluntary housing organisations to undertake the building of housing schemes under the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes. I have set high targets but I am optimistic that these will be responded to and that the voluntary housing sector will be a significant addition to the overall housing programme. For the first time assistance towards site acquisition costs by voluntary bodies has recently been introduced.</P>
      <P>These steps have resulted in significantly increased activity at local level in the voluntary housing sector. Output is expected to reach 1,000 units this year, double the 1998 output. I assure Senators that the level of assistance to the voluntary housing sector will be kept under review on an ongoing basis by the Government to ensure steady growth in output. I made that commitment at the beginning and I have reviewed it twice since then. I have also introduced the housing subsidy. All these measures are helping greatly. The provision in the Planning and Development Act to set aside 20% of housing development for social housing will be a major help to voluntary organisations in acquiring land on which to build.</P>
      <P>Further steps to facilitate the growth of the sector include the establishment within my Department of a dedicated unit with responsibility for all aspects of voluntary housing and a remit to expand and develop the sector. A working group on voluntary housing has also been established to identify and advise on changes to procedures and schemes governing the sector. It is also mandated to advise on ways of further expanding the sector and increasing output. The group consists of representatives of the voluntary and co-operative housing movement, local authority officials and Department officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to tackling the problem of homelessness. We have launched an integrated strategy which offers a whole new approach to the way in which services for the <Col N="586" /> homeless are to be planned, funded and provided. We have introduced new arrangements to prevent and comprehensively address the problem. The strategy aims to provide an integrated response from all the statutory and voluntary agencies providing services for the homeless. Under the strategy, each county and county borough is required to establish a homeless forum for the delivery of homeless services on a joint basis. It will consist of representatives from the local authorities within its area, the health board and the voluntary bodies operating in the county. The homeless fora will bring local authorities and health boards together to front the leadership of all responses to homelessness in their areas. I am confident that the direct involvement of local authorities and health boards in a more collaborative manner will strengthen the response of voluntary bodies to homelessness and will secure the appropriate responses which voluntary bodies have identified as not being made or deficient at present. This will overcome the major obstacle of deciding who is responsible for various aspects of the problem, to which Senator Ryan referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Once the strategies are prepared they will be implemented. The resources are available to implement them.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are also required to draw up action plans at city and county level in conjunction with health boards and voluntary bodies to detail how accommodation, health, settlement and welfare services will be provided for homeless persons by all the agencies involved in providing these services. The immediate task for local authorities is to lead in drawing up these action plans to deliver services to address accommodation and care needs, health and welfare needs, settlement and training in life skills. Work is well under way on action plans in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway where the greatest levels of homelessness exist and these plans should be agreed by the end of November. However, all authorities have responsibility in this matter. We have also made substantial current and capital funding available to ensure that the measures outlined in the strategy are implemented and effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All local authorities have prepared and adopted five year Traveller accommodation programmes, as required by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998. We are committed to supporting and resourcing local authorities to allow them to implement their accommodation <Col N="587" /> programmes in the period 2000-04. The national Traveller accommodation consultative committee is evaluating the adequacy and implementation of accommodation programmes and I expect its initial examination and report will be completed early in 2001. The Traveller community is strongly represented on the consultative committee and I look forward to receiving its views on the accommodation programmes which have been received from the various local authorities.</P>
    <P>My target is to expand overall housing output through the range of local authority and voluntary housing programmes to meet the needs of more than 15,000 households over the next few years, compared to 9,200 households last year.</P>
    <P>The Government has also significantly developed the range of schemes providing targeted assistance to improve the living conditions of those most vulnerable and those with special needs. We have increased the effective maximum disabled person's grant from £8,000 to £14,000 and allowed 90% of the cost to be recouped as opposed to the two thirds of cost grant we inherited. We have increased the effective maximum essential repairs grant from £1,800 to £6,000 and extended the scheme to urban areas. Funding for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly has been increased to record levels, from £4 million in 1997 to £8 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government also aims to develop a thriving, diverse and well-managed private rented sector. In addition to measures designed to increase the overall supply of housing, actions taken in recent years include specific incentives for the provision of rented residential accommodation in urban renewal areas and for the provision of student accommodation. In relation to income tax relief in respect of rent paid by tenants in the private rented residential sector, the Government increased the ceiling for persons under 55 years by 50% and doubled the ceiling for those over 55 years.</P>
    <P>I also established a commission on the private rented residential sector to make recommendations on a wide range of issues, including improved security of tenure, maintaining a fair and reasonable balance between the respective rights and obligations of tenants and landlords and increasing investment in and the supply of accommodation in the sector. The report of the commission, published in July this year, identified a growing need for accommodation in the private rented sector and set out a number of recommendations to increase supply, including recommendations aimed at increasing long-term investment in private rented accommodation. The commission's recommendations must be viewed as a total package, all the constituent elements of which are essential to the successful reform of the sector. These recommendations have very significant implications for the landlord and tenant <Col N="588" /> legislative code and the tax code, which are currently being examined.</P>
    <P>The commission has identified areas where changes can be made leading to a rented sector which provides an excellent service for tenants and an appropriate return to landlords. The objective is to enable the sector develop to its maximum potential so that it may be seen as a tenure of choice, along with social housing or home ownership. I intend to submit comprehensive proposals to Government in response to the report as soon as possible &ndash; I hope to bring a memorandum, including the final recommendations, to Government within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>On the question of rent assistance for private rental accommodation, the Government decided in principle to establish a new local authority rent assistance scheme in accordance with the main recommendations in an interdepartmental report published last year. This would replace, in the main, the current arrangements for rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>A planning group, under the aegis of my Department, which commenced work in April will report towards the end of this year with detailed proposals on rental assistance to enable the Government to take definitive decisions on future arrangements. It will also address a range of issues arising in the implementation of new arrangements and examine the possible scope for improvements in relation to the existing SWA scheme pending the introduction of new arrangements. Some improvements to the existing scheme were introduced in this year's budget and the Social Welfare Act, particularly in relation to arrangements for retention of supplements by people making the transition from welfare to work.</P>
    <P>The key aims in relation to the rent assisted housing sector are to achieve greater effectiveness in meeting housing needs, maximum co-ordination of housing policy and effective arrangements to ensure that needs are met. This will include retention of a welfare safety net for urgent income support needs while avoiding, as far as possible, factors which could promote further imbalance between supply and demand in the private rental sector.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to make it clear that we have no intention of repeating the mistakes made in the UK where the introduction of a housing benefit system in the 1980s contributed to the creation of a high rent and chronic dependency environment. Many tenants there are caught in a benefit trap. They cannot afford to leave the system and there is a major disincentive to improve their earnings.</P>
    <P>Introducing an expanded system of benefits or any other device that would inject more money into the market is not the answer. It would be counter-productive in a situation where there is already an imbalance between supply of and <Col N="589" /> demand for private rental accommodation. As is the case in the housing sector generally, it is important to focus on the supply side and this is a key consideration of the planning group.</P>
    <P>One of the important issues we are exploring is the potential for more supply focused approaches to rental assistance, including possible arrangements and measures needed to promote improvements in standards and supply of rent-assisted accommodation. The objective will not be simply to transfer what is largely a welfare payment scheme to local authorities or to create an expensive, bureaucratic and counter-productive system of housing benefit.</P>
    <P>We are committed to consulting widely and availing of all informed opinion and advice in the housing area. This is demonstrated by the establishment of the housing forum under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The forum is not only a mechanism for the social partners to monitor, on a regular basis, implementation of the various actions set out in the PPF, but it also provides a formal avenue for input of ideas from them for future policy development.</P>
    <P>The social partners, through their membership of the housing forum, can play an important role in assisting in tackling constraints on housing supply. For example, the trade unions and the Construction Industry Federation are well placed to assist in devising measures to address skills shortages in the construction sector. They will also be able to identify any additional constraints as they emerge. Such co-operation between the social partners and the Government is an important element in achieving the housing targets set out in the national development plan and the PPF.</P>
    <P>The Government has prioritised the development of a modern, efficient and effective planning system. Significant advances are being made in achieving a balanced distribution of population and economic activity in the future through strategic and spatial planning. We are preparing a national spatial development strategy which will identify broad spatial development patterns for areas and will attempt to deliver more balanced development between and within regions. Strategic planning guidelines have been published and they form the basis of a development strategy for the overall Dublin and mid-east area.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act, 2000, has extended and updated the planning code and represents a fundamental development in planning law. PartV, which commenced last week, requires local authorities to prepare housing strategies to address the housing needs of all sectors of the community, including those in need of social and affordable housing. This requires local authorities to make an assessment of current and projected needs for housing in their areas, to prepare housing strategies accordingly and to vary their development plans to incorporate the strategies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> Guidelines for planning authorities on the preparation of their housing strategies, together with a model housing strategy, are being finalised by my Department and will be published later this month. This comprehensive, tiered planning structure within a national framework, which also allows for local flexibility, will allow the properly planned construction of over 500,000 additional housing units which we estimate will be required to meet housing demand over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The national development plan published last November provides for massively increased investment in economic infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and public transport, all of which is essential to support housing development in the period to 2006 and beyond. State investment in water, sewerage, roads and other services, required to open up building land for development, has never before been increased as substantially as it has been by this Government since it took office. For example, funding for water and sewerage services has increased from £163 million in 1997 to almost £290 million this year, an increase of 78%.</P>
    <P>Good progress is being made under the serviced land initiative and output under the initiative is expected to yield 129,000 sites, well in excess of the 100,000 units originally envisaged. By the end of this year, schemes providing 100,000 sites nationally will either be completed or under construction. Key infrastructural projects such as the Swords treatment works and the north fringe sewer, both of which are critical to the development of the north Dublin area, are progressing well.</P>
    <P>What really matters is action to deliver the increased housing our population needs. The Government has delivered and will continue to do so. The degree to which this Government's investment in housing and related infrastructure is yielding positive results in a period of extraordinary and unprecedented growth in housing demand should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to overall housing needs forms a coherent, interconnected and strategic response. I outlined some of the range of actions being taken by the Government across the housing spectrum. The actions taken by the Government will, I am sure, result in further moderation of house price increases, increased and more effective provision of social and affordable housing and the establishment of a pattern of balanced growth.</P>
    <P>In considering the progress that has been made on housing, it is also necessary to point out that many measures already taken have yet to have full effect. This is a crucial point &ndash; there is a significant lead-in time to achieving results where construction is concerned, especially large-scale construction such as water and sewerage schemes and other infrastructural projects and when the construction industry is operating at full capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> Similarly, institutional change cannot deliver results overnight. The effects of our landmark policy under the Planning and Development Act to enable local authorities to reserve up to 20% of land intended for residential development for social and affordable housing have yet to be felt. All that has yet to feed into the system. The same goes for the Act's provisions which streamline the planning process. These include the use of the strategic development zones to ensure the early development of large-scale residential developments with a land holding levy for landowners who do not develop the land within a specified timeframe.</P>
    <P>These options stared the Labour Party in the face for the five years it was in government but it did not take any initiative in this area. Senator Ryan and I sat on the Oireachtas committee which dealt with the price of building land for more than a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I took over chairmanship of that committee from the leader of the party he has since joined. His leader could have done something because he was Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge that problems and challenges exist, the Government has taken steps to address them and the effects are beginning to become apparent. Our approach to housing has been action oriented. We have kept housing under careful and ongoing analysis and review and we have refined our strategies as necessary. Any comprehensive and fair-minded analysis of the Government's record on housing will find that we have taken an unprecedented range of actions across the broad housing spectrum. It will also find that we have not been lacking in political resolve to tackle the housing issue.</P>
      <P>I reject Senator O'Meara's false statement at the outset of her contribution. It is unworthy of her and it does not reflect the facts or what I have outlined in my speech to the House tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is biased and politically inspired rhetoric which bears no relationship to the truth and the facts. The statistics will prove the Senator's comments are absolutely and utterly wrong.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to evaluate carefully the initiatives we have already introduced. We will implement further measures if and when we feel they are warranted. This is an ongoing situation which we will keep under review. We are not standing back from taking further major initiatives in this area to ensure our objective that every person who is urgently in need of accommodation shall get it within a reasonable period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State remembers the expression that a rising tide lifts all ships, which was said by a person he admires, Seán Lemass. However, many of the ships are anchored on short chains and they have become submerged because the tide has never risen so fast economically. I do not have the same experience Senator Ryan has gained with the Simon Community over many years. I bow to his knowledge and genuine concern for the homeless. That issue was not addressed here tonight.</P>
      <P>One of the side effects of rising house prices which is not always obvious is the continuation of urban sprawl. The Minister of State said he was against urban sprawl and that he wanted more concentration. However, if someone in Dublin wants to buy a house, the cheapest house they can find and afford, even with two incomes, might be as far away as north Meath or Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to social mix, not to urban sprawl.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This puts a further strain on our infrastructure. It also means that travelling times are increased and carbon-dioxide gas is emitted into the air.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister of State has established a commission for the private rented sector, it is only in response to the fact that some of the strategies he has implemented will reduce the amount of private rented accommodation because it will not be feasible or profitable for people to get involved in that area. I know student hostels are being built in some places. However, many single people, who are not students and are trying to live in Dublin or a large urban area, find there is no accommodation available or it is too costly.</P>
      <P>Many of the initiatives the Minister of State said he has implemented are long-term. We must address this issue today. It has taken too long to come to this stage. Some 20% of social and local authority housing will now be taken from developers. I discussed this issue when we debated the Planning and Development Act, 2000, because I did not believe it was equitable. I was surprised when I discovered the decision to challenge it was overturned. Perhaps we will see some benefit from it in the future.</P>
      <P>We have had this debate in the House a number of times because people are concerned about what is happening. This is approximately the fifth time in the past two years the Minister of State has been in the House. I accept he is committed to reducing this problem. He believes the demand and supply ends of the market must meet. Some of the strategies which have been implemented are long-term ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NESF held a plenary session in Dublin Castle on 20 June and it made recommendations which are worth considering. The plenary session which was chaired by Maureen Gaffney and <Col N="593" /> David Silke, who are both on the project team of the NESF, drew conclusions which might be worth remembering. It proposed the establishment of a national housing authority. The Department was reluctant to take this on board on the basis that it was a duplication of effort and a waste of money. However, the Department now appears to have come around to the idea of accepting the possibility of establishing such an authority. If that authority is established, some of the recommendations of the NESF should be considered.</P>
    <P>Some of the recommendations of the NESF were planning and keeping under review a multiannual plan for social housing need; evaluating and co-ordinating an examination of policy issues across all housing tenders; advising on the allocation of funding to local authorities and non-profit housing organisations; providing technical advice and support for local authorities and voluntary housing bodies; facilitating the development of best practice in relation to social housing, provision and maintenance; promoting housing choice through sustainable house ownership and a diverse and well managed private rented sector; promoting social integration; supporting and co-ordinating programmes to improve housing conditions; promoting energy efficiency; undertaking and commissioning house research and evaluation; and developing a housing information service.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will probably say that some of those recommendations are already in place in the Department and I accept that. However, they are worthwhile. As regards the recommendation about promoting energy efficiency, I was at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government today which met the Construction Industry Federation. It and the people who are developing timber frame buildings discussed energy efficiency in the future.</P>
    <P>The proposed housing programme means that half a million houses will be built in ten years. However, the planning regulations on the reduction in COf8&gt;2 gases will not be fully implemented until 2005, which will bring the level to the German standard. That is the commitment we made at Kyoto. However, another regulation, which is not as stringent, will come into effect in 2002. The delegation at the committee meeting was asked if it would have any difficulty implementing the regulations, which are supposed to come into effect in 2005, now. An accusation was made that the Department was reluctant to introduce these regulations because it would affect the industry by increasing costs. However, the delegation stated it would not have any difficulty if the regulations were introduced sooner. I ask the Minister to take this issue on board.</P>
    <P>Some of the restrictions attaching to the shared ownership and the affordable housing schemes <Col N="594" /> run by the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be lifted. It should be left to the local authorities to decide where greater proportionality may be more appropriate. That might create a better social mix.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that a certain number of local authority houses must be developed. Local authorities should have more flexibility to decide whether they want more social housing and a better mix. Our local authority held a debate recently where the acting city manager was very reluctant to accept our recommendation regarding more social housing in a specific area on the Headford Road. We are in favour of the concept of social housing, which will lead to more private ownership.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government's holistic approach to the homeless. I ask the Minister of State to take on board recommendations made by Padraic Kenna, a director of the Galway Simon Community, who believes that some anomalies can be addressed and he asks if it could be Government policy to accidentally exclude many of the minority groups dealing with homeless people from local homelessness fora. He also asks if there is a need to complement the administrative response to the homeless, An Integrated Strategy Report, with a chapter of rights for the service users. Would a right to adequate and affordable housing for all citizens, including children, empower those who are excluded from housing far better than any other approach? I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</P>

      <P>&ndash;the range of measures taken to expand the output and capacity of the voluntary housing sector;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="595" />&ndash;the range of measures taken to address homelessness, including substantially increased resources, additional accommodation, improved inter-agency co-operation and the introduction of a comprehensive integrated strategy to meet the needs of homeless persons;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the enactment of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 and, in particular, the provisions of Part V dealing with housing strategies and the provision of social and affordable housing;</P>
    <P>&ndash;the provision in Action on Housing of an additional £1 billion over and above the £6 billion allocated in the National Development Plan, 2000-06 for social and affordable housing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This country has a proud record of home ownership and I am convinced that will continue. The Government's record on housing is unparalleled. Many new and innovative measures have been introduced in recent years. The Minister of State alluded to many of them in his speech.</P>
    <P>To refer to the challenges in this area as amounting to a housing crisis is an exaggeration. It would be a pity to politicise what is a very important social remit of the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure we meet the challenges ahead. Certain problems have arisen, for example, the escalation of house prices has affected accessibility and the homelessness problem continues, especially in the major population centres in the cities.</P>
    <P>The escalating price of houses is a consequence of the imbalance that has arisen in supply and demand. The Government has rightly tackled this issue. Measures taken prior and subsequent to the Bacon reports have been partially successful, but the problem is not yet resolved. The measures outlined by the Minster of State include the strategic development zones where areas have been designated for large-scale residential development. The landholding tax penalises landowners who do not develop their land within a specified timeframe. Those are positive developments towards generating an increase in the supply of housing.</P>
    <P>The project offices, referred to by the Minister of State, will drive key infrastructural projects. Other supply side developments include addressing the shortages in the capacity of the building and construction industry, especially in the areas of skilled and professional workers and the employment of existing planning resources, an issue that was debated in the House previously.</P>
    <P>On the demand side, the reductions in stamp duty have encouraged and facilitated first-time buyers to purchase second-hand houses. The corollary of that is the 9% stamp duty applied to <Col N="596" /> investors in the private sector. That has impacted significantly on demand and has created a better balance.</P>
    <P>The various social and affordable housing measures that have been taken are commendable. The Minister of State outlined the additional 1,000 local authority houses per annum for the years 2000-06. The shared ownership scheme could be more widely promoted by local government and the local authorities. Increasing income eligibility to £25,000 for single people, with a corresponding increase for double income families, will assist the promotion of that scheme. The increase in the local authority house purchase loan to £100,000 is a recognition of the reality of house prices.</P>
    <P>The investment of £600 million in housing this year, an increase of 52% on 1999, is unprecedented. In 1999, 46,500 houses were constructed and on the basis of figures for the first nine months of this year that figure is expected to be in excess of 50,000. All these figures are very significant increases on the position when the Minister took office.</P>
    <P>The increase in new house prices for the first nine months of this year is 7%. That is still too high, being in excess of inflation. There is a need to continue to drive down this figure. In this regard, the profits in the construction industry should be targeted.</P>
    <P>The total provision for local authority housing is £434 million this year, an increase of over 140% on 1997, the last year the Labour Party was in power. A sum of £65 million was provided for the voluntary housing scheme. Part V of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which was welcomed by all sides of the House, includes a courageous and republican initiative which has proved to be very unpopular with developers. We have yet to see the benefit of it, but it is good that it has been enacted. I hope it will be energetically pursued.</P>
    <P>The personal and social costs of homelessness are enormous. The break up of the family unit is enough in itself, but the subsequent consequences of loss of identity, social alienation and the loss of opportunity are additional features which add to the devastation associated with homelessness. We must solve the problem, especially when funding is available. There appears to be a far greater focus on the problem than heretofore.</P>
    <P>A radio programme broadcast a few days ago identified 800 hospital bed places available in Dublin. There is approximately 95% occupancy. I am sure the Minister of State will clarify that these places are allocated to people aged over 25 years and that there are only 50 bed places for those aged under 25 years. There is a particular problem with young people who find themselves homeless. The housing situation is not the only cause. The problem needs to be tackled on a wider basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The various voluntary organisations involved in homelessness should be complimented. We are fortunate that over a wider sphere of activities, be it sport or social services, there are people who give selflessly of their time in the interests of others. We should commend the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and others who play a positive and constructive role in this area.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Minister of State's efforts to address homelessness. People are entitled to two basic rights, the right to work and a job opportunity and the right to shelter. Following that, a good republican philosophy would allow people to develop their talents and progress from there. The State has a duty in both of these areas. We have been very successful in tackling the employment issue, especially over the past five or six years. We can now make a serious attempt to address the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider the causes of homelessness. These include poverty, unemployment, various health issues, including mental health, alcoholism, drug addiction, lack of appropriate services, relationship breakdown, family violence, sexual abuse and parenting deficiencies. All of these problems are factors which give rise to homelessness in many instances and it is imperative, therefore, that this question is tackled not just by the Department and local authorities in providing accommodation but in a more integrated way. The manner in which the Minister has set out his integrated strategy, which I believe will bear fruit, is a welcome step in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like briefly to mention another area, namely, the availability of private rented accommodation for single people. We have a generous rental subsidy system in operation and there is talk of bringing that under the remit of local government, something which is long overdue, but we should also ensure that local authorities implement the registration of rented dwellings. If the availability of rented accommodation under local government could be combined with this new strategy, we could have an effective mechanism for making serious inroads into the homelessness problem.</P>

      <P>This is an important motion and it is useful that the House should discuss it. It is a pity, however, if we see it entirely in a partisan, adversarial way where we have, on the one hand, accusations and condemnation of the Government and, on the other, lists of statistics, the achievements of the Government and so on. It is easy for either side to justify its own position but at the heart of this matter, as speakers from both sides of the House have indicated, there is a real human problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason I am glad that my colleague, Senator Coogan, put on the record some of the information contained in the report of the NESF. I will not go back over that because he appropriately put down the bullet points contained in the <Col N="598" /> document circulated to us. The NESF made a telling point when it stated that access to adequate housing shelter represents one of the most basic needs and should be regarded as a fundamental human and social right. It argued that individuals, families, communities and economies cannot be sustained without adequate accommodation. It went on to suggest that serious problems remain and to acknowledge that there was a 43% increase in the official assessment of housing need between 1996 and 1999, and that social housing output over the period was unacceptably low. That is not a particularly partisan point. That does not come from one political party; it comes from an agency that deals with these people on the ground, and it specifies both the public and voluntary sectors. That is where we need to target our comments and it is certainly where I intend to locate my concerns.</P>
    <P>We are aware on a human basis of precisely how significant to us as creatures is the provision of adequate housing. One only has to look at the past few days when we were hit by floods, and the shock registered in the faces of people in comfortable homes who suddenly found themselves without a home. Those people have all the advantages of wealth and suddenly a natural catastrophe strikes and they are confronted with a situation they never expected. As we have seen in recent days, that can happen to almost everyone.</P>
    <P>There is no question that there has been an enormous escalation of house prices. I know this from my personal experience. I am one of the lucky ones and it is necessary for those of us who have advantages to understand that there are many other people in our society who do not have these advantages. Twenty-five years ago I bought a house in Dublin with 25 rooms for £25,000. Within the past six months, the mews that had originally been attached to the house, in other words, the garage, as we would say today, was withdrawn at £250,000. Every week in the property supplements we see Europe-wide comparisons. One can buy a villa in Greece for a quarter of the price of a suburban house in Dublin. That is not the responsibility of one Government. It is partly market forces and it would be unfair of me to blame this particular Minister for that, but that is a fact that we have to take into account, even for professional, middle class people.</P>
    <P>At one point in my career I was an academic of sorts and I still maintain some contact with the world of academia. I find it interesting that a number of recent appointments in our universities have got into difficulty because people at a fairly senior level in academic life find that they cannot afford housing in Dublin on their salaries. That is an interesting point. If it bites at that level, what must it be like lower down the scale? We need somebody with the passion of Noel Browne to release funding for the people who are at the <Col N="599" /> most difficult point in the housing scale, and there are many of them. Sometimes it is difficult for us to see them.</P>
    <P>I know this motion is in the name of the Labour Party, and that does not entirely surprise me because it is known to have a social concern. Senator Ryan spoke earlier, and I regret I was not in the House to hear him, but ten years ago when our offices were across the road in Kildare House it was a standing reproach to us as parliamentarians that every time we moved in and out of that building to come across here to speak or to vote, we passed a woman who was living in a cardboard box. We made some attempt to help her but the difficulty was that I believe she had some kind of personality problem.</P>
    <P>We heard some well intentioned words from the Minister. He said that this evening's debate is all about building houses and that the local authorities could build the whole four year programme in one year. That may be true. He went on to say that it was all about building houses on the ground, not about making speeches but one also has to understand the psychology of the people who are homeless. It is not just a question of creating concrete flats on the ground. It is trying to understand the reason there are still people who are homeless. I am glad tribute was paid to the extraordinary and valiant work of Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, but why is she still needed if the situation is so easily resolved by the simple building of houses, as the Minister said?</P>
    <P>I am familiar with the inner city of Dublin. I sometimes take shortcuts through its back streets and on an afternoon a couple of months ago, about 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m., I walked through Henry Place, at the back of O'Connell Street, the principal thoroughfare of this capital city, and I saw a young man with no shoes on his feet eating food out of a skip. That young man's problems will not be solved simply by building houses. There has to be a greater imaginative effort on our part, and that is the way we must proceed.</P>
    <P>Other people mentioned the drugs problem. I am glad Senator Walsh mentioned the difficulties for young single people because where local authorities have a points system, single people are considerably disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider a situation that was drawn to my attention by a correspondent who both wrote to me and telephoned me. He claimed he was denied housing and told by somebody in a local authority that his application was pointless because he was gay. His feeling was not simply that, as a single man, he would not have enough points. He got the feeling from the local authority that because of his lifestyle there would be less energy put into housing him. If that is true, it is a great pity, particularly in our alleged Christian community where one of the questions one should ask is, &ldquo;Who is my neighbour?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> I am sorry there is so little time and I thank the Chair for his slight indulgence. If there was one point I would like taken from my few inadequate words this evening it is that the building of houses simply as concrete shells is not enough. A piece of concrete is not a home. Ask the disadvantaged or the young homeless people we increasingly see on our streets. We must understand why they are there and do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. As Senator Coogan pointed out, this is the fifth time we have discussed this subject in recent years. There is no doubt there is a significant housing problem for which there are many varied reasons. Some of these reasons relate to more than the lack of a building, but to house people, be they underprivileged or privileged, we need and will continue to need many more houses.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the housing problem is the extraordinary and unprecedented growth in demand in recent years. There may be a number of reasons for this but one significant factor has been the growth of the economy and the demand for second houses as an investment by those who already own a house. This has led to an increase in house prices which has excluded many people from the market, particularly first-time buyers.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the measures he has taken. Most people agree he has a detailed understanding of the problem and is very committed to finding a solution. We have to achieve a balance between the supply and demand for housing as, only then, will we curtail the increase in the cost of housing.</P>
      <P>We must also think in terms of what has been done in recent years. The Action on Housing programme, introduced last June, allocated an additional £1 billion for housing over and above the £6 billion provided in the national development plan. Everyone will agree that the measures being introduced are being pursued with great urgency.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the difficulty caused by lead-in times. No matter what measures one introduces to provide additional housing one has to obtain and service a site and build the house before one can move in, all of which takes time.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that every effort is being made to bring forward land for housing more quickly than in the past. However, local authorities are experiencing problems due to the lack of planning staff and the fact that they are losing planning officers to the private sector. It is proving quite difficult to replace these people. Measures were introduced last June to alleviate some of these bottlenecks and there are other difficulties as regards infrastructure. These measures are beginning to take effect and there has been a significant increase in investment in the voluntary, social and private housing sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The most recent changes in stamp duty have led to a situation where first time buyers and owner occupiers are in a much stronger position than in the past as investors who buy two, three, four and five houses as a capital base will be discouraged from doing so in the future. I know of one individual who bought ten houses on an estate in Carlow. The changes in stamp duty will mean that more houses will be available for first time buyers and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>These measures are beginning to bring about a moderation in the cost of housing. This is particularly the case with new houses where the rate of increase is reaching a more manageable level than in recent years. This is to be welcomed. We all know of young couples earning good salaries who want to get a foothold on the housing ladder but are unable to do so. Such people saw the cost of housing continuing to rise, but I hope that is coming to an end. This offers the possibility that people may be able to buy a house in 12 months or when they have a deposit. Twelve months to two years ago, such people had no possibility of getting on the ladder. This is one of the positive outcomes of the measures introduced.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we increase the supply of housing. The Minister of State outlined that, over the next ten years, there will be a need for about 500,000 additional houses. That is an extraordinary number of houses in a country of this size so it is imperative that land is rezoned quickly. I am aware of many cases at local authority level where the Labour Party, the sponsor of this motion, has prevented rezoning. In some cases there were valid reasons for stopping the rezoning but in many other cases the reasons were spurious. This is not good enough as we need to fast-track this process.</P>
    <P>We also need to put in place the necessary infrastructure as quickly as possible and, thankfully, the Government has allocated money to this area. The Minister of State pointed out that, over the past three years, investment in infrastructure has increased by about 80%. We will have to live with the problem of the lead-in times. It takes time to achieve things and one cannot build a house over night. I once saw a factory where people were laying, plastering and painting blocks on the same day, in the rain, in preparation for an official opening. That does not work.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that the construction industry is operating at full capacity. Whatever measures are needed to increase this capacity must be taken. The number of people involved in construction is increasing every year but we will have to continue this increase as much as possible in the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House is fed up with me talking about the homeless people I meet on Baggot Street on my way home every night. I recommend that Senators read the very good report on homelessness in Dublin issued by the Office for Health Gain which points out that a considerable number of those on the streets are <Col N="602" /> ill and will never be able to buy one of the houses being built. None of these people will ever be able to run their own home unless effort is put into the other areas which are contributing to homelessness.</P>
      <P>The report points out that, in general, homeless people who sleep out in this city are older men, women with children, young males and refugees. The refugee crisis has been tackled to some extent and women in general are accommodated with their children in bed and breakfasts, but they are out on the street during the day. However, the situation for adult males and young men, many of whom have left home because of disagreement with the family, is really very serious. When one reads this report, which states that 30% of them have psychiatric illness, and one remembers that 1% of the general population have psychiatric illness, one really sees how appalling the situation is.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year Professor Ted Dinan of the Royal College of Surgeons spoke of the services in the area of the Eastern Health Board, which is now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, as being substandard, the out-patient facilities in particular. We have a situation where we have put community facilities in some locations and while the buildings may look fine they are totally underfunded and, therefore, are not staffed adequately. People who require psychotherapy, occupational therapy or the support of social workers can get nothing except drugs given out by the doctors and nurses working there because the sector is totally underfunded.</P>
      <P>Twenty years ago the paper The Psychiatric Service: Planning for the Future encouraged the closure of the major psychiatric institutions and that people would be cared for in the community. We closed the psychiatric institutions and put people out of major hospitals but we have not provided the community care to support these people. The process has slowed down a little now because the situation has been seen to be so appalling and the services are out in the community and trying to treat homeless psychiatric patients which is almost impossible. I am not talking about the additional people who have alcohol and drug abuse problems &ndash; they form about another 20%. About 50% of the people who are out there tonight are actually ill and in need of services which are not being provided. It is very difficult to ensure that homeless people will take their medication. To try to get them to go to day hospitals, which were so uninviting and so deficient in staff, only compounds the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another serious disincentive to homeless people getting treatment is the sectorisation policy which we have pursued in the psychiatric services. This means that if one meets somebody outside Baggot Street hospital and asks where he comes from and he says &ldquo;Blanchardstown&rdquo;, one cannot get him treatment in this area because they will say that he must go to his own sector, to Blanchardstown. If, however, he fell down and broke his leg he would not have to go out to Blan<Col N="603" /> chardstown and he could go to St. Vincent's Hospital. Therefore, there is total discrimination against people with psychiatric illness just from the point of view of getting the bare necessities of the health service.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember also that 10% of schizophrenics die young, that is, under 30. When one thinks of the number of these homeless people who may be schizophrenic and not getting proper treatment and when one thinks of the treatment for schizophrenia available nowadays and the fact that they might be well able, if given proper treatment, to hold down jobs, it really is deplorable the way we have let so many people end up in this outrageous position due to the fact that they are homeless because they have psychiatric illness. Some people with alcohol and drug problems end up out on the street supporting their habit through prostitution and that is another problem we must deal with.</P>
    <P>Another group who are heavily represented among the homeless are people who were in prison. There is little in the way of discharge facilities when people leave prison. Some of them have ended up in prison because of their vagrant lifestyle and being involved in minor offences but they should not have been put in prison in the first place. Somewhere to live should have been found for them. If they had been involved with the probation services, social workers, etc., perhaps one would not have them costing us £50,000 a year to be kept in Mountjoy. It really is ridiculous. When one thinks that Sister Caoimhín does not even get £50,000 a year to run her drop-in centre and here we have £50,000 being spent on prisoners, it really makes me so angry.</P>
    <P>On discharge, most prisoners, if they cannot get into a Simon hostel or one of the Salvation Army hostels, really are lost. Focus Point does a great deal for young people who may be in a position where they cannot stay at home, but how many emergency beds are there for young single people in this city at present? I think there are 50. This is ridiculous. We need several hundred. An effort in this area will help us to save money in the long-run by not having to care for these people in the prison service.</P>
    <P>Children also pose a serious problem because some of them leave home due to abuse or neglect and, because of the Child Care Act, 1991, they are in the care of the health boards. The health board, however, describes these children not as homeless but as &ldquo;out of home&rdquo; because there is somewhere, they say, which they could stay if only they would go back there, but maybe they have extraordinarily good reasons for not going back to their homes. There is little investigation into the reasons the children have left home in the first place.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have the situation regarding hostels addressed, not just in the centre of Dublin but all over the country, to see if we could have a better support service with hostels for emergency care for children and young people in particular.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> Much of the emergency accommodation is in fact not emergency accommodation anymore. It must be used on a long-term basis by people who have nowhere else to go and some of them do need support. Streetwise and Barnardos do a great deal with children and I cannot speak highly enough of organisations like the Salvation Army, Focus Point, the Simon Community and the Capuchin drop-in centre on the quays. Those in the voluntary sector make such a huge effort that we in the State sector need to focus our minds far more on the multiple causes, which are not bricks and mortar and which result in so many people living on the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this debate. No doubt there are homeless people in Ireland but there are homeless people in every country and one would not want to forget that. As a matter of fact, I was part of a group in my county, County Kerry, some years ago where we tracked down homeless people in London and went to the trouble of bringing them back home under the voluntary/community housing programme, which was initiated by this Government. Such projects are welcome.</P>
      <P>However, I am amazed at the escalation in house prices over the past number of years. In the early 1960s one could buy a house in Ireland for £600, £700 or £800 but now they are enormously expensive. There are reasons for that and they have been tackled. This Government has taken on the challenge and it is tackling the problem in a very real way. I congratulate the Government for making funding of the order of £6 billion available for the first time over the term of the national development plan. Recently it announced the provision of an extra £1 billion for that programme and increasing the number of houses in the programme by 1,000.</P>
      <P>Last year over 50,000 houses were built in Ireland. If that rate continues over the next ten years, an extra 500,000 houses will be built. A comparison worth noting here is that in a country with a population of four million, we will build half a million houses over the next ten years yet the UK, which has a population of 60 million, is building about 160,000 per annum. We are building 50,000 per annum with a population of four million. That means the rate of construction of new homes here is approximately 450% greater than that of the UK. One would want to examine the reason that is happening. The reason is that the economy of this country has turned around completely. I remember in 1987, when Fianna Fáil took power after a Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government from 1983-87, every newspaper and commentator said they thought everyone would leave the country and they asked the last person leaving to make sure they turned out the lights. Over a 13 years period, the entire economy has been transformed. One would have to ask how this came about. Was it an accident or was it as a result of proper management by good Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> There is a problem now. There are homeless people and people seeking to be housed. I remember a time when one would not get a local authority house unless one was married, had been on the housing list for three, four or five years, had maybe three or four children and lived in a mobile home or in poor accommodation, but all that has changed. I remember when I was first elected to the local authority in County Kerry in the 1980s, there were approximately 1,400 people on the housing list. The Government transformed the situation and brought that list down to about 400 people. The list has gone up to 700 or 800 people but it is a long way short of the 1,400 people who were on the housing list then.</P>
    <P>For the first time we are housing unmarried mothers, single parents and old people. That did not happen under any other Government. There was no such thing as 90% funding for community housing efforts. No effort was made. It was a case of whether we were going to build 50 or 60 houses per local authority or whether there might be 90 starts one year, which would be finished in two or three years time. All of a sudden a programme has been put in place by a Government which wants to ensure the housing needs of this country are addressed.</P>
    <P>Other steps could be taken to improve the housing situation. Many fat cats came in and bought up a lot of land. Somebody mentioned the rezoning of land. Rezoning seems to be a terrible word in Dublin and in other big cities where it was thought that if the Government or a local authority rezoned land, it was for gain and so on. I have stated on many occasions that a lot more land needs to be rezoned. The Government is making funding available for infrastructure, including roads, water and sewerage. It is making the moneys available under the national plan and a lot more land should be rezoned.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, which have land banks at their disposal, should make land available for people who are on the housing list at an affordable price, not at £20,000 to £80,000 per site. The local authority should offer sites to people who are on the housing list at knock down prices of maybe £400 or £500 per site to entice these people to build their own homes rather than go on a waiting list and wait for the Government to build houses for them in the future.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of work available at the moment, thanks to the Government, and everybody is making a good living. I admit there will always be a certain number of homeless people but that is the case all over the world. People fall on hard times for one reason or other and they are homeless in the short-term. The number of homeless in this country is not large compared to that in other countries. In the United States, Canada and Australia, there are homeless people. That is a reality.</P>
    <P>The Government is tackling social housing needs with the programme introduced by the local authorities and the Southern Health Board which will house people who are old and <Col N="606" /> deprived. Local authorities could play a bigger role with the land banks they have. They should buy more land at affordable prices. House prices are levelling off at the moment because, as was stated by a Senator, the number of fat cats buying eight, ten or 15 houses to try to drive up the price is on the decline. Prices will level off and people will be able to afford to buy their own houses shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards Senator Kiely's analysis of the economy and how it has developed since 1987, I remind him that the 1977 manifesto removed the entire tax base. The few that were eligible to pay tax did not pay it as the tribunals are now discovering. The entire tax base was removed in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>We have a two tier society and are trying to solve problems in Dublin which do not apply to the rest of the country. There is no homelessness in rural Ireland, but there are thousands of people on the local authority housing lists which was not the case in the 1980s. There is not the type of homelessness about which we are speaking in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report, in its endeavours to solve the crisis in Dublin, has affected the property market throughout rural Ireland because what pertains in Dublin does not pertain throughout the country. In County Mayo, from where I come, house prices are declining. One can get £10,000 off the list price of a house if one spends about five minutes talking to an auctioneer.</P>
      <P>We must remember there are two different groups. We have an explosion in Dublin, with economic development and the number of people living in the capital, which is too many. We are trying to persuade them to move down the country and to get jobs there. The crisis in Dublin does not pertain down the country. As I said, the Bacon report, in its endeavour to solve this Dublin problem, is affecting house prices and property throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Minister will already have had representations from the House Builders Association, which has recently formed a new association in Connacht-Ulster to try to bring some sanity back to the market. Second homes, especially holiday homes in Counties Donegal and Mayo, cannot be sold at present because investors have left the market. The Government needs to monitor the situation. By solving the crisis in Dublin, it is creating a crisis down the country which it will also have to solve shortly.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and Senators who contributed to this very important debate. A range of points were made to which I would like to respond, although it will not be possible to do so in five minutes. One or two, however, stand out. I have been told by Members on the other side that what we refer to as a crisis is an exaggeration. I also heard that we have a proud record of home ownership. If we have a proud record on home ownership, will the Senator agree there is a <Col N="607" /> crisis when a couple on a joint income of £40,000 cannot afford to buy a House? I urge Members on the Government side to wake up to the crisis.</P>
      <P>I also wish to comment on Senator Kiely's remarks on homelessness. He seems to be saying that this is homelessness is acceptable because every country has this problem. He implies that this is tolerable. Homelessness is not acceptable, and neither is the Senator's attitude. It is not good enough for a Senator on the Government side simply to say every country has a homelessness problem and some people will always be living on the streets. This type of attitude has led judges to take extraordinary measures to make the Government wake up to the problem of homelessness, particularly child homelessness in this city.</P>

      <P>Rezoning, which is being investigated by tribunals, has been used to line pockets. We know the rezoning of land has made millionaires of landowners overnight. I reject totally the accusations made by the other side of the House that the Labour Party has somehow obstructed the rezoning of land for development. That is not the case. My councillor colleagues throughout the country are resisting this lining of pockets over<Col N="608" /> night, which is still taking place. The housing crisis is still ongoing.</P>
      <P>I was accused of making this a political issue. It is a political issue because political decisions have led to the current problems. I have listened to many people talk about the need for housing but I have not heard them talk about the right to housing. I heard remarks which indicated that people have a right to two houses, a right to invest, while so many are currently in need of basic shelter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that his major concern is to tackle the issue of homelessness. I accept he has a personal commitment in relation to this matter but he needs to do much more to solve the problem. He referred in his speech to a special housing aid scheme for the elderly. Housing covers a large range of issues, including availability of housing, homelessness and so on. I must bring to the Minister of State's attention a letter I received from the health board in my area in response to representations I made on behalf of an applicant for the special housing aid scheme for the elderly. The application was received in 1999 and the letter read, &ldquo;We are currently dealing with applications received in 1996&rdquo;. There is a four year waiting period for basic assistance for the elderly, some of whom we all know are living in dire conditions. In a world class economy, this aspect of housing is a scandal and a disgrace. The Government is still in denial and fails to wake up to this crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I call on the Minister for Health and Children to disclose the outcome of the February investigation into the high number of deaths from brain haemorrhage in the docklands area. This is a matter of considerable concern to people on both sides of the River Liffey, in the Ringsend and north docks areas.</P>
      <P>It is reported that approximately seven deaths occurred in Ringsend and five deaths on the north side of the river in the year ending February 2000. That is a total of 12 deaths which are known to have occurred from brain haemorrhage in a 12 month period. The people who died were all aged in their 20s and 30s. These young people had experienced severe headaches which had been diagnosed as migraine. Many of them had brain scans and brain specialists had examined them, but evidence of serious illness was not detected or diagnosed. Yet these people suddenly became ill, experienced violent vomiting and died shortly afterwards. This matter was brought to my attention by a family in the north docks area when a young man in his early 20s, who was a good footballer in the local club and had a partner and child, suddenly became ill and died.</P>
      <P>It is a strange phenomenon which we have not experienced elsewhere in the country. There seems to be a cluster of mysterious deaths on both sides of the River Liffey. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, instigated an inquiry into the cause of the cluster of deaths in early spring of this year. I want to know the outcome of that inquiry and what was discovered during the investigation. I understand senior officials in the Eastern Regional Health Authority were empowered to conduct the inquiry. Have they identified any salient factors which might have caused the deaths?</P>
      <P>Were these deaths compared with similar deaths in other parts of the country? Is this a unique case? What is the incidence of death from brain haemorrhage among a young age group? Why has the docklands area suddenly experienced this rare cause of death, particularly among a young population who were seen as happy go lucky and enthusiastic people in the prime of their lives? Has the Department put a mechanism in place to monitor such deaths in the future? Will the Department continue to monitor the docklands area over a period of time to see if there is a pattern of such deaths? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is alarming and has caused worry and distress for parents whose children have been snatched from them for no obvious reason in tragic circumstances. It is distressing for the community because if this can happen suddenly to one family, it can happen on a more widespread basis. I and the people in this area are keen to <Col N="611" /> know the outcome of the inquiry and I am sure the Minister will provide those details.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt): I thank the Senator for raising this issue on the Adjournment. There are guidelines in the Eastern Regional Health Authority to deal with the matter of clusters of health events in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the public health department of the Eastern Regional Health Authority that a small group was convened and a number of meetings were held in relation to this issue. Steps taken to deal with concerns over the alleged increase in brain haemorrhages include area medical officers contacting general practitioners in the locality regarding deaths from brain haemorrhage in the under 40 years of age group. A concise literature review was carried out in the area of cerebral haemorrhages and a number of causes for different types of haemorrhages were identified.</P>
    <P>Data on brain haemorrhages was obtained from the Central Statistics Office in relevant age groups from zero to 39 years of age for the period 1995 to 1999. However, nothing specific was noted in the data. The data available referred to Dublin County borough within the Eastern Regional Health Authority and a breakdown into smaller areas was not available. The data for causes of death for 1999 for the Ringsend docklands area is not yet available. Hospital in-patient inquiry data was also reviewed in relation to the Dublin 4 area. From the information available, I am advised that nothing out of the ordinary was found. However, the public health department of the authority will not draw any final conclusions until 1999 mortality data from the Ringsend area is available.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said, 12 deaths is high in any one area. A family history of brain haemorrhages is usually significant, but I await the final breakdown and report on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, for coming into the House to discuss an important issue for many people with disabilities who are less fortunate than able bodied people.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the regulations dealing with community employment schemes, particularly the regulation which states that after three years on the scheme a participant is obliged to leave it. When community employment schemes were established and this regulation was brought into force the intention was that suitable training would be provided to ensure that participants could return to the workforce. Community employment schemes have been successful, but because we are close to full employment there are not as many participants as there were in the past.</P>
      <P>Many hundreds of people are affected by this issue but one case which came to my attention recently was that of personal assistants to persons with disabilities who are employed on community employment schemes. They have an important job and they have the benefit of substantial training. They develop an excellent one-to-one relationship with the person for whom they are caring.</P>
      <P>A person has participated as a personal assistant for the last three years. He is 63 years of age, enjoys what he does and has a good working relationship with the person who has the disability. Unfortunately, because of the regulations he will be obliged to come off the scheme from the end of this month. I call on the Minister to relax the regulations to ensure that people doing this work have the benefit of additional training, whether it be in physiotherapy or in other caring areas.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that a person so well qualified who has developed a good relationship with a person with disability should have to come off the scheme. It is a huge loss to the person with a disability and a huge disappointment to the person doing the work as a personal assistant who finds the work most rewarding. It would, therefore, be very beneficial if the rules were relaxed.</P>
      <P>If the person has to come off the scheme, then the person with disability and FÁS must find another suitable person through the community employment programme. That person must then develop the same one-to-one relationship and undergo the same training. We are wasting the resources of the State in this way. If and when these people must come off this scheme perhaps the health boards and health services would consider favourably employing them as carers, because they have acquired the necessary training skills over a three year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue has wider implications. Other issues could be considered through the community <Col N="613" /> employment schemes. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt): I thank the Senator for raising this important matter. I share his particular interest in it. Following Government approval in 1999, the community employment programme is being restructured to take account of falling unemployment levels and to better target available places at older long-term unemployment persons. As part of this process and in consultation with the social partners, a decision was taken to reduce gradually the numbers employed on community employment programme from an average of 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by 2003. The Government's restructuring decision also included, among other measures, a new three year limit on participation in the community employment programme, except in the case of island residents, to discourage repeated participation on the programme.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the community employment programme is part of an overall shift in strategic policy in favour of greater investment in training places, especially for persons under the age of 25 years and the long-term unemployed. In this context it is necessary for FÁS, as the operation agency for the programme, to prioritise projects according to need. FÁS currently gives priority to caring and support projects based in the community and voluntary sector, including services for persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the community employment programme also involved the proposed mainstreaming of certain essential services, including services for disabled persons. Mainstreaming in the context of the community employment programme is the term used to describe the proposed transfer of funding and the provision of services to the relevant mainline Department with direct responsibility for the area concerned. My Department is giving active consideration in the first instance to the mainstreaming of community employment programme services to schools in regard to school secretaries, caretakers, classroom assistants and to persons with disabilities with regard to personal assistance.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the PPF standing committee, which operates under the aegis of my Department, will discuss the outcome of these discussions on the labour market with the social partners. According to an audit of the community employment programme essential services undertaken by FÁS in November 1999, 1,822 programme participants were engaged in personal assistant services at a cost of approximately £14.5 million. A more recent audit of these services undertaken in September 2000 indicates that there are currently 1,900 participants on programme schemes providing these services at a cost of approximately £15 million. To ensure that <Col N="614" /> the services provided under the programme to persons with disabilities are not adversely affected by the restructuring, these services are currently classified as a priority by FÁS and are, therefore, protected from the phased reduction which has been imposed on other categories of projects, such as in the environment and education sectors.</P>
    <P>The Senator will appreciate that the short-term nature of participation in the community employment programme, three years now being the maximum term, is not compatible with the needs of persons with disability, where personal bonds of sensitivity and flexibility are essential. The proposed mainstreaming would, therefore, have positive implications for the provision of these services in the future in terms of creating more permanent funding conditions for their delivery. The Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for funding in this area, is supportive of the proposal in principle and the two Departments, in consultation with FÁS, are now looking at the modalities involved. I hope these discussions can be completed as soon as possible, enabling the proposed new funding arrangements to be put in place by the Department of Health and Children at an early date.</P>
    <P>The new national support employment programme for persons with disabilities, as announced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, last July has now commenced and is being administered by FÁS. The object of the programme is to integrate people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market and to provide them with the support required to achieve their integration into the workplace. Emphasis will be on matching people's ability to suitable jobs in the labour market. Under the programme a job coach will be assigned to the disabled person to find a suitable job with a local employer and to provide ongoing support to both the employer and the employee as necessary. It is intended that this support will gradually decrease as the employed become more confident in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Other supports to employers also available for FÁS will include disability awareness training grants for the workforce, grants for the retraining of employees who acquire a disability during their working lives and workplace adaptation grants. The support employment programme and the new grants, which will be available shortly, will be accessible through FÁS. FÁS has invited applications for funding under the programme from organisations already working to integrate people with disabilities into open employment.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I, as Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, are both very concerned to make progress on this important issue. I am confident this package of new measures will lead to a substantial improvement in services for people with disabilities.</P>
