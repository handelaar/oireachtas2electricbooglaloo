      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House I wish to extend a vote of sympathy to the family and colleagues of the late Mr. Tom McEllistrim, who served in this House from 1987 to 1989. I will leave it to his constituency colleagues and Senator Tom Fitzgerald in particular to give a more complete appreciation of his life, but it is worth noting that he was Minister of State at the Department of Finance in 1979. The outcome of recent Irish history might be different if the four votes that defeated him in the 1987 general election had been cast in his favour. That was the election in which Deputy Spring narrowly survived.</P>
      <P>We must also be conscious of the great republican tradition of the McEllistrim family and the fact that such long, distinguished and uninterrupted service was given by both Mr. McEllistrim and his father from the foundation of the State. That is a remarkable achievement. His father served here for 46 successive years &ndash; from 1923 to 1969 &ndash; and Tom himself was a distinguished public servant. I extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, son and daughter and to his brother and sister. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Tom McEllistrim. He was someone I knew from the time I arrived in this House. He always took an interest in getting to know new Members and was always very helpful. He was steeped in the tradition of Fianna Fáil. His family were founding members of the party. As the Deputy Leader has said, the long and virtually unbroken tradition of service by the McEllistrims in Dáil Éireann to the people of Kerry is something very few families can equal. It was a great disappointment to him when he lost his seat. He served in this House, which I think he did not particularly like &ndash; he was not at home <Col N="678" /> here. I think he felt his proper place was in the other House and he eventually returned there for his last term.</P>
      <P>He was someone I was always pleased to meet. He was friendly and very conscious of his roots and the people he served. He was probably one of the sharpest dressers in the House. He always looked a great deal younger than his age and he had a great love of life. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to salute his record of service and convey our sympathy to his family on the death of a very decent man.</P>

      <P>Growing up in Kerry in a political household where there were always arguments about which side of the fence one should be on, Tommy Mac was the name that resonated through many of these arguments. I was elected here in 1987 and he joined this House at that time. Some of my colleagues asked me to point out that some of the media missed the fact that he also gave distinguished service in this House. He was very friendly and supportive to me as a fellow county person during that period. I always found him open and helpful and a source of good local information. We on the Independent benches would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his family and party, particularly to his wife, son and daughter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and condolences to the family of the late Tom McEllistrim. It is clear from his distinguished record at local and national level that he and his family have given enormous service to this State from 1923 to 1992. He gave an even more extensive service at local level in the county council, the GAA and the Chamber of Commerce. He served his country and county well. I did not know him personally but I recall being on tenterhooks on the day and night of the final count between himself and the then leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, when a small margin of four votes separated them. That was tragic for his family and it brought to an end in the lower House the service of father and son from 1923 to 1987. I wish to offer my condolences to his family, the people of Kerry, Fianna Fáil and to his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret that we learned of the death of Tom McEllistrim, a former Member of this House and of the lower House. I knew Tom throughout all my political life and I knew his father before Tom came on the scene. In 1974 when I was elected to Kerry County Council in the same electoral division as Tommy Mac, which was the Tralee division, I received help, advice and guidance from him. He was affectionately known as Tommy Mac throughout Kerry. There was a period when part of south Kerry, namely the Dingle peninsula, was <Col N="679" /> part of the constituency of Kerry North, so Tommy Mac was also our TD for many years.</P>
      <P>Tom lived in Ballymacelligott and was first elected to the Dáil in 1969, succeeding his late father, also Thomas, who served as a Deputy for Kerry North between 1923 and 1969. Some years ago, shortly before Tommy lost his seat in the Dáil, a huge celebration was held in Ballymacelligott by the McEllistrim family of 60 years of unbroken service to the people of Kerry.</P>
      <P>He continued a long tradition of public service and served with distinction as a Minister of State, Dáil Deputy and a county councillor. He came from very strong Fianna Fáil roots and was fiercely loyal to his party, something that maybe is not as relevant today as it was then. I say that without any disrespect to any other party but Tommy only saw one party &ndash; the Fianna Fáil Party. It was back and white with him and that was it and he made no apologies to anyone for that.</P>
      <P>Tom served as a Dáil Deputy until 1987, as has already been mentioned, when he lost his Dáil seat to the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Dick Spring, by a margin of four votes. To most people this would be a very severe blow, but surprisingly Tommy took it in his stride. He knew the ups and downs and the cut and thrust of political life and he accepted that he had lost his seat by the smallest of margins. He was then nominated by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, to serve in this House. He served with quite a number of people who are here today.</P>
      <P>Tom was a great representative of the people of Kerry and was very active locally and nationally. He was a great source of support and strength to everyone. Even until last Christmas he was still an adviser to quite a few of what one might call the grassroots people of Kerry. They still went to him and looked on the family with reverence. I pass Tom Mac's house every week when I come and go to Dublin and I went down to Tom's just before Christmas. It was with some surprise, to be quite truthful, that I learned of his death. It was a bit of a shock to me because I did not realise he was so ill.</P>
      <P>Tom can take a fair amount of credit for much development in Kerry, particularly the Kerry county airport, just at his doorstep. He served Kerry County Council for many years and is now succeeded by another Tom McEllistrim. He worked tirelessly for everybody. I join with other Senators in this vote of sympathy to his wife, Marie, his son Tom McEllistrim and his daughter Anne. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to be associated with the warm words of tribute to Tom McEllistrim who has sadly passed on. I got to know him very well on Kerry County Council from 1991 to 1999. He had served on that council since 1967. <Col N="680" /> Contrary to some of what we have read, he was very loyal to the leaders of his party and his father, Tom McEllistrim, had the honour of proposing Jack Lynch for the leadership of Fianna Fáil in 1966. He too was a thorough gentleman. He did me a turn on one occasion, though not in a political way I hasten to add, but he was that kind of man.</P>
      <P>There is another story of which the House may not be aware. There was a great friendship between the McEllistrims and the Scarteen O'Connors. The story is often told that had communication in those days been as it is today, they might not have ended up on opposite sides.</P>
      <P>I am informed by more senior Members that, as the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in 1979, Tom McEllistrim oversaw a number of improvements in the House to Members' advantage. Since 1991 I found him a fair and impartial chairman of Kerry County Council. He was a man who often said bluntly what he felt. He did not hide his views. He liked the company of politicians and he was always like a politician. He could be discreet and diplomatic, as evidenced by his response to journalists on a famous occasion when he said, &ldquo;What shots?&ldquo;</P>
      <P>He enjoyed politics and the company of politicians. Those of us who knew him will miss him. I join Members of the House in extending my sympathy to his wife, Marie, his son, Tom, and his daughter, Anne Marie.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the future role of vocational education committees and their involvement in the development of adult education programmes and with new education centres.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to consider the importance of our State airports as fundamental infrastructural utilities that have huge influence on the vibrancy or otherwise of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify if the Office of Public Works intends to vacate its depot at the Military Barracks, Summerhill, Nenagh, and, if so, to outline the reasons and when it will take place.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to allocate additional emergency funding towards the Mozambique flooding disaster.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure that all recreational and sporting buildings and structures are free of asbestos.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Chambers, O'Meara, Taylor-Quinn and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Chambers's and Senator Taylor-Quinn's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule Senator Costello's matter out of order as the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation has no official responsibility in this matter. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, a motion regarding the specification of the Grand Canal docks area. This will be taken from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. with a proposed time of ten minutes per speaker. No. 2, Committee Stage of the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1998, will be taken from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Private Members' business will be No. 20, motion 16, in the name of the Fine Gael Senators. The afternoon's business will recommence at 8 p.m. if it has not previously concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Members will agree with my appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use every effort and all his powers to convey to his colleagues in the European Union the urgency of the situation in Mozambique. The reaction has not been nearly as rapid or as extensive as it should have been. While we, as one country, cannot do very much we could do more and we could put pressure on our colleagues to realise the urgency of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who is watching the excellent series on the history of modern Ireland by Seán Ó Mordha on RTÉ will be struck by the extraordinary professionalism, from the beginning, of the Irish Army. At every key point in our history the <Col N="682" /> Army has been thoroughly professional. It is a national scandal that due to the actions and the incompetence of the Minister for Defence the Army chiefs and the Army are now being put in a new situation where the Army is behaving in a way which many people do not regard as proper for an army. The fault for this lies squarely with the Minister. Last week the Deputy Leader informed us that a compromise had been found which would resolve all the issues. They certainly have not been resolved and the situation has worsened. Nobody likes to see the present situation.</P>
    <P>I ask for a debate in the near future on the Government's policy on decentralisation. Decentralisation <i>per se</i> is a good thing, but what we have seen recently is that Ministers are taking parts of their Departments, like apples from a tree, and putting them in their constituencies, irrespective of the merits of the case. People join the public service with certain expectations that they will live in a certain place and be able to make plans about their children, their education and their future. In a totally arbitrary way they are being told in an abrupt manner that they must either move to a particular part of the country or leave the public service. As I understand it, five other agencies are on the hit list for decentralisation without any consultation. If we are to have decentralisation, which can be a good thing, let us have a debate and hear the reasons for it but not have Government agencies used by Ministers as a means of enhancing support in their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of issues. I had a letter yesterday from a classroom of young pupils who asked why the rest of the world does not do something about Mozambique and why cannot they do practical things. If necessary, they should be sent boats, engines and material. It is important that this country, as a small nation, should be seen to take a stand on world affairs such as this in a practical way. I will not dwell on it in detail but I would like to hear what the Department of Foreign Affairs intends to do in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of the national minimum wage, there are soundings coming from the employers and the chambers of commerce who have been parsimonious with regard to the low paid in national talks. We are now awaiting the minimum wage legislation. People all over the country are working for very low wages. For people in all unions, the minimum wage proposals are the absolute minimum that anyone is prepared to accept. That is a plank and a foundation stone on which this scheme is constructed and if it is pulled away there will be no deal. If the Government is tardy in bringing forward the legislation we need to hear its plans. I do not think the Government is at fault but rather that the chambers of commerce are trying to ride a couple of different <Col N="683" /> horses at the same time. It is unacceptable that the low paid should become another bargaining chip.</P>
    <P>Given that the Deputy Leader, many others and I support the Shannon River Council Bill and given that the Leader is away for a week, is the Deputy Leader prepared to grasp the nettle and put it on the Order of Business for tomorrow? Let us go ahead and do our business and show we can get on without him, even though we show much appreciation of him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with Senator O'Toole. This is the opportunity to clean up the Shannon. Let us get going on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate for Ireland to bring influence to bear on the European Union with regard to the situation in Mozambique. This should be done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister to tell the House what he proposes to do about this matter? The Minister might be asked to do this tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The publication of the White Paper on Defence appears to have gone terribly wrong. It now appears that the White Paper will have to be totally rewritten. Will the Deputy Leader arrange to hold a debate on defence? The Minister has dealt with this matter most unsatisfactorily.</P>
      <P>The Minister now proposes to transfer sections of the Army headquarters to his own town of Roscrea. This smacks of petty aggrandisement and is not acceptable. Such smash and grab raids by Ministers on their Departments are happening far too often. I agree with Senator Manning that a discussion on decentralisation is called for.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste made a statement yesterday regarding the importation of 200,000 skilled immigrants to deal with the labour shortage. It is necessary to have a debate on this question. On the one hand, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is firmly placing legal obstacles in the way of recognising economic refugees while, on the other, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment proposes to round up workers from the highways and byways of the European Union and applicant countries. The Government's policy on immigration must be clarified. If the Tánaiste's proposal is acted upon massive social problems will arise in housing, education and so on. Will the Deputy Leader arrange to have a debate on this matter?</P>

      <P>I call on the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the House to discuss the health aspects and dangers of dioxin emissions from thermal treatment plants. This is particularly necessary in view of the 1999 EU report on dioxins which was published late last year. This report contains alarming findings regarding dioxin levels in Britain and in mainland Europe which are sometimes three to four times the acceptable WHO level. As we face the challenge of waste management and the possible introduction of thermal treatment, we should examine all aspects and particularly the health aspects of this matter.</P>

However, we are in a very poor position to point the finger at any other country on pollution issues, considering our own very poor record in coming to terms with litter, the most visible form of all pollutions.

      <P>Were the Leader here he would be reminded of the various efforts made to have Partnership for Peace debated in the last session. We were unable to do so because the Government did not allow it. I am taking into account the comments of Senator Costello in seeking a debate on the Government White Paper on Defence. Almost simultaneously as the White Paper on Defence was published, the Fine Gael policy on neutrality &ndash; the suggestion we abandon neutrality &ndash; was published. We should have an urgent debate on our military capability, including the White Paper on Defence, as it would give us an opportunity to have an input into the second draft of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have a debate on Teagasc and, in particular, its concentration on genetically modified foods and organic foods. This House is the perfect place to have a dispassionate debate <Col N="685" /> which should involve science rather than emotions. I welcome the £25 million investment in Teagasc and the discussion opportunities in respect of genetically modified food and organic food. It could be a big threat but it could also provide us with a big opportunity. If we allow emotions to rule rather than science, we may miss a great opportunity. If we do not have a debate, however, we may find ourselves stepping into something which is a big mistake. Let us ensure we have such a debate soon.</P>

There are disturbing headlines in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> that Ireland is at the bottom of the league when it comes to the promotion of adult education. It is important that the White Paper is brought forward sooner rather than later. Many interested parties are awaiting it.

      <P>With other Senators I wish to address the question of Mozambique. This tragedy has not been addressed by the international community. Mozambique went through the trauma of many years of civil war where both sides were aided and abetted by other countries. They were supplied with arms, military equipment and anything they wanted so that the civil war could continue. Fortunately that civil war was brought to an end. Senator Connor and I, among others, were in Mozambique when the first elections took place and we saw the problems the civil war had created in terms of mines, the running down of agriculture and the rural economy. Over the past few years, there has been a renewal of spirit in Mozambique and it was beginning to rise up and grow in stature. De-mining was being put into operation.</P>
      <P>As Senator Costello asked, why does the rest of the world not do something? The people who supplied arms to Mozambique during the civil war should do something now. It is a nonsense that there are nine operational helicopters taking people from nearly 1,000 sq. km. of land. South Africa has provided between two and four helicopters but they are not operational at the same time. The international community and the African countries neighbouring Mozambique have not been helpful.</P>
      <P>While we can do only a limited amount, I ask the Leader to contact the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development co-operation to see if we can get the relevant organisations together, such as Concern, Trócaire, Goal and the Department of Foreign Affairs, to make a concentrated effort to send money or the practical necessities to Mozambique. On radio this morning there were five separate&mdash;</P>

The organisations concerned should be brought together immediately to ascertain if a concerted effort can be made.

I ask the Deputy Leader to do whatever he can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to No. 20 on the Order Paper, motion 10 which calls on the Government to establish a national paid holiday to value women's work. When I raised this matter before the Leader of the House gave an indication that he would grant a debate on 8 March, International Women's Day. I understand there is a proposal to change this to half an hour at lunch-time tomorrow. I hope this can be altered again. Serendipity is a wonderful thing. St. Brigid has smiled upon us and it will be my Private Members' time on 8 March and I propose to take the motion to which I referred. I would like the Deputy Leader to inform me if it is possible to substitute the half hour debate on a day which is not appropriate to the two hours which St. Brigid has granted us on International Women's Day.</P>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach will remember I raised the question of decentralisation two weeks ago. I am very glad that various Members of the House share my view that there is a curious coincidence about the fact that every time a Department is moved it is moved to the relevant Minister's constituency. If there is to be decentralisation why not, as a very sensible person said on the wireless the other day, move to the suburbs of Dublin? This would certainly help to alleviate some of the traffic problems and would not cause as much disruption for the civil servants involved.</P>
      <P>The question of Mozambique should be discussed. I lend my support to calls for a debate on the matter. Further flooding is expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of genetically modified food has been raised many times. I could not agree more with my distinguished colleague, Senator Quinn. Let us have an informed debate. I am not quite so much against emotion as he. Citizens are rightly concerned and they should be emotional, particularly when they are confronted with operations such as Monsanto which has a conviction in the American courts for falsifying scientific results. In the last week there has been information that scientific results on this subject were suppressed from within the Food and Drug Administration in America. If we are to have a debate informed <Col N="687" /> by science let us have the full facts, not the partial facts promoted by an international conglomerate which has a very murky reputation.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning referred to the fine historical series being broadcast on RTÉ produced by Seán Ó Mordha. It is a fine series except in one regard. It has, to date at least, completely excised the Labour Party from Irish history. I hope this will be corrected in future programmes. Perhaps an explanation will be given as to why there has been no reference to the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Defence to debate with us the role of the Army in the context of the White Paper on Defence, in particular its role in overseas operations, whether in eastern Europe or further afield? It appears that the downsizing of the Army will have huge implications for its role in overseas missions, of which it is proud. The matter should be debated as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Cox in calling on the Deputy Leader to make arrangements for a debate on thermal treatment or incineration at an early date. Waste management is probably one of the biggest challenges facing local government and there is much concern regarding not only the health aspects but the effects on agricultural producers of dioxin emissions. The debate we seek could cover all areas of waste management because incineration runs in the face of the minimisation of waste, which is one of the EU's objectives.</P>
      <P>I also want to raise the recent controversy involving a District Court judge and members of the Law Society. I do not wish to comment on the specific issues, but to avoid such unseemly controversies in the future I suggest it could be useful to provide for some system &ndash; this has been mentioned here previously &ndash; of monitoring decisions. This would involve self-regulation within the judicial system to provide checks and balances to ensure consistency in judicial decisions and also to avoid such events happening in the future.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that, contrary to the common misconception, Kerry is suffering severely from a shocking lack of funding. Many small counties, which I do not begrudge, are doing much better. For instance, in the recent allocations to local authorities Kerry ranked 14th even though it is ranked fifth in terms of size and eighth in terms of population. On top of that discrimination, I have been informed that the Cahirciveen marina project, which we had been led to believe was sanctioned, was not approved under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999. That project is badly needed there and it would fit in well. We <Col N="688" /> were led to believe it was on the way. This is a kick in the teeth.</P>

I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to come in tomorrow and discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>While that Minister is here, I also want to raise the other matter I raised recently, that is, the abuse of human rights in Chechnya.

No doubt the EU regulations are imposing a demand for treatment, which does not just involve recycling but which seems to place an emphasis on thermal treatment, on the Government, which, in turn, is imposing it on local authorities. There are alternatives which are worthy of a debate in this House. Such a debate would alleviate the fears of people or at least indicate whether their fears are justified about the possibility of dioxin emissions from thermal treatment, which apparently is being pushed by the Government.</P>

To print a picture of the house of a young woman who has four children because she is rich is disgraceful. It leaves her open to all kinds of threats and abuse which is despicable.</P>
      <P>Recently I called for a debate on the United Nations institutions &ndash; I refer in particular to the Taiwanese-Chinese problem which we should not be afraid to tackle. It may come as a surprise to this House that if Taiwan offers help to Mozambique in the form of medical or financial aid, the World Health Organisation blocks that aid from getting there.

Although it does not seem to be too serious a problem for some, inflation is running at 5%, or 3% above the European Union average. I read what the relevant Minister said and about the blame being placed on smoking and the cost of cigarettes, which is relevant. However, house prices are not included in our inflation rate. We are giving a false impression of the real situation.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to get the relevant Minister to come to the House because it is very serious that inflation is running at 3% above the average European Union rate?

      <P>That is something which the Minister for Foreign Affairs would fail to understand as well. I am sure he will make his views forcefully known to the European Union and through international fora. It would be useful if we could debate the issue, although I am not sure if the Minister is available tomorrow. We will consult <Col N="690" /> with the Whips after the Order of Business to see what can be done. It would be desirable to debate this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The matter of the Defence Forces was raised by Senators Manning, Costello and Quinn and several others. It is important to state what the Taoiseach said about this issue in the other House this morning on the Order of Business. He said, &ldquo;The Government will implement the contents of the White Paper, the note of the agreement of last Thursday and the Government decision yesterday. They will all be fully implemented.&rdquo;  That fairly conclusively gives the Government's position on this issue. We all hope that the difficulties which arose are now behind us and that the Defence Forces can go forward well motivated and well equipped to deal with the international and domestic obligations they have always fulfilled so well on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the national minimum wage. The legislation will come before the House and some of the points the Senator raised can be made at that stage. I understand the legislation is imminent in the Dáil. It should be with us next week or the week after but I stand to be corrected on that.

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Meara, Hayes and other Senators raised a point about decentralisation. I am not aware of a threat by any member of Government to the effect that people are being told, &ldquo;You move, or you leave.&rdquo;  I cannot envisage that being said. I am in favour of decentralisation, like many of the Senators who have spoken on it. While Members are critical of Ministers for transferring parts of Departments to their constituencies, every Member of the House will want part of a Department for his or her constituency. I am sure Senator Coghlan would welcome the transfer of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to Caherciveen to sort out all the problems to which he referred and which could have been dealt with on the Adjournment.</P>

While that relates to people from within the European Union and other areas, there seems to be an impression abroad that such people will be economic refugees and illegal immigrants. That is not the case. We must accept we have a skills shortage and a labour shortage. If we are to fulfil the objectives of the national development plan, we will need skilled labour and that labour is in short supply. Some of what is being said on this issue borders on racism.</P>

      <P>The matter of the thermal treatment of waste and the threat of dioxins should be debated. It is related to the issue of litter raised by Senator Quill. We will have to face up to making some difficult decisions on these issues in the near future. One of the most negative images visitors take away of this country is the degree to which they see litter in the countryside. We will try to find time to debate the issue of dioxins raised by Senators Cox, Walsh and Coogan.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman asked about the Children Bill and the Mental Health Bill. Those Bills are at order for Second Stage before the Dáil. They have commenced their passage and as soon as they have been completed in the Dáil they will come to this House.

      <P>Senator Quinn made a point about the Defence Forces. While we have discussed GM foods and organic foods in the past, given the developments taking place at a very rapid rate in this area, it would be useful to revisit these issues. I will see if time can be provided to discuss them.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer Senator McDonagh's question on the White Paper on Adult Education, but I will try to get an answer on it and communicate with him.</P>

    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of a national women's day and the possibility that we might deal with it in the morning. I am anxious to facilitate the Senator. Perhaps the Whips could discuss <Col N="692" /> the matter with him to see if he could discuss it during his Private Members' time rather than tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>Senator Walsh raised the issue of District Court decisions. While the practice is that we do not comment on those decisions, he has raised the issue of inconsistencies in regulations and that is something we can consider.</P>
      <P>As to the Cahirciveen marina project which was raised by Senator Coghlan, I am absolutely lost on that issue. It is something that might be raised on the Adjournment in the context of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Senator Ó Murchú had to say about Chechnya which does seem to have left the headlines to some extent. The humanitarian catastrophe there is of a similar scale to the one in Mozambique, although caused by war rather than a natural disaster. That is something we should not forget.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned the matter of dioxins which was raised by Senator Coogan, and the issue of decentralisation raised by Senator Hayes. Senator Lydon raised the issue of a press council and we have had debates on defamation in the past. It is a subject we should return to, along with the UN institutions. As regards inflation, the Minister for Finance will be bringing the Finance Bill to the House in the near future when those points can be made directly to him.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following order in draft:&ndash;</P>
      <P>Specification of Grand Canal Docks Area as an area for which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority may prepare a planning scheme,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft form before the Seanad on 14th day of February, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to move this important motion, the passing of which <Col N="693" /> will pave the way for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to prepare a planning scheme for the Grand Canal Basin. For the benefit of Senators I would like to outline the background to this motion and to the operation of the planning scheme approach which has been a central part of the development and regeneration of the Dublin docklands since the great enterprise to renew this part of Dublin commenced in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>The draft order which is the subject of this resolution is being made under section 6(3) of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997. This provides that any order under section 25(1) of that Act &ndash; the section under which planning schemes are prepared &ndash; shall not be made until both Houses of the Oireachtas have approved a draft of the order. This procedure is required where section 25 planning schemes are being prepared for areas outside the Custom House Docks area. The effect of making a planning scheme for an area is that development within that area which complies with the scheme will be exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.</P>
      <P>While the planning scheme approach was considered appropriate to facilitate in a coherent, integrated and accelerated fashion the development of the Custom House Docks area, a similar approach would not be appropriate for the wider docklands as a whole, and the restricted approach to the application of planning schemes is the rationale behind the section 6 provision. In keeping with the terms of the legislation, the master plan adopted by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997 identifies just three areas outside the Custom House Docks street area &ndash; Sheriff Street, the Poolbeg Peninsula and the Grand Canal Basin &ndash; as being suitable for the preparation of planning schemes.</P>
      <P>We are also breaking new ground in other ways. At 94 acres, this is the largest area for which a planning scheme has been prepared since redevelopment of the docklands commenced. Unlike the Custom House Docks area which had publicly owned lands, this diverse area includes a significant amount of properties in private ownership. The master plan envisaged this area as being the key to achievement of the plan's objectives on the south side of the Liffey. It is a part of Dublin that has seen little private investment and is relatively isolated, access being an identified problem.</P>
      <P>Removing that sense of remoteness from the centre of the city is a priority and the provision of an improved transport infrastructure looms large in the range of objectives as envisaged by the master plan. When I opened the City Quay section of the splendid new linear park on the campshires recently, I was often amazed by the number of people who have been living in Dublin for years or even generations but who have never been to the place where the waters of the Dodder and the Grand Canal meet up with Anna Livia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must be addressed in the overall programme which the authority is implementing and <Col N="694" /> the planning process can obviously assist in meeting master plan objectives in this regard. The integrated planning framework of a planning scheme will also provide property owners, residents and business interests with a major, once off opportunity to participate in the social and economic redevelopment of this important and diverse part of Dublin.</P>
    <P>A criticism sometimes levelled at planning schemes as they have operated is that they afford a means of bypassing the rigours of the normal planning process and, in particular, recourse to the third party appeal system operated by An Bord Pleanála. That line of argument misses the point. For the reasons I have already mentioned, planning schemes are only appropriate in certain limited circumstances and the authority was mindful of this in developing the master plan. In terms of how people are affected, a planning scheme is based heavily on wide public consultation at all stages before, during and after the draft planning scheme has been prepared, whereas in the normal planning permission process the public can only respond after a planning application has been made. I also stress that if developers so wish they can apply to Dublin Corporation for planning permission in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The consultative process also involves the participation of relevant State agencies and Dublin Corporation. Once the scheme has been approved by the Minister, the authority is then in a position to certify the developers' proposals as being compliant with the scheme, thus in effect providing planning permission.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal Basin is the next frontier in so far as implementation of the master plan is concerned and the authority is anxious to press ahead with preparation of the draft planning scheme which has culminated in the draft order before the House. Most of the area fronts the Liffey, the canal or the Dodder. The authority has already prepared and adopted an area action plan for the Grand Canal Docks which has involved considerable consultation with the local communities. In view of my quasi-judicial role in relation to the approval process for planning schemes, I cannot make any comment on the various proposals which the authority has or is developing for the area, but I understand the authority hopes to be in a position to submit the draft scheme for my approval by July next.</P>
    <P>The scheme itself must consist of a written statement and a plan indicating how the authority believes the area should be redeveloped. In that context it must address issues such as the nature and extent of the development, the distribution and location of uses, design proposals, transportation proposals and also deal with the development of amenities and the conservation of architectural heritage or other relevant features. The planning scheme has been very much at the heart of the redevelopment of the docklands, providing a coherence and accelerated planning process which has given us many fine buildings and <Col N="695" /> amenities in the redeveloped area. The fact that the IFSC now employs more than 8,500 people is indicative of the success of what has been achieved in the docklands since the 1980s. IFSC 2 is at an advanced stage and will provide much needed commercial office space, which is crucial given the docklands' status as the hub for the financial services industry. Small retail units are also being provided in the Custom House Docks area and there are plans for the development of restaurants in the area, including the campshires.</P>
    <P>The former gasworks site on Sir John Rogerson's Quay forms part of the area covered by the draft order. The master plan stated that a planning scheme for the Grand Canal Docks would not be proceeded with until arrangements were agreed for the decontamination of this site. The site is now in the ownership of the authority and I am glad that following receipt of the necessary Environmental Protection Agency licensing and planning permission, preliminary works have commenced on the site. It is expected that remediation works will be completed in two years' time on the first major site.</P>
    <P>An important plank in the authority's programme of redevelopment is the provision of social and affordable housing. The master plan envisages the population of the docklands rising by 25,000 over the 15 year period of the programme and has set an ambitious target of 20% of residential units to be allocated to social and affordable housing. The authority is providing approximately 45 houses at East Road and 37 units are also being provided in the IFSC 2 area as part of the residential project being provided by a private developer. These latter units will be managed by the St. Pancras Housing Association. Last year the authority launched an affordable housing scheme aimed at people living in the docklands and this scheme will assist those wishing to purchase units in these and future schemes being provided in the area. The authority will push ahead with its plans for the provision of social and affordable housing and the operation of a planning scheme in the Grand Canal Basin will strengthen the authority's hand in meeting master plan objectives in this important area.</P>
    <P>The authority is also pressing ahead with its Saol Scoil approach, which involves the promotion of lifelong learning in the docklands. Implementation of the local labour charter continues to offer real employment opportunities for local people. The DDDA/Reuters Schools Job Placement Programme, the community training workshop at Seville Place and various other community development projects will greatly enhance the range of opportunities for young people in the docklands.</P>
    <P>We are creating a docklands development for docklands people. I am frequently told by elected representatives and community groups from the area how attitudes of previously socially marginalised communities have changed, particularly in the area of education and training. People now <Col N="696" /> see a real prospect of making a rewarding and fulfilling life in their own place. We should not understate that achievement and what has been and is being done here gives a lead which others might follow in terms of tackling social marginalisation in a coherent, integrated way by providing jobs and opportunities to better oneself and by helping people to find their career niche based on their aptitudes and capabilities.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Dáil unanimously adopted this resolution and today we take another vital step. It is important for the authority that the Oireachtas backs what it is trying to achieve in the docklands and this can only strengthen and support it in implementing the master plan. I have no hesitation in commending the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right in saying this is an extraordinary area with huge potential, yet because of the way in which the city has developed, it is an area where very little development has taken place and which is in many ways isolated from the rest of the city. There is a sense of separateness about it in that it has not shared the development over the years and there is a sense of distance from other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>The document the Minister has circulated is helpful. However, it is largely aspirational which, by definition, must be the case. It sets out the objectives the Minister hopes to achieve, including the creation of new jobs, the development of the physical infrastructure in the area and the provision of better transport. In all of these aspirational documents there is mention of the mix of housing, particularly socially affordable housing, shops, cultural artefacts and services which will give the area a life of its own. It is precisely because of my worries about earlier developments that I want to signal a few worries about this development. These arise largely from happenings at present in the Spencer Dock development. One can listen to people coming from very different points on the spectrum, such as Fr. John Wall, the priest in the area, or Dermot Desmond, international financier and a man of great vision, who was almost certainly the progenitor of the International Financial Services Centre. When people on these two ends of the spectrum voice concerns, it is time to take notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential criticisms of the Spencer Dock area and what has happened so far in the Financial Services Centre is the lack of integration, the sense of areas being built which are out of harmony and out of tune with the rest of the history and natural environment in which they operate. We have heard the fears of the residents who live <Col N="697" /> close to Spencer Dock. When one looks at the montage of what is proposed, these people have very real fears. People who live close to Croke Park and Lansdowne Road when large stands are built suffer a very definite deterioration in the quality of their lives as a result of these developments. These effects would be just a fraction of what will happen if some of the plans as envisaged go ahead. I am aware that a public inquiry is taking place and that various groups will have a chance to make their case. However, it is important that living communities should not be displaced by something which is, in effect, a foreign body being placed in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre as conceived was to be a centre with a very definite identity which would be integrated into the rest of the city. That integration was meant to enhance and extend the city and to draw a diversity of different audiences, and much more. At one level we can look at the International Financial Services Centre which is a very real success; I would be the first to say that. Some 9,000 people work there and there is a corporate tax take of over £400 million per annum, and growing. However, when we look at the International Financial Services Centre, we do not see a sense of integration into the city. We do not see the museums, marinas or public parks and so on which were promised when the International Financial Services Centre was being conceived. These things have not happened even though we were told they would happen. There is often a very great leap between what developers promise and what happens in reality. There are often very good reasons, one at a time, these things do not happen.</P>
    <P>The IFSC today is essentially an island. It is almost a foreign body within the city as far as most Dubliners are concerned. On Sunday evenings people do not bring the children for walks to look at the buildings around the International Financial Services Centre in the same way they go to Bray, Howth, St. Stephen's Green and so on. The IFSC is not seen by Dublin people as part of the living city. That is not what Dermot Desmond envisaged or what was promised when the concept began. Spencer Dock is a warning and we will have just one chance to get that development right. There are lessons, both good and bad, to be learned from what has happened in the IFSC. However, we must be careful not to create a whole area of Dublin which is not people friendly, which is there as a temple to mammon and commerce but not to the people of Dublin and which does not reflect the diversity that is Dublin and where people do not want to bring their children on a Sunday afternoon to experience a sense of ownership.   </P>
    <P>While I welcome the Minister and I am pleased he has given such a detailed outline of the draft order, it is important not to rush into developments which cannot be reversed. In relation to Spencer Dock, time should be taken to listen to the concerns of the people of Dublin and those <Col N="698" /> who will be affected by what will happen. Having said that, I thank the Minister for coming to this House and for what he had to say.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister and I compliment him on his presentation. I agree with the motion in relation to the specification of the Grand Canal Docks Area as an area for which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority may prepare a planning scheme. It is ironic, given that the Docklands Development Authority can, through the Minister and the Oireachtas, bypass normal procedures under local authority planning regulations and apply for planning permission to An Bord Pleanála, that some people would see this as a shortcut and a means of bypassing the normal procedures. Knowing the way the Docklands Development Authority has operated and the formula they use in terms of consultation on such a wide basis with the local communities, the local authority, business interests and in the context of their master plan, ironically the consortium with responsibility for the Spencer Dock project sought to bypass the Docklands Development Authority so that it could get a better deal from the local authority in terms of the planning process. This is a very interesting benchmark because the Docklands Development Authority wanted to see Spencer Dock developed within the context of the master plan. The master plan had some very fine models of practice in terms of height, density and mix but they were not prepared to adhere to this. Treasury Holdings Consortium, which put forward the plan for the 52 acre site, thought that Dublin Corporation would give them a better deal. They applied for permission to develop an area of six million square feet and Dublin Corporation granted permission for 4.7 million square feet, which was in excess of what the Docklands Development Authority was prepared to give.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of this horrendous planning application, which is currently being appealed, that we must look at what is taking place here. I hope the outcome of the oral hearing to An Bord Pleanála will be in accordance with the wishes of virtually every interest other than the particular consortium. I am ashamed that CIE as a semi-State body, which owned 51 of the 52 acres, should be the Trojan horse, the link with a private consortium to bring about a development which no one living in the area or who has anything to do with buildings, including An Taisce, the Docklands Development Authority or Dermot Desmond, wishes to see. If this proposal is rejected, CIE should go back to the Docklands Development Authority and, having consulted all the interested parties, put forward an integrated area plan which is in harmony with the developments to date along the docks in something like this form as an integrated area plan with all interests being consulted. It should be in harmony with the development to date along the docks on both the north and south sides of the Liffey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> I welcome this proposal, which involves consultation and a certain fast-tracking of the procedures for the much needed development of this derelict site. One of the strong points about the development is the requirement for not less than 20% social and affordable housing. That is the first hard target likely to be met in terms of our commitment to getting a mix of affordable social and private housing in this city.</P>
    <P>Too often we have bemoaned the fact that we have ghettoised sections of our community and our city by the manner in which huge complexes of flats or housing estates were built without proper amenities and totally separate from the private sector. This is an opportunity to move away from this and to put in a 20%-80% mix, which is a very desirable target. I understand that the mix will be something like 60% residential and 40% office and I would like to know if the Minister has any figures on the actual number of units of accommodation to be created.</P>
    <P>I was concerned about the figures given by the Minister on the developments taking place so far in social and affordable housing. He said, &ldquo;The authority is providing around 45 houses at East Road and 37 units are also being provided in the IFSC2 area as part of a residential project being provided by a private developer.&rdquo;  I understand there are at least 800 units of residential accommodation in part two of the financial services centre development. I would have thought that 20% of that would be about 200 units. A figure of 37 units seems a long way off the specified target in the master plan and it seems that up to now the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has not met its targets. What difficulties are being experienced with private developers in terms of targets that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is seeking to reach? Is it true that the only targets being met by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority are those relating to land owned by the authority itself rather than the percentage being provided from the private sector? </P>
    <P>Could a commitment be given now on the specification of the Grand Canal Docks Area in terms of the area development plan which will be carried out by the authority and the private sector? The interesting thing about this area is that it is one of the few areas with a mix of land owned by the docklands authority and by private developers. It is better to bring them all together in a master plan which means a controlled development rather than the individual applications coming before the planning authority. Land, buildings and structures owned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the private sector should all be incorporated in a proper master plan.</P>
    <P>What is the residential input involved in this? Could a commitment be given that this development will have a 20% mix, as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority told me and the local councillors, and as claimed by Peter Coyne yesterday in an presentation made by him to the <Col N="700" /> area committee of Dublin Central? It seemed that he was talking about a full 20%. At what figure will that work out in practice? Will there be a full 20% from all of the private developers who will build residential developments as well as building on the land owned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority?</P>
    <P>I would like some information on the gasworks site which is being decontaminated. In the past a major obstacle to the development of the overall site was the degree of contamination there during the gasworks operation. There is no facility for disposal of the contaminated material. The asbestos removed from the Hogan Stand in Croke Park is still packed away somewhere waiting for disposal to Germany or the Netherlands. The plan is much the same for this site. All the sludge and contaminated material will be dredged up, pumped into ships and taken to the Netherlands or to some other European country for disposal. Is that the case and how will it be ensured that the entire site is decontaminated? The full decontamination of the site is a serious concern if a large number of residential units are to be built there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals and those of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. I expect it will be a very fine development but I would like these concerns to be addressed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion on the specification of the Grand Canal Docks Area, which I support. This development must be orderly and planned with proper consultation. There must be consultation with residents and their views must be considered in any developments taking place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the very detailed speech by the Minister. The docklands is a derelict and unused area &ndash; that type of area is of no benefit to Dublin city. One must remove that sense of remoteness through development. Heritage areas and areas of architectural merit in this area must be preserved. I welcome the measures for affordable housing, which is the basis of the proper development of any area. One must give people an opportunity to move into an area with affordable housing. The Minister mentioned 20% of the residential units comprisinng affordable housing, which is very welcome.</P>
      <P>We see so many derelict sites, about which many people complain countrywide. When things are going well and the economy is thriving it is time to develop those areas, no matter where they are. This is an ideal opportunity to develop the docklands. Yesterday this motion was discussed in Dáil Éireann and unanimously adopted, which signifies the importance of the development. On behalf of this side of the House, I welcome the motion. I thank the Minister and his officials for outlining in great detail the proposals for the area.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the House. I welcome the motion. It is important that the development of Dublin continues in a controlled, proper and orderly manner. Undoubtedly, as the Minister said, the docklands have been a remarkable success in certain areas. I must confess &ndash;<i>mea culpa, mea maxima culpa</i>&ndash; that I was one of the doubters about the Irish Financial Services Centre. I remember pouring as much scorn and contumely as I could on the idea and I said it was a white elephant. However, I acknowledge that I was wrong. It has been a remarkable success. The buildings and the energy that has been released are exciting.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to some of the redevelopment work along the line of the river. In what he called the campshires, the linear development includes a cobbled park, trees, benches and public lighting. It is a delight and a joy. This is the type of development which should be favoured, although there are some problems such as the Spencer Dock development on the other side of the river to the Grand Canal site. Curious things are happening there. Undoubtedly, Kevin Roche is an architect of the greatest international distinction. Looked at singularly and out of context, the development appears to be architecturally exciting, especially the new conference centre. I hope this will be built because this city needs a conference centre and something as exciting and innovative architecturally as the proposal by that distinguished architect.</P>
      <P>However, I am worried about site density and scale and I hope these will be considered carefully in the Grand Canal development. One of the reasons I objected to the millennium spike in O'Connell Street was that I knew it would be used as a reference point in documentation from developers to increase the scale of projects. Dublin has certain distinctive qualities as a modern European city. It still has its 18th century core and a respect for humanity in terms of the scale of its buildings. We should not go down the awful, boring and bland route of sky scraper buildings. They are anonymous and inhuman and they scar so many European cities. We should keep the human feel which is one of the great attractions of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with great interest that a prominent member of the financial community, Mr. Desmond, has chosen to intervene and object. It is interesting that he has done so, but it is curious. <Col N="702" /> I also note that another development, the millennium mall, is being held up by a row between two sets of <i>Tyrannosauri rex</i> in terms of property developers who are hacking at each other. This is a very bad precedent because an important development is being held up by the selfishness and greed of two sets of property developers. As far as I am concerned, the sooner they get off the pitch and let the development go ahead, the better.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Grand Canal docks area development and I hope it will be monitored carefully. The Minister also referred to three areas outside the Custom House docks area, Sheriff Street, the Poolbeg peninsula and the Grand Canal basin. These are the only ones currently regarded as suitable for the preparation of planning schemes. I welcome the inclusion of Sheriff Street because traditionally it was an extremely deprived area of the city. Decent people lived there but it was vulnerable to the incursion of drugs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could give the House some information on the plans for the Poolbeg peninsula because this is an important amenity to the people of Dublin. The great South Wall, which was built by Captain Bligh of the <i>Bounty </i>in the late 18th century, is now closed to public access for repair work. I am not sure that a timescale has been given for the completion of that work. Is there any concrete news in that regard?</P>
    <P>Regarding the Grand Canal basin, the Minister wondered wistfully how many people have walked in this area and how many citizens of Dublin know about it. However, there may be more than he imagines. I remember the area as a small child. The Minister called it the confluence of the Dodder, the Grand Canal and Anna Livia. I remember it as a place of fascination for us as children because there was a set of locks and one could walk across on planks at that point. We often watched the emergence of the <i>Innishfallen,</i> the old coal boat, from the area. It caused great excitement and there was a romance about the area.</P>
    <P>I hope some form of historical survey will be carried out. There was a gasometer there and many people had a sentimental attachment to it. It is now gone and contaminated ground remains. There are technical problems with that and I am sure they can be solved. However, the gasometer site was also the site of earlier elements in Dublin's history. I remember inspecting it and seeing the remains of a fine plain building which had on the top, &ldquo;Mariners Church 1832&rdquo;. This was part of the site.</P>
    <P>Will a small handbook, a short history or a small exhibition on the area be prepared? For example, the remarkable cranes were there from an early part of Dublin's development. These were interesting mechanical artefacts from a lost industrial age. Another item which should be preserved is the early diving bell. It was a curious iron construction with a funnel. It looked like an enormous metal funnel, but it was a 19th century <Col N="703" /> diving bell. In many other countries such an item would be preserved. Perhaps there is an opportunity for the creation of an interpretative centre, although I hate to use that phrase. This area of the docks deserves to be celebrated even as it travels in the direction of 'yuppiedom'. Inevitably, this area, among others, was known to James Joyce. The little ferry which carried Joyce and his brother across was at that point, but it is now gone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal and that it will be a controlled development. I hope those responsible will be conscious of height and I applaud the fact that there will be affordable social housing in the area. I hope the target will be met. However, the lead on that did not come from central authority or Dublin Corporation, but from the decent ordinary people of City Quay. They were to be turfed out and relocated in some of the outer suburbs of Dublin, but as a parish and a community, and as people who knew each other, they wanted to stay together. They recognised the value of living together as a community so they upped stumps and refused to move &ndash; I remember the marches &ndash; and they got their housing. This is the nice housing which has the privilege now of looking out on the redeveloped linear park. The people of Dublin would not go, saying, &ldquo;This is where we live, this is where our traditions are&rdquo;. The people who lived there had been loaders, dockers and wharfhands. Their culture, pubs, schools and churches are there and they refused to have their community broken up. They stayed and eventually Dublin Corporation built them very decent housing. I hope we can continue this tradition because it is important that people continue to live in the heart of an area that is sometimes, unfortunately, seen just as an engine of economic regeneration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who have contributed in such a positive way to this debate. All decisions must be made on the basis of informed debate. I have been impressed by the range of issues raised and the various worthwhile and interesting suggestions which have been made and which can only benefit the process on which the Dublin Dockland Development Authority is about to embark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next stage of implementation of the master plan marks a challenging and exciting opportunity for the authority and the people of the Grand Canal Docks to transform and redevelop this area of our city. The support given by speakers today and by Dáil Éireann, which unanimously adopted this resolution yesterday, is a valuable public recognition of the important role which the authority has in implementing its master plan for the area. The broad political support for the master plan across the political spectrum means that where you have a strong consensus <Col N="704" /> that something has to be done, achieving your objectives will be that bit easier.</P>
    <P>As in all good debates there have been some points of criticism and I would like to deal with some of those issues. I understand the points made in relation to building height, an issue on which Dublin Corporation is currently preparing a study. This study will provide guidance on the height of buildings in the context of the overall planning of the city, including the docklands area. The results of this study are awaited. The height issue has been satisfactorily handled under previous planning schemes &ndash; the IFSC buildings come to mind. The Dublin Docklands Development Authority can deal with this issue in the context of the planning scheme which will be made for the Grand Canal Docks but that is a matter for them and is something I cannot comment on given the Minister's quasi-judicial role in the process.</P>
    <P>Social housing provision is an important plank of the master plan. Members will be aware that last year the Minister launched an affordable housing scheme for the Dublin Docklands Development Authority which is based on the shared ownership scheme, with additional features built in so that it opens up the prospect of home ownership to many people in the docklands area who otherwise could not aspire to it. This is a 15 year plan and the authority is committed to meeting the 20% social affordable objective.</P>
    <P>As regards the points made in relation to planning, I reiterate what the Minister said earlier. Planning schemes have only limited application and for this reason only three areas were identified. They have worked successfully in the past. There is no question of anybody trying to set aside proper planning controls or to leave people affected out of the process. Far from it. This system has a strong consultative base and everyone affected will have an opportunity to have their say. Developers who do not want to avail of the planning scheme option can opt instead for the normal planning permission route.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the gasworks site is being decontaminated. The necessary planning permission and EPA licence have been obtained. Under the EPA licence the decontamination works are being carried out to the highest environmental standards. The authority is satisfied that the process of extraction and disposal will be done in accordance with the best international practices.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Manning's point about the cultural life of the docklands. A considerable number of people live in the docklands area, some of whom are very involved in the development. The authority organises an annual docklands festival each summer &ndash; Flugtag 1999 etc. It is modest and local in its impact but it is growing and in 2000 will have a musical scheme. The authority is working with the St. Patrick's Festival committee and with Bloomsday (Joyce Society) to increase the relevance of these events in the docklands each year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> The Point Village development is likely to include a redevelopment of the Point Depot as an improved concert venue in a greatly enhanced environment. The campshires are being progressively developed as a public realm and during 2000 will include two new café-restaurants on the waterside at the IFSC 2.   The authority has commissioned a study on the leisure and tourism regeneration of the Liffey and intends to invest in implementing this regeneration and in the completion of the campshires project in the next three to four years.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 23, before &ldquo;sexual&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;physical or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments which have been grouped together refer to one of the fundamental and essential elements of this legislation. The legislation initiated by the Labour Party and accepted in principle by the Government is designed to start the process of redressing the balance to give rights of redress to those in our community who have been the subject of abuse in the past. The legislation has been debated in the Dáil. What we are trying to do in this small way and as part of the overall framework of legislation is to start the process of dealing with issues which are only now coming to light from the past, in particular the abuse of children at the hands of State institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many individual stories have emerged. There are many hundreds of examples of abuse, both physical and sexual, from a broad range of institutions, religious or formerly religious. We know we have to put together a framework of legislation to redress the balance and ensure the voices of those victims are heard. In regard to the commission being established, it is the Government's intention, judging from statements made, to ensure victims are properly heard and to introduce a measure of accountability and redress into this whole sorry saga. To a large extent the Government is approaching this in the correct manner. I ask the Government to listen carefully to victims and their representatives who are seeking meetings with the Government to discuss a number of their concerns about the terms of reference of the commission, their representation as victims prior to enduring commission sittings and <Col N="706" /> support for victims attending the commission and for the group which supports survivors on a wide range of issues, including this legislation. I have listened to the comments of this group and these individuals and I hope I can reflect some of their concerns.</P>
    <P>These amendments seek to re-insert the issue of physical abuse into the Bill. During its passage through the Dáil the issue of physical abuse was removed from the Bill by way of an amendment, in order to allow the Law Reform Commission to study the question of the definition of physical abuse before giving legislative effect to it. When my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, and I published this Bill, it was our intention that sexual and physical abuse would be covered by the legislation and this is still our desire. The question has been discussed at length in the Dáil and in this House on Second Stage. I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider his position. I hope he will say that, on consideration and having listened to the arguments, he will accept our point of view.</P>
    <P>In many cases it is impossible to make a distinction between the physical and sexual element of a recurring act of abuse. An instance of what might be considered to be physical abuse, such as a beating, might have a strong sexual element. How does one define such abuse? By removing the element of physical abuse from the Bill, we appear to downgrade it, to say it is less important or less traumatic than sexual abuse, although we know from those who have suffered this trauma that this is not so. It cannot be beyond the ability of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come up with a definition of physical abuse which would comply with the spirit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Last week I was party to a conversation which turned to reminiscences of an Irish Christian Brothers' school attended, at a particular time, by most of the participants. Some of the stories they told were, in today's terms, quite hair raising. They told of fingers being broken, of various assaults being made for absolutely no reason and of individuals who exercised their authority in very physical ways. Many who attended school before the imposition of the ban on corporal punishment are familiar with teachers, particularly with male teachers, who were very handy with their fists. I thought of this Bill as I listened to that conversation.</P>
    <P>We must accept the fact that at a period of our history vulnerable children were subjected to very serious physical abuse. It is not acceptable to say that it was normal at the time. This abuse resulted in serious trauma. We cannot distinguish one person's experiences from another or judge who suffered trauma and who did not. It is too easy to stand back and maintain that everyone suffered the same treatment and that it did no one any harm. By omitting the issue of physical abuse from this legislation we might lend credence to such an attitude or lessen the import<Col N="707" /> ance of the trauma suffered and the injustice done to victims of serious abuse.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister accepts the spirit of the legislation and that he and his officials have done sterling work on it. However, I appeal to him to ensure that the legislation as enacted lives up to the spirit in which it was introduced. It will be a lesser Bill if this amendment is not agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Senator O'Meara has said and I will not delay the House by repeating arguments already made. On reading the Official Report of the discussion of the Bill in the Dáil, I was struck by the confrontational tone of the debate. I do not blame anyone for this and I suspect that there were two sides to the story. However, there seemed to be no meeting of minds with regard to seeking a resolution of the problem outlined by Senator O'Meara. Given the fact that the Government has ordered Committee Stage but not Report Stage today, I wonder if the Minister has changed his mind since the Bill was debated in the Dáil. Is there a possibility that the case made by Senator O'Meara might be accepted? It would provide a guideline for the remainder of the debate if the Minister gave an indication that this is so, at this stage. The Minister has referred this question to the Law Reform Commission and, given the voting numbers, this is probably how it will be resolved. However, a strong case has been made for the inclusion of the term &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in this section.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara has made the point that physical abuse, particularly over as sustained period, can be as traumatic as sexual abuse. We have all come across evidence &ndash; some first hand, some hearsay and some well documented &ndash; of people who were traumatised by physical abuse. These people were incessantly beaten, they lived in a state of terror and at a very fragile and impressionable stage lived lives of utter horror. Their personalities were changed hugely in the process. They have carried the burden of this experience and, perhaps, will carry it for the rest of their lives. Who is to say that the result of such physical abuse is less than sustained sexual abuse? Abuse is abuse. There are too many stories in our recent history of gross physical abuse over a sustained period. The question arises whether the reluctance on the part of the State is financial. It may well be, but I hope not. I know the Minister and his track record, and I do not think he or his officials would be motivated by something which was imposed or at the sanction of the Department of Finance. That question has been raised and I will not repeat the arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the course of debate in the other House, on Second Stage here, and from what Senator O'Meara said a few moments ago, the Minister has heard a very strong case for the inclusion of physical abuse in the Bill. If he cannot give us an <Col N="708" /> answer today, perhaps he will consider the matter further between now and Report Stage in light of what has been said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, was pleased when the Minister accepted the spirit of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's Bill in the other House, but I was disappointed when the words &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo; were removed and it was put forward on the basis of sexual abuse only. Even if we had not seen and been horrified at various reports from institutions, I am sure the Minister is aware of the report from Welsh institutions which were revisited recently, and the close association between physical and sexual abuse given as evidence by so many people who had been inmates, indeed, by people who worked there and by those who were very courageous for many years in trying to bring the authorities' attention to the abuses. We must accept that physical and sexual abuse are frequent partners in any areas of children's lives where there was severe trauma perpetuated on them.</P>
      <P>I was of the generation of young doctors instructed to look out for the battered babies syndrome in casualty departments in the 1960s. We were inclined to be of a mind and, perhaps, slower than other countries, that those who had charge of small children would not be driven to hitting them across the head, of breaking their bones, or shaking them until their retinas came off the back of their eyes and so forth. We were inclined to say that as a nation we were most unlikely to be involved in the physical abuse of small children. We now know that is not the case. Today there has been an appalling report of the murder of an 18 month old child. A rope was tied around his neck and a stone placed at the other end and he was thrown into a flooded quarry. We must recognise that there is a serious level of physical abuse which leads to mortality.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that when the discussion of abortion arises, we point to our history and say that illegal abortion was not so common. We rarely include infanticide. There have been frequent cases in the past and, even now, the bodies of new born babies have been found but how frequently have they not been found? This is a serious problem. Excluding physical abuse in this Bill compares with returning to the days when we said such things would not happen. We know physical abuse has occurred and continues to occur and it must be addressed. We cannot just airbrush it out of the picture.</P>
      <P>In the debate in the other House &ndash; as Senator Manning said, it was very confrontational &ndash; there appeared to be many problems about definition. Senator O'Meara referred to the report of the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse. If one examines the definitions in that report one can see that the Minister is prepared to bring forward definitions. Why can they not be included in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> For example, the definitions in the terms of reference of that report states:</P>
    <P>The definition of abuse should be sufficiently broad to encompass acts or omissions which include (a) physical abuse, meaning the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction on or failure to prevent injury to a child; (b) sexual abuse, meaning the use of a child by another person for the sexual gratification or sexual arousal of that person or another person or other persons; [this commission goes further than Senator O'Meara has asked in her amendment] (c) neglect, meaning persistent or severe failure to care for a child which results in serious impairment of health and/or development and/or failure to thrive; (d) emotional abuse, meaning on the part of a carer, persistent coldness, hostility or rejection towards or unrealistic expectations or severe over-protection of a child or exposure of a child to the abuse of others resulting in severe adverse effects upon behaviour and/or development.</P>
    <P>If it is considered serious enough to have these sections of abuse within the commission's remit, surely it is not too much to ask that &ldquo;physical abuse&rdquo; should be included as well as sexual abuse. Many of the people in the Public Gallery today are most anxious that emotional and mental abuse should also be included.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara probably feels she is pushing for this as far as she can by asking for the inclusion of physical abuse. I ask for it, not just because the commission will examine this area, but because we will be going down the same road when we airbrushed out of the picture a very serious situation which we were slow to recognise. Giving it recognition now will make some amends for what happened in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleagues said. I commend Senators Manning and O'Meara for tabling these amendments. Without them the Bill is disastrously flawed. In the literature of the 19th century there is a great deal about the abuse of children. If one looks at the works of Dickens and the Bronte's one will find that each confines itself exclusively to the physical abuse of children. There is nothing in these works, remarkable as they are, as evidence of the human imagination of any sexual abuse whatever. Yet, will anyone pretend that such did not exist? We are doing the reverse in this Bill. We are saying sexual abuse exists but not physical abuse or, at least, it is not important or significant enough. It does not count. These people have been insulted enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspaper a couple of days ago the story of two men who were physically abused. It did not say anything about sexual abuse. These men have a grievance with this Bill. I was struck by the phrase one of them used. He said, &ldquo;Fifty years ago no one listened and now, 50 years later, still no one is listening&rdquo;. As Senator Henry said, some of the victims of this abuse are with us today. Can we honourably discharge our duty in <Col N="710" /> the presence of these victims without recognising the nature of their suffering? How can we separate physical and sexual abuse? It is an absurd, neurotic degree of categorisation. It is an attack on the vulnerable people. It is not just sporadic violence; it is systematic and deliberate sadism, sometimes with a probable sexual content.</P>
    <P>Let nobody think this was confined to the Christian Brothers. The Christian Brothers, in some respects, did a fine job &ndash; when there were damn few others &ndash; in educating marginalised people in our society. This constituted the majority of the population because they were all marginalised as a result of the imperial administration. I attended an upmarket, Protestant boarding school. I witnessed the most appalling physical abuse at first hand and have yet to see people raising this issue in public. It seems to have become a sectarian issue. One can only accuse certain Roman Catholic orders. The snotty Protestant boarding schools are allowed to get away it but some of us have memories, I in particular. I was not a specific victim but I had a very talented older brother and he was a victim. His life was virtually destroyed by this. He was intended to follow family tradition and go to Trinity and become either a doctor or engineer. He is now doing very good work as a long distance lorry driver. He is married to a wonderful woman and has a good family but for many years his life was destroyed and a series of tragedies brought upon the family which ended in the premature death of my mother.</P>
    <P>In the school that I attended many others were victims. Only a year or so ago I was speaking at a dinner in London with very successful members of the British industrial establishment after which I was taken to the luxurious farmhouse home of the person who chaired the meeting who said to me, &ldquo;I think we went to same school.&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;Really, what was that?&rdquo;  When he told me I said, &ldquo;What a dump, it should have been closed by the sewerage department of Dublin Corporation.&rdquo;  He pulled the car into the side of the road and started to weep. He told me that it was only in the previous three months that he had been able to tell his wife about the physical abuse he had suffered.</P>
    <P>Last week I was in Portlaoise launching a book on the history of County Laois. A middle aged man came up to me and said the same thing &ndash;&ldquo;I was at the same school as you&rdquo;. I also said same thing &ndash;&ldquo;What a dump&rdquo;. He told me about the same teacher, a little Himmler from a minor British public school. He added in another detail about which the House might like to learn, that this man used to take a run at the children so that he could deliver with a cane on the backsides of the children such blows as would draw blood. Is that not abuse? Does it have to be sexual? If he had opened the child's flies on the other side and fiddled with him would it suddenly become worthy of the attention of the legislators? Is it not of any significance to us that he was simply beaten <Col N="711" /> to a pulp? I just do not understand this mind set, although I recognise that it exists.</P>
    <P>I remember the film &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo; and the actual case which lay behind it. In extenuation of that case Queen's Counsel on behalf of the accused said, &ldquo;Well, My Lord, I put it to the court that at least he did not interfere with him&rdquo;, by which he meant that there had been no sexual abuse but the child had been drowned, he had been killed. Does this not constitute abuse? Is it only when there is a sexual element that there is ever to be any consideration and care?</P>
    <P>We hear so often in cases such as this, &ldquo;It is very sad but we don't want to get involved&rdquo;. That was what I heard about the school in which I was involved. People knew about it but they did not want to get involved as it would cause a scandal. It was said that one should not put one's head over the parapet, rock the boat, make accusations, make people feel uncomfortable or get involved. This House should get involved. We have a duty to do so. It is not just the physical beatings, it is the psychological terror, it is the waiting and knowing that one is about to be brutalised. The period of waiting, knowing what is about to occur, is probably as cruel as the actual physical violence.</P>
    <P>It is a well known psychological fact that there does not need to be any mutual sexual interchange. These situations can sometimes be sexually charged.</P>

      <P>We know all too well from the debates we have had in this House on pornography that some people are sexaully aroused by violence. There does not need to be any sexual element on the part of the victim, it can just be a beating. How therefore can we so easily make these distinctions? It is wrong. I have spoken with strong feeling but I hope not in the manner described by Senator Manning, as being contentious and so on. I speak with emotion. We really must address this issue. We owe it to all the victims of abuse. They are entitled to our concern as legislators at this late stage. We should introduce something along the lines of the amendments tabled by Senators O'Meara and Manning. If there is a technical problem the Minister should solve it. The advisers have given us so much benefit of their wisdom on so many Bills&mdash;</P>

This House requires a solution from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform if it is to be maintained that there is a flaw in the amendments. I thank God for Seanad Éireann and the initiative of my colleagues in tabling these <Col N="712" /> amendments as without them this is shameful legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the inclusion of the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in the section before the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;. The case for this has been more than well made by previous speakers. If the Minister speaks to the officers of his Department and members of the Garda Síochána investigating cases of alleged physical and sexual violence he will find that in many cases it is very difficult to draw a line between physical and sexual abuse. Prior to the sexual abuse of children there was physical abuse. It is very unfair therefore to isolate sexual abuse from physical abuse.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning and others said that there has been severe physical abuse inside and outside various institutions, not just the Christian Brothers and convents, but by people entrusted with the responsibility of caring for children in orphanages and homes. This has to be recognised. We have a responsibility to ensure that the right to take action of those who were physically abused by adults during their childhood is protected.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have no difficulty accepting the amendments which are straightforward. I am certain that he is fully aware of stories where the hands of children were so swollen having been beaten so severely that they could not carry their schoolbags home from school. There are umpteen other examples. This is unacceptable and intolerable. Children who have been abused deserve to be protected by legislation introduced in the year 2000. The required evidence and information are available within the Department. I therefore urge the Minister to include the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support previous speakers. It is not possible for us to allow this legislation through and to look in the face afterwards people who have been victims without being answerable in some way. I regret that I did not get a chance to speak on Second Stage. Ironically on that day I was in Government Buildings negotiating parts of the new agreement which deals with the socially excluded in society and the victims of society. This appears to me to be exactly along the same line.</P>
      <P>I also speak as a member of the teaching profession, which has been diminished in many ways by sexual abuse over the years. Sexual and physical abuse have sullied the names of all people working in religious orders, many of whom were decent, honest and upright. For that reason this legislation needs to be focused to deal with issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that the legislation cannot accommodate the amendment. I do not understand how anybody can distinguish between physical and sexual abuse in all cases. In some cases it can be done but it cannot be done in all cases. Senator Norris, in what I would consider one of his best contributions, made a clear case and I agree with every word he spoke. I would <Col N="713" /> appeal to the Minister to recognise that this is something at which we have looked previously.</P>
    <P>This is about physical abuse. There are two stages before abuse. There is use, misuse and then abuse. The law of the land has always been able to make the distinction and decide what was physical abuse. Therefore, we have experience in dealing with it. We also recognise that there was a time, until 1982, when the use of corporal punishment was legal. I stress the word &ldquo;use&rdquo; because misuse and abuse were never allowed and were always illegal and unacceptable, but unfortunately it went on.</P>
    <P>The legislation would be seriously damaged were it not to include this amendment to extend its scope to physical abuse. It would be seriously flawed in terms of addressing the worries, concerns, needs and demands of the victims. I defy anyone to tell me the difference between sexual abuse and physical abuse in a form of words which would apply to all cases.</P>
    <P>There are people who get sexual gratification from physical punishment, from hurting other people. This is evident not only in folklore but in literature down through the ages. Some highly charged and emotive literature has been written about bullies, physical tyrants and people who effectively got their kicks from hurting other people. It is not possible to make a distinction between sexual abuse and physical abuse in all cases; therefore we cannot allow this legislation go through without amending it to include physical abuse.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look back to the roots of this debate. What was the ambience which led to this legislation? It has come about because of the horror of the community which suddenly came face to face with what was being done in its name. The community now wants, if not to make amends because I do not know if that is ever possible, at least to respond and to show that it is prepared to do something which might compensate in some small way &ndash; it is not possible to compensate fully &ndash; for the hurt, wrong and abuse of the past, and that must include physical abuse.</P>
    <P>I sense that the victims, with whom we have met and discussed these matters, are people who have shaped their lives to the point where they were able to articulate and carry forward the argument to try to make many of us understand to some small degree what it was like. I am also conscious of the thousands of others whose lives were wrecked irrevocably and irreparably and who became the flotsam and jetsam of society. These people were never able to piece their lives together and spent a lifetime attempting to understand how they could possibly have been treated like this. They see their lives destroyed and they have gone on to populate the prisons and other institutions. They were the unemployed, the dependent population who were the dropouts of society who in some cases could not even go into a building anymore. This is what we <Col N="714" /> are talking about and it is as much a consequence of physical abuse as of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I would say without fear of contradiction that many of the people who were abused, both sexually and physically, could not make a distinction about when it was sexual abuse and when it was physical abuse. That is a fact and there is nobody who can say otherwise. The victims themselves cannot distinguish between when it was sexual abuse and when it was physical abuse but they knew it hurt mentally and physically all the time. There was never any difference and we cannot walk away from that fact.</P>
    <P>We have a duty and a responsibility to the victims. We are answerable and accountable. To that extent, I would appeal to the Minister to look again at this amendment. He should take it on board. He should reflect on our responsibility to the people to whom we are trying to respond, reflect on what society must do to make amends and recognise that this is just one small first step. I appeal to him to accept the amendments and to amend the legislation. I commend the amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not going to speak on this amendment. Senator O'Meara moved the amendment and she dealt adequately with it, but having listened to the debate I feel I would be negligent in not saying something on the matter. The nub of this is that the Minister is kicking to touch with the Law Reform Commission on the serious aspect of physical abuse.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, as other Senators said, one cannot state simply that it is sexual abuse and that physical abuse is in a totally different category. It is not. There is an intrinsic link between the two. We all know that. Scientific studies prove that there is an element of violence or physical assault when sexual abuse takes place. There are other physical abuses which are just as horrific, if not more horrific, than sexual abuses.</P>
      <P>Last night a man who had been to Upton detention centre in Cork visited me at my clinic on Seán MacDermott Street and gave me a copy of the sworn statement which he had made to his solicitor and to the Garda. He was detained in that institution for a number of years because he had been mitching. He had been sexually assaulted by older boys and had been continually beaten by the religious order in that institution. While he was not sexually assaulted the religious, there was gross negligence on the part of the religious authorities in not ensuring his personal integrity was protected in terms of his being sexually assaulted by a group of other boys. The beatings which occurred were of such a nature that he could not go to bed at night without wetting the bed. For a long time he was beaten each morning because he had wet the bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we put forward legislation, and a definition of what will be covered by it, if we do not include horrific assaults of a physical nature which occurred in these institutions? We are try<Col N="715" /> ing to deal with the incredible incidence of torture of young people in the State's care. It is no good the Minister saying there are difficulties and complexities and sending this to the Law Reform Commission to deal with. That will not solve the problem; we must deal with it in this and the other House. That is why we are elected as legislators &ndash; to deal with such an issue and not to kick it to touch and ask another body to look at it for an indeterminate period. We would not know what, if anything, would happen after its deliberations.</P>
    <P>Goldenbridge convent has closed down. There has been no mention, in any of the allegations made, of overt sexual abuse but it is uncontested that there was gross physical abuse of young boys and girls by the female religious order in charge there. One young girl died as a result of severe burns to her legs which resulted from a particular form of treatment she received. Gross physical assault took place in that convent. Are we saying this legislation cannot apply to what happened in that institution simply because we are limiting the definition to sexual abuse and will not extend it to physical abuse? </P>
    <P>We will only deal with half the problem if we go down the road the Minister proposes. The victims have waited a long time for a substantial response to their misfortune in the State's care. There is no sense taking a half-hearted approach. Let us be generous and take a full and comprehensive approach in dealing with the matter. Let us try to make good the serious negligence and flaws in the system which we allowed to proliferate for many decades.</P>
    <P>In 1979 I remember doing a survey of 200 prisoners in our institutions. While I do not have the exact figures now, the majority served time in either reformatories or industrial schools before they ended up in prison. Clearly, a huge proportion of the population who inhabit the prisons, and who have done so over the years, were brutalised and were brought into the system in such a hostile fashion that they reacted against the establishment and the society which did that to them. They were forever outsiders in that society, a position that led to a life of crime. We have a serious case to answer.</P>
    <P>Like all speakers on this side, I am passionately convinced that we need to add the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo; if we are to deal with this amendment adequately. I have no doubt the Minister, whose speech I read, would like to resolve the matter adequately. I would have thought he would have taken an open and comprehensive approach to the matter rather than a limited one. Let us remove the obstacles if they arise. Let us not put forward legislation which we may never get around to redressing or amending. Like my colleagues, I plead with the Minister to accept these amendments. Let us get on with it and send the legislation back to the other House to incorporate these amendments in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the House that I have no wish to be confrontational on this matter. There was a certain amount of confrontation in the other House because, to be quite blunt, there were clear attempts to misrepresent the Government's position and I could not stand by and tolerate or accept that.</P>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the debate which, for the most part, has been calm and rational. I do not believe there is anything between us in terms of the end we are trying to achieve. The difficulty which presents itself is how precisely we are going to achieve the end we all require. As a first step, I accepted the legislation which was brought forward as a Private Members' Bill by Deputy O'Sullivan. I did that because I wanted to achieve the objectives set out in that legislation. In the same way, I want to achieve the objectives Senators have mentioned this afternoon. As I will outline in my contribution, the difficulty I am faced with is how best I can achieve the solution which everybody wants.</P>
      <P>I already indicated in some detail in my Second Stage contribution in this House the Government's approach to the issue of limitation periods in cases of child abuse of a non-sexual nature. Sexual abuse of children has always been regarded with particular abhorrence by the community &ndash; all the more so when such abuse is perpetrated by the very people charged with the care and nurturing of children.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Second Stage, the Government's view is that the case for changing the law of limitations, as it applies to child sexual abuse, is unanswerable. It is universally recognised that the abuse of a person of tender years in a sexual way can result in trauma which can prevent the victim from seeking help or redress for the abuse suffered, in some cases well into adult life. It is clear that special provisions regarding limitation periods to take account of that lasting effect should apply to civil actions where sex abuse is an element.</P>
      <P>However, this is emphatically not to suggest that the issues surrounding physical abuse in childhood are regarded by me or the Government as being less serious or of less significance in our whole approach to childhood abuse. I am very aware from representations made, and from having heard at first hand the harrowing stories of some of those I have met, how such abuse has blighted many lives, leaving emotional as well as physical scars. I assure such people that neither I nor the Government seek to neglect their position or to exclude them in any manner. The Government's whole approach to the issue of childhood abuse has been open and proactive and that remains the approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind Senators that the Taoiseach in May of last year set out a package which represented the Government's position and still does. This included an apology on behalf of the State to the victims of child abuse; the setting up of a commission to inquire into childhood abuse; expan<Col N="717" /> sion nationwide of the counselling services available to assist the victims of child abuse; the preparation of a White Paper on the mandatory reporting of child abuse; priority advancement of legislation to include a register of sex offenders &ndash; the House will be aware I have published that legislation; amendment of the limitation laws as they relate to civil actions based on childhood sexual abuse &ndash; the House will also be aware I accepted Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill on that &ndash; and the referral of the question of limitation in other forms of childhood abuse to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The unreserved apology issued by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State was a very important starting point and the objective was to try to address the wrongs that unquestionably were done in the past. There was general agreement across the political spectrum and across society generally that it was an appropriate response for the State to make to those who have suffered in childhood and that it was a response with which most right thinking people wished to be associated. The Government has been actively progressing the measures announced by the Taoiseach and they represent a considered and proactive response by the Government.</P>
    <P>Child abuse covers a wide range of activities. If one were to say that some of these would have been classed until relatively recently as reasonable corporal punishment, one would not be far off. Others could be described, by any standards, as unacceptable but which might nonetheless not affect the person's ability to bring proceedings in a given time. There are still others that will have the same lasting trauma that is known to arise frequently from sexually abusive acts.</P>
    <P>In this context, Senator Henry referred to the definitions of abuse given in the commission to inquire into childhood abuse and suggested them as a model for this Bill. I am aware of the provisions of that Bill and my Department's comments have been taken into account in the framing of the definitions in that legislation. However, those definitions are specific to the context of that Bill. The question of the inclusion or otherwise of other forms of abuse in this Bill is not simply a case of defining the various types of abuses. I will return to that point later.</P>
    <P>The issue of sexual abuse is clear cut. That is why the Government was in a position to support the Bill to the extent that it deals with such abuse. Unfortunately, the issue of physical abuse is not as clear cut. It is precisely because the issues are not clear cut that the Attorney General at the request of the Government referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission. The purpose of that referral is to have the benefit of the commission's research facilities, well established consultative processes and, most importantly, independent and considered advice as to the way forward in this area of the law. It is worth bearing in mind that the Law Reform Commission is a creature of statute, in other words, it is a creature of the Oireachtas. This is precisely the type of <Col N="718" /> issue on which it is ideally placed to offer recommendations, an issue with a considerable technical legal dimension and one which is firmly anchored in the day to day lives of very many people.</P>
    <P>I understand from informal inquiries that the commission's researches are under way and its intention is to publish a consultation paper in the near future. The publication of that paper will give the interest groups who represent the victims of abuse in childhood a valuable opportunity to have an input into the formulation of the commission's recommendations. It does not make sense for the Oireachtas to pre-empt the advice sought by going ahead with legislation to deal with such cases. That is why the Government indicated from the outset its support for this Bill in so far as it deals with sexual cases and why it was necessary on the Dáil Committee Stage to confine the application of the Bill to actions arising out of sexual abuse in childhood.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Government's position on this Bill represented as a refusal to legislate for physical abuse cases and an unwillingness to deal with the issues. Reports of a public meeting held as recently as last weekend were along similar lines. I state categorically that these comments utterly misrepresent the Government's position. I emphasise that these misrepresentations and attributions are entirely wrong. Before we can decide what changes should be made, and the Government is committed to change, the Government and the Oireachtas must know how best that change should be achieved. I want to state clearly again, as I stated on a number of occasions during the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and in my Second Stage contribution in the Seanad, that I will act on the commission's report in a prompt and proactive manner. That remains my position. That is the position I outlined from the outset. In all honesty, I cannot give a clearer or more definite response than that. I do not lightly make such commitments before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I see no reason the Government's intentions should be doubted.</P>
    <P>Our record in the implementation of the measures that were announced last May is one of solid progress. Senators will recall the progress made from my Second Stage contribution to the House. It includes the establishment of Laffoy commission, the publication of the commission to inquire into child abuse Bill to which I referred, and the provision of funding to expand the counselling services available for victims of child abuse. It would be a pointless exercise to request the Law Reform Commission to carry out its work on the issue only to pre-empt effectively its findings by extending the scope of this Bill at this stage to include physical abuse. It may well be that the commission's recommendations will fall in line with proposals in the Bill, but it is equally possible the commission will recommend a different approach entirely.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that some of the interest groups in this area have expressed the view that this Bill should be held up awaiting the final out<Col N="719" /> come of the Law Reform Commission's deliberations on this issue. That would be counter-productive and would cause unwarranted delay in the implementation of the valuable reform of the law provided in this Bill as it stands. I believe strongly that it is a sensible and responsible approach to await the outcome of the commission's work.</P>
    <P>This is a highly technical and complex area of the law and it is only right that we should have available to us the advice of experts. Any change in the law in relation to other forms of abuse should be informed by the commission's work if we are to ensure that we achieve the best outcome in legislation. I repeat my strongest assurances that I will act in a prompt and proactive manner on the commission's report when it becomes available.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senators' comments in this regard, the provisions of this Bill apply to proceedings arising out of an act of sexual abuse irrespective of whether there was physical abuse involved. Thus, where the sexually abusive acts were part of a pattern of abuse of both types, it is clear that the entire pattern of abuse would be encompassed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I completely reject what I regard as extraordinary remarks by Senator Norris to the effect that no one is listening. I would have thought, given all we have said and done, nothing could be further from the truth. We are listening, but there is not a shallow or simple solution. If a simple solution was apparent I would only be too pleased to take it on board. I cannot legislate by way of aspiration; as experienced Senators in this House will know, I have to legislate with certainty. If I cannot have certainty in the legislation, then the disadvantage lies with those for whom, in the first instance, the legislation is supposed to assist. I believe strongly that if I am to do justice by those who are affected by the issue of physical abuse, it is incumbent on me as a legislator to ensure that the provisions I put in place have not only the benefit of certainty but the benefit of the best expert advice that is available to the Government. I can assure Senators that it is not a question of kicking to touch, far from it. Because of the complexities that are involved I am trying my utmost to ensure that those people who were victims of physical abuse and who should rightly be covered by this Bill are covered by legislation which will evolve in the not too distant future following upon the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>It has been clear for many years now that acts of sexual abuse can induce a misplaced guilt in the victim. Therefore, it was possible to define, for example, an act of sexual abuse in this legislation and also go on to deal with the whole issue of disability. I do not know at this point whether the question can be resolved by a definition provided by the Law Reform Commission. In the context of ascertaining the degree of trauma which would induce the disability, it is more diffi<Col N="720" /> cult for us to be definitive in regard to the physical abuse provision. For those reasons, which I hope I have clearly outlined, I am awaiting the report of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply anxious to resolve this matter at the earliest opportunity to everybody's satisfaction. It is not and never was a question of the Government trying to keep the purse closed. What we are trying to do is achieve the objective which was set out eloquently in the House this afternoon by so many Senators, and to do so in a certain way that will stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed by the Minister's response. He should look to the old adage &ndash; Actions speak louder than words. In reiterating what the Taoiseach announced last May, in the form of an apology and referral of the matter to the Law Reform Commission, the Minister has given us much technical detail about how his Department is examining the issue. The fundamental fact remains, however, that physical abuse takes place. The Minister said it is not possible to define physical abuse and he referred to it as a complex area of the law, but it is not complex. It is a reality for many human beings, involving an imposition of abuse on a person's physical being by another. In many cases the physical and mental abuse is of children who place their trust in adults.</P>
      <P>The suggestions made in the Minister's response are totally inadequate. He referred to the definitions of abuse and Senator Henry also referred to them in detail. She requested the Minister to include just one &ndash; that was the definition of physical abuse in subsection (<i>b</i>). That is all that is involved here. The Minister has a legal background and some Members of the House have legal experience also. To say that this is a huge and complex area of the law is avoiding the situation and not dealing with reality.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to physical use, misuse and abuse. We are talking about the fundamental abuse of a physical sanction. We have all received a slap at school and we survived it, but we are not talking about that. We are talking about physical abuse which is not that difficult to define. The Minister should include this definition in the Bill. Platitudes from the Minister and the Taoiseach are poor consolation to people who have been grossly physically abused. When it comes down to doing something definitive about physical abuse through legislation, however, the Minister cannot do so because of the lack of a definition. The Minister knows well what physical abuse is and everybody in the House has provided him with examples of it. Any legal person so requested would be capable of adjudicating on whether this is use, misuse or abuse. We are talking about abuse, an issue on which any fair minded judge could adjudicate. I invite the Minister to reconsider his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Law Reform Commission has a wide range of legal expertise. Senators who contributed to the debate have a wide knowledge of what is happening from having spoken to experts and others, including their constituents. They have far more knowledge than many of the legal eagles who will produce a recommendation for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Logically I understand what the Minister is saying but I certainly do not agree with him. As a representative of the party that put forward the Bill in a more complete form than it now appears, I am disappointed in the Minister's response. He says that the Law Reform Commission will produce a consultation paper in the near future and interested parties can make submissions on it. Presumably we are talking about a period of at least six months, followed by another number of months before the commission produces its final report. Following that the Minister will act. I do not for a moment deny the Minister's commitment to act promptly. Let us face it, in the two and a half years since the formation of this Seanad, the Minister has been in the House more often than any of his colleagues. One cannot deny his ability to produce legislation, but unfortunately that creates a twin-track approach whereby those who have suffered trauma, arising from what the law would interpret as purely physical abuse, must continue to wait for a period which we cannot forecast. That is to be regretted and it was never the intention of the Labour Party when we published this legislation.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's bona fides in this regard but I fundamentally disagree with him. On behalf of the victims of abuse, I must express severe disappointment with his approach. While I do not doubt his commitment to bring forward legislation, there is no doubt that this time next year we will only be at the stage of preparing the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also disappointed in the Minister's response, part of which I find quite curious. I read the definition of abuse from the reports on the terms of reference for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Bill has been published by the Department of Education and Science &ndash; a Department which is part of the same Government. I would have thought, therefore, that it would be wise for all Departments to try to use the same terms of reference. Otherwise one could have a tremendous amount of confusion with different Bills. Abuse is defined on page 1 of the Bill as (a) &ldquo;the wilful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical injury on, or failure to prevent such injury to, the child&rdquo;, and (b) &ldquo;the use of the child by a person for sexual arousal or sexual gratification of that person or another person&rdquo;. Two other subsections concern mental and emotional abuse. On the first page of this Bill from the Department of Education and Science there is an interpretation of the word &ldquo;abuse&rdquo;<Col N="722" /> which apparently cannot be used in a Bill coming from the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>If one looks at the Equal Status Bill, which came from the Minister's Department, it seems that those who wrote it should include a section which is not explicitly sexual. Section 11(5) deals with sexual harassment and states that sexual harassment takes place where a person</P>
      <P>subjects another person (&ldquo;the victim&rdquo;) to any unwelcome act, request or conduct, including spoken words, gestures or the production, display or circulation of written words, pictures or other material which, in respect of the victim is based on any discriminatory ground and which could reasonably be regarded as offensive, humiliating or intimidating to him or her.</P>
      <P>This section is specifically about sexual harassment and whoever wrote the Bill felt it was worth putting in matters that were not specifically sexual. It has been well worthwhile pointing out the frequent coexistence of sexual excitement with physical punishment of another.</P>
      <P>There are those who promote the legalisation of prostitution. I have always said that male prostitution should be legalised first to see how we get on with that, as the involvement of violence with prostitution is well known. Some prostitutes will tell one that their clients will climax with no sexual involvement at all. Do we have to wait for children reporting sexual abuse which is just watching an adult coming to sexual climax? Would that be counted as sexual abuse? From this definition it probably will, but part of the definition refers to any act committed against or in the presence of a person that any reasonable person would, in all circumstances, regard as misconduct of a sexual nature. However, another part of the definition refers to that being the case provided the doing or commission of the act concerned is recognised by law as giving rise to a course of action.</P>
      <P>I do not know if that covers those who are physically abused to the extent where the pleasure gained from inflicting such pain on another gave the person inflicting the pain sexual satisfaction. I do not require the Minister to read <i>The Story of O</i> or other hard pornography to see how important the correlation can be between physical abuse and sexual enjoyment for extraordinary people, but we may lead ourselves into a situation where people, to try to get some justice from life, may make more of a correlation between the physical abuse they endured and the sexual pleasure it gave others. Senator O'Toole said that some people not getting sexual gratification out of this would be accused of getting sexual gratification and we would be better off leaving physical abuse in as part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I return to my confusion as to why a definition will do one Department with one Bill but will not do another Department with another Bill, although both Bills are going through the Oireachtas at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. I have heard the Minister defend his views and those of the Government, but he does not need to do that. Nobody is casting aspersions on his views. I know him well enough to know that he is as compassionate a man as I or any other Member. That is not the issue. Whatever comments were made, that is not my interest.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's explanation and, with the greatest respect, I think it is not correct. I am going to have a good look at it and I will get some legal people to look at it because I do not believe it holds up. I want the Minister to come back to this matter. I am going very close to what one is allowed to say in the House, but I want to make certain that I do not accept that explanation. I want the Minister to confirm for me that what he has said is a matter on which he is saying he has a legal position.</P>
      <P>There is over 100 years of case law on physical abuse in Ireland. It was in my town, the Minister's town and everywhere else, and went from the lower courts to higher levels. The courts and Judiciary have been dealing with physical abuse cases for as long as I can remember &ndash; not that many, but they have been dealt with. I want a clear position from the Minister, as I am not clear on whether this has to be defined in order to have it in the legislation. I do not accept that is the case. Is it that this cannot be defined? I am not sure what the position is, but I want it on the record, because we will come back to it. This issue will not go away.</P>
      <P>In terms of physical abuse, there is only one question we need to ask &ndash; are there people who suffered physical abuse of such significance that their will or their ability to make a reasoned decision to bring such action is &ldquo;substantially impaired&rdquo;, as the Bill puts it? Any of us would know that is the case, so how can we live with ourselves if we pass legislation that is clearly flawed before it is enacted? It is clear that those who have suffered physical abuse are or were in a situation where their ability to make a reasoned decision to bring such action is substantially impaired, or was before they came to terms with it or understood how to find redress. That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have the legal difficulties spelt out for us. That can be done in as legalistic a language as the Minister wishes, but I want it on the record and we can revisit it. I do not believe they will stand up to scrutiny. This has nothing to do with commissions or the view of Government. It is about how we respond to people with a problem through the legislative process. That process is flawed in this case because quite clearly people who suffered physical abuse are unable to make a reasoned decision or, if that is not now the case, it would have been the case at some time in the past. That is all that is required. Once we know that, we are taking a decision that although we know this abuse impaired their ability to make a decision on seeking redress, we will not include <Col N="724" /> them because of undefined or ill-defined legal difficulties.</P>
    <P>How can we not have case law, possibly since the Offences Against the Person Act, on this? It did not require legislation for someone to go to court to prove they were physically abused and for judgment to be taken on that basis. It was done in courts at all levels &ndash; from District Judges to the upper levels of the Judiciary. I cannot accept that it could not be done in this day and age &ndash; someone could state he or she was physically abused and an informed Judiciary could adjudicate on it and come to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>What are the legal difficulties? Has the law not dealt with cases of physical abuse for decades and why can it not deal with them now? Why does physical abuse have to be defined? There are many aspects of law that are not defined. When an Act refers to &ldquo;any reasonable person&rdquo; it means that we do not need a tightly written definition or interpretation. It is not needed when that phrase is in an Act, because it refers to what a reasonable person would conclude.</P>
    <P>We are aware that there are people who have been abused to the extent that their ability to make a reasoned decision is substantially impaired. How can we possibly let this legislation through in a flawed condition? How many and what exactly are the legal difficulties?</P>

      <P>It would be wonderful if the answers to the questions posed by Senator O'Toole were readily available and if the information which he says is available were available. The truth is that the negative is the position in both cases. Senator O'Toole asked questions to which I do not have answers. I put these questions to the Law Reform Commission because I did not have the answers to many of them. If I had the answers, I would not have had to ask the Law Reform Commission for answers. If Senator O'Toole had the answers, he would not have to ask me the questions.</P>
      <P>I stated already that child abuse covers a wide range of activities, some of which would have been classed until relatively recently as reasonable corporal punishment. Others, by any standards, are unacceptable but might nonetheless not affect a person's ability to bring proceedings in a given time. Others may have the same lasting trauma which is known to arise frequently as a result of sexually abusive acts. The Law Reform Commission has been considering this matter since May and, if there were a simple answer, it would have come forward with it by now. Within the Law Reform Commission some of the finest brains in the land are dealing with this issue. It has not as yet come forward with a report but it is bringing forward a consultative report. As an educationalist, Senator O'Toole will know that if such eminent people took a considerable time to consider a consultative paper and deemed it necessary to produce a paper prior to publishing a report, this issue cannot be as easy as some back-of-the-lorry speeches might suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> This is a difficult area and, in that context, I refer to the speech of Senator Taylor-Quinn which completely misses the point. She seems to think that what is at issue is solely the definition of physical abuse. That is not the point. If that were the point &ndash; other Senators also referred to it &ndash; perhaps I would have had no difficulty whatsoever. Senator O'Toole said there is 100 years of precedent; there is none. There is not a case in terms of limitation law.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with physical and sexual abuse in limitation law. Let us not try smokescreens; this is what we are dealing with here. The issue is quite straightforward. We are dealing with the question of a disability, the disability having been deduced or induced by or from the whole issue of physical abuse. There is no case law dealing with either sexual or physical abuse in the context of limitation law. That is why this extremely complex issue of physical abuse was referred to the Law Reform Commission. I have stated categorically in this House and in the other House that when that complex question is answered by the Law Reform Commission, I will be proactive in terms of bringing forward amendments to the law or any new legislation which is required. I wish it were otherwise.</P>
      <P>I wish the solutions which have been proferred here were the answers to the questions. The unfortunate truth is that they are not and, if they were, I must take it that Senators would in good faith have put down amendments in order to assist me. The truth is that I would not have bothered under any circumstances with the Law Reform Commission if the answers were readily available to me. I repeat that I would be doing a grave injustice, though it may seem otherwise to some people in this House, to victims of physical abuse if I accepted a half-baked amendment which would ultimately not serve their causes. This would be irresponsible of me and I must not and will not do so.</P>
      <P>When the Law Reform Commission's report is to hand, I will be proactive in bringing forward the legislation or any amendment thereto which is required. I stress again that we are talking about not just physical abuse but about the whole issue of physical abuse in the context of limitation law and the issue of disability. Let us not pretend this is a simplistic matter because that will do the argument no service whatsoever.</P>

      <P>&mdash;and I will not let that go on the record of the House. It is very easy for the Minister to give his version of back-of-the-lorry speeches by putting words in people's mouths. Let us be clear. Step one is that there are people looking for justice under the law. In order to be covered under the law, they must get through the Statute of Limitations Act. In order to be covered under the Statute of Limitations Act, they must comply with certain requirements under the Bill, and this is what we are debating. What we are now debating does not change the operation. The operation has been changed by the introduction of sexual abuse. Once it is recognised that it is as written down under the terms of sexual abuse, the person will get in under the cover of the Statute of Limitations Act and will be entitled to take the case. We are talking about step one and the argument I have put forward is not to do with the legal precedent of the statute of limitations, but with the courts understanding of, experience of and judgments under the heading of physical abuse. That is the case I am putting forward. The Minister is not correct and what he has said is not acceptable. That was not the argument which was well enough made.</P>
      <P>We need to hear what the legal difficulties are, not that the lawyers are having trouble getting their act together. Experts will tell us anything. An expert yesterday might as well have told us that the sun shines in the middle of the night when he said that house prices have not increased. The greatest brains in the world told us that. I am not a bit impressed by people with letters after their name. The reality is that if the Minister took a decision that there were legal difficulties, he should tell us what the legal difficulties are and put them on the record.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but the Minister in his further response has done nothing to assist the situation. In fact, he got on his legal high horse and brought new legal matter into play. He referred to the definition when, in concluding his earlier contribution, he said he did not know whether the issue could be resolved by definition. Those are his words &ndash; I wrote them down as he spoke them. The Minister brought in the question of the definition and its lack of clarity. Now he has introduced the wider issue of the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to introduce a Statute of Limitations Bill. We want to insert the word <Col N="727" />&ldquo;physical&rdquo; into this Bill. Suddenly the Minister has made a major legal issue out of this. As Senator Henry said, the definition can be accepted by another Department in one Bill currently going through the other House, but the definition cannot be accepted in this Bill. This does not make common sense.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may have a legal background and may try to swamp us with further legal definitions, the realities are what we see. He spoke about the context of limitation. Law is about basic common sense, about justice being done and being seen to be done. Those in positions to administer justice use the information available to them in any particular case and adjudicate on that information, deciding for or against a certain decision. This does not have to involve complications relating to definitions and to highpowered legal jargon.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to those eminent people on the Law Reform Commission &ndash; we accept that and appreciate the wonderful work they did in the past and hope they do more in the future, but a simple matter is before us. The Minister may try to complicate it but he needs to forget his legal background and accept this amendment as based on common sense. It is a very simple matter. Leave it to the judges to decide. The Minister said there was not any prior case law definition relating to this &ndash; point accepted but somebody will have to decide. Let us accept this amendment and allow the situation to evolve.</P>

      <P>We all have the one concern and in publishing this Bill the Labour Party was attempting to redress an injustice. We were trying to ensure that people who were the victims of terrible injustice in the past would be given redress and that their rights would be restored to them. That is the objective of everybody in both Houses. It is very frustrating to encounter a major block, which this appears to be, while handling a piece of legislation, particuarly when one's own party has promoted it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that this legal point, in other words, the testing under limitation law of the extent of physical abuse constituting sufficient trauma, has not been tested. He said that the legal issues attached to that are very complex and therefore must be referred to the Law Reform Commission and answers must be obtained before this issue can be properly resolved and inserted in the legislation. It is frustrating to encounter such a block at this point but I am not in the legal profession. I want to explore this issue further, with the result that I will not press the amendment on this stage but I will bring it back on Report Stage. Meanwhile I will consult legal advisers on a way to shift this blockage in the short term rather than the long term and give people the legal redress they deserve as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This amendment clearly states our intent. It is motivated primarily by the fact that there are many people who, because of the trauma and difficulties they experienced, were not in a position to take action.

      <P>When I spoke on Second Stage I indicated to Senators that I would examine further the question of whether the Bill should operate in a more retrospective fashion than that already catered for in the Bill as it stands. I stated that I would consider the question in more detail and in consultation with the Attorney General. I am still in discussion with the Attorney General and my Cabinet colleagues on the technical aspects of a possible amendment which would approach this issue in a positive manner. Senators appreciate that any proposal in this area, as well as requiring Government approval, is technically complex because of the need to ensure consistency with legal principle. The Senators know that this is a difficult legal issue as well as one of real significance to certain of the victims of childhood abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendments before the House would be that abuse which arose before the passing of the legislation would be treated differently from abuse arising after the passing of the legislation. This is so because the disability rule provided for in the Bill would apply only to acts of abuse arising after the passing of the Act but would be disapplied by these amendments to abuse arising before that point. This raises an important issue of legal principle which must be examined very carefully. It might assist the House if I were to indicate briefly the kind of considerations which are being addressed with a view to <Col N="729" /> overcoming them in the amendment I am hoping I can bring forward at Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The concept of limitation periods in civil cases is a feature of legal systems generally. It enables persons to assert their rights on the one hand, while on the other hand it provides for some certainty of the legal position of both parties. It can be argued that it is a breach of normal legal principle to disapply such a concept if by so doing it were to lead to a provision which would treat people differently by effectively removing the disability rule in some cases while others would have to prove that the abuse was of such significance that their will or ability to make a reasoned decision to bring an action was substantially impaired. This could lead to a situation where, as in the case of the amendments proposed by the Senators, abuse which arose before the passing of the Bill would be treated on a different basis from abuse arising after the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The legislation would thus, it could be argued, discriminate between certain classes of persons and abuse on a basis that is open to challenge. The analagous changes were made to the limitation law in 1991 by way of introduction of the rule of discoverability. Persons were not treated differently by reference to different rules. A significant departure from the norm, however, was that the 1991 legislation applied to all causes of action occuring before the commencement of that legislation. This was on the basis that to apply the normal rule of non-retrospectivity would frustrate the objective of the reform. The approach to retrospectivity has been followed in the Bill, following my amendment which was agreed in the other House.</P>
    <P>The question I am now examining is whether the Bill should, notwithstanding normal legal principles, relax the limitation rule further by treating those cases of past sexual abuse, which do not benefit from the provisions of the Bill, in a way which would target them specifically so that the limitation period could be reviewed in respect of them and begin to run again. That approach, if feasible, would avoid the serious difficulty that could be created if the Senators amendments were successfully challenged. The result in that case would be that the Bill would be totally undermined.</P>
    <P>There are real difficulties but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to bring forward proposals on Report Stage which will find acceptance among Senators and address the concerns of victims in a fair and reasoned manner. On that basis, I invite Senators to consider withdrawing their amendments until then.</P>
    <P>I already indicated that the technical details of a possible amendment are being worked out. I also made it clear that the Government must approve any such proposal. It would be wrong of me to anticipate the outcome of either aspect and I hope Senators will respect my position in that regard. However, I gave the amendments deep and careful consideration. I am doing my best to <Col N="730" /> address the issues which were raised in the other House and in the amendments before this House. I must clarify precisely my position before Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be accurate about the figures from the Department of Health and Children which show that, in December 1999, 36,855 people were on waiting lists. This shows a reduction of 28 in the figure for the previous December of 36,883. The point which has caught our attention and that of the media is the flabbergasting and appalling rise of 3,000 in the number on waiting lists over the past three months, which is an increase of 9% in the last quarter. This is despite the massive injection of £90 million into the health services. What is happening to the huge amount of money being put into health services because, ultimately, we are no better off than we were 12 months ago?</P>
      <P>The problem is not only related to waiting lists. The former Minister, Deputy Cowen, addressed many Private Members' motions since I took over the health and children portfolio for my party in the Seanad, but it is necessary to continually raise the same issues. We are aware of the difference between waiting lists and waiting times, but they have also increased. The figure for the ear, nose and throat procedures, which is the worst sector, is 7,486 while the number waiting for hip replacements, which is an orthopaedic procedure, has increased from the September figure of 5,838 to 7,344 in December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need the detail behind these figures because, from experience in my clinics, it appears many people have switched from public to private health care because they can no longer endure the stress and intense pain associated with their conditions. Many people come to my clinics to ask if there is anything I can do to reduce the cost of a stay in hospital. They will pay the surgeon but they have a big problem finding the money for expensive accommodation fees. That is because their doctors would not allow them wait any longer than a couple of weeks, given the <Col N="732" /> extremely traumatic times in relation to orthopaedic treatment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in his character to avoid dealing with the contentious issue under discussion &ndash; the exacerbated hospital waiting lists. I refer to orthopaedics, about which I am concerned, and ask him to comment on the number of people who have gone from the public to the private list, merely because they could not wait any longer for treatment. The Mater Hospital National Cardiac Centre has a waiting list of 3,855. For operations other than heart surgery, St. James's Hospital waiting list has increased from 1,592 to 1,996. These were the figures prior to the flu epidemic in January.</P>
      <P>Mr. Finbar Fitzpatrick, Secretary General of the IHCA, says the problem is related to beds and shortages of doctors. I have already mentioned ear, nose and throat procedures, but the waiting list for eye procedures, cataract operations, is 4,309. The cataract operation &ndash; and I said this to the Minister's predecessor &ndash; is relatively simple. It is mainly for people who are elderly and expect to have one pleasure at least afforded to them, reading. Mr. Finbar Fitzpatrick referred to people going blind while awaiting cataract operations. I hear about those at my clinics.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the specific public in-patient waiting lists in the Mid-Western Health Board area. In March 1997 the Regional Hospital, Dooradoyle, Limerick, had a waiting list of 1,142; in December 1999 the list was 1,441, an increase of 20 per cent. St. John's Hospital has reduced its waiting list from 257 to 111. I am pleased there is also a reduction in Croom, despite the closure of 20 beds. I am extremely exasperated with those lists given that orthopaedic operations do not require great skill. The number on the waiting list for the Mid-Western Health Board was 1,841 at the end of December. The monthly average number of bed days lost was 1,056 which, if multiplied by 12, amounts to 12,672. Those are the facts. It is disingenuous of the Minister to blame much of the increase on the nurses' strike&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister will be able to correct that because I could see absolutely no reason why the nurses' strike would be blamed for the increase in that it included a holiday weekend. The money lost was gained in what was <Col N="733" /> not paid out to nurses; they would have earned over and above their normal salaries if working that weekend. It was an X = Y situation, so that it was not a financial loss. One could argue that services were brought down but I do not think that short period was the reason for the increase at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few positive suggestions as to how the Minister might approach the whole issue of waiting time and the problems that need structural reform. It is not a question of throwing good money after bad, but of getting into the nitty gritty to see where there are conflicts in how people do their business, the different ways of doing things when one compares one hospital with another, including how they deal with nursing shortages. We have to accept that on a breakdown of costs in a typical hospital 70 per cent are pay related, of which 50 per cent is for nursing. About 35 per cent of total hospital costs relate to nursing pay. They are facts and we cannot change them.</P>
      <P>I mentioned waiting time and the operation turnover time. If one required heart surgery and was placed on a list, the length of the list would be irrelevant if one was an emergency case. The emergency patient would get priority. Also lists can be shuffled around and do not reflect the number of people who have opted to go private, essentially to prevent pain or, in many cases, death. The crux of the problem is the throughput of patients. To give an example, I looked at figures for Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. It has a public child heart surgery list of 96 compared to a private list of 24. The operations are carried out in the same hospital under the same conditions. The crux in this case has to be management priority reform. The Mater heart unit which has five surgeons has 1,000 patients per annum requiring operations. The unit, with considerable resources, could reach only just over 800.</P>
      <P>The disparity in management styles between hospitals is incredible. For instance, the Mater's rules on nurses' overtime differ considerably from St. James's where much more overtime is worked. This is compounded by the fact that the Mater's bill for agency nurses is £2 million. Has the Minister control over how hospitals actually work where one can have overtime and the other does not but brings in agency nurses, an area where there are problems? An idea which was good in principle was the nurses' job sharing scheme, designed to bring more nurses back into the workplace. There is evidence that there is no proper management of this scheme. While it was a good idea in principle it failed to make a serious impact in practice. I accept more money is required but that alone will not speed up the actual number of operations. Before taxpayers' money is wasted, how does the Minister propose to tackle such problems? The biggest contributory factors are bed and staff shortages and I stress the need for structural solutions to structural problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> I regret I do not have more time as I have mentioned only a tenth of what I wanted to say. I appeal to the Minister to take a root and branch approach as to how moneys are being spent in hospitals and how health boards are managing. It would be a shame if the £1 billion to be provided in the national development plan was to go to waste and if we were still dealing with similar waiting lists and waiting times over the next quarter when the figures will be released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his new ministry. The health service here is a two-tier system where those who can afford to pay for it get the service and those who cannot must wait. This index of waiting lists is also an index of pain and suffering. There are over 34,000 people on waiting lists. This figure is totally unacceptable. As Senator Jackman said this problem, which the Government has failed to deal with, must be tackled in a planned and structured way.</P>
      <P>One of the problems which we in Fine Gael have identified is the need for a new grade of consultant in our hospitals &ndash; that is, a full time public consultant who would be dedicated to looking after the people on the public waiting lists and would have no private practice. Such a person would be paid the same very high sum which a top surgeon deserves and gets in the private sector. We must take a structured approach to this question and put the structure in place immediately.</P>
      <P>Throwing money at the health services is not the answer to its problems. It is important that we invest wisely and well. One of our major problems is the shortage, not of consultants but of nurses. We cannot recruit sufficient theatre nurses. Trained nurses have several career choices and many are leaving the country. We must recruit many more nurses with the specialist skills which are in short supply. The health boards or the Department must recruit nurses in whatever country they can be found and pay them sufficiently well to attract them to work in our hospitals. It is not acceptable, when theatres and surgeons are available, that operations are delayed because of a shortage of nurses.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago hundreds of trainee nurses demonstrated outside Leinster House against the charging of fees for part of their education. That situation is disgraceful. We must make it financially attractive for young people to enter the career of nursing. Student nurses should be paid while they are training and we must take a radical look at the way we fund that training. A society is judged by the way it looks after those who are in pain, have low incomes and cannot afford to buy essential services. We must make every possible effort to recruit more nurses, train them well and pay them while they are being trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital accident and emergency departments are unnecessarily clogged up. I welcome the publicity campaign to persuade people to go first to their local doctor. However, the GP service in <Col N="735" /> many of our towns and cities is not adequate. At weekends it is extremely difficult to find a GP. A patient may have to accept the service of a locum, which is not acceptable to many people. General practitioner units must be established in our acute hospital system so that, in major acute hospitals, appropriate patients can be channelled into a GP unit, leaving the accident and emergency services for those who actually need them.</P>
    <P>Step-down facilities are not adequate for elderly people when they are discharged from acute hospitals. In many cases, stroke victims are sent home to be looked after by an elderly spouse for whom tasks such as lifting the patient or taking him or her to the toilet are impossible. Adequate step-down facilities must be made available for elderly people. The lack of these facilities causes untold upset, concern and anger. Home helps are badly paid and in very short supply. In County Louth, for example, they are almost impossible to find. A new type of professional carer is needed. Such people would be paid a full-time salary to go from home to home and look after patients. Our present system is totally inadequate and is collapsing around us.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about services for stroke victims. When elderly stroke victims are discharged from hospital, they do not have access to the physiotherapy which they badly need. The Minister should examine the question of the availability of help for stroke victims when they have been discharged from hospital. Many of these people, when they go home and receive no physiotherapy, feel they have been placed on the scrap heap and that society no longer cares about them. We must devise a strategy for dealing with victims of stroke, particularly when they are elderly.</P>
    <P>It is upsetting to meet a person of sixty or seventy who is waiting in pain for a hip replacement operation on a list that seems to be never ending. Frequently during the summer months, orthopaedic theatre units are closed down and operating theatres deal with emergencies only. Elective surgery lists are suspended for three or four months every year in many of our orthopaedic hospitals. Elderly people must wait all summer in pain and suffering while nothing is done for them. A new strategy is needed for dealing with elective surgery lists.</P>
    <P>Those of us who live in Border counties realise the necessity for co-ordinating our services with those in other countries and particularly in Northern Ireland. We must devise a more organised way of dealing with people in either jurisdiction whose needs are more easily met on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Many patients are on two or three waiting lists. We must compile a national database of people who are on waiting lists so that if a place becomes available in Cork, for example, it can be taken up by a patient in another part of the country. We should not be confined by the rigid structure of <Col N="736" /> the health boards. Patients should be brought to any hospital where theatre space is available.</P>
    <P>A radical overhaul of the health system is needed. It is not good enough. The Government cannot continue to defend the disgraceful system which leaves more than 34,000 people in pain and suffering, awaiting operations which they cannot afford to pay for and which the Government cannot provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the increasing number of patients that are benefiting from acute hospital treatment, commends the increasing Government resources and the series of strategic initiatives that are being taken to facilitate a growing volume and an improving quality of service; and endorses the Government's strategy for reducing public hospital waiting lists and waiting times in a structured, co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary manner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Nobody could object to a discussion on the health services, even on the lines of this evening's discussion. However, the Opposition speakers have spoken almost exclusively in terms of surgery. They referred to eye operations, hip operations, cardiac operations and so on. Unfortunately, mortality is an integral aspect of surgery. Many lay people have an unnatural faith in surgery as a cure for all ills. Many regard their bodies as they do their motor cars, in which the gear box or the engine can be replaced. The human body is not like that.</P>
      <P>A problem for any Minister for Health arises from the length of time it takes to train doctors and nurses. To train a surgeon, for example, takes ten to 15 years and the stress of a surgeon's workload is very great, whether in public or private medicine.</P>
      <P>When I started my medical career people went to hospital because they were sick. Now they go to find out if they are sick or if they are going to be sick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. People are being brainwashed about screening procedures, even the best of which have a failure rate of 10 per cent to 15 per cent. A patient may ask a doctor to check his cholestoral level or blood pressure, the doctor tells him he is healthy and he thinks his engine has been guaranteed for another 20,000 miles. However, he could be dead in the morning. Those practising in medicine realise that but it is not to say we should not strive to improve our medical services. We are dealing with a quality of life service on the one hand and a life saving <Col N="737" /> one on the other. People who require hip replacements, corneal grafts and cataract operations are deserving of them. We should try to ensure that if the operations cannot be given on demand there should be at least a structured waiting list. They should know within a month or so when their operation will be done.</P>
      <P>We should look outside the public hospital system. There is no reason medical card patients should not be treated in private clinics such as Blackrock or the Bon Secours because the requirement is there. A patient's place on a waiting list is decided by a consultant, not by a politician or even a general practitioner. When a patient is referred to a Dublin hospital, a letter will be sent by a GP to a consultant who will decide when the patient will be seen. In some specialist areas the waiting period for private patients can be longer because consultants have a greater range of staff dealing with public patients. They have trainee surgeons and doctors and the taxpayers are paying for this. By and large, the taxpayer gets value for money.</P>
      <P>The point was made earlier that more GPs and a better GP service are required. We also need GPs to work in the hospital system. I consider that 80 per cent of people presenting at accident and emergency units could be seen in the first instance by their GP. General practitioners excel at about the age of 50 when they have about 20 years experience under their belt. If such GPs worked even for a few hours per day in accident and emergency departments, waiting lists would be cleared very quickly. Accident and emergency units are staffed almost exclusively by trainee doctors who, understandably, do not have the experience of knowing what to test for and what to look for. Ranges of tests and X-rays are ordered which clog up pathology and X-ray departments.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider having an accident and emergency hospital &ndash; I suggested this idea some years ago and I was laughed out of court. There is one such hospital in Birmingham which deals totally with accident and emergency cases. It frees up the other hospitals in the general area to deal with what we call cold medicine or cold surgery &ndash; hips, eyes, hearts, etc. For example, if 20 years ago a patient went to an accident and emergency department with a badly mangled hand more than likely amputation would have been involved. That is not the case now. That patient's hand could be saved. The minimum down time in a theatre is 12 hours &ndash; I had a patient recently who was that length of time in the operating theatre. One can imagine how the backlog builds up and this leads to the cancellation of operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not quote facts and figures as the Minister has them at his fingertips. We need more personnel in the health service. A fundamental change in attitude is needed. We must stop looking at patients as mendicant supplicants. We must treat them as valued customers and give them the service for which, as taxpayers, they are paying. A <Col N="738" /> person pays once for service in a hotel. When paying for hospital services one pays through one's taxes, probably through one's VHI and there will be other charges as well. With three charges on a patient the service could be improved greatly but it will take an attitudinal change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for raising the issue. I apologise for being a few minutes late but when I turned on the television in my office I saw the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill debate was ongoing. I was in the middle of a meeting but I came here immediately. I thank Senators Jackman and Fitzpatrick for their contributions. I found Senator Fitzpatrick's contribution fascinating in terms of the practicalities of the health service. This is an important and welcome debate.</P>
      <P>Government health policy impinges in a significant way on the overall quality of life enjoyed by us as a society. It is little wonder that the subject generates much interest and debate, particularly in relation to the quality and availability of acute hospital services which are called on in critical circumstances on a 24 hour basis, 365 days a year. Against this background, I am glad of the opportunity to publicly acknowledge the high quality service overall that is provided in our acute hospitals. I also want to place on record the Government's strategy for its further development and continued improvement to the benefit of patients and potential patients everywhere.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion put to the House this evening attempts to portray a hospital service that is under-performing and that is failing to make full use of the resources available to it, to the neglect of thousands of people. This suggestion does a great disservice to the many thousands of skilled doctors, nurses and other health care professionals and the management of the hospitals and needs to be addressed head on at the outset.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it needs to be recognised that the acute hospital system delivers a service that is ever growing in terms of its volume and complexity. A rapid pace of medical and technological change and ever increasing expectations of quality challenge the system itself and all those working in it on an ongoing basis. Within this highly dynamic and complex environment, the hospital system is producing constantly improving patient outcomes which are facilitated by the ongoing introduction of new services, the development of existing ones, the introduction of new technologies and treatments and an unparalleled commitment to continual professional development by staff at all levels of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from the many qualitative improvements that are being made, in pure volume terms more people are benefiting from services in our acute hospitals now than at any time in the past. The numbers being treated continue to grow, year on year, each year. The latest figures available show that for the first ten months of 1999 almost 2.5 <Col N="739" /> per cent or 16,000 more people were discharged overall and almost 10 per cent more people were treated on a day case basis in our hospitals than in the same period in 1998.</P>
    <P>The overall volume of activity delivered is the most basic measure of performance of the system. Over the course of this year, more than 1.2 million people are likely to avail of accident and emergency services, almost 2 million people will be seen in out-patient departments and more than 800,000 people will be treated on an in-patient or day case basis.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that temporary closures of beds should be viewed. The number of bed days lost in the system through temporary closures represented just 2.73 per cent of the overall bed days available in 1999. The bottom line is that the 97 per cent plus of the total available bed days that were used, enabled a volume of service that was approximately 2.5 per cent up on that provided in 1998 to be delivered.</P>
    <P>Temporary closures do occur for good reason and have been a feature of the bed management function in acute hospitals for many years. Hospital and health board managers have a primary responsibility to ensure that the agreed volumes of service set out in the annual service plan are delivered upon. There is an important onus on them to achieve this within the resources available, be they of a physical, human or financial nature.</P>
    <P>Periods of annual leave for consultant and other staff have traditionally led to temporary closures on a seasonal basis. The vastly increased funding that has been made available through the capital programme under this Government over the past two years has meant that major projects and minor refurbishment works are underway in hospitals all around the country. This year £231 million is available under the capital programme as against £100 million in the year that the previous Government left office. These works, which are aimed at the improvement of facilities for patients, obviously involve unavoidable periods of disruption and temporary closure of facilities while under way.</P>
    <P>There are also, as Members will be aware, specific problems relating to the recruitment of staff, especially nurses, that have necessitated temporary closures in the eastern region in particular. Specific measures are being taken to address that problem which is a function of wider social and economic issues that are not confined to the health sector alone. The key point is that more than ever before the acute hospital system is delivering more service and a higher quality service. Shortening average lengths of stay and an increasing delivery of services at a day case level reflect ongoing advances in medicine that benefit the patient hugely and mean that the resources available can be used to better effect in a manner that suits the clinical and social needs of patients.</P>
    <P>While it is very important to make these points, I am very aware that the issue of access to ser<Col N="740" /> vices for those who are not deemed to be an emergency or in immediate need of care remains a focus of considerable dissatisfaction. Yesterday I announced the waiting list figures for the end of the December 1999 period which showed that the numbers waiting had risen in the final quarter of last year and are now back close to the level they were at this time last year.</P>
    <P>I have already publicly expressed my dissatisfaction with the figures. I realise that the 36,855 people on public hospital waiting lists represent less than one-twentieth of the total numbers admitted annually for treatment in the hospital system. Yet, it is a matter of genuine concern that many patients, whatever proportion they represent, have to endure lengthy waits for access to elective procedures.</P>
    <P>I am aware that waiting lists are an international phenomenon and fully appreciate the complexity of achieving a solution to the problem. Substantial resources have been made available. This year £23.5 million is available under the waiting list initiative. Some £90 million in total was provided under the initiative between 1993 and 1999, yet, the problem of unsatisfactory access remains.</P>
    <P>In coming at the problem there is a need to look at options more creatively and flexibly throughout the system to achieve real progress. These options include more flexible working patterns through longer opening hours for day wards and operating theatres; the use of hostel or other accommodation for patients required to travel for minor procedures; greater utilisation of facilities during periods of low seasonal demand &ndash; we will be looking at this issue in the shorter term to increase utilisation even more; more use of cross-contracting arrangements to maximise overall capacity in the system; improved collaborative arrangements between different parts of the system to facilitate a smooth passage for patients, thereby freeing up acute hospital facilities for new patients more quickly; better flows of information between general practitioners and acute hospitals; possible direct access arrangements for GPs for certain services and ready access to step down and long stay beds for acute hospital bed managers.</P>
    <P>While there is no one simple solution to this problem, the key task is to manage the different parts of the system in a more closely integrated manner. We need to move away from narrow perspectives where each part of the system seeks to address its own problems in isolation and towards management and organisational structures that support a shared objective across programmes of achieving improved access at all stages of care. I am confident that the new era of health services management under way from today in the eastern area with the launch of the Eastern Regional Health Authority will be a major catalyst for progress in that region. The integrated organisational framework now in place in the eastern region needs to be capitalised on <Col N="741" /> and the arrangements should be developed upon elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This integrated approach to the problem underpinned the recommendations of the expert review group on waiting lists which reported in 1998. That report set out a series of short, medium and longer term measures that are directed at addressing the underlying causes of the problem. The Government strategy in place on foot of those recommendations has real potential for success. The good progress made in achieving reductions in the first three quarters of last year provided encouraging evidence of this. I intend to drive the implementation of these recommendations with an even greater urgency, with the emphasis on achieving reductions in average waiting times rather than the less meaningful measure of overall numbers waiting. Progress made to date is being reviewed and, where necessary, I will be seeking to accelerate the introduction of the required measures through direct communication and action with the chief executive officers of health boards.</P>
    <P>The integrated approach required will also be mirrored in the organisational arrangements in place within the Department for tackling the issue. I have already established an inter-divisional group under the chairmanship of the Secretary General for this purpose. We will be looking at short-term as well as medium and longer term responses.</P>
    <P>In planning ahead there is a need to examine the factors that have led to variations in the relative performances of hospitals in achieving waiting list reductions. Certain initiatives have clearly yielded success in some settings and we need to look at the scope for replicating those elsewhere. By the same token, the constraints that have impinged on the performances of other hospitals need to be identified and addressed.</P>
    <P>I propose to take a number of practical steps that can facilitate progress in improving waiting times for access to services. While I am aware that there are no easy solutions, there is a coherent strategy in place which, if actively and comprehensively implemented, provides the promise of real improvement in the way we manage our services, leading to significant reductions in waiting times for access.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the shorter-term measures now being taken there is a need to gear up the system with longer-term demand issues associated with demographic changes and to put in place the infrastructural framework required to address some of the underlying causes of the problems now being faced in the acute system. Towards this end the Government is committed to the investment of £2 billion capital funding under the national development plan over the next seven years. Significantly, £1 billion of this will be directed towards the non-acute sector. This represents an unprecedented level of investment in the infrastructure necessary to ensure patients are given access to services in the setting they require. This development of non-acute and com<Col N="742" /> munity based services should also absorb some of the load being carried by the acute hospital system. The hospital system will also see investment of an additional £1 billion over this period. Investment on this scale should show real results in addressing some of the bottlenecks and under-capacity in the system.</P>
    <P>In tandem I am initiating an immediate review of overall bed capacity in the acute hospital sector. This review is committed to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and will be undertaken by the Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. It will specifically address the issue of bed capacity and projected future demand. The review will examine and assess the adequacy of day care facilities as well as the organisation and utilisation of other existing facilities. It will also look at issues arising in the areas of manpower planning and technology assessment to support future decisions on the provision of diagnostic and treatment equipment.</P>
    <P>These measures form only part of the Government's overall strategy for the development of acute hospital services. As part of a planned, coherent approach major progress is being made on a number of fronts in improving the responsiveness of the service to meeting identified need and in ensuring a patient focused, quality based approach underpins the delivery of service at every level. This is being achieved through the implementation of the recently launched national cardiovascular strategy now under way at an anticipated full cost of £150 million; the ongoing major progress being made in implementing the national cancer strategy &ndash; £34 million has been invested to date under the Government; the development of renal services through a planned investment of £20 million over the next three years which will dramatically improve and change the environment for renal services and a wide range of initiatives aimed at improving quality, from addressing medical manpower issues through to developing hospital and laboratory accreditation, acute hospital governance, management development, clinicians in management and health technology assessment.</P>
    <P>These strategic developments are being facilitated by the unprecendented levels of additional resources the Government is committing to the improvement of our health services. Development funding for the acute sector alone this year stands at well over four times what was provided in the previous Government's final year in office.</P>
    <P>While there are issues remaining to be addressed, it should be borne in mind that there is no service sector, public or private, that deals with people in such large numbers day in, day out and has comparable demands placed on it in terms of complexity, quality and the need for sensitive treatment of individual patients and their families as the acute hospital sector. In terms of access, quality, effectiveness in the use of resources and the commitment and skill of staff, our acute hospital system compares extremely <Col N="743" /> well internationally. The Government is committing the resources and we have the strategies in place to ensure the service can continue to respond to the demands it faces and continuously improve as we move forward in the new millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome him to this Chamber in his new role as Minister for Health and Children. I wish him well. We know him to be a good, careful, considerate and caring Minister. We had that experience of him as Minister for Education and Science, a role in which he did remarkably well. I have no doubt that he will follow the same track as Minister for Health and Children. To some politicians this is a poisoned chalice because it is not an easy position to fill as there is always greater demand than capacity, particularly as medical techniques improve and people assume that they are entitled to perfect health at the expense of the State but unfortunately we are perishable goods. We do not last forever and there are certain circumstances in which there is little that the medical profession can do. We seem to trust that everything can be set right either surgically, as Senator Fitzpatrick said, or with drugs.</P>
      <P>There is always, it seems, a shortage of money also. I am heartened by what the Minister said, that £2 billion is being allocated, of which £1 billion is for non-acute services. This is certainly good news. I am glad that these resources are placed at his disposal because the Minister has the capacity to be a great health Minister. We have had one or two great Ministers, and the one I think of in particular is my old friend, the late Noel Browne. Recently I watched a film called &ldquo;Dr. Browne Also Spoke&rdquo; in which Noel Browne was standing in an empty hospital in Galway which was about to be closed. He spoke so passionately about this beautiful place and the tragedy that the beds and the wonderful facilities were being left unused. In the 1940s, with the assistance of his Department, he literally raided the funds of the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes and used all the capital to build hospitals. At that time, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Ireland, together with Sweden, had the best health service and hospitals in Europe. I hope we can regain that position because I am not sure we have it at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one reads in the newspapers of people prominent in public and political life going abroad to the Mayo Clinic or the Sloane Kettering Institute for treatment of various kinds, of course on a human level one cannot blame them. When they are there receiving the most sophisticated treatment at the top of a queue, I wonder if their increased awareness of their own vulnerability as mortal beings ever fires them up to think that they must use every effort to provide the very best services in Ireland. I suppose it is a cliché but nevertheless it is true that one of the <Col N="744" /> classic indicators by which one judges the moral welfare of society is the way in which it treats its vulnerable, and particularly its sick.</P>
    <P>I am not making a partisan point because I am an Independent and all Governments confront the same problems. There is no point in one party scoring points off the others &ndash; they have all confronted this situation. There have been shortfalls in the level of facilities made available to people by every Government and one would hope that the State's capacity to deliver good services would increase, but under successive Governments it is the disadvantaged who have suffered. I am a member of the highest possible VHI scheme, which I think is scheme E, and apparently can get everything I want. I can even go to the top of the queue. However, that does not matter. To my mind the test is the service provided for people who do not have the money to join such schemes, the people who for one reason or another, particularly financial disadvantage, are left out of the schemes.</P>
    <P>I am worried about a few matters also, such as this business about so many people being discharged early. This is the caring Minister, and that is why I ask him to look at those figures because there is a kind of ideal of bureaucratic efficiency at work in some of the health services. The idea is to get as many people through the system as possible and sometimes that militates against the patients.</P>
    <P>Recently I spent time in hospital. I was perfectly healthy until I got in and they got at me. The next time I will go either to a vet or a plumber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Senator Fitzpatrick's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a prostate procedure. They were inserting a camera into the urethra to have a look, etc., and I assumed they were using fibre optics but, from what I felt when I woke up on the slab, it must have been the outside broadcast unit of RTÉ television. A couple of hours after I woke up I was discharged in a taxi. Some 24 hours later I was very ill indeed. I had to get a fire brigade ambulance and I ended up in hospital for nearly a fortnight. That is really not an economy. Sometimes if one discharges people too quickly after these procedures one is not doing any favour either to the patient, the efficiency of the service or the economy because it costs more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that little procedure not everybody suffers bleeding, as I did. There were no antibiotics used. Why not? In Europe and America this is common practice. I know that the kind of strong adverse reaction which I had is unusual, but it probably occurs to a fair number of people. To my mind, it is not a saving not to use antibiotics because if they had been used as a precautionary measure, it would have saved them this further treatment. This is my personal experience but that is my contact with the service. However, I am very grateful <Col N="745" /> for the wonderful care and concern which I received from the doctors and the nursing staff.</P>
    <P>I noticed two things about the conditions of young doctors and nurses. I saw the way some of them are humiliated. I saw a consultant come in and go straight over to a fellow who was very ill. I noticed, incidentally, the difference between the patients who are very ill and those who are not very ill. The very ill patients are compliant, caring and co-operative and the ones with very little wrong with them are the most awful collection of whingers one could ever come across. The patient to whom I refer had his hand lifted up like a lump of meat without hearing so much as, &ldquo;Good morning, may I introduce myself? Do I have your permission to use you as an exhibit?&rdquo;  The consultant started talking about the rash. A young female doctor or nurse had saved that man's life during the night, but there was some test which was not back from the laboratory and the consultant just turned and said, &ldquo;Are you stupid? Have you any intelligence? Do you know anything about medicine?&rdquo;, in front of the patient, the other students and me. I just struggled to my feet, got to the end of the bed, waited until he looked around for applause and approval, and stuck out my tongue and gestured my disapproval. Then I pulled the curtain around the bed and the nurse came in and asked, &ldquo;Are you in pain? Do you need a pain killer?&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;No, I do not. I want ear plugs because I will not listen to that ignorant lout humiliating people whom he is supposed to be teaching.&rdquo;  I taught for nearly 30 years in Trinity College and one does not teach people by humiliation. One must have respect for nurses. That includes not just matters of pay but also respect for the care they give and for their dignity as human beings. One should not humiliate and trash them.</P>
    <P>It is not just about wages. It is matters like the fact that, at a time when there is supposed to be free third level education, nurses are the only group expected to pay for their university education out of their small incomes. That is wrong. I am glad to see the Minister indicate that this is not true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit more complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something which should be looked at because it is perceived as such by the nurses. This is probably why the nurses reacted so terribly badly to the question of the use of the word vocation. That shattered me. I could not believe it. I heard decent reasonable people from the other side of the House use the word. The nurses asked, &ldquo;How dare they call it a vocation?&rdquo;  That is because they feel they are being exploited, but of course it is a vocation. Politics is a vocation, as far as I am concerned. I was a teacher and that is a vocation also. It should not mean that one gets humiliated and does not get paid properly, but it should be a vocation. It should be a calling to help, serve and minister to other people, as is the vocation of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> Recently I heard on the radio of the huge bureaucracy involved in the appointment of a medical oncologist in Cork. That appointment must go before about 18 committees, which is madness. Is it not possible to cut through that bureaucracy and appoint such people? There are sick people who need these services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not tolerable that there should be reference to all these different committees.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that this has become a matter of contention because in the area of health we should urge the Minister rather than put things to a vote. I will not be voting because I will not be here as I must chair a meeting about James Joyce &ndash; we have a visitor from Zurich. If I were here, I would not vote anyway because I would prefer that the House urge the Minister, support the Minister and give him the teeth he needs in dealing with bureaucracies of all kinds and not make a political football of the issue. There is no side of this House which has solved the problem of the demand for medical services by every citizen, including me.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing a good job and I wish him well in helping people who are sick or vulnerable, particularly the people who, unlike all of us, cannot afford to pay for it themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has challenged all of us to be constructive in the course of this debate and that must be applauded. I will attempt to be as constructive as I can. I am not minded to come into the House and criticise the Government and pin the blame for the length of the waiting lists on it. I am mindful of the fact that this year alone £23.5 million has been invested in specific initiatives to shorten the waiting lists. If there is one lesson more than any other which can be learned from that it is that throwing money at our problems does not solve them. Our problems are infinitely more complex than that and they demand much more complex responses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I would very much like the Minister to be here, but I fully understand. I wish him well in his new brief. I would like to say, while he is still within earshot, I hope that during his term of office the emphasis in the Department of Health and Children will be on health rather than on sickness and that we could switch our attitude. I will develop that point later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that part of the reason for the swelling of the waiting lists this year was the 'flu and the way it hit people, particularly older people, in the <Col N="747" /> last three months of last year. There is great scope for the development of the GP service. We are too quick to refer people to hospitals. A good deal of treatment, healing and cures could be brought about by an extension of the GP service. The extension of the GP service should be an objective during the Minister's term in office with a view to keeping as many people as possible out of hospital.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am acutely aware of the human misery inflicted on people who are on waiting lists for certain operations. I am thinking, in particular, of hip replacement surgery. If one has VHI or private health cover, one can have one's hip replacement in six weeks or in two months at the most. If, on the other hand, one happens to be a public health patient, one may have to wait for one and a half to two years. That is an obscenity.</P>
    <P>It is pathetic to see the level of ongoing grinding misery inflicted on people who suffer from acute arthritis or acute failure of the joints. If we are to make inroads into that area of elective surgery we need to employ a group of surgeons dedicated specifically to public patients. We should employ and pay such surgeons and require of them, for a specified number of years, whether two to four years, to deal only with public patients and not to carry on with this lethal mix which exists at the moment where consultants can, at their own discretion, opt in and out and see their private patients on a Monday and their public patients on a Monday nine weeks hence. It is unsatisfactory and is an obscenity in any country, particularly in one as small as ours with the type of homogeneous population we have, and in a Christian country that there has to be this disparity of treatment between patients in the private and public sectors. It wounds me greatly and hurts me more than anything else.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed at the way the Minister for Health and Children tried to address disadvantage when he was Minister for Education and Science. He tried to close that appalling and unacceptable gap between those who achieve within our system and benefit greatly from it and those who get little out of it. If that principle and philosophy were applied to health and were put into practice on a day to day basis, it would make a radical change and difference.</P>
    <P>As a young and active Minister, I would like to see him place more emphasis on good health and good health practices. I would like us to develop a system which gives better recognition to what is now called alternative medicine. There are people who believe that those who go for herbal medicines, acupuncture and these types of treatments are hypochondriacs. In my experience, for the most part, these people are conscious of good health and are prepared to go that extra mile to maintain good health.</P>
    <P>I would like a registration system for practitioners in that field, including acupuncturists and people who carry out deep massage and pro<Col N="748" /> cedures of that nature. I suspect they are not all good and we have no way of knowing, which is a pity. However, we will have no way of knowing until there is a system of registration. I suspect those who are good are very good, and I have experience of this.</P>
    <P>There is much waste in the health service and I will give a simple example. Senator Norris gave a personal example, so I feel entitled to give mine. I had hip replacement surgery about two years ago and was in hospital for nine days. I was covered by the top VHI plan and when I rang my insurers to ask about the aftercare to which I was entitled, they told me I could have two weeks in a convalescent home, the cost of which was £700 per week. They were prepared to foot a bill of £1,400 if that was what I wanted. I said I did not want that because I had been in hospital for nine days, which was long enough for me, and I wanted to go home.</P>
    <P>I felt I was at least mentally agile enough to be able to manage at home if I got a little help because I live in a house with another professional woman who is at work during the day. I asked if I could have access to home help for maybe three weeks. Home helps are paid £3 per hour by the health board in Cork. However, that was not permissible under the private insurers scheme. That is such a bad use of money. In the event, it was not a lot of money anyway but it is the principle rather than the cost I am highlighting. I got my home help and, although I do not know what it cost per hour, it was very little and was for only a few weeks after which I was fit and fine. It goes to show how badly we think through value for money and service to customers. I would like to bring that to the Minister's notice.</P>
    <P>On herbal medicine, there was much public debate about St. John's wort, in particular. I hoped that debate would not be let die and that, as a result of it, there would be greater focus on this type of medicine in the promotion of good health and the prevention of sickness, that there would be more public discourse about it and that there would be a system to register health shops so that clients would know, scientifically, what was good and what was being flogged commercially in shops. There is great scope to do that.</P>
    <P>I note £150 million extra has been allocated to the cardiovascular area, which is very welcome. We need to place much greater emphasis on preventing the development of cardiovascular diseases. I come from a family where, by the standards of the previous generations, I should be dead and gone nearly ten years. None of my aunts and uncles nor my father survived beyond their fifties. I had a brother who died at 37 years so I know something of the loss to families because of heart disease and heart attacks.</P>
    <P>We need to promote good health practices. We have more information at our fingertips than ever before as to what promotes health and prevents cardiovascular disease. The Department of Health and Children should promote, at national <Col N="749" /> and local levels, good health practices, more exercise, good diet and a good attitude to life.</P>
    <P>Sadly, one of our colleagues suffered a heart attack today. I do not know of anybody who would not put that down to the pressure of work and lifestyle. I know that person has all our good wishes and prayers. He is a young man and we hope he will make a total recovery. That should stop us in our tracks and remind us of the kind of lifestyle we all lead. We are supposed to give leadership in society. In terms of lifestyle and its impact on good health, we do not give good example. We are not great models and that is a pity. Something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>While £34 million has been allocated for cancer treatment services, I argue that sufficient emphasis is not placed on prevention and early diagnosis. Cancer is a major killer among women. The House will have statements tomorrow on national women's day and we will love, treasure and value our women, but we ought to do more to ensure the early diagnosis and prevention of cancer. Few things are more harrowing than the death of mothers of young children and we should be conscious of that.</P>
    <P>Henceforth, I hope less money will be spent on the administration of the health services. I endorse what Senator Norris said about the cumbersome procedure of appointing consultants. It is not the hallmark of a developed modern country. It would not happen in Chechnya. I welcome this debate.</P>

      <P>I am delighted a general practitioner is in the ministerial chair and that my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, is present. I welcome the Minister's speech. I also welcome that he has set up a study into the shortage of acute beds in the hospital services. I compliment Senator Jackman on tabling this motion. Given all the money we have spent in the past ten years in the health services, it is profoundly depressing that the waiting list has increased to the level it was at when the first waiting list initiative was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, in 1993. There were 40,000 on the waiting list at that time, but the number has increased to that level again. That is profoundly depressing not only for patients but for those who work in the services.</P>

    <P>There is less elective surgery and fewer elective admissions. In 1994 64 per cent of hospital admissions were emergencies, by 1997 that figure had increased to 68 per cent and the estimated figure for last year was 70 per cent. In five years there has been a 10 per cent increase in the number of emergency admissions. That is also profoundly depressing because more and more people are being put down the waiting list as people are brought in as emergency cases. Whether they become emergency cases because they are wait<Col N="750" /> ing for treatment is another matter we must consider. One of the most important aspects of the continual lengthening of waiting lists is that we have more emergency cases. While people may become emergency cases because they have to wait for treatment, we must take into account that we have an ageing population and more of our people are likely to be admitted to hospital as emergency cases.</P>
    <P>There are several reasons waiting lists have developed. In the late 1980s, about 3,000 acute beds in the hospital system were lost, about 1,000 of which were lost in Dublin. We have not recovered from that loss. I am delighted the Minister has at last commissioned a study to ascertain whether we need more acute beds. I think we do. He is the first Minister to consider this matter in recent years. I hope the study is completed rapidly.</P>
    <P>I was working more actively in the hospital system when Dr. Steeven's hospital was closed down. It was only when it closed that many of us in the other Dublin hospitals realised the amount of work that went through that hospital. It was incredible. It took a great deal of casualty cases, which allowed other hospitals, such as St. Vincent's and the Mater, two of the hospitals particularly badly hit at present, to take on more of the elective cases.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that, apparently, every night 450 acute beds are occupied by people who should be in step down hospitals. We have a grave problem due to the shortage of acute beds. An acute hospital bed costs £2,000 a week. I will leave it the better mathematicians in the Seanad to tell me how much those 450 acute beds cost every night, but it is a considerable amount of money. This happens on a nightly basis across the country. We cannot afford to allow this practice to continue.</P>
    <P>Step down hospitals are not inferior, they are extremely good. One generally gets a very high standard of nursing there and one is away from the hustle and bustle of the activity in an acute hospital. It is preferable to be in a step down hospital when one is recovering from an acute illness. I am pleased Dr. Fitzpatrick is nodding in agreement. The faster one can get out of an acute hospital, the better. If one is not fit to go home, one would be better off in a step down hospital. I was once in an intensive care ward and it was worse than being at a crossroads. It was a nightmare. I do not know how people survive to get out of those hospitals as there is so much activity in them day and night. The rest and tranquility that is required for people to be restored to health is not to be found in those hospitals. We must act to deal with the provision of step down beds.</P>
    <P>A serious problem in surgery is that some theatres are closed because we do not have the theatre staff to run them. We have a grave shortage of theatre nurses. This is an international problem. It has been the practice in America for many years that theatre technicians are part of <Col N="751" /> the career structure. It mainly came about because of the involvement of male nurses in war zones with the American army. Perhaps we should examine that possibility. Theatre technicians' training is not as long as that of nurses and it is more technical. If we examined the possibility of recruiting theatre technicians, we could augment the number of theatre staff.</P>
    <P>There are four theatres closed in St. Vincent's hospital and its waiting list is the worst at present. How can that position be improved if the hospital cannot open those four theatres? Several theatres in Tallaght hospital have never opened. Beaumont hospital has theatres closed at present due to the lack of an anaesthetist. We put in place the bricks and mortar of hospitals, but we do not make sure we have the necessary staff to ensure the work can be done.</P>
    <P>There is a patchwork approach to this problem in some hospitals. For example, to get its cardiac surgery unit open, St. James's hospital acquired nurses from different parts of the hospital, but that meant other theatres were left short staffed. That results in people having to cut their lists. Some hospitals now have a rota to ensure that everyone's list is not always cut. For example, if my list was cut on Monday, another person's would be cut on Tuesday and another person's would be cut on Wednesday. Without a rota, it was found that the same people were having their lists cut all the time. This practice augmented the build up of waiting lists for specialty treatments, such as ear, nose and throat, where it was easier to cut elective operations because the cases were not quite as grave as the emergencies in other cases. That led to very serious problems.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of 1,200 nurses in Dublin at present. Nurses' pay is an important aspect of this problem. It is very expensive to live in Dublin. The low morale within the nursing profession is also an important element. Clinical care gets very little kudos nowadays which is most unfortunate. If people do not have a hi-tech diploma, they do not feel they are worthwhile, although it is not that those with whom they work do not think they are worthwhile. Patients will not allow anybody apart from nurses to poke at them to see how they are getting on. Nurses cannot be replaced with the same ease as staff in other parts of a hospital. Nurses must be used in the places where it is absolutely essential that they be employed and where there clinical skills are most needed. More could be done to promote retraining courses for women in their 30s and 40s who might consider returning to nursing because of the seriousness of the situation. Recently I saw an advertisement for the Mater Hospital which offered shifts of two, four, six, eight or 12 hours.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the consultant situation briefly. I am a member of Comhairle na nOspidéal which carries out consultant surveys every now and then. I wonder why we do so, however, because I can say who will be retiring in 2020. I presume that half the rest of the country could do <Col N="752" /> the same, yet no job ever seems to be advertised until six months after the person should have retired. This occurs even though the administrations both of the health board and the hospital know perfectly well that this greying figure who is walking the corridors is obviously going to retire soon. Why on earth is this ridiculous process going on?</P>
    <P>I would caution Fine Gael on this matter of having people full-time in the public service. A large number of people are and if one added the private waiting lists to the public ones it would be much worse. Therefore, it is not that great a solution. The really important solution is to increase the number of consultants. Apart from parts of the United Kingdom, Ireland has the lowest level of consultants <i>per capita,</i> in all specialities, among the OECD group of countries. This is patently ridiculous. The country currently needs 35 neurologists and has only 11. In 1991 when we had ten we requested 25, yet in nearly ten years we got only one. Consultant staffing levels must be increased. I keep hearing promises but we must not be fooled into thinking that extra people in the public service will deal with the waiting lists. Public waiting lists in orthopaedics, ENT and dermatology are just as bad as in the private service. One would be as well to get one's name down on both lists in the hope of getting to the top of one of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the amendment. I was slightly amused when I saw the motion, given the previous Administration's record in this area. My colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, mentioned the increase in people's approach to the elective method of having various procedures carried out. Twenty years ago if people had to go to hospital, half the parish rallied round and encouraged them to go, and there was wailing and gnashing of teeth. That is not the case now, however. It is quite the opposite. This is due to people knowing that little bit better. When they go to their GP for a 50 or 60 year check-up, the GP will refer them for a number of tests, as all good GPs do. Following that they can be on any of four or five waiting lists. That is one aspect of the current situation in the health service.</P>
      <P>Other aspects include the fact that people are living longer, emigration is almost nil and Irish people are returning from other countries. While we may be criticised by some people on the other side of the House for doing so, we are also taking in political refugees. They deserve to be taken in and their health needs have to be serviced. Taking all those things into consideration, it must impact on the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the motion amusing because, talking about waiting lists, from 1996 to 1997 the previous Administration reduced health funding for that particular service from £12 million to £8 million. When Deputy Cowen took office in 1997 as Minister for Health and Children he increased that figure to £12 million. It is now almost 300 per cent greater at approximately £23.5 million. What <Col N="753" /> is the current position? Waiting lists are still increasing and nobody can say why. I certainly do not know. As a member of the Association of Health Boards I am in constant contact with members of the medical and nursing professions and they do not seem to know why waiting lists are increasing either. The point has been well made that throwing money at the problem will not resolve it.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzpatrick said, medical staff in A&amp;E departments are not experienced people. We need to separate the wheat from the chaff. If some people have a pain in their big toe or a toothache they go to the casualty department of a hospital rather than their GP or dentist. That is why others have to wait in the A&amp;E department of Longford-Westmeath general hospital, in some cases for up to ten or 12 hours.</P>
    <P>In his address, the Minister made a very positive suggestion when he said:</P>
    <P>Shortening average lengths of stay and an increasing delivery of services at a day case level reflect ongoing advances in medicine that benefit the patient hugely and mean that the resources available can be used to better effect in a manner that suits the clinical and social needs of patients.</P>
    <P>As regards post-operative recovery periods, who is to say that when a person has a certain surgical procedure they must spend the entire recovery period in an acute bed? That is nonsense. In that respect I welcome the Minister's statement that the &ldquo;development of non-acute and community based services should also absorb some of the load being carried by the acute hospital system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Last year a motion in the name of Senator Norris and other Independent Senators dealt with the psychiatric services. A survey of acute psychiatric services by the Eastern Health Board revealed a 45 per cent rate of inappropriate bed occupancy. While I am not saying that is the case in general hospitals, there is some evidence of it. I hope that will be eliminated in the psychiatric services and I will certainly pursue the matter. It should be reflected also in the acute general hospital services, including casualty units. We have such a unit in the Midland Health Board which is serviced by local GPs. These can reduce bed occupancy in acute hospitals.</P>

      <P>Health is not just a matter of surgical and psychiatric beds. It is a very broad-based service. It is worth noting the Minister's investment of huge resources in areas such as mental <Col N="754" /> handicap services, psychiatry and disability services in general. That should be noted.</P>
      <P>I will not draw the Chair's ire any further, but a root and branch examination of the waiting lists is needed. It has always been and will always be a feature of beds in acute hospitals that some are closed at certain times, such as the summer and Christmas periods. They were closed under the previous Administration, the one before that and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck by Senator Norris's comment that he judged a society on how it treated its sickest and most vulnerable people. That is a fair way to judge a Government, society or people. At a time when Ireland's prosperity has reached a level we never thought was possible &ndash; we are richer than any economist ever predicted &ndash; I do not believe the motion goes far enough. The Government amendment is mealy-mouthed, absurd and cosmetic. There is no excuse in Ireland today for waiting lists of any sort. We can well afford over-capacity, not under-capacity, in our hospitals &ndash; we can well afford to have empty beds waiting. We can afford that flexibility to meet the demands of the growing population.</P>
      <P>What Senator Norris said was right, but I would go further. I am a committed free marketeer who believes in the profit motive and in keeping public spending down, but health care should be non-negotiable. To a large extent, voluntary health insurance is immoral and I am immoral myself as I subscribe to it because I am selfish and can afford it. I do it for all my family and am on the top rate; it is not a matter of great pride to me but is a matter of necessity. I do it because health is the most important asset any person can carry with them. However, it is patently unfair and unjust that some people should be able to buy better treatment while others are on these long waiting lists. Do not ask me to be an angel and justify what I am doing. Everyone knows why they are on VHI and others are not. It is because they want to stay alive.</P>
      <P>At the heart of this motion is an Opposition condemning the waiting lists but making no radical suggestions and a Government saying it congratulates itself on reducing the waiting times in a structured, co-ordinated and multidisciplinary manner. That is rhubarb &ndash; it means nothing. What we should be saying is that there is no longer an excuse in modern Ireland for people to die, which is what happens by virtue of not having enough money. The Minister knows, as do I, that some people on waiting lists with heart and brain conditions die because they do not get to hospital in time. That is what happens. We cannot justify that and we are not even taking steps to resolve it. The number one target should be to ensure nobody dies because they are on a waiting list, but the only way to do that is not to have a waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way to achieve that is to do the exact opposite to what the last speaker said &ndash; it is to <Col N="755" /> throw money at it. That is the way to do it &ndash; to build more hospitals, to train more doctors and to do what we have not done for years, to pay nurses more. If the Government said we do not have enough hospital beds, doctors or nurses, so it is introducing a programme to ensure within a certain number of years this will end and if we have over-capacity and too many doctors and nurses, I would respect them for it. What we are getting is a mealy-mouthed token attempt to convince us we are doing something.</P>
    <P>The Government is, of course, the only shareholder in the VHI. The existence of that organisation and BUPA must be questioned, as they are the vehicles whereby better off people stay alive and poorer people die. This is a clear case for the State taking a responsibility for all its citizens equally.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is it more apparent that the State does not take its responsibility seriously than in its attitude to nurses. I have never had it explained to me why nurses are paid so much less than most other groups in the public service. I have asked that question for ten years while I have been bellyaching for their pay and conditions to be improved, but nobody can ever explain it to me. It is not because they do not work as hard because they work a damn sight harder. It is not because they do unnecessary work because they do the most necessary work. The reason they are paid so little is that Irish society does not value the health of its lesser citizens. If it did, this Government and the previous one would have rerated the nurses and put a value on them above other areas of the public service. However, it has not because it is able to get away with it. The nurses should be paid more and given better conditions than nearly every other group in the public service. That would indicate that the State and the Government believe that health care is more important than anything else. I include teachers, gardaí, prison officers and the Army. These are the people who stand for protecting the nation's health and should be rewarded accordingly. In the market economy in which we now exist nurses, because of their scarcity, will probably command greater salaries, but that is because they will have to wring it out of a Government that does not want to give it to them. It is not because the Government will say voluntarily that it feels what nurses do is so important that they should get more; it is a contest.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to the VHI is very strange. It allowed the VHI to increase and decrease premiums and waste money. This was ignored for a long time. It had an extraordinary number of cars for its executives. This seems inexcusable.</P>

      <P>It has a great deal to do with it. The Government's response to the crisis in the VHI is not just to sell it off but to give it £50 million, and for what purpose? This is a purely commercial response which will allow the VHI to exploit people to the full. This is the wrong response. The Government should look at ways of ridding the nation of private health insurance, which in itself is of such dubious value. This is encouraging the rich to be healthy and the poor to be unhealthy. The result is that there are people on waiting lists which is referred to in the motion. There is no radical approach to health care; there is a piecemeal and reactive approach to it. There are waiting lists to which all Governments react when in office. However, they never attack the fundamental problem which is the right of every citizen to equal health care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I saw the British Prime Minister being asked questions on a live television show about the general health service in Britain. It was interesting that some of the difficulties we are experiencing seem to be similar to the problems in Britain in relation to the health care system in which the British Government in the past, particularly the Labour Party who introduced it, had such great pride. In Britain people do not seem to be able to get proper medical treatment such as surgery and hip replacements. Certainly there are long waiting lists and there is a need for change and investment. It seems that 9 per cent of gross national product goes into the health care service and it is intended to provide the public with a proper complementary service in the next five to seven years.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the motion and the Minister, Deputy Martin's, contribution indicates that he is carrying out an in-depth analysis of the health service. He is looking at areas where there is need for change. I agree with the previous speakers, including Senator Norris, that a yardstick of the strength of the economy is the level of health care people receive. Many people, who may not be financial wizards, believe that despite the substantial investment by this Government in the last two and a half years under the national development plan, and by Governments in the past, there are very few results by way of a reduction in the numbers on waiting lists. At the end of the day, this is the fundamental measurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a radical approach and proper evaluation of the administration of the health service. There must be major changes in dealing with consultants and there must be a better return for the money invested by Government in the long term. There will have to be changes by technicians in operating theatres. There must be more versatility so that there is a better return for money. By having a co-ordinated approach nationally throughout the service, from administration level down, including consultants, GPs and throughout the voluntary health system, I believe we can achieve a greater return for our <Col N="757" /> money and a better service for the public. I am aware we will come up against very strict structures which have been in place for many years, particularly in relation to consultants. There is need for a fundamental change in this area and for a new approach by young consultants who, if properly remunerated, will carry out the work and break down old structures. This should be encouraged because it will give a better return for money within the health service.</P>
    <P>There should be greater opportunities for more young qualified consultants and surgeons to take on this work. This would go a long way towards reducing waiting lists nationally. The Minister mentioned substantial investment in overall health care from general practice upwards. This would allow for a more caring health service, it would take the pressure off hospitals and allow for greater development of acute hospital services.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine question in relation to the voluntary health service. It should either be expanded in a national context to give a better service or it should be analysed in the context of the overall investment in the health services. It could be argued that the voluntary health service creates a two tier system, to which we are all party. However, it has served some people well but it does not serve a huge section of society. The issue of health insurance should be addressed in the overall review of the health services if they are to be brought up to the level expected of this productive modern Irish economy which has gained a lot of international prestige. A lot of effort should be put into dealing with this area. I am satisfied that the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, the Department and the Government will make substantial changes in this regard and that the Irish people and those on waiting lists will be the beneficiaries in the long term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to emphasise the thrust of the motion which is that the Government should take immediate initiatives to ensure the full and proper utilisation of our hospital resources this year so as to significantly reduce the numbers now awaiting in-hospital treatment. The Minister states that the Fine Gael motion attempts to portray a hospital service that is under performing and that is failing to make full use of the resources available to it, to the neglect of thousands of people, and that our suggestion does a great disservice to the many thousands of skilled doctors, nurses and other health care professionals and the management of the hospitals and needs to be addressed head on at the outset. We called on the Government to provide a structure. There was no criticism of the skilled nurses, doctors and health care professionals. I am concerned about this because calling us the baddies is a cop-out. We are discussing facts and figures. I detected in Senator Frank Chamber's comments that he seemed to agree totally with me on the need for a strategy and integrated services, all the <Col N="758" /> things I have mentioned. Many Senators have stated that an improvement and an integrated structure are needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that hospital and health board managers have a primary responsibility to ensure that the agreed volumes of service set out in the annual service plan are delivered upon. He is making the point for which he criticised Fine Gael. He said there is an onus on them to achieve this within the resources available.</P>
      <P>He also said that the Government has put in place major projects and that minor refurbishment works are under way in hospitals all around the country. Infrastructure was put into the Regional General Hospital in Limerick, for example, during Deputy Michael Noonan's time as Minister for Health, but the resources are not there today. The consultants and the team that a consultant needs to bring with him or her are not there. Some wards are not open and new rooms are not occupied because the consultants have not been appointed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there is no one simple solution to this problem and the key task is to manage the different parts of the system in a more closely integrated manner. This is what we were calling for in our motion. We agree with what he says and still an amendment was put down which contradicts the points he is making and those made by us. He mentioned the need for an integrated approach, which affirms what we are looking for.</P>
      <P>He mentioned the expert review group on waiting lists which reported in 1998. That report sets out a series of short, medium and longer-term measures. Money is spent on short-term strategies which we would be happier to see spent implementing long-term strategies and that is why the waiting lists are long. The money does not appear to be utilised correctly to reduce the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to positive things he intends to do but he mentioned just two or three and I would like to give him more suggestions to consider. These suggestions include the use of communications technology as referred to by Senator Fergus O'Dowd who seconded my motion. The national guidelines must detail a specific timeframe within which patients should receive care. There is a reference to the UK regarding those guidelines, which we should implement. Consultants should be appointed without delay. We said that before it was raised today and it was debated very stringently today on the &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; radio programme. I did not hear the Minister say that the recommendations from the Commission of Nursing should be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national assessment of unused capacity within each hospital should be carried out. Those with unused capacity should have the option of buying in work from outside their area, thereby reducing waiting lists. This would ensure current resources are fully utilised. I am helping the Minister by giving him Fine Gael proposals on how <Col N="759" /> we would deal with this. He referred to those patients who do not need to stay overnight in hospital but do so for practical reasons such as living a long distance from the hospital, for whom guesthouses and hostel accommodation should be provided. We have said all this. It has been said by Deputy Alan Shatter many times but Ministers have chosen to ignore it. I did pick up that proposal and I am delighted to see that he is picking up on Fine Gael's positive proposals.</P>
    <P>All hospital beds should be kept open all year round &ndash; the Minister differs from me on that &ndash; as closing them in the summer is false economy and it only further exacerbates the problem. In the mid-Western Health Board region, 39 beds are closed on average every month. That should not be the case. Day surgery units, which the Minister did not mention, should be established, to greatly increase the opportunity to reduce elective surgery waiting lists. More investment is needed to provide ongoing out-patient services to <Col N="760" /> allow acute out-patients priority. This is necessary for particular services. We must consider the future. Tele-medicine is especially useful for patients in remote areas or those with mobility problems.</P>
    <P>We have been extremely constructive in proposing this motion and I cannot understand why the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Senators could not have accepted the essence of our motion, which is to ensure the full and proper utilisation of our hospital resources this year to significantly reduce the estimated list of 37,000 people now awaiting in-hospital treatment. I am shocked that this amendment has been put down, taking up our points on dealing in a structured, co-ordinated and multi-disciplinary manner as a strategy to reduce public hospital waiting lists. This is the point of our motion and what we have been arguing. The amendment was put down for cosmetic reasons and we cannot accept it.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Proposed Privatisation of Aer Rianta.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. While the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, is an expert and able Minister I did not realise his ability extended to the proposed privatisation of Aer Rianta. Given that he is not a member of Cabinet I ask him to convey to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, my disappointment that she has not come here to take this important matter.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this matter is that there is a general belief that the Government is about to make a decision in relation to the privatisation or part-privatisation of Aer Rianta. It is important that the Government realise this is a very serious matter and that the Warburg Dillon Read report should be rejected out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has responsibility for three national airports &ndash; Cork, Dublin and Shannon. These are basic infrastructural utilities like our seaports and our road infrastructure. It is essential that the <Col N="761" /> Government retain control over what I believe is a key player in our national and regional economies. There is a huge difference between trading entities in a free market &ndash; such as air carriers and telecoms &ndash; and utilities such as airports.</P>
    <P>A fundamental issue of public policy cannot be forgotten in the debate about the best future strategic direction for Aer Rianta. Two central issues stand to be examined, the national air access transport for an island economy and regional policy. Any Government can decide to maintain or reduce airport landing charges and proceed with the marketing of new routes to develop our tourism economy and commerce. However, this will not be possible where private shareholders are concerned. Policy will be decided in the best interests of the balance sheet of the company. Earnings per share will be the priority, even after partial privatisation and not the interest of the national economy or public policy.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward that EU rules on investment prohibit the Government from investing in our airports is something that must be seriously questioned. I do not believe it is contrary to EU or any other rules to make such State investment. Airports, unlike aircraft, are not mobile assets; they are fixed assets like our roads and seaports and the Government has no difficulty in providing a capital programme to serve this basic infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Equally, the other argument that has long been put forward that the State cannot act as regulator of itself no longer stands since the appointment of a new regulator, Mr. Bill Prasifka, for aviation and airport matters. The State can now retain ownership of Aer Rianta's core assets since there is no longer an inherent conflict of interest. Therefore, that argument falls by the wayside.</P>
    <P>Suggestions that a 30% flotation of Aer Rianta is inevitable are totally unacceptable. In that case future equity needs would dictate that the State shareholding would be diluted. In effect, what would happen is that public policy considerations would be further reduced and the demands of the private shareholders would be more fully catered for in that scenario. Ultimately, this would lead to a full take-over of Aer Rianta. For the Government to proceed to privatise would be equivalent to a farmer selling his farm and holding on to his herd of cows. It makes neither common sense nor economic sense. I call on the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the Taoiseach and the Government to reject the proposals of the Warburg Dillon Read report and to retain Aer Rianta in full State ownership.</P>
    <P>There are other specific matters that arise in relation to Shannon Airport. Recently, an advertisement for two positions placed in the local newspapers suggested that CVs be sent to the personnel department in Dublin Airport. This is contrary to regional policy and is focusing more towards centralisation. It is also contrary to stated Government policy. I ask the Government to look at this issue with its State company and to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>On the question of the proposed part-privatisation, given that the flotation would be small, I <Col N="762" /> understand that it would only be to institutional investors.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, for the responsible position he adopted at the weekend when he made it clear that part-privatisastion or privatisation of Aer Rianta would not be advantageous to the development to our tourism economy. I think he has stated that both inside and outside Cabinet and I compliment him for so doing. The political parties &ndash; Fine Gael, Labour, the socialist parties &ndash; SIPTU and all the trade unions are opposed to privatisation. The IPO &ndash; initial private offer &ndash; has an automatic inference that this is only the initial offer and that there will be more offers to privatise. We must realise that once that happens there is no going back &ndash; it is irreversible. No safe mechanisms can be built in.</P>
    <P>Airports are a fundamental key to the national economy and, more importantly, to the regional economy. There is no good reason for privatisation, bar the Government not being prepared to invest £350 million into the airports as required. There is no EU regulation that prohibits the Government from doing so and an argument put forward on that basis does not stand. I suggest the Minister of State convey to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, the considered view of all people, who have the national economy and the regional development interest at heart, that privatisation or part-privatisation is not in our best interests at this time and to cast the issue aside and forget it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue on the Adjournment. Airports are vital elements of economic infrastructure. I am pleased to have this opportunity to re-emphasise the importance the Government places on the need for cost effective airports to serve the requirements of the aviation sector and the wider economy.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective in this respect is simple and straightforward. It is to deliver the level of air access which will best serve the needs of the Irish economy as we go forward into the first decade of the new millennium. This means ensuring that the State's airports can provide sufficient capacity, to an appropriate standard and at the lowest cost consistent with commercial performance, to meet the needs of the airlines and the travelling public into the future. There is no dogma and ideology driving this strategy. It simply requires a practical approach. The Government is taking just such an approach in addressing the requirements of the airport sector in a pragmatic manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three State airports have faced unprecedented passenger growth in the past decade. While growth at the pace of the last few years will not continue indefinitely, the indications are that there will always be growth in airport traffic as long as the economy is growing. This increase in traffic must be catered for by making substantial investments in new terminal buildings, approach <Col N="763" /> roads, taxi-ways, aprons, car parks and services. Runways need to be refurbished and new lighting, instrumentation and ancillary equipment installed.</P>
    <P>The cost of these investments is very substantial. Aer Rianta has spent over £300 million since 1996 at Dublin, Shannon and Cork. Aer Rianta would expect to spend a further £500 million over the period of the national development plan, from 2000 to 2006. These projects are intended to provide sufficient infrastructure to meet the future capacity needs of the airports for the next decade. They are not pious aspirations, they are concrete investments in a vital component of Ireland's transport infrastructure.</P>
    <P>For example, later this month the Minister for Public Enterprise will open the new passenger terminal at Shannon Airport that has been under construction over the past 18 months. The terminal and related work represents an investment of £40 million. I am sure Senator Taylor-Quinn welcomes this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That was initiated by Deputy Lowry, as Minister. The Minister is merely going to perform the official opening. The preliminary work was done by the former Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Shannon Airport is growing faster than either Cork or Dublin airports at present. The figures for January this year are up 27% on January 1999 with new direct routes coming on stream. Last year, Shannon had its best year ever. Traffic exceeded two million passengers for the first time. Passenger traffic grew by 19% overall, with growth in all markets, domestic, Europe, United Kingdom and transatlantic. Shannon's growth rate in 1999 was well ahead of that for Cork and almost double the rate of growth at Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So why privatise? The Minister of State is making the case for keeping the company in public ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The new terminal at Shannon Airport will allow for an annual throughput of four and a half million passengers. For an airport which is currently handling just over two million passengers that is a clear vote of confidence in its future. We are putting infrastructure in place today, to meet the needs of today and tomorrow.</P>
      <P>That is what this Government is about, meeting the infrastructural needs of our modern, growing economy in a practical and pragmatic way, whether by investment in rail safety, the Luas line in Dublin, the new roads programme or at the State airports. Using whatever is the most appropriate means, whether Exchequer funds and European funding under the national plan, by public private partnership, or by encouraging direct private investment, the Government will make sure that it lays the foundations for the continued prosperity of this country and for its future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> It is not enough to make sure that the necessary infrastructure is provided. It has to be provided in a cost effective manner, so that it adds clear value to the Irish economy. In order to play a positive role in attracting new air services, the State airports must be cost effective. In practical terms that means that their airport charges must be as low as possible&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not happen if they are privatised. The lads in Cork know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;consistent with safety considerations and prudent commercial judgments. The basic requirements of sound commercial operation must be adhered to so that the airport authorities, from their own resources, will be able to make due provision for future investment needs as well as meeting immediate requirements.</P>
      <P>For airports, the assurance of cost effective performance is being achieved by creating the position of aviation regulator. The regulator will have a clear mandate. His job will be to make sure that value for money is achieved in terms of all airport costs and charges. The Bill to provide for the necessary powers for the regulator and to establish his office is being drafted at present and the Minister for Public Enterprise hopes to publish it later this month.</P>
      <P>I trust the Senator and the House will agree that by these actions the Government have clearly demonstrated that not only does it recognise the importance of the State airports in the modern Irish economy, but that it is taking the necessary steps to make sure the airports contribute in the fullest possible way to the further development of that economy.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their attention and I apologise for the Minister who was detained by other business. I have no doubt about her commitment to Shannon Airport.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Adult Education Boards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Senator Mooney. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter and I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter to clarify the role of vocational education committees in the future of adult education and learning in the light of recent press statements relating to proposed drafts of the White Paper and in the context of the new national wage agreement. The VEC adult education boards have been established since 1984. The composition of these boards reflects the statutory and voluntary sector. The boards include two nominees from the VEC, one from Teagasc, one from FÁS and one from the local statutory library authority. A further seven come from voluntary organisations, trade unions, employers and other educational institutions. Each board's function is to establish adult education provisions for the administrative area of its VEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Unfortunately, while the Kenny commission of 1984 proposed that these boards be set up on a statutory basis, the Department of Education, in its circular letter, suggested that they be set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis as section 21 committees of the vocational education committees. In counties where the circular letter was adhered to and the boards set up as proposed, they have functioned quite satisfactorily and have met the needs of adult education in their counties with the resources that have been provided. County Mayo VEC and a number of other vocational education committees are of the view that adult education boards could form the basis of new learning councils and that there is no need to set up new structures at local level. There is a view that separate structures may be set up to organise and administer adult education and that the valuable work of vocational education committees could be undermined.</P>
    <P>Adult education has been an integral part of the vocational education committees' work for more than 60 years and we have gained a great deal of experience providing programmes and courses for all sections of the community, at times with very few resources. Another source of concern are the new education centres which have been established throughout the counties, supposedly as teacher training centres but now regarded as educational centres. What their long-term function will be is not clear.</P>
    <P>There have been many positive developments in adult education in recent years, particularly the setting up of the further education section in the Department and the appointment of a Minister of State. Funding for adult education has improved and support for the disadvantaged is now at a significant level. The missing link is the absence of a proper policy framework for adult education in order to allow it to be delivered in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The role of the vocational education committees is critical to the future development of adult education. There are two possibilities. One is that the vocational education committees continue to play a central role as locally elected bodies and that their adult education boards, with a proper statutory basis, continue to provide a service, as they have done for the past 20 years. The other is that the vocational education committees become one of the players in adult education, merely playing a subsidiary role in the new structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank Senator Chambers for allowing me to share his time and I applaud him for bringing this matter before the House. I am sure the House will agree the Minister of State has been one of the most proactive in this regard. I compliment him and wish to put on record the appreciation of those involved in education at local level, in an administrative sense, and at elective level, at the marvellous initiatives he has brought to the fore and is currently putting into the public domain for debate and, hopefully, for eventual legislation. My main purpose in requesting the opportunity to make this contri<Col N="766" /> bution is to support all that Senator Chambers has said. He, like myself, has been a member of the VEC for some time. As chairman of Mayo VEC he brings a special insight into this aspect of the debate.</P>
      <P>My main concern centres around the latter part of his contribution as to the future roles of the VEC. I wish to impress upon the Minister, who I know has an open mind on this and other matters in respect of adult education, that the structures are in place nationwide. The vocational education committees, as Senator Chambers has accurately pointed out, have a proud and distinct record in the provision of adult education within their administrative boundaries. In principle, I have a difficulty about any proposals emanating from Government and, indeed, from any administration that there should be yet another layer of administration placed on top of that which is already there. If it is inefficient, if its mandate is not being addressed, if there are shortfalls or if there are inherent flaws in the existing systems by all means they should be addressed but, on the basis of the proposals so far, the suggestion of setting up new countywide adult education boards is a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water and another layer of bureaucracy being put in place.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am talking from the perspective of a small administrative unit such as County Leitrim, but I am sure the same is true &ndash; and Senator Chambers has articulated that view &ndash; of vocational education committees throughout the country. I impress on the Minister the importance of giving a boost of confidence to the vocational education committees which, in many cases over past decades, have been struggling with meagre resources, yet have provided advances in adult literacy with the provision of adult education through evening classes. In clarifying his position in this regard, I hope the Minister will send out a message that the vocational education committees are not bit players in any future developing framework for advancement of adult education.</P>
      <P>Statistics published in newspapers in recent days indicate a low level of participation in adult education which is a problem. Of course, the Minister has a serious responsibility in that regard and he is perfectly placed with his expertise and commitment to ensure we are in the forefront of participation in adult education. It seems that the existing structures at local level need to be strengthened rather than diminished or, I hate to suggest, abolished. Like Senator Chambers, I speak on behalf of many of our colleagues in the VEC sector. The VEC sector should be strengthened and, at the end of the day, there will be a value for money administrative framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Chambers for giving me the opportunity to address this important matter and Senator Mooney for his kind remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education committees have played a critical role in the development of adult and second chance education to date and I intend <Col N="767" /> that this role will be continued and further strengthened in the future. More than 90% of PLC courses are provided in the VEC sector, along with the Youthreach and senior traveller training centre programmes for early school leavers, the vocational training opportunity scheme for unemployed adults and the adult literacy service. In addition, the vocational education committees support community education provision and cater for almost 90,000 part-time participants on self-funded adult education part-time programmes. Overall, 135,000 further education students annually are catered for within the VEC system. The sector has proved its success in catering for a spectrum of needs ranging from those with minimal or no qualifications to those who need advanced vocational training for specific niche occupations.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on Adult Education clearly shows that, relative to other European countries, provision of education and training for adults on a lifelong basis has been limited and has attracted low levels of State investment until recently. This is beginning to change and the national development plan provides for a very substantial increase in investment in this area in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Across Europe, countries are investing substantially in lifelong learning and see the promotion of ongoing access to education, training and professional development as being critical to competitiveness and social cohesion in a knowledge society. This process also manifests itself in the widening of provision to new learning sites outside the traditional education domain by a host of organisations and groups and European research indicates that an increasing &ldquo;pluralism of sites&rdquo; is likely to be a common feature of lifelong learning systems in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Green Paper proposed the provision of national and local structures &ndash; a national adult learning council and local adult learning boards &ndash; to ensure that such diversity could be accommodated within a co-ordinated and strategic framework for the development of the sector where the full range of interests could agree an over-arching policy and priorities and provide their services in the context of an integrated framework. This would provide for an area based approach to assessing priority needs at local level, support a cross fertilisation of expertise within a common quality framework and enable the range of providers to work effectively together to ensure a relevant response to area needs.</P>
    <P>The question of where local adult learning boards should be located was one of the areas on which views were sought during the extensive consultation process which followed the Green Paper and this question will be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Adult Education. I note what has been said about the recent leak of <Col N="768" /> some proposals in the White Paper but I wish to make it clear to the House that the leaked document was an initial draft, several months old. The final White Paper could take a very different shape. I hope the final White Paper will be published in the next three to four weeks.</P>
    <P>In advance of publication of the White Paper I do not consider it appropriate to make any definitive statement on this matter. A guaranteed framework for the participation of all providers, training and community and voluntary interests will form part of the new approach, and the local adult learning boards would have autonomy to operate within the overall constraints of their budgets and in the context of an agreed national policy framework. I do not see this as diminishing the role of any of the participating parties, including the vocational education committees, in the delivery of a range of services but rather as forging a co-ordinated and integrated approach. Existing VEC programmes will continue to be supported as heretofore but there will also be significant expansion of provision within the context of the new back to education initiative, allied with the development of supporting services. Vocational education committees and other providers will continue to operate in schools and centres, but will do so within the context of the framework agreed by the local adult learning boards based on nationally agreed criteria and quality standards. This, of course, will take investment, including capital investment, where the need arises for expanded infrastructure, the development of guidance and child care supports and increased emphasis on staff development and this issue will be progressed further in the context of the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Education centres, known in the past as teacher centres, have an expanded role as resource and in-career development centres for primary, secondary and further level education, including both schools and out of school centres. Centres are in a period of major development, having expanded from a focus which was mainly on the primary sector in the past. In addition, their role now covers the community and parent representatives on boards of management as well as the teaching profession. Given the stage of the network in its development, I envisage that it will be only one of a range of players active in staff development in the sphere of adult and further education. The other providers will include vocational education committees, the national co-ordinators of the various programmes, the National Adult Literacy Agency, third level colleges and the various provider associations who have undoubted expertise in this area. The national adult learning council will play a key role in ensuring a co-ordinated approach in this area.</P>
