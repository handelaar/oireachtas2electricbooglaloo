      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to fast-track procedures in the building section so that the extra classrooms required in St. John Bosco Senior Boys' School, Navan Road, Dublin 7, are provided.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive. No. 1, motion for the discharge of referral of trademarks regulations, 2000, to Joint Committee will be taken without debate. No. 2, motion approving trademarks regulations, 2000, will be taken without debate and No. 3, motion re the appointment of the Ombudsman to be taken without debate.

      <P>It is with reluctance that the Order of Business is agreed. To take four Bills on the last day and expect to finish them is questionable in the extreme. I would have thought there were better opportunities to discuss, as the Lower House is doing, issues relevant to the public with regard to the tribunals and other matters the Government has bungled. There could have been a great opportunity today, not for standing up and saying how wonderful the Government is, but for a genuine debate on issues of current interest. It is with reluctance that we are taking all Stages of four Bills on the last day of this session. It is not the way to do business in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Leader did not refer to Tibet, as he had mentioned it yesterday. Perhaps we could have an hour or 30 minutes during which to discuss this issue. Item 23, motions 18 and 19, could be passed by the House without disagreement. I can confirm that these motions have already been passed by the French Parliament, and the French Administration is close to the Chinese, so I do not think it should cause any great problem.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is supporting the redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre at a cost of between £30 million and £50 million. Will the Leader pass on to her the suggestion made by the former city architect, Mr. Daithí Hanley, that since he had the distinctive foyer of the old Abbey Theatre carefully dismantled and numbered, it could be incorporated into the new structure? The old foyer is in Mr. Hanley's possession and many Americans universities are seeking to obtain it. We should incorporate it into the new design as a theatre museum, including costumes and programmes.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could give the House some idea as to her plans for the Abbey, specifically signalling whether the old foyer can be included. If it is incorporated now at the design stage, we could have something really wonderful and exciting which would form a connection with the days of Yeats, Annie Horniman and Lady Gregory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Leader of the House did consult me about the Order of Business, I cannot support it. We are putting through nine items, and if we accept the proposal by Senator Norris to include a further item on Tibet, which I believe was promised yesterday, then ten items will be dealt with today, including all Stages of four Bills. Essentially, we are tidying up business <Col N="1831" /> from the Dáil. Those four Bills have not come before this House before, although they have been dealt with in the Dáil. The Dáil, however, has not tidied up our business. There are still ten or 12 Seanad Bills in the Dáil which have not been dealt with. It is inappropriate to spend the last day of the session tidying up some Dáil business.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with all Stages of four Bills, it means that we cannot examine and analyse them properly. We have said before that we do not want all Stages of any Bill taken in one day in the House, yet now we are expected to deal with four Bills in this way. I oppose the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Coogan that what we should be doing is having a debate along the lines of the Dáil motion, where they are dealing with issues in the public domain, issues in relation to matters&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are not going to deal with those issues on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Leader of the House for a similar debate to today's Dáil business, instead of dealing with the matters before us. My proposal is for a debate on the state of the nation, including achievement and lack of achievement, critical issues, scandals, hospital waiting lists and housing lists. We should deal with current issues rather than having a hotch-potch of issues that amount to tidying up what the Dáil has been doing, while the Dáil has not tidied up anything we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Costello's concern that we are rushing through much Dáil business. I have an even greater concern, however. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children, when he brings the Medical Practitioners Bill to the House, if he will be prepared to give some replies on what is happening as regards the third dispute in which the health service employers are involved? It is beyond belief. There was a strike involving nurses and almost a strike involving non-consultant hospital doctors. The health service employers are now in dispute with the home help service. What is the situation in relation to industrial relations in this area given the problems? The Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill must be introduced because of the problems involving non-consultant hospital doctors. What will happen during the summer to all the old people who depend on home help?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps these points are more appropriate to the debate on the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill does not relate to home helps. Will the Leader ask the Minister to prepare to answer questions on this matter? There may be a long strike by these committed <Col N="1832" /> people during the next three months. Many of these people work on bank holidays and Sundays when they do not even receive the usual miserable amount of £3. I ask the Leader to address this as a matter of urgency and to ask the Minister to be prepared to indicate what is happening in this area because it is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader pass on my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, on the excellent work he is continuing to do in fighting for the closure of Sellafield? This is with particular reference to the article in today's newspaper which states that 12 of the 15 signatories to the OSPAR Convention have called for an end to nuclear reprocessing in Europe. This is an excellent and progressive step.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the need to treat all applicants for grants, who have the medical condition of clinical depression, with sympathy and the greatest possible degree of leniency. These people may be entitled to grants but do not apply for them because of their illness. This is a personal matter for a constituent of mine and it greatly concerns me that not enough attention, care and commitment are given to people who are unwell and suffering from depression. They are deprived of grants for which they would have qualified if they had been well enough to apply for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the recent return of Elián Gonzalez to his parents in Cuba. Oireachtas committees have met the Cuban ambassador and representatives of Cuba and this is an important change in international diplomacy. It indicates maturity on the part of all those involved and it will lead to improved relations. It is a welcome development for the people of Cuba and I hope some of the hardships resulting from embargoes will lessen and that this will benefit the people. I hope it will also lead to an opening of relations and a strengthening of the compatibility between the people in the area.</P>

      <P>I call Senator Avril Doyle on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that is a reference to previous speakers or to my track record but I can ignore it for the moment while I work out what the Cathaoirleach meant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in anticipation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Chambers was obviously in order because the Cathaoirleach did not call him to book. The House should note that the Elián Gonzalez case is a triumph in terms of the rights of children preceding diplomatic niceties. This is as it should be. As adults involved in running the world, if we can put our differences aside to ensure that the rights of the child take precedence, it will augur well for society gener<Col N="1833" /> ally. I support the points made by Senator Chambers.</P>
      <P>I also support the point made by my colleague, Senator O'Dowd, and perhaps the matter should be properly debated. I ask the Leader to consider arranging such a discussion. In the agriculture sector, many farmers are missing application deadlines. Depression and mental health problems are rife among farmers. Many of them, through old age, cannot cope with the bureaucracy now needed for farming and they do not appreciate the importance of meeting a deadline on all application forms. Others, through depression, which is a serious problem in Ireland, particularly in rural areas, cannot cope either. I ask that medical evidence of genuine problems be accepted if they do not meet the deadlines for applications, rather than heaping penalties on them which are out of proportion to the offence. I add that to what Senator O'Dowd said about deadlines for environmental grants. The farming world feels there is a problem with too many deadlines.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's comments that the number of items on the agenda for the final day does not allow us to do justice, as the Seanad can, to important legislation. I have always been a great supporter of the role of the Seanad. I have been critical that we have not always used it to best effect or revised our role to ensure we stay as effective as we can. The practice has always been that we sit a couple of days after the other House finishes to tease out properly legislation which comes from it.</P>
      <P>It might be slightly ironic that I am asking for an extra few days when my attendance record is not too high. I decided to say that before the wits on the backbench said it. I recognise the irony but it does not mean I do not appreciate the role this House has always played and can play.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the shortage of staff in local authorities and I ask the Leader to bring that to the Minister's attention. This is important from the point of view of implementing major projects. Given that we are initiating local government reform, it is important to consider staff requirements in all local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is like the last day of summer term at school where we have been given no homework. Since it seems unlikely that calls for a debate on certain subjects will be accepted, I will not make such a call.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to note the disappointment of the House that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, who has responsibility for the Sellafield issue, did not attend the OSPAR meeting yesterday at which the Irish motion to suspend nuclear reprocessing in Britain was not on the agenda. I have raised this matter twice in recent days. There may be solid reasons why he was here rather than there, but it is disappointing that the motion on ceasing nuclear reprocessing at Sellafield was not on the agenda in Copenhagen yesterday.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the serious statement yesterday in the report of the Law Society of Ireland that the legal aid service for asylum seekers and refugees is totally inadequate. If the figures are correct, there are only seven solicitors in a group of 29 employees looking after 3,000 clients. Something must be done about this. I hope the summer will not go by without the Minister ensuring that action is taken on this important issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concerns of Senators O'Dowd and Quinn and I know that the Members of the House must be absolutely horrified that our neighbour, Britain, is continuing to behave abominably in allowing such vast quantities of nuclear waste be discharged so frequently into the Irish Sea. As I understand it, that is in clear breach of an international agreement and of its international obligations. I know we cannot have a debate on this matter today. I always appreciate the Cathaoirleach's many kindnesses and as this is the end of term, I thank him&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I usually do, and I am getting better at it, if I may say so. Seriously, I appreciate <Col N="1835" /> the efforts of the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, but I would like to hear the Leader's response on the need for us to be relentless in our efforts to ensure that this appalling practice is discontinued and that this awful plant is shut permanently.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns of my acting leader, and indeed the other speakers, regarding the four Bills being taken today. I thought we had an agreement some time ago in the House, which I thought would be honoured, that we would not rush through legislation in any one day. I do not know what can be done about that but we will wait to hear the Leader's response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address the issue of Sellafield and the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob. Since I have done a lot of research on the work of the Minister of State, I ask the Leader to send my commendations to him, not my criticisms or my doubts, on the phenomenal contribution he has made in taking on the British and all other nuclear powers, the laudable lead he has given in that regard and his all out efforts to terminate the nuclear industry from the world stage. I could quote examples of that <i>ad nauseam.</i> If he missed one meeting I am prepared to forgive him. There must have been a genuine reason.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to call on the Minister for Health and Children to set up, as a matter of urgency, in-service courses for hospital consultants in personal development and bedside manners. Not all, but a significant number, of hospital consultants seriously lack personal development skills and their bedside manners are akin to those of a pigsty keeper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Cathaoirleach will not tell me this is not a point of order because I believe it is. Senator Quinn referred to the school holidays but when we went on our school holidays we got a school report. I have grave difficulty praising our school principal, if we can call him that, the Leader of the House, because he made a promise to me on two specific occasions. I referred to him before as a faithless lover and I have not changed my mind because he made two solemn promises to me and he has reneged on both of them. First, he promised he would bring the Minister into the House, and Senator Henry will agree with me on this, to review the laws on pornography. Senator Henry has referred to the disgraceful situation with regard to the pre-1994 videos. As a nation we are a disgrace because of the lack of action in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> The other request I specifically made concerned the homelessness issue which is escalating. If one walks down Molesworth Street at night or even early in the morning, one can see that the numbers of homeless people are increasing. The Leader of the House promised me a debate on that issue as well and I am disappointed it has not happened. If I was giving a school report, I would have to write &ldquo;must do better&rdquo; or &ldquo;should do better and will have to do better&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is no point in making such promises if, like election promises, one is not able to deliver on them. I hope the Leader will not adopt a Pontius Pilate attitude during the next session. One cannot be popular as a Leader if one promises matters one knows in one's heart and soul one cannot deliver on. I am terribly disappointed, even disillusioned, about this. I hope there will be a very visible improvement in the attitude adopted by the Leader in the next session.</P>

      <P>Senators Coogan, Costello, Doyle and many other Senators expressed concern about the volume of business we have to conduct today. The conducting of such a volume of business in one day has not been the policy of this House, but the longest and fullest debate will be permitted on matters and all Members will be permitted to make whatever contribution they wish. We can stay here for the longest time. However, I cannot understand a Member who raised a particular matter on the Order of Business, but was not here yesterday when a state of the nation address was made by the Minister for Finance.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce the Gas (Amendment) Bill, 2000 to the House. While the Bill deals with four different matters, there is a particular urgency relating to one matter &ndash; the scheme to allocate scarce gas capacity to new power stations. I will explain this in detail shortly but I stress that there is a real need to have this legislation adopted before the recess in order that power station developers may proceed with their projects.</P>
      <P>The three other issues dealt with in the Bill are provision for the enlargement of the functions of Bord Gáis Éireann to allow it to engage in non-gas related activities; provision for an amendment to the existing Gas Acts to increase the borrowing powers of BGE from £350 million to £550 million; and provision for amendments to the Gas Acts (as amended) to introduce the same consent requirements for all people wishing to build natural gas pipelines. In this respect it will give private pipeline developers the same powers to access and compulsorily purchase rights over land as those currently enjoyed by BGE for the purpose of building pipelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I explain the detailed provisions of the Bill, I will give the House a brief account of developments in the natural gas industry in Ireland. Since its establishment in 1976, BGE has achieved significant progress in developing the natural gas industry. It built an interconnector with Scotland in 1993 to augment supplies from Kinsale. BGE now supplies natural gas to over 300,000 homes and has over 10,000 industrial and commercial customers. Natural gas now meets <Col N="1843" /> around a quarter of our total primary energy requirements.</P>
    <P>Natural gas has also come to play an increasingly important role in electricity generation in recent years. Last year over 30% of electricity generating capacity in the State was fuelled by natural gas. This reflects trends at European and global levels. Natural gas is now the fuel of choice for power generation and has significant efficiency and environmental advantages.</P>
    <P>The natural gas industry is undergoing a significant period of change, not only at national level but at European level. The EU gas directive, adopted in 1998, requires gas market opening to be introduced on a phased basis over a period of ten years up to 2008.</P>
    <P>Ireland already exceeds the market opening requirements of the EU Directive. Under the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, large gas consumers may buy their gas from suppliers other than BGE and have it transported through BGE's network on their behalf. This means that in volume terms more than 75% of Ireland's market is opened. A number of large companies are currently sourcing some of their gas from outside the State and importing it through the interconnector. I am currently reviewing the pricing arrangements for third party access to the gas network and I expect to have this finalised in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the issues being dealt with in this Bill, a scheme to allocate scarce capacity in the natural gas network, is a very pressing matter and I will outline to the House the background to this issue. Existing indigenous reserves of natural gas in Kinsale are declining and the interconnector with Scotland is nearing full capacity some ten years sooner than had been anticipated owing to faster than expected growth in demand. This growth in demand is a function of our economic success and the opening of the electricity market.</P>
    <P>Against this background, my Department and BGE undertook a major study &ndash; Gas 2025 &ndash; to examine future natural gas infrastructural requirements. This study made a number of recommendations regarding future gas supply options and considered that the optimal solution would be to construct a second natural gas interconnector, parallel to the existing interconnector with Scotland. This option was endorsed by independent economic consultants. They recommended, however, that we wait and see the outcome of the exploration of the Corrib gas field off the west coast before deciding on future gas supply infrastructure. The Corrib partners will make a decision later this year on the commercial development of the field.</P>
    <P>There are also other parties interested in building gas supply pipes, one from Belfast and one from Wales.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the capacity in the natural gas network will be sufficient to meet final demand until 2003. If one or other of the private developers is not committed to building the <Col N="1844" /> necessary infrastructure by the end of this year at the very latest, to cater for demand beyond 2003, I will approve the building of a second interconnector by BGE. This will allow sufficient time for new supply infrastructure to be in place to meet anticipated demand.</P>
    <P>I want to turn briefly to developments in the newly opened electricity market, which are impacting on the gas market. In anticipation of the opening of the electricity market to competition in February this year, a number of companies wishing to enter the market approached BGE last year to book capacity in the network to carry gas to fuel their proposed power plants. The applications for capacity, which were received by BGE, exceed to a significant extent the capacity that will be available in the network in the medium term.</P>
    <P>Forecasts for future electricity demand show that an increase in power production capacity of 600 megawatts will be necessary by winter 2004. In order to ensure that the electricity needs of the State can be met over the next few years, I decided that available capacity in the natural gas network would be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling up to 800 megawatts of new gas-fired power stations. While this will meet the electricity needs of the country, it is insufficient to satisfy the demands of all the prospective power producers who applied to BGE for network capacity. Consequently, I decided that a scheme for the advance selection of power producers, to whom network capacity would be allocated, was necessary, and that the allocation scheme should have particular regard to the need to ensure that new power plants were commissioned as soon as possible. Having regard to the provisions of the EU gas and electricity directives, the Attorney General advised that any allocation scheme devised should be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify why it is necessary for gas capacity to be allocated now, rather than when new capacity becomes available for purchasing. Certainty about gas capacity is necessary in order for large-scale power projects to commit investment. There is a 24 month lead-in time from the commitment of investment to the production of electricity. This means that a delay in the allocation of gas capacity until the end of the year, when there will be certainty about new supply infrastructure, could lead to electricity problems in about two years' time.</P>
    <P>My Department consulted widely with interested parties on the process to be employed in allocating capacity to prospective power producers. In light of the outcome of that consultation, I decided that the best interests of electricity consumers would be served by allocating capacity on a &ldquo;first-to-market&rdquo; basis. A further issue which I also considered was the question of who would be responsible for conducting the allocation scheme. BGE normally allocates capacity as part of its transportation business. However, as BGE has declared its intention of entering the electricity market, it obviously would not be <Col N="1845" /> desirable to have a situation where they would be responsible for allocating capacity to potential competitors. In order to prevent any possible suggestion of discrimination, I decided that responsibility for allocating capacity to prospective power producers should be given to an independent agency. Accordingly, I decided that the allocation scheme should be conducted by the Commission for Electricity Regulation.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision in legislation where the relevant terms used in the Bill are defined. Sections 2 to 16 of the Bill are the relevant sections relating to the capacity allocation scheme and the conduct of that scheme by the Commission for Electricity Regulation. Section 2 empowers the Minister, after consultation with the Commission for Electricity Regulation, to make regulations authorising the commission to allocate a specific amount of natural gas capacity in any one year to the power producers who will be selected by the commission under the scheme provided for in the Bill, and any regulations made under the Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 5 set out the details of the procedure to be provided for in regulations which will be employed by the commission to select power producers to whom capacity will be made available. Essentially, this procedure entails the power producers making an application for capacity in the network. The commission will then rank these applications in order of precedence, on the basis of the estimated commissioning dates for the proposed power plants. The commission may make alterations in the ranking of applications to preclude the selection of an applicant where, in the opinion of the commission, the selection of that applicant would adversely affect the promotion of competition in the electricity market, provided this alteration in ranking would not jeopardise continuity of electricity supply.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the commission shall determine and publish the criteria to which it proposes to have regard, in deciding the date on which it estimates a proposed power station will be commissioned. These criteria must be published by the commission at least one month before the selection is made.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the commission the power to require BGE or the ESB to provide certain information to it for the purpose of selecting power producers to whom capacity will be made available, or for the performance of any of its functions. It also obliges BGE and the ESB to comply with any request for information.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the commission to give directions to BGE regarding the use and management of the natural gas network, where it considers that it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the capacity rights of the power producers who are selected under this scheme are protected. The commission must consult with BGE before giving such directions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1846" /> Section 9 allows BGE, subject to the prior written consent of the commission, to enter into contracts with power stations, commissioned after the passing of this Bill into law, which have not acquired capacity rights under the Bill. In addition, the Minister may by order remove the requirement on BGE to obtain the prior consent of the commission in relation to contracts for capacity, if the Minister is satisfied that such contracts would not jeopardise power stations selected for capacity rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 imposes an obligation on BGE to make capacity in the natural gas network available to the power producers selected by the commission under the scheme provided for in this Bill when enacted, or under regulations. The section sets out in detail the procedures to be followed in the contractual negotiations between BGE and the selected power producers, and the time limits to apply to each part of the process. It also contains a dispute settlement mechanism and allows the commission to alter the time limits if it deems it proper and specifies the new time limit in writing.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that regulations to be made under the Bill when enacted may include provisions for bonds and levies. A requirement may be imposed on the power producers selected by the commission to effect a bond providing for the payment to the Minister of a specific amount which is calculated on the basis of the generating capacity of their proposed power plant, if the plant is not capable of sending out electricity to the transmission or distribution system on its estimated commissioning date.</P>
    <P>Regulations may also provide for the imposition of a levy on selected power producers to defray the costs incurred by the commission in carrying out the selection procedure, and to recoup funds expended by the Minister to facilitate the commission in preparing to carry out its functions under this Bill or under the regulations. Regulations may include incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 contain amendments to sections 11 and 12 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. This will provide for the appointment by the commission of authorised officers to assist it in carrying out the selection process provided for in this Bill, and for the obtaining of search warrants where it considers it necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 14 amends section 13 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, and provides for a prohibition on unauthorised disclosure of information obtained by the commission in the performance of its functions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 contains an amendment of section 32 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. The effect of section 15 is that any decision made by the commission under this Bill when enacted, or regulations made under this Bill, can only be challenged by way of judicial review proceedings. It precludes any person from questioning the validity of such decisions, save by way of judicial <Col N="1847" /> review initiated within two months of the date on which the decision to be reviewed is given. Provision is made for the courts, in specified circumstances, to vary this time limit.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the indemnification of the commission by the Minister out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas in relation to the performance of its functions under this Bill, or regulations made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the other elements of the Bill. Sections 17 and 18 relate specifically to BGE. Section 17 allows BGE, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to engage in any business activity that it considers advantageous, whether energy-related or otherwise. This amplifies the existing functions of BGE which are limited to the energy sector. Section 18 provides for the amendment of section 23 of the Gas Act, 1976, to increase the borrowing powers of the board from £350 million to £550 million.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 amend sections of the Gas Act, 1976, to create a level playing field between BGE and private operators. The amendments introduce a consent requirement for all operators wishing to construct natural gas pipelines. Under existing legislation, only BGE is subject to a formal consent requirement. The amendments also give private operators the same rights of access to, and acquisition of, land currently enjoyed by BGE for the purpose of constructing pipelines. Naturally, the extension of these rights is subject to the payment of compensation and operation of a comprehensive set of procedures in relation to the exercise of compulsory purchase powers. The sections also contain a number of technical amendments consequential on the introduction of a level playing field. The combined effect of sections 19 and 20 is to place private operators and BGE on the same footing.</P>
    <P>Section 21 contains two technical amendments to the 1976 Act consequential on the provisions in sections 19 and 20. Section 22 contains an amendment to the Registration of Titles Act, 1964, to place private operators on the same footing as BGE in relation to the 1964 Act. Section 23 provides for an amendment to section 8 of the 1976 Act which will enable me to attach similar conditions in relation to pricing to a consent for a pipeline constructed by persons other than BGE to those attached to pipelines constructed by BGE.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill contain provisions that are standard in legislation. Section 24 provides for the laying of regulations or orders under this Bill, when enacted, before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 25 provides that the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas to such an extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance. Section 26 contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title of the Bill and provision for <Col N="1848" /> collective citation, etc., of the Acts amended by it.</P>
    <P>This concludes my introduction of the provisions of the Bill and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>I also wish to express my sincere thanks for comments made earlier in the House. Senators O'Dowd, Coghlan, Liam Fitzgerald and others made complimentary remarks about the outcome of the recent discussions on the OSPAR Convention on the marine environment and the substantial achievement that emanated from those discussions. I appreciate the support that has been forthcoming from and the consensus that has emerged over the past year among colleagues in this House, such as Senator O'Dowd, and the other House. I have no difficulty acknowledging that and it has been the main plank in the hugely elevated campaign that is now ongoing against Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn had some concerns and I wish to explain the position to him. He asked why I was not present and he suggested that there may have been a good reason for my absence. There was a good reason and I favoured a ministerial segment in this important session of the OSPAR commission. I spoke with the Danish Minister when he visited me in Dublin to that effect. I also travelled to meet and speak to all the Ministers in the Nordic countries in an effort to gain support for our motion. However, it was decided to stick to the rules and protocol attached to the OSPAR commission and to leave the matter at official level. We maintained a hot line to our officials throughout the four days of negotiations. Massive preparatory work was done. I travelled to meet all the Minister in the OSPAR signatory states to try personally to bring them along.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said it was a pity that our draft decision did not reach the floor. However, it reached the floor and it was there up to the final moments. Ireland took a strong line in the negotiations and the potent and tough Irish motion and the Danish motion were catalytic in creating a revised motion that was signed by eight countries, including Germany, which was significant. Another four countries were eventually brought along. A total of 12 countries, a qualified majority, demanded, in effect, the cessation of reprocessing of nuclear material in Sellafield and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is a huge move forward and an escalation of the campaign against Sellafield. Today's newspapers positively reflect that situation. I again offer my sincere thanks to Senator O'Dowd and others with whom I am happy to work hand in hand over the coming period. I thank the Chair for its co-operation and indulgence in allowing me to make these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister of State's comments, when we were in Government and in the short time we have been in Opposition &ndash; which will change soon &ndash; this side has always <Col N="1849" /> considered Sellafield and nuclear processing a national issue. It should not be a divisive issue; we must work together on it. It is important that organisations such as Greenpeace also support the Government's actions.</P>
      <P>From my contacts in the nuclear industry in Ireland and America, I am aware of the significance of the pressure mounted by Ireland on the British authorities, particularly the British Government and British Nuclear Fuels, and the securing of the support of the combination of other northern European countries, as the Minister of State and his Department achieved. The countries have acted and focused on the issue together.</P>
      <P>The recent clear statement, in which the signatories to the convention say that they want an end to reprocessing, is most significant. It would not have happened five or even three years ago. However, it is happening now. Companies such as British Nuclear Fuels are considering ways out of the situation and I hope they will cease their activities. This type of pressure and countries combining and working together ensures significant progress.</P>
      <P>The Bill is most important, although it is technical legislation. I was looking through old school books some years ago and I came across a book about the geography of Ireland. I am sure Senator Fitzgerald also read it when he was in school. The book, which was probably published 20 or 30 years ago, mentioned the resources in Ireland and it effectively said that Ireland had no natural resources. It said there were bogs and peat but little else in terms of industry.</P>
      <P>In the past 30 or 40 years the economy has moved from being the slow coach of Europe to the cutting edge of change, improvement and technology. One of the changes, which is due to the major improvements in society, is the increased demand for energy. In that context, the Kinsale gas find in the 1970s was a major boost to the economy. There have been reports of potential oil finds off the west coast, with consequent speculation in shares. The fact we have further added to the significance of our gas reserves recently is important.</P>
      <P>Our energy demands are increasing rapidly and it is important to have competition for consumers. Domestic households and businesses must have the option of buying energy from whatever source they wish. Approximately 10,000 companies get their energy from gas supplies and more than 300,000 domestic households benefit from natural gas. Gas is used for more than 23% of our total primary energy requirements. It is the fuel of choice.</P>
      <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald and I recently attended a conference on alternative and renewable energy sources. Gas is a finite resource and it is the way forward. It makes sense to move to natural gas and away from other fossil fuels. It is environmentally friendly and the reduction in carbondioxide in our environment will lead to beneficial changes in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> I welcome the report of the Department of Public Enterprise on renewable energy. I do not know if we debated it in the House but we must look at it again. There is a move throughout Europe to encourage and support the use of renewable energy. It is a significant area which we must develop. The Government must adopt a positive and progressive policy towards communities and companies who wish to do research on producing energy by alternative means. We should look at introducing major tax incentives to encourage people to use alternative sources of energy. I am impressed with the reports on wave energy. We could use our underwater sources to supply us with energy. This is the way forward in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. I read what Deputies Sargent and Yates said on this Bill in the other House. Most of Deputy Sargent's contribution was as Gaeilge and I did not have sufficient time to translate it all. I was interested in his comments on and support for certain sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the issues Deputy Yates raised, and perhaps the Minister of State might address it, was that we are using the &ldquo;first to market&rdquo; principle in the allocation of capacity to prospective power producers. He made the point that the UK had an auction system for allocating mobile telephone licences. Why can we not use that system? If people submit a tender and come fourth or fifth, they may take a case to court to find out why they were not selected. That could cause delays and negativity. There should be an auction so that the biggest bidder is given the privilege of supplying energy. Competition is good and there are major players in this field. I hope the growth in our economy will mean more people will be interested in providing our energy needs.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said he wants this Bill passed before the end of the session. I understand we are taking all Stages today and I do not have a difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to build a gas plant in Platten in County Meath, which is adjacent to where I live in Drogheda. I have no problem with this project in principle. However, water from the River Boyne will be used in the plant and then put back in the river at a temperature of one or two degrees higher. I am concerned about the impact that will have on the environment and on plant and animal life. Someone told me the animals in the water are cold blooded, somewhat like politicians. People are concerned about the effect on the environment. If water is taken out of the River Boyne for the power station and put back in again at a higher temperature, it will have a significant impact. I do not know what proposals are envisaged in the rest of the country. There are signs near Athlumney in County Meath opposing the power plant. This is an important environmental issue for the people concerned and it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill will increase competition for consumers. It will help to supply them with an acceptable form of energy which is environmen<Col N="1851" /> tally friendly. It is a good Bill which we support. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Bille an-thábhachtach é seo a bhaineann le pleanáil don tionscail gáis. De bharr an dul chun cinn seo beidh pobail na hÉireann in ann usáid a bhaint as na háiseanna iontacha seo. Tá struchtúr an-éifeachtach curtha i bhfeidhm ag an Aire Stáit, ag an Rialtas agus ag an Oireachtas ar son mhuintir na hÉireann. Beidh deis acu a bheith go maith as ins na blianta atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>This Bill is being introduced to ensure that people and businesses receive natural gas and electricity at the best prices. It underpins the introduction of competition and fair play in a transparent and open way to ensure we have a choice in terms of our energy utilisation, which the Minister of State emphasised. The Bill is a classic example of the Minister of State and the public service ensuring that business operates in this industry to the benefit of the only constituency which matters, the people.</P>
      <P>Many people use natural gas to heat their homes, while businesses use it to fuel their energy requirements. However, that was not always the case. Approximately one third of electricity is now generated using natural gas. That was not always the case either. Natural gas is becoming such a fundamental part of Irish life that we are in danger of taking it for granted.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to reflect on the background of a wonderful natural resource and the reason it has become popular. Bord Gáis Éireann has been responsible for developing the natural gas industry in Ireland. It is a monopoly supplier of this resource. Until now, the industry had to be organised in this way because it was a relatively young industry and we needed to ensure the natural gas infrastructure was built and used in an orderly way to deliver this resource as efficiently as possible throughout the country. I would not say that is the perfect way to do things but who among us, apart from myself, can claim to be perfect?</P>
      <P>Prior to discovering natural gas in the early 1970s in the Kinsale Head field off the south coast, there were a number of gas companies throughout Ireland. Natural gas was not recognised at the time as an important energy supply. The establishment of Bord Gáis Éireann in 1976 changed that. Natural gas is now supplied to more than 300,000 homes and more than 100,000 industrial and commercial consumers. Approximately one million people are using natural gas to heat their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most fundamental and significant features of the Bill is that it has, as one of its primary purposes, the regulation of the allocation of scarce capacity in the natural gas infrastructure. My reading of the Bill, and this was confirmed by the Minister in his elaboration of the different sections, suggests that the Minister is telling the industry we need a new interconnector as a matter of urgency. If a company is chosen to <Col N="1852" /> build that plant, it will be given two years or so to do it and at the commencement it will be given a commitment that it will have access to the infrastructure. What the Minister is saying, and I hope I understood him correctly, is that if private industry is not prepared to take this on, he will then be in a position to offer the challenge to BGE, and rightly so. I fully support him in that. What is being created is a level playing pitch to ensure, both domestically and industrially, that scarce capacity in the natural gas infrastructure is managed with the highest efficiency.</P>
    <P>I laud the Minister &ndash; and I waited for the publication of the Bill with much interest on this point &ndash; for the manner in which he has decided to empower in this legislation the Commission for Electricity Regulation to be responsible for conducting the allocation scheme. He said he considered greatly the question of who would be responsible for conducting the allocation scheme. We all know that BGE normally allocates capacity as part of its transportation business. However, as BGE has declared its intention of entering the electricity market, the Minister rightly considered that it would not be desirable to have a situation where BGE would be responsible for allocating capacity to potential customers. A serious problem of discrimination could potentially arise and the Minister wisely decided that the responsibility for allocating capacity to prospective power producers should be taken out of BGE's hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point strongly, and I support him fully on this because he and I have debated it here previously, that there was no implication of impropriety of any kind to be drawn from what he said about the manner in which BGE has managed to discharge its affairs up to now. It has done so with the highest professionalism and integrity. He correctly identified, however, the potential for a conflict of interest arising and the obvious need for transparency in the process. I agree with him that these were sufficient grounds for the allocation process to be conducted on an independent basis, and I laud that decision.</P>
    <P>There is a commission in place which is working very well. It has gained a lot of experience and there is no doubt that experience will be invaluable in the process of allocating capacity in the gas network because the two industries will now move much closer together. In a sense they will be more interconnected, if the House will excuse the pun. The Minister of State's decision is all the more laudable when one considers that a party in a previous Government had to take on personal advisers, at taxpayers' expense. This Minister already has enough experience and effective structures are in place. He has full trust in them. They are working well and there is no need, in this particular case, for any further bureaucracies or personal consultants.</P>
    <P>A number of State bodies are set up to ensure that infrastructure is utilised in the best interest of the consumer, for example, the Commission <Col N="1853" /> for Electricity Regulation, the Commission for Telecommunications Regulation, etc. These bodies, and this is State intervention, are in a market to create a level playing field, and indeed by EU directive as well. The Commission for Electricity Regulation, for example, is being charged in this Bill with responsibility to allocate capacity in the gas network and ensure that similar objectives are met in delivering natural gas to consumers.</P>
    <P>It is a small leap in understanding and logic from the principle of establishing committees for monitoring and ensuring that infrastructure is developed and utilised for the maximum benefit of the people. That is why we are all here. I have in mind the establishment of a commission for the acquisition of development land, agricultural land, pre-development or pre-serviced land or serviced land to ensure that this vital infrastructure for normal living and everyday life is maximised and utilised to the maximum benefit of Irish consumers, along the lines of the models the Minister has brought before us and which are working well.</P>
    <P>This is by no means a huge leap into the dark. In fact, we have taken such leaps already with the commissions I have mentioned. I have referred to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Etain Doyle, and the electricity commission and the way the Minister is proposing to interface with them. We are learning fast from our recent developments and we are learning to confront what previously we considered were impossible dreams, some called them sacred cows. We have to confront those sacred cows, whether it is in the gas or electricity markets or energy supply generally. We have done so effectively and the Minister is doing it very effectively here today. We should do it also in the housing market. In case anybody misinterprets me, I am not taking a sideswipe at the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I admire greatly and laud the measures he has taken from the Bacon report so let nobody come back at me and say that is my motive. I have great admiration and tremendous support&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a personal view I began to generate when Deputy Quinn, as a former Minister for Finance, was asked by Richard Crowley on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; about the PriceWaterhouse report and how to solve the housing problem, and his reply was the &ldquo;orderly release of thousands of <Col N="1854" /> acres of land onto the market&rdquo;.

      <P>I referred this matter recently to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for his consideration. I am merely throwing my tuppence ha'penny worth into the political forum for a national debate on it. It may come to nothing. I may be proved to be indulging in an exercise of folly but so be it. I am well able to take that criticism.</P>
      <P>If such a commission for land servicing or for the purchase of already serviced land was in place, the competition I referred to would automatically follow and the builders and auctioneers who are gazumping young couples on the market day in day out would face a house market environment where roles would be reversed, for the first time in years, because the competition would no longer be among the exploited buyers, the young couples, but among the builders themselves.</P>
      <P>When the financial services centre was being considered, it was identified that a lot of red tape had to be removed before such a highly imaginative scheme could be properly established. This necessitated the changing of company law, contract law, taxation law and planning law to ensure that it could be set up in the docklands area as quickly as possible, and potential and actual logjams to the effective operation of the financial services centre were removed as quickly as possible. The State was intervening in the international financial services market and did so effectively, with some hiccups that may still exist, but the system by and large is working well. That is a model from which we can draw the good points and discard the bad ones.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach at the time set up a small group of individuals to discuss the difficulties as they arose and who would have access at the highest level of Government and the Civil Service to introduce legislation at very short notice to ensure that difficulties were removed as efficiently and swiftly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1855" /> To learn from this example, we could now establish a commission or grouping of similarly powerful individuals, a team of various disciplines, with access to Government at the highest level to ensure that serviced land or unserviced land was identified and developed as quickly as possible. It takes time to introduce plans like this but with the right will and the right structure this could be fast-tracked and one of the best ways to do that is a small group of people, a multi-disciplinary team of the highest calibre and integrity, charged with responsibility to plan and acquire the land in accordance with Government policy.</P>
    <P>I use that as an example to illustrate the significance of what the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is doing here today, which is hugely significant. He is taking the existing model, which is working well &ndash; in plain language it is State intervention into the market &ndash; and he is now saying we have to move on further.</P>
    <P>We have urgent infrastructural requirements to meet a rapidly growing demand and the Minister of State said he will use this model because, having studied it, he is satisfied it is the right model. This model is independent, transparent and works well. It has the capacity to facilitate quick intervention and we need fast action. I believe the Minister of State will get that.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill. Further generations will laud the Minister of State because he will have passed on to them, through this legislation and the Electricity Regulation Act, legal structures that will ensure fair play in the price and availability and security of supply will obtain for the people who most matter to all of us here, the ordinary people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank him for what he said at the end of his contribution. He will be pleased to note that what I said on the Order of Business was aimed to elicit that information. What I said may have sounded like a criticism, but I added that there may have been a satisfactory explanation as to why he was not in Copenhagen yesterday. The Minister of State has admirably explained why he was not there. The other explanation he gave resulted from a vote of 12 to two, which is clearly a win. Any veiled criticism I appeared to make was to elicit the information I sought. I congratulate the Minister of State on that vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also congratulate him on the solo run he has made on the issue of Sellafield recently. I was highly critical about the operation of Sellafield over the years. I believed various Governments were almost shy of upsetting the British in case it upset the relationship in regard to Northern Ireland. I stand by that view I held in the past. However, that position has changed. I used the term &ldquo;solo run&rdquo;, and with the match being played in Thurles on Sunday, I am sure that if the Minister of State came from Cork or Kerry, he would <Col N="1856" /> be make a solo run similar to that which he has made recently.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate him on introducing this Bill and on the explanation he gave for its introduction, as I had a number of queries about aspects of it that had not been explained. I am conscious of limited time allocated to this matter. Normally, I would be critical of taking all Stages of a Bill in one day but, as Senator Dardis said, there is an explanation for that, and I accept it.</P>
    <P>I remember my father pointing out to me in the 1950s that the enemies of the people in the coal business were their competitors in the oil business. The people in the coal business stayed in that business and fought against the oil business, but they were fighting a losing battle. Those who won were those who said, &ldquo;We are in the fuel business.&rdquo;  They got into both businesses and they said, &ldquo;Whatever way the market goes, we are in that business.&rdquo;  My father likened that to those who were in the horse and carriage business at the turn of the century who said they were in the horse and carriage business and they would fight against those in the motor car business, as against those who said there were in the transport business and would stay in that business.</P>
    <P>That reflects what the Minister of State has done in this Bill. He has said, in effect, that this matter is the fuel business &ndash; it is not concerned only with gas, electricity or nuclear energy. Therefore, the decision to encourage and to enthuse Bord Gáis to diversify into the provision of electricity or other fuels must be commended.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the far-sightedness of this Bill. A book entitled <i>2020</i> was published by the IMI in 1995 with the object of predicting what Ireland would be like in 2020. A question that arose at that time was whether we would be able to handle the challenges that faced us. In the past five years we have not even realised how quickly we have moved forward. I was impressed by what the Minister of State said about our ability to foresee the capacity requirements that are needed. My criticism about the wait and see approach adopted to the Corrib oil field was answered well by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>With regard to the alternatives to nuclear energy, it may be that we will use nuclear energy in the future, therefore, we should not condemn it. However, we condemn reprocessing of nuclear fuels and the manner in which that takes place.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a point Senator Liam Fitzgerald made about the State's involvement in this area and the extent to which it should be involved. The Minister of State answered that point reasonably well. The State should be involved if there is no one else to do the job, but the objective should be to encourage others to do the job.</P>
    <P>I remember Eleanor Butler's geography book, which Senator Liam Fitzgerald is probably too young to remember, from which we learned that Ireland had no natural resources other than agriculture.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am older than the Members present who remember it. In those days we assumed we did not have natural resources. I will have to give credit to the former Minister for Finance, Charles Haughey, who does not get too many compliments nowadays, because in the 1960s he contributed to our discovering we had natural resources by giving tax incentives to encourage people to establish whether or not we had. Through giving such tax incentives our natural resources, such as lead and zinc, were discovered. Similar tax incentives are being used to discover further natural resources, whether the gas field off Kinsale or the oil field off the west coast. That is critical for our future, which is threatened by inflation and is threatened in the long term if we do not manage to maintain the low cost of fuels.</P>
      <P>Those of my relatives who are in the tomato business found it almost impossible to compete with their competitors in Holland because the Dutch always had a low fuel cost and they were able to grow products such as tomatoes indoors when we did not have a low fuel cost.</P>
      <P>I note from a Northern Ireland television programme broadcast this morning that traders in Northern Ireland have allocated 1 August as an anti-petrol day to protest against the cost of petrol in the North. Traders there who are close to the Border find it difficult to compete with traders in the South where the price of fuel is lower. We will not be able to compete in the long term unless we have low cost fuel. The steps the Minister of State is taking gives us an opportunity to do something about that. Therefore, the Bill deserves our support.</P>
      <P>With regard to deregulation and encouraging non-Government agencies to enter this market, we must be proactive. This Bill gives the Minister of State the ability to actively encourage the participation of such agencies in this market. I am not sure that commitment will exist in the future unless it is pursued very actively. I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State's enthusiasm for it. It is well worthy of support.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I compliment him on the work he has been doing for our people to secure the closure of Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is timely. I have had meetings with representatives of Bord Gáis. I do not know why many areas of the country were excluded when the plan was drawn up for the gas pipeline. Every citizen is entitled to access to the same type of fuels and to pay the same price for such fuels. I do not understand why people in cities can obtain <Col N="1858" /> fuel at a cheaper price than those living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Our strong buoyant economy presents an opportunity to extend the supply of gas throughout the country. I speak in particular about my side of the country. The gas pipeline extends to Limerick and, from meetings I had with representatives of Bord Gáis, I understand it is intended to extend the pipeline to the Aughinish Alumina plant and to the Moneypoint power station, along the Shannon directly across from County Kerry. There is an oil powered station in my own village of Tarbert which may possibly be converted to gas. If so, I cannot understand why the gas line cannot be extended to Tarbert and into Kerry.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a smelter was to be provided on a landbank of over 600 acres situated in north Kerry in the ownership of the State for the past 25 years but it did not materialise. Other industries were also mentioned for that area but did not materialise. The land which is lying idle is situated on the deepest and most natural waterway in Europe and has been crying out for development for a long time. If gas were extended to that region it would be an additional attraction for foreign investors.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the development of the west. Various Bills dealing with the west have provided for development in Mayo and Galway. Were it not for Deputy Carey's efforts Clare would not have been included. From a geographic point of view I do not know where Kerry fits in but it is deeply imbedded in the west, or the south-west. In every programme that has been introduced, Kerry has been forgotten so far as any type of development is concerned. Kerry is crying out for development. North Kerry has had no new industry for the past 25 years. There is a Kerry group which could use gas and Listowel is badly in need of it. Tralee, which has a huge population, and Killarney would also benefit from it.</P>
    <P>If the Tarbert power station is to be converted from oil to gas this is an ideal opportunity to extend gas into Kerry. If the funds were not available and the economy was not doing well there would be an excuse but that is not the case. The people of Kerry should be treated in exactly the same way as those in Dublin and should get their fuel at the same price. Gas is a clean fuel and is the way forward for the future. I am pleased at the gas find off the Corrib and I hope it can be put to use for all the people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Minister. When the Minister of State was appointed to this portfolio I did appreciate his portfolio but I compliment him on its importance to the economy. I commend him on the manner in which he has handled all aspects of his responsibility in relation to dealing with Sellafield. I join with previous speakers in complimenting him on the way he has handled his minis<Col N="1859" /> terial brief, brought matters forward and fought from a small premise and raised international awareness on some of the environmental issues affecting the country.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It recognises the achievements of and supports Bord Gáis Éireann. It takes on board the EU directives and national directives in relation to competition. It opens up the industry to the private sector. Its puts a legal framework on energy business and gas, in particular. The future development of Bord Gáis Éireann is welcome in that it intends to bring an extra 250,000 houses into the national gas framework. Its expansion programme will be a great investment and will benefit the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>I watched the debate in the Dáil last night which was worthwhile, and heard the compliments paid to the Minister by Deputies Stagg and Yates, and to some of the proposals and amendments put forward to the Minister. The Minister should maintain a strong responsibility in the overall development of the gas framework while at the same time allowing the private sector and Bord Gáis Éireann to get on with the development programme. However, he should have a strong input into the general outline of development in the State.</P>
      <P>Coming from the Objective One area I welcome the proposed development to inter-connect into the Galway area and the western region. It is important to ensure a balance and that those areas have the benefit of reasonably costed fuel which is environmentally friendly.</P>
      <P>On a previous occasion I raised the issue of Bord na Móna and the ESB power station at Bellacorick. There are serious concerns in regard to its proposed closure in 2005. While the Corrib field has not yet been declared commercial and Bord Gáis Éireann has not entered into any negotiations, it is important that the western region receives some benefit. I understand it is a private development and that Enterprise Oil is a private company. Nevertheless, it is important that if a pipeline is established and it is commercial that the Objective One region should have the opportunity to avail of reasonably costed fuel. In view of the proposed closure of Bord na Móna and the ESB power station it is important the Minister have a serious look at this given that over 200 people are employed there and when part-time workers and others are included the number increases to 350. The Government has a responsibility to outline its future plans. There should be some plans for the future of that area and a structure set down as to how it will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. It is well structured from the point of view that it seeks to protect competition within the industry, it opens up new opportunities and it allows the private sector to participate in the development of the gas framework. The Bill is to be commended to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on Sellafield and his success in the European context. While we have decided to go the road of non-nuclear power in terms of generating power capacity, this Bill is silent on any link-up with Northern Ireland. Much of its power capacity comes from nuclear power whether from Scotland or further south. In terms of the Electricity Supply Board and any injection into our own power capacity here, has the Department considered any such link-up and the implications of a link-up with power that has been generated through a nuclear capacity? Perhaps the Minister will respond.</P>
      <P>The background to this legislation is the economic boom the country has been experiencing over the past years. There is a huge increase in house construction and more houses are needed. The economy is far ahead of what was believed would be the required capacity in terms of the generation of electricity, power for industry and so forth. The percentage of our power needs supplied by traditional forms of power generation has been reducing as well. The Arigna coalmines closed down in 1990 or 1991 bringing an end to our indigenous coal supply. Hydro-electric activity has also decreased enormously in percentage terms.</P>
      <P>The mainstay of our supply at present is the coal generating plant at Moneypoint, the oil generation plant at Portadoyle and the increasing use of natural gas. The latter is now reaching capacity in terms of the expiration of the supply at Kinsale and the use of the interconnector from Scotland. Progress is being made in generating power from wind farms. Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on the proportion of capacity wind power might supply in the future. What work is being done on generating power from waves or from solar energy? Has the Department carried out any work in this area and is it relevant to this legislation? Will it contribute to the capacity we are likely to have or feed into the national grid?</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on the forward thinking in the legislation. I have a number of questions however. The national development plan for the period 2000-06 covers many areas, including power generation. Power generation should be looked at as an integrated process. One cannot look at the generation of power for industry without looking at the power needs for the construction of homes and the fact that the same type of power generation will be used in both sectors. Look at what happened to the Kinsale gas. There was an interconnector to Dublin with a spur to Limerick but the entire western region was ignored. The pipeline was directed there and there was no service to that hinterland. How can one seek Objective One status for that region when there is no integrated power supply to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any sources of power that come on stream, particularly beneficial ones such as natural gas, should be automatically connected to the areas of the country most in need of development. Fuel is needed to boost industry and to develop the <Col N="1861" /> country. Clearly, we must think in terms of an extra supply, network and capacity that would benefit the areas of the country which have been neglected to date.</P>
    <P>There was no information in the Minister of State's contribution about the Corrib gas field, its capacity and how it will be distributed on the mainland when it is taken on shore. Where will it be taken on shore? Will it be Ballina or Sligo or will it be directed to Galway? What are the plans for a network of pipes to cover the north western and western areas? There is a crucial decision to be made about the future of this country, particularly the west. The legislation is silent on this. The Minister of State might say this is not the appropriate Bill for this matter but I believe it is &ndash; we are planning for the future and if it is not dealt with in this legislation, when will it be dealt with?</P>
    <P>The most critical issue to be addressed is the integrated nature of the network that will provide fuel capacity not only for central heating for homes but also for industry and other development. This is also relevant to Northern Ireland. What is capacity in Northern Ireland? Does it have a surplus of capacity which would enable an interconnector to be built into the Republic? Such an interconnector would cover Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Border areas. With the Good Friday Agreement reasonably stable, there will be more emphasis on interconnection in terms of cultural, economic and industrial projects and schemes. There is a capacity there which should be explored and which could be beneficial to areas which are currently underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the private sector. I have no problem with private operators coming into the market but I am concerned about the private sector having the same power as the State in relation to the compulsory purchase of land. Sections 19 and 20 give private operators the same rights of access to an acquisition of land currently enjoyed by Bord Gáis Éireann for the purpose of constructing pipelines. The extension of these rights is subject to the payment of compensation and the operation of a comprehensive set of procedures in relation to the exercise of compulsory purchase order powers.</P>
    <P>Compulsory purchase powers are not given generously. This argument has arisen in relation to the construction of houses. It has proven to be difficult to compulsorily purchase land to build more homes. We have not been able to do that even though the State is trying to do it in the interest of providing people with shelter. In this Bill, however, that power is being given out willy-nilly. It is not being given to just one private operator but to a plethora of operators. Obviously, there will be a temptation to compulsorily purchase land which might not be required immediately and to create landbanks to provide for further capacity in the future. Once the land is acquired, what will happen? How will we ensure that the land is used for the purpose for which it was compulsorily acquired? The only require<Col N="1862" /> ment is that compensation be given and the compensation will certainly not be equivalent to the value of land that is zoned for residential or industrial development.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, generating capacity has been provided by the State, whether through the ESB or Bord Gáis Éireann. Power stations are to be built now by private operators. The Exchequer's coffers are overflowing but all the Minister for Finance can think of doing is locking the funds away. This year £3 billion was put aside for pensions which are not yet a problem. It will be at least 2020 before we begin to experience problems in that regard. There is loads of money available which could be usefully utilised. We do not need to borrow.</P>
    <P>Rather than tying that money up in non-productive ways, should we not think in terms of providing a network of power stations throughout the country? This is the obvious area for State investment. I have no problem with private investment. However, where the State does not require it and where traditionally the State has done the job, why should it not continue to do that job when it has the funds? Let us seek private investment where there is a shortage of funds. I am concerned about the extent to which we are introducing private interests into this sector, particularly in relation to compulsory purchase orders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the far-sighted approach of the Minister, which is extremely important if our economic success is to continue. I welcome the fact that Bord Gáis Éireann is given extra powers to engage in non-gas related activities. I welcome also its increase in borrowing power from £350 million to £550 million, although I would increase it to £1 billion which would be appropriate at this time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the extensive powers being granted for the first time to private contractors. I would like to have had an opportunity to tease out the possible implications of these powers and how their implementation might impinge on other matters. That is why it is a pity we are dealing with all Stages of the Bill today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House. He is one of the few Ministers to be complimented and congratulated here. I am not aware that he has ever been the subject of major criticism or investigation of any type.</P>
      <P>This is a very well thought out Bill to prepare for the future in anticipating energy demand and making proper provision for its supply. It is prudent that the legislation is currently being put through the Oireachtas so that work can commence and the Minister can proceed to make the necessary preparations to meet energy demands. We are at full potential as far as the supply of electricity is concerned. Supply and demand are literally neck and neck and we are now facing a rather critical situation. Therefore, it is important to provide additional supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> I am particularly pleased that the Bill proposes extending gas supply throughout the country. I welcome the Minister of State's proposal to build an interconnector within the next few years if private operators do not do so. This is a wise and prudent decision on which I congratulate him.</P>
    <P>I understand the proposed new pipeline will come down to County Limerick, go out to Aughinish and cross into County Clare at Ballynacally. I suggest there is a gap between Limerick and Ennis; the Shannon area is not included in the maps currently being produced by Bord Gáis. It is absolutely vital that an industrial zone such as Shannon, including the town and airport, should have an opportunity to avail of this gas supply. I ask the Minister of State to raise the matter with Bord Gáis to ensure a connecting line is built from Coonagh on the border of Clare and Limerick right out to Shannon airport and possibly into Sixmilebridge, an area with a large population. One section of the pipeline will come to Ennis but another section will cross from Aughinish underneath the River Shannon to Ballynacally, County Clare. This is just a few miles east of the village of Kildysart. The Shannon Estuary has huge potential for development and this is an ideal opportunity for the Minister and Bord Gáis to direct a pipeline west along the northern side of the Shannon Estuary back to Kilrush and even further on. That area has some of the deepest waters on the estuary or indeed in Europe, particularly outside Cahercon and outside Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the generation of electricity. There is currently a coal burning electricity generating station at Moneypoint. There was mention some years ago of installing a fourth generator but that has not happened. Given that a generating plant is in place in Moneypoint &ndash; granted the infrastructure is a coal burning facility &ndash; this is an ideal opportunity for the ESB to introduce a gas interconnector to generate electricity. It would be very unwise if the Department did not consider that option and proceed along that route.</P>
    <P>By making the connection from Ballynacally west to Moneypoint and on into Kilrush, one would be putting in place the infrastructure to enable substantial industry to be set up in that part of County Clare. Given that the Minister of State got his foundation in the town of Kilrush and is here in such a solid capacity, we must lay claim to the fact that some of the sound common sense emanates from that town. He will appreciate fully what I am talking about and will respond positively to what is a very sound and common sense proposal.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister of State gave an explanation in his Second Stage speech as to why he considers it necessary for the gas capacity to be allocated now rather than when the new capacity becomes available for purchase. It was a wise decision to put that on the record.</P>
    <P>On the Corrib find, I am concerned about what we as a nation own because I believe the gas finds <Col N="1864" /> in our territorial waters belong to the Irish people. I would like to think the people and the Government get a proper monetary return for gas, oil or any other finds. Given that we are traditionally a country with an agricultural background, we have not much expertise in the field of energy exploration other than the expertise within the Minister of State's Department. I hope proper monetary arrangements are in place and that the people receive a proper return from these finds.</P>
    <P>I am interested in what the Minister of State had to say about making a decision later this year on the commercial development of the Corrib field. Perhaps he will elaborate further on the capacity of that field. I welcome the fact that he will approve the building of a second interconnector by BGE before 2003 if private developers do not do so. This is a wise and prudent decision on his part.</P>
    <P>The supply of natural gas to 10,000 industrial and commercial customers and over 300,000 homes is interesting. I am sure there is huge potential for supplying additional homes. I concur with previous speakers, including Senator Chambers who comes from County Mayo, that people throughout the country should have an equal opportunity to obtain energy at prices similar to those in the Dublin area. People in the west should not be discriminated against because of the isolation of the area.</P>
    <P>Supply and demand for electricity are neck and neck at present. The Minister of State said forecasts for future electricity demand show that an increase in power production capacity of 600 megawatts will be necessary by the winter of 2004. That is not too far off and it is vital that the necessary infrastructure is put in place and that the generation of electricity to that capacity will take place. He went on to say he has decided that available capacity in the natural gas network should be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling up to 800 megawatts of new gas-fired power stations. This is extremely welcome. He also said he has decided on a scheme for the advance selection of power producers. I would like him to elaborate in more detail on how he intends to go ahead with that advanced selection of power producers. It is vital that the infrastructure is put in place to prevent us from falling between two stools. People have suggested that this will go ahead but there are no guarantees. We need those assurances. I would like the Minister to explain this matter further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the gas pipeline, I am a little concerned about the extension of the compulsory purchase power to private developers. I appreciate that this scheme must comply with EU directives on equality and equal opportunities but I am still concerned. We know the difficulties county councils must face if they want to acquire properties. We also know the problems connected with compulsory purchase orders and State agencies. I would, however, hate to think that ordinary <Col N="1865" /> people, farmers, landholders, householders or whatever would be put in a position where they would not have much choice but the great big powers could ruthlessly charge through them and buy land using compulsory purchase orders. I would not like to think that the big man could do that and that the interests of the ordinary private citizen would not be adequately protected.</P>
    <P>I know that other operators do not require consent and that the Minister can impose the same requirements on them as he did on BGE. It is imperative that he does that because some operators can be cowboys and ruthless. I would like to think that the ordinary person who would not have the money, the financial backing or the ability to fight these people would be protected by him, the Government and the State. This is very important. I hope he will re-examine this situation and impose the same conditions he imposed on BGE on other operators.   </P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for their contributions. I also thank them for their kind remarks about the nuclear campaign. Together &ndash; I am not interested in solo runs on this issue &ndash; Deputies and Senators will continue to escalate this campaign and we will be successful.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour to give a brief but comprehensive response to the points raised by Senators O'Dowd, Liam Fitzgerald, Quinn, Dan Kiely, Chambers, Costello and Taylor-Quinn. In bringing forward the Bill I am seeking to address four issues, two of which require immediate attention. The first most pressing issue is to provide for a scheme to allocate scarce capacities in the national gas network to ensure that additional power generating capacity will be made available in the State to meet expected increases in demand for electricity.</P>
      <P>The scarcity of capacity in the national gas network is a short-term problem. My Department has consulted extensively with interested parties on the question of an appropriate mechanism for allocating capacity in the gas network. The scheme provided for in the Bill is a transparent mechanism to select power producers and only capacity available in the network will be allocated. It will select those producers who will be capable of bringing additional electricity generating capacity onstream at the soonest possible date.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that there is no threat of disruption to existing gas customers. There is sufficient capacity in the system to meet forecast gas demand until 2003. Neither is it the case that BGE will be constrained in connecting and supplying new customers. Sufficient capacity to fuel approximately 800 megawatts of electricity generating capacity is available in the gas network. I have decided that this will be reserved specifically for the purpose of fuelling new power plants to meet the expected increase in demand for electricity in the next couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> There is a set of converging circumstances which has resulted in there being limited capacity available in a natural gas network in the short term. Demand for natural gas and electricity has been increasing at a greater rate than expected. This is directly related to the unprecedented levels of economic growth that we have experienced in recent years and which hopefully will continue in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The gas interconnector with Scotland is nearing full capacity ten years sooner than had been anticipated due to the greater than expected growth in demand. In addition, the demand for natural gas has been boosted further by the opening of the electricity market.</P>
    <P>The second pressing issue the Bill addresses relates to the construction of natural gas pipelines and is concerned with the question of right to access and acquire land for the purpose of constructing these pipelines. Anomalies exist in our current legislation in relation to the construction of pipelines. BGE must obtain my consent to construct a natural gas pipeline while private developers must give previous and reasonable notice to me of their intention to build a pipeline. In both cases I can require that the pipeline be built in accordance with certain criteria relating to environmental, safety and efficiency considerations. BGE has powers to access and acquire land for the purpose of building a pipeline. Private developers do not have these rights.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening address, a number of parties are interested in building pipelines both within and to the State. The EU Gas Directive has been in force since 1978 and it requires that all natural gas undertakings be treated on similar terms. Therefore, I could not approve any proposal from BGE or a private developer to construct a pipeline where BGE and private developers do not enjoy the same rights by virtues of the reasons Senator Taylor-Quinn mentioned. She referred to the competition constraints imposed on us by the directive and European law.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to remove existing anomalies. The provisions of the Bill would make all pipeline developers, both BGE and private developers, subject to the same consent conditions. They also extend the rights currently enjoyed by BGE relating to access and acquisition of land to private developers. These rights are extended to private developers subject to the same obligations to pay compensation that apply to BGE.</P>
    <P>Senators raised specific items. Senator O'Dowd suggested that we should auction the scarce capacity that exists. My Department did seriously consider an auction as one of the possible methods for allocating our scarce capacity. We held a widespread public consultation on possible options. As I said earlier, I formed the view that the first to market principle was the best choice in these particular circumstances. I can see the benefits of an auction arrangement but I had to be sure that the mechanism chosen would ensure the early completion of new power stations so that there would be no danger to the continuity <Col N="1867" /> and security of electricity supply. That is the kernel of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd proposed the establishment of a new power plant in Drogheda. He also talked about pumping hot water into the river Boyne. All new power plants must obtain a series of authorisations and licences before they can operate, for example, from the Commission for Electricity Regulation, the planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency. There are very stringent processes in place and they are designed to ensure that the construction and operation of power plants is carried out to the very highest standards.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Dowd, Liam Fitzgerald and others talked about renewable sustainable energy and the need to debate it in this House. This subject is close to the hearts of the Senators who raised it and it is very close to my heart. I will be only too delighted, if Senators deem it appropriate, to come here and debate this very important area. Senator Fitzgerald also called for a debate on renewables.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn exhorted BGE to expand its role. We are facilitating that in this legislation. He referred to the practice in the past of using tax incentives to encourage the search for and location of our natural resources which has been wonderfully successful. In my era at school, we were told that we were essentially an agricultural country and we had no natural resources. The way this has evolved is marvellous. We have natural resources, we are making the very best use of them and will continue to do.</P>
    <P>Senators Kiely, Chambers and Taylor-Quinn all aspired to have the gas grid extended particularly into their own constituencies, which I endorse. We would like to see our natural resources spread as much as possible countrywide and made available to all of the people. Gas is a hugely important resource. It is a catalyst which has the ability to bring industry to an area, for instance. BGE's function is to do what the Senators aspire to. The main criterion thus far has been commercial and financial viability. That will still play a major role in the expansion and extension of the gas grid.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers referred to Bellacorick station. I deputised for my senior colleague when the Senator raised this in the past on the Adjournment in relation to electricity provision. The ESB has no proposal currently relating to a gas-fired station in Bellacorick or its environs. The peat-fired power station at Bellacorick comprises two 20 megawatt units which were commissioned in 1962 and 1963. For some time, this plant has been scheduled for closure in 2004, at which stage the station will have been well over 40 years in operation. That was agreed in a tripartite agreement between the Department of Public Enterprise and the ESB management and unions, signed on 17 February last.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers has raised several times the matter of a task force for his area in the context <Col N="1868" /> of the matter being discussed today. While such an initiative would be more appropriate to bodies such as the county councils or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I will bear his exhortations and his message to the appropriate Minister or Ministers.</P>
    <P>In her efforts to bring this resource to her own shores, Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn mentioned Kilrush, the town of my birth. I would gladly see it move there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Senator's comments on gas infrastructure in the Shannon region and Kilrush. I reiterate that responsibility for deciding which areas are served by gas is and will be a matter for BGE, which is required to operate on the basis of commercial criteria. I fully understand the Deputy's concerns and aspirations. She can be assured, as can Senators Chambers and Kiely, that I will bring to the attention of BGE the aspirations they articulated today, and the very strong resolve they have shown on the matter, to see what can be done in that regard within the constraints.</P>
      <P>Senator Joe Costello raised the matter of windfarms. I published the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy last September, which has been very useful for getting this matter off the ground and I was very pleased it was so well received. One of its recommendations was to establish an expert group to examine renewables. I was fortunate to get excellent expertise and knowledge in a group examining that matter currently under the chairmanship of a very eminent and knowledgeable person, Professor John Fitzgerald. The matter has not been long-fingered. I expect that report from them within the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>As the Senator knows, in the Green Paper we set the targets for electricity production via renewables at 500 megawatts. Some would say that is a very ambitious target. I say it is an achievable one. The first technology that this group will examine at my request is wind technology. I have asked them to look at the constraints and how we might overcome them. I expect that report will be available in mid-July. We will take the matter from there.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also referred to where Corrib gas would be landed ashore and how it will link into the network. Other Senators have been very interested in that also. The business of bringing gas ashore from Corrib is entirely a matter for the developers. As I mentioned earlier, BGE and the Corrib partners are in detailed negotiations as to the building or the creation of a spur from source as it comes ashore to join the line which will be in place from Dublin to Galway and down to Limerick. That is a matter for the players involved, but both the decisions and the construction of this important infrastructure need to be expedited. We will do everything possible to have that implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1869" /> Senator Costello and Senator Taylor-Quinn raised the question of giving compulsory purchase rights to private operators. CPO rights are not given automatically to private operators. An applicant will avail of these powers only after I have given my consent to the construction of the pipeline, in other words, after there has been full public consultation on the application and environmental impact statements. I will license only bona fide applicants. There is a measure of protection in that process against the potential hazards raised by Senator Costello and Senator Quinn.</P>
    <P>Senator Madeleine Taylor-Quinn specifically asked for assurances that these power stations would go ahead. I assure her that the Bill contains significant penalties in the form of a bond for which developers will be liable if they do not proceed with the stations. This fund will be an appropriate incentive to ensure that they are built and if not the forfeiture of the bond to the State will provide the funding to undertake contingency measures to ensure security of supply. I fully agree with Senators who have raised this issue. I hope I have at least touched on matters which have been raised.</P>

    <Title>Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited (Payments to Former Employees) Bill, 2000: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the making of <i>ex gratia</i> payments of £20,000 to the former employees of the Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited or their personal representatives. Former employees or their representatives will apply for the <i>ex gratia</i> payment. Applications will be reviewed by an interdepartmental committee and each eligible applicant will be paid £20,000.</P>
      <P>The Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was established in 1930 and was promoted by a private company, Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited, in pursuance of a standing agreement with a sweepstakes committee appointed by the governing bodies of various hospitals. The Hospitals' Trust Fund was used to channel the net proceeds of the sweepstakes to hospitals for capital purposes. Statutory responsibility for the Hospitals' Trust Fund was with the Minister for Health and that for the running of the sweepstakes by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited with the Minister for Justice. Overall responsibility for pensions in the private sector, however, rests with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sales of sweepstakes reached a peak of £18 million in 1961 but then declined until for the three years 1980-82 total sales were only £23.1 million. The expenses as a percentage of the proceeds came to exceed the statutory maximum of 40%. The bulk of the income had come from outside the State, and this had declined severely as legal gambling opportunities arose elsewhere. The hospital sweepstakes made various proposals for new weekly draws but the approval of successive Ministers for Justice was not forthcoming, mainly because it was considered the draws would interfere with and cause unfair compe<Col N="1871" /> tition with existing lotteries supporting worthy causes.</P>
    <P>The entire workforce, then some 150 persons, were given notice of redundancy in January 1987 and received statutory redundancy payments. The Labour Court in 1987 recommended payment of redundancy of two weeks' pay per year of service in addition to the statutory payments already made. This was rejected by the company on the grounds of inability to pay. Although there was a company pension scheme, most of the persons concerned accepted a once-off lump sum of a few thousand pounds in lieu of the small pensions that were available. They are now dependent on the State old age pension.</P>
    <P>In December 1990 the Public Hospitals (Amendment) Act enabled the Minister for Health to take over approximately £481,000 in unclaimed sweepstakes prize money, together with accrued interest, for distribution to former employees of the company. The money was distributed in 1990 and 1991 to the former employees generally regarded as the most seriously disadvantaged when the company ceased operating.</P>
    <P>The staff made redundant in 1987 were the only employees of the company who did not receive any compensation over and above statutory redundancy entitlements, apart from a tiny pension or a small lump sum. All other groups of employees of the company who were made redundant prior to 1987 received compensation in the form of enhanced redundancy lump sums and enhanced pensions. Accordingly, this Bill is directed towards the staff who were made redundant in 1987. It provides that they receive a once-off and final payment from the Exchequer of £20,000 each. Some 147 former employees who were made redundant benefited from the Department of Health scheme in 1990-1. It is expected that the number of beneficiaries of this scheme will be similar and the cost to the Exchequer will be somewhat less than £3 million.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that these <i>ex gratia </i>payments do not involve setting a precedent for former employees in other organisations, either public or private. There are several unique features which distinguish the former employees from others. While the employees were employed by a private company, statutory responsibility for running the sweepstakes by Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited rested with the Minister for Justice. The existence of this company was dependent on the Hospitals' Trust Fund, which was used to disburse the net proceeds of the sweepstakes to hospitals. Statutory responsibility for this fund rested with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Those employees who remained with the company until it closed received only their statutory redundancy entitlements, supplemented by a tiny occupational pension or the alternative of a small lump sum. Most of them opted to accept the lump sum which means they are dependent on their old age pension. While more than 30 of these former <Col N="1872" /> employees have since died, the majority are single women living in very poor circumstances. I am confident that no other group of former employees of other organisations could claim that their circumstances are similar to those of the sweepstakes employees who were made redundant in 1987.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish a mechanism which will enable <i>ex gratia</i> payments to be made to former employees of Hospitals' Trust (1940) Limited. Section 1 is an interpretation section and defines the terms in the Bill. The term &ldquo;former employee&rdquo; is defined as a person who was employed by the company for a period of which not less than 104 weeks was a period of continuous employment within the meaning of Schedule III of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and continued to be employed until 1987. The term &ldquo;personal representative&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that payment may be made to the former employee or, in the case of a deceased employee, to a personal representative. This section also identifies the level of payment at £20,000. Section 3 provides for the appointment of a committee to advise and assist the Minister in implementing the provisions of the Act. The membership of the committee will comprise two officers from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and one officer each from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children. The remainder of the section deals with the position of chairman of the committee, the quorum for meetings, filling of vacancies, regulation of business and the dissolution of the committee.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that applications must be made within two months of the passing of the Act, although this may be extended by the Minister. Such information as the Minister may require to process the application must be provided. Where applications are refused the applicant must be so notified in writing and the reasons for the refusal must be given. Applicants must be informed that they can appeal the decision within 21 days. Appeals against such refusals may be made within 21 days. The Minister must consider such appeals and notify the applicant of the final decision and the reasons for this decision.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prohibits the giving of false information in relation to an application for payment. It provides for a maximum fine of £1,000, but recognises that certain defences are available. Section 6 provides that applications for payment must be referred to the committee. The committee will ascertain whether the applicant is a former employee. If the former employee is not the applicant, the committee must verify the status of the applicant in relation to the former employee. This section provides that the committee report to the Minister on its investigations and activities. The section also provides that the committee can require applicants to answer questions and provide information and documents relevant to the <Col N="1873" /> application. Section 7 provides that, in the case of a deceased former employee, payment will be made to the personal representative.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that administrative expenses incurred by the Minister will be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 9 is a formal section which provides the Short Title.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the final chapter in the ongoing saga concerning the treatment of a small group of Sweepstakes workers who were made redundant in 1987. The perception is widespread that these workers were badly dealt with both by their former employer and the State. The Bill vindicates the campaign of these former employees for a generous gesture by Government. It is hoped that these former employees will take some satisfaction from this <i>ex gratia</i> payment. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish to expedite the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is welcome legislation. It is a pity it did not come at Christmas because it is a real bonus for the people who so richly deserve it. I lived less than half a mile from the headquarters of the Hospital Sweepstakes. It was founded in 1930 and did wonderful work throughout the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, when it financed the capital programme for many of our hospitals. In 1948 Dr. Noel Browne made good use of the money it raised to build a number of hospitals.</P>
      <P>Most of the workforce were women. The management was very sympathetic in its employment of widows, especially those with large families. It was before its time in that it employed people with physical disabilities. It offered good employment to people no one else would employ at the time.</P>
      <P>The trust was very profitable between the 1940s and 1960s. It reached its peak in 1961 when tickets were in great demand. The sweepstakes were run on the results of three races &ndash; the Grand National, the Derby and the Cambridgeshire. The trust would increase its staff on a temporary basis 13 weeks prior to the races.</P>
      <P>In the late 1970s the Hospital Sweepstakes came into competition with other fund raising activities and the prizes were no longer as attractive. The national lottery was established in the late 1980s and although the Hospital Sweepstakes applied to manage the lottery, it failed and that was the death knell for the sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1987 the 150 remaining workers received redundancy notices and were only offered £2 a week pension or a lump sum of £4,000. Most of them understandably took the lump sum. The pension fund established by the management of the Sweepstakes was totally inadequate. Subsequently, the Labour Court made the decision that the employees should get two weeks pay for each year of service. As the State was a beneficiary from the Hospital Sweepstakes, many people felt there was an obligation on the Exchequer to pay the figure decided on by the Labour Court. <Col N="1874" /> Unfortunately the Government of the time did not feel able to do that.</P>
    <P>Some the employees had given over 40 years' service and they felt hard done by. This legislation is welcome because it will give assistance to the last employees of the Hospital Sweepstakes. I pay tribute to the dignified way in which they approached this matter. They appealed to us in an appropriate manner and there was no lobbying outside the gates of Leinster House with banners. I am delighted that in the last budget the Government made provision for £20,000 for each of the employees of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstakes. The legislation is most welcome and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is overdue. Successive Governments have been remiss in not ensuring that the absence of such legislation was not resolved before now. It is particularly unfortunate considering that most of the former employees were women who worked there for a number of years and are now elderly. Most of them have been in difficult circumstances in the intervening 12 or 13 years. The responsibility in this case rested with the employer and the State, both of whom have been remiss.</P>
      <P>The employer was remiss because the Hospitals' Trust sweepstakes garnered huge revenues in earlier years. The provision of two weeks' pay per annum served, plus the statutory redundancy, as was proposed by the Labour Court, did not impose an enormous burden on the employer, considering the extent of profits that were made over the years. I do not believe for a moment that all those profits have been frittered away or that the employers went bankrupt. We all know who the employers were. They certainly did very well out of the hospital sweepstakes and became wealthy.</P>
      <P>The State also did well out of the sweepstakes. The Departments of Justice and Health would have had a particular responsibility in this matter as the State relied largely on the sweepstakes to fund hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that the Government and Opposition could not have joined forces before now to ensure that a reasonable amount of compensation was paid to make up for the negligence of these employers. As Senator Joe Doyle said, the Hospitals' Trust employees always acted in a dignified fashion. They were courteous people who worked loyally for what they saw as a good cause, in the interests of the State. They made possible a level of service that could not otherwise have been provided in the medical sector. Since the employees played a significant role and made a significant contribution to the welfare of the State, it now behoves us to commend their efforts by making this <i>ex gratia</i> payment. It would be nice if this payment could be made in the run up to Christmas, as it would be an appropriate Christmas present.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on introducing this legislation which is long overdue. I cannot understand why previous Governments, whatever their political persuasions, did not do it. In its time, the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes was a marvellous institution. The funding was used for hospitals and the sweepstakes kept national morale high in difficult times from the 1930s to the 1960s.</P>
      <P>We know about the success of sponsored programmes on RTÉ, but the biggest and best of these was the Irish Hospital Sweepstakes programme, presented by the great Bart Bastable. He used to conclude the show every night with a one-liner that went, &ldquo;Makes no difference where you are, you can wish upon a star&rdquo;. At a time when money was scarce, housing deplorable, employment non-existent and emigration rampant, the Hospital Sweepstakes draw, which took place three times a year, gave people a little hope. In those days the sweepstakes jackpot was £50,000, which today would not pay half the cost of a bungalow in rural Ireland, or put a deposit on a house in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask a few questions about the provisions of the Bill, however. Does the legislation only concern former employees who retired after 1987? I understand that 30 former employees have passed on to their eternal reward. Does that mean that their next of kin can claim the £20,000? If that is the case, what is the position for those who retired and received very <Col N="1876" /> little before 1987? One dear friend of my family received very little in 1985 and retired in poor circumstances, despite the fact that she was an eminent person in the Hospital Sweepstakes company. She was one of the leading people who met with dignitaries on special occasions. I would like to think that, while she has passed on to her eternal reward, her next of kin might be eligible for the payment.</P>
    <P>I understand that not everyone can be facilitated, but a reasonable sum of £3 million has been made available by the Government to address this problem. Previous speakers referred to the dignified way in which former Hospitals' Trust employees had sought action by the Government. I also want to congratulate them. One does not have to demonstrate at the gates of Leinster House in order to obtain one's goals. The Bill shows that nowadays Governments do listen.</P>

      <P>We have always had a good positive relationship politically. I am not at all surprised that this legislation has been brought to the House by him. While I am sure he is fed up with me rehearsing it, I remember that he took some quite difficult decisions on the Child Care Act in order to include an important section which has already benefited children. I am not surprised that this humane measure has come before the House under the aegis of the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I have a sentimental attachment to the sweepstakes because I was brought up in Dublin 4, that place so hated by the media conspiracy. I was born, however, in central Africa. My mother used to describe the place where I was born as a long, low, white building &ndash; the Clinique Reine Elisabeth, in what was then Leopoldville &ndash; with nurses in starched uniforms. For a time, I thought I had an extraordinary memory and that I could remember the few weeks after I was born because I had a very clear picture in my mind of this place which I thought was the Clinique Reine Elisabeth. Then one day, while sitting on the number 18 bus which had stopped outside the sweepstakes' office, I happened to look over and there was the long building of my memories, with a nurse but she was cardboard cut-out, pulling a ticket from a drum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the ladies from the Sweepstakes very well. They were respectable women and many of them had financial difficulties or strain. Many of them were widows, but they had considerable respectability and decency. They had the opportunity to make a few bob but it was hard work for other people in the Sweep. However, in the period after the war, everybody was glad to get into it. One sister of James Joyce, <Col N="1877" /> and possibly two of his sisters, were employed there.</P>
    <P>What puzzles me is how it operated because it was a curious public-private partnership in advance of the notion of such partnerships. The McGrath family appeared to do extremely well out of it but, in that period, there were several other unexplained aspects, the most notorious of which was <i>The Irish Press.</i> All the money contributed by people in America, who did not have many resources, for the creation of a national newspaper, principally for the Fianna Fáil Party, wound up under the personal control of the de Valera family, the current generation of which has not shown any great managerial capacity.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Leader that it would be good to have an alternative source. It is a pity and the <i>Irish Press</i> is greatly missed in terms of balance. I would be happy to see it again but I think that is a vain hope.</P>
      <P>Such problems have arisen before and I remember the terrible situation in which former employees of Irish Shipping were placed as a result of bad management policies. I remember them protesting outside the gates of Leinster House. I would not like it construed from the Leader's comments that people who protested outside the gates were lacking in dignity. I am sure that is not what he meant. On occasions those people were outside the gates and marched around with placards, but they maintained their dignity. They did the State great service but they received very little reward for it.</P>
      <P>Everybody enjoyed the Sweepstakes. There was almost a sense of guilt about it because it was a grey area. Gambling in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s was looked on as slightly risqué. Ireland was unusual in having this type of lottery. Tickets were got to America and England almost through subterfuge because lotteries and gaming were illegal in those two jurisdictions. However, a series of thrills were involved. If one's ticket was pulled and one got a horse &ndash; I am not sure how the £50,000 came into it &ndash; one could sell it to people like Terry Rogers. They would take a part interest in the horse so one was guaranteed something.</P>

I take on board the points made by the Leader about people prior to <Col N="1878" /> 1985. There always tends to be a cut off point but it would be wonderful if everybody who was employed by the Sweepstakes could be looked after.</P>
      <P>There may have to be a cut off point if the person concerned is dead. One cannot have seventeenth cousins materialising from Australia, claiming £20,000 on behalf of a person whom they never saw in their lives. However, cases such as that mentioned by the Leader should be considered. If somebody was prominent in the organisation, did good work for it and was excluded simply by an accident of time, their case should be considered. This is a good day for the Seanad because the Bill is decent and generous. It is no less than the people involved deserve. However, as was the case with regard to Irish Shipping, people do not always get what they deserve.</P>

      <P>Indeed, spiritually and temporally. I thank all the Senators for their positive and supportive comments. We all want to achieve a quick mechanism to address the shabby treatment of the former employees who, unfortunately, were made redundant when the Sweepstakes closed down in 1987. The Bill provides such a mechanism. Senators have fine memories of the Sweepstakes. We remember the great sensations, opportunities and wonder it provided. As the Leader said, £50,000 was a huge amount of money at that time.</P>
      <P>People who left before the Sweepstakes closed got a better deal than those who stayed until the end and this is the reason for the Bill. The people who left early got additional redundancy sums and better pensions. Those who were loyal to the end and who, on age grounds, were entitled to stay on found, when the company ultimately went into liquidation, that they were faced with the stark reality that they no longer had employment or pensions; or, if they had a pension, it was very small. They received very little money at the time and it had to keep them going until they qualified for the old age pension. Hence, we have a moral and legal responsibility to ensure that they are looked after and politically this is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted, we will ensure that all eligible former employees are encouraged to apply for the <i>ex gratia</i> payments. The committee will be established quickly to review the applications and we intend that there will be no delay in making the payments. My Department, which has responsibility for redundancy payments, has a list of the people who qualified for redundancy payments in the past. The Department of Health and Children has a list of the people to whom it paid special contributions in 1991. The lists have been checked already and they are accurate apart <Col N="1879" /> from five or six names. There will be no problem communicating with the people concerned and it is our intention to distribute the money as rapidly as possible after the Bill is signed by the President.

      <P>Under the tax laws enacted by the Oireachtas, all payments are subject to tax. However, in this case, due to the age of the people involved, they will qualify for the various allowances. This will mean that anybody with long service would not be subject to any taxation. Indeed, he or she would have approximately £5,000 to spare above the threshold of allowances. This will ensure that they will not be subject to tax. The only people who will be affected will be those who had five years service or less. In most cases, they will only be taxed at the lower rate. We are confident that only a small amount of tax will be deducted from these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with the tenure arrange ments for local authority managers. Section 1, the only substantive section in the Bill, provides for an amendment to the Local Government Act, 1991, in order to modify the current arrangements. At present, the maximum term of a local authority county or city manager is seven years. This Bill provides an option for managers to extend that contract period for a further three years to a maximum of ten years in total. The tenure arrangements now being introduced are in line with the ten year term recommended by the Barrington report and the policy in the institutes of technology where the directors are now offered ten year appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> Fixed tenure arrangements for local authority managers were first introduced in 1991. Section 47 of the Local Government Act, 1991, allowed the Minister to introduce such arrangements by way of an order laid before both Houses. An order providing for a standard fixed term of seven years and for interim transitional arrangements was made in 1991. Managers are entitled to apply for other manager posts, and many of them do, in the same way as other local authority officials may apply for posts in other local authorities. There are obvious benefits to a system of open competitive mobility and it provides a readily accessible pool of experience from which local authorities can draw on the basis of merit.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons managers apply for other posts, such as preferred location or higher pay. However, the principal reason managers apply for other manager posts during their contract period is to ensure continued employment. In order to ensure they will have a new appointment before the present term expires, the trend is for managers to start looking for new posts after approximately four or five years' service. It seems that the introduction of the seven year tenure has had the unintended effect of managers vacating their existing posts prematurely, which has given rise to instability in local authority management. This is not in the best interests of efficient and effective local government. At the most senior level of manager, a certain level of stability is essential.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem would seem to be that the contract periods are currently too short. A seven year contract with an option to extend by three years giving a maximum total of ten years, as proposed, is intended to address this difficulty and, subject to the relevant requirements, will be open to serving managers whose contracts would otherwise expire.</P>
    <P>I will now discuss the provisions of the Bill in more detail. Section 1 provides for the new arrangements to be introduced by regulations in the same way as the original seven year term was introduced. Such regulations will be required to be laid before both Houses and are subject to annulment by resolution of either.</P>
    <P>The new tenure regime will provide as follows: the basic seven year contract will continue to stand as at present; managers will, however, have the option to extend this by three years, giving a total maximum of ten years; a maximum retirement age of 65 will apply in all cases; the extension option will have to be exercised by the person concerned giving notification to the cathaoirleach within a period, the notification period, to be prescribed in the regulations; a different notification period may be specified for a transitional phase following the introduction of the new arrangements; the standard notification period for the exercise of the extension option will be specified in the regulations as the fifth year of service within the seven year tenure; the cathaoirleach must notify the members of the local authority, the Local Appointments Com<Col N="1882" /> mission and the Minister when given notification; where a person gives notification he or she is precluded from applying for a manager post until six months before the expiry of his or her extended term of office and the LAC is precluded from considering any application made within that excluded period; the regulations can, however, specify manager posts to which this prohibition will not apply, for example, Dublin city and Cork County, to ensure a sufficiency of suitable candidates for these top posts.</P>
    <P>I remind Members of the Seanad that the comprehensive Local Government Bill, 2000, which was presented to the other House last month and provides for the consolidation and modernisation of local government law as well as introducing a range of reforms, will provide plenty of opportunity to this House for the consideration of all aspects of the local government code affecting councils, managers and related matters. This Bill aims to address a specific but important issue which has given rise to difficulty. I commend it to the House on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government Act, 1991, is being amended because the introduction of the seven year tenure has had the unintended effect of managers vacating their existing posts prematurely, which has given rise to instability in local authority management. It is important to have stability in local government. We are blessed to have had good local government management at the highest level, with one exception, for a long number of years. I have worked with city and county managers for 22 years and I found them to be excellent people who gave leadership. It is important that city and county managers give leadership to their councils.</P>
      <P>However, a problem has arisen in that when people excel themselves at local authority level, whether at managerial level or at lower levels, such as director of traffic, planners or people with financial expertise, they are encouraged to move to the private sector. There is a haemorrhage of good personnel from the public sector. Many of these people move as consultants to the private sector. We must introduce measures to enable local authorities to retain the best equipped staff possible to manage them and to maintain stability. I welcome the extension from seven to ten years. After four or five years many managers will look for another appointment. If they are good managers, we should retain them for that period of time and give stability to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have difficulty with only one aspect of the Bill in section 1. If a manager is seeking an extension, he or she must notify the cathaoirleach. Has the council a right to refuse him or her the extension? We can take the hypothetical case of a manager who is unhappy with his or her council. If other councils do not want him or her and he or she applies to his or her own council for an extension, has it the right to refuse him or her an extension for a further three years? A council should be <Col N="1883" /> given the authority to do so when extending a manager's contract.</P>
    <P>When the House comes back in the autumn the Local Government Bill will be introduced which will give the public the right to elect lord mayors or cathaoirligh. It is important that people are elected to that position who can work with the manager and the council. We should establish that linkage between the manager, lord mayor or cathaoirleach and the council. The directly elected mayoral position will work only if we fulfil that criterion. I realise I am deviating from what is contained in the Bill but I wanted to make that comment. The Bill is very short and I have no difficulty with it passing all Stages today.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this legislation. It is a short but necessary Bill. As has been said by Senator Doyle, getting good quality managers is not easy and there is a major drain in terms of top management posts in the local government system. If one employs a good manager it is important to try to hold on to him or her as long as possible. I welcome the legislation to extend the seven years to ten years. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Senators for accepting the Bill, which is very straightforward. Some of the points raised by Senator Joe Doyle will be addressed in the Local Government Bill later in the year.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, in common with other public sector bodies such as the Civil Service and health boards and many private sector companies, are currently operating in a labour market that is buoyant, and one where there is a notable skills shortage. We are all aware of the difficulties in recruiting clerical staff, engineers and planners, as has been referred to. There is a need, therefore, to review recruitment procedures to ensure that each local authority is in a position to attract suitably qualified and experienced staff to enable it to provide a full range of services in a professional manner. It is equally important that, once recruited, such staff are fully trained and developed and that measures are in place to retain them in the sector.</P>
      <P>The development of modern human resources practices in local authorities is being undertaken by my Department in partnership with the Local Government Management Services Board and the local authorities. I understand that the human resources sub-committee of the board has been examining the recruitment and retention of staff in the local authority service with a view to making recommendations to assist local authorities in competing for and retaining new recruits, and is due to report to the board in the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, local authorities have been proactive in the matter and have been examining new ways of attracting staff. In addition to adver<Col N="1884" /> tising far and wide to fill posts, in particular professional posts, some local authorities have actually conducted interviews in the United Kingdom and near European countries with some success.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities also took part in the public service open day which was held in the RDS on 28 May last to promote the Civil and public service as a challenging and rewarding career choice.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were also having particular difficulties in recruiting clerical officers. This has been due mainly to the low starting pay for the post <i>vis-à-vis</i> other jobs in the private sector. However, following the coming into force of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which outlawed age related remuneration as a feature of employment, the Department of Finance took the opportunity of addressing the problem of low starting pay for clerical officers in the Civil Service, health boards and local authorities. They have eliminated the three age points on the scale, which means that clerical officers will now start on what was the old fourth point. This is an increase of over £1,500 per annum and will ensure that local authorities will offer a competitive starting salary when recruiting such officers in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the question of the extension option and the council's role. The option of extension will be available to a manager under section 47A. The old arrangements which most Senators will remember saw a manager appointed and he &ndash; it was always a man &ndash; remained in office until his 65th birthday. In the early 1990s, a seven year contract was introduced and the new system will allow the manager an option to extend this contract by a maximum of three years. This option is available as an intrinsic part of the new system. It is not subject to approval by the council or the Minister but where it is exercised, the manager does so in the knowledge that he or she is formally and statutorily committed to remaining with the authority and is prohibited from applying for most other manager jobs.</P>
    <P>The option is exercised by the manager giving a formal notification to the cathaoirleach who must then notify the Local Appointments Commission and the Minister, and inform the elected council at its next meeting. Current law allows the elected council the right to suspend or to remove a manager from office. In the event that there is a valid reason for suspension or removal, the mechanisms exist for the council to take the appropriate action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend to the House the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill, 2000, which provides for the temporary registration period, as set out in section 29(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to be extended from an aggregate period of not more than five years to an aggregate period of not more than seven years. It is intended to do this to ease recruitment and retention difficulties being experienced by hospitals in relation to non-consultant hospital doctors. From 1 July, some hospitals will experience difficulties in securing their required number of junior doctors. This amendment will remove one of the obstacles in that it will allow doctors who may have to leave the country to remain here and thereby ease some staffing difficulties.</P>
      <P>The staffing requirements of hospitals and the deployment of staff within hospitals is primarily a matter for local management, having regard to the services which hospitals are expected to provide. There are particular staffing difficulties being faced by the health services at present across a wide range of areas, particularly in medical, paramedical and nursing areas.</P>
      <P>This amendment to the Medical Practitioners Act is one of a number of measures being taken to improve the working arrangements for non-consultant hospital doctors. On a broader front, the issues relating to medical staffing of hospitals are currently being addressed by the Medical Manpower Forum. With particular regard to non-consultant hospital doctors, the forum is seeking to redress the imbalance between career posts and training posts, the need to improve post-graduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to examine the position of women in medicine in Ireland with a view to redressing the number who leave medicine. The Medical Manpower Forum is due to finalise its first report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An intensive series of negotiations held under <Col N="1886" /> the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission has concluded and agreement has been reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on all the major concerns of non-consultant hospital doctors. The proposals are now being balloted on by the NCHDs. As the NCHD committee has recommended that the proposals be accepted, I am hopeful that the industrial action threatened is now resolved.</P>
    <P>The proposals for settlement include a very significant improvement in the overtime rates being paid to NCHDs. In addition, a senior manager is to be appointed in each major hospital with specific responsibility to manage NCHD hours. A concerted effort is to be made to improve the working conditions and to reduce NCHD working hours with particular attention to long periods of continuous duty. There is also a substantial training package to be put in place amounting to £10 million per annum. New procedures are to be put in place to deal with NCHD grievances at local level. Relocation expenses are also to be paid to NCHDs who have to move residence as part of formal rotation schemes.</P>
    <P>Some of the issues that affect the working conditions of NCHDs cannot be resolved immediately. Among those are the twin issues of working hours and the restructuring of the medical career hierarchy. The working hours of NCHDs have been the subject of negotiations at European level in the context of the proposed extension of the 1993 EU Directive on Working Time to doctors in training. Deputies will be aware that different stances on this issue have been taken by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. I am glad to note that the agreement was reached on a formula that provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. Ireland has always stated that it will reduce junior doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week at least as quickly as required by any European legislation, if not sooner. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years allowed or in a shorter period.</P>
    <P>As part of our preparations for this eventuality, we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants. The report of the study will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the non-consultant hospital doctors staffing shortages, health service employers and the Health Service Employers Agency are continuing to monitor the take up of employment offers made from 1 July 2000. As an NCHD may have an offer of employment from more than one hospital, the full picture will not emerge for some days. However, I expect further positions to be filled after 1 July. Hospitals are exploring different options in an effort to ensure that essential posts are filled. In the event that some posts remain unfilled, hospitals will be asked to ensure that essential and critical services are not affected. With the full co-operation of all <Col N="1887" /> concerned and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.</P>
    <P>While the primary responsibility for the staffing of hospitals rests with hospital management, I seek the co-operation of this House to amend the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, to extend the period of temporary registration for NCHDs from five years to seven years.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While this area is not my brief, I have some knowledge of the difficulties existing in hospital services, especially the junior hospital doctors issue, as I am a member of the ERHA and the East Coast Health Board. This problem has developed over many years. A Private Members' motion was tabled recently by Senator Henry on the matter. This problem persists and, thus far, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. However, I hope what the Minister of State said will give us some assurance that the current industrial relations difficulties will be resolved.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a good medical service, we must have junior doctors who are happy in their employment, work reasonable hours, get well paid and are provided with other essential services, such as accommodation near the hospital, but that is not the case at present. As a medical practitioner, the Minister of State must be conscious of the difficulties relating to junior doctors and the long hours they work, a practice which has a long history.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill to allow the Minister to extend the temporary registration of non-EU doctors from five years to seven years. That will allow doctors whose registrations will expire on 1 July to continue to work in our hospitals. However, given that today is 30 June, this legislation is being introduced a little late in the day. Non-EU junior doctors whose registrations will expire tomorrow will have made other arrangements. This legislation will provide us with no more than 25 non-EU junior doctors who will be able to continue to work in the State. While that will be an improvement, I hope the Government gives a commitment to address fully the problem of the shortage of junior hospital doctors.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question in the Dáil on 23 May, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children said there was no evidence that there will be a shortage of junior doctors arising from the new assessment for non-EU doctors, while on 30 May, the Minister for Health and Children gave a different reply. He acknowledged that some hospitals were experiencing some difficulties in recruiting junior doctors in certain specialties. Those hospitals are experiencing grave difficulties in recruiting such doctors. There is no doubt there is a problem in the health services with junior doctors and I hope what is proposed will address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> Given that many people with minor problems go to accident and emergency departments, much of the time of the staff in those departments is taken up dealing with patients who could be dealt with elsewhere. The East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunction with St. Vincent's Hospital, is making arrangements for a general practitioner to be available on the campus of that hospital from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. each evening to deal with patients who wish to see a GP. General practitioners in the area have got together and agreed to participate in this initiative, which will reduce the pressure on the accident and emergency department in that hospital.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will encourage the introduction of similar initiatives throughout the country. Such an initiative could develop further than the GPs dealing with patients with minor problems and that would reduce further the pressure in accident and emergency departments, as that where the real problem lies.</P>
    <P>I deviated from the Bill in making that point, but given that this initiative was announced recently and will be introduced shortly, I thought it was worth mentioning. I urge the Minister of State to consider introducing similar initiatives in other areas.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. I strongly support this Bill. The two extra years of extended registration is a significant step in resolving difficulties related to the recruitment of junior doctors. I am pleased the Minister of State referred to the long hours that junior doctors work. As someone who worked with them for many years, I often wondered how they could carry out their duties having worked so many hours. Given that proposals have been agreed between the Labour Relations Commission and the IMO, which are currently being balloted on by the NCHDs, and that the NCHD committee has recommended that the proposals should be accepted, it would be wrong for me or any other Senator to say anything that could affect the outcome of that ballot one way or the other.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is significant in terms of what it provides. The Minister of State has said all that needs to be said. The provision of £10 million per annum for training is significant. Junior doctors, as with every other profession, must have a facility whereby they can improve their career in a structured way. I welcome the Bill and I trust it will have the support of the House.</P>

      <P>The previous two speakers were admirably brief but, as the Chair might expect, I will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It says a lot that when the new Minister for Health and Children went into the Department he immediately had to set up an industrial relations initiative. It is extraordinary that the health service employers have had a nurses' strike and have just, perhaps, averted a non-consultant hospital doctors' strike. I asked on the Order of <Col N="1889" /> Business this morning if we could find out what has happened to home helps who appear to be in difficulty again with the health service employers. People who were paid ridiculous sums, such as £3 per hour, for keeping the elderly in their homes will now be granted £6.50 per hour, but apparently some difficulties have arisen with the health service employers. Someone has got to be in charge of the health service employers. If it is not the Minister for Health and Children we should be told.</P>
    <P>I was saddened on the last occasion I raised this topic in Private Members' time two weeks ago when the Minister said we could not require statutory health boards to be independent and at the same time expect him to do something. He has overall charge of the health services and if we cannot look to him for help, to whom can we look? </P>
    <P>No progress has been made on the negotiations with the consultants. The Minister of State will say the medical manpower report is due shortly but we had the Tierney report five years ago which seemed very good. The medical manpower report will not be agreed shortly because the Irish Hospital Consultants Association has not agreed the sub-consultant grade, nor will it. The Department may want it but it has been a dismal failure in Great Britain. Why would we want to introduce something here which has been such a failure there? Let him introduce sessional consultants, part-time consultants if he wishes, but he must get rid of the notion that this sub-consultant grade, which in many cases would take the place of additional consultants, would be a great help. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will convey these views to the Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>Non-EU doctors here have been treated disgracefully for many years. They have been the backbone of the health service, particularly outside Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. They have run the county hospitals of Ireland. They came here for training which they did not get. This is the reason the Medical Council acted in 1996. I have been raising this matter since 1997 and advised that this day would come. Now it has come. The previous Minister for Health and Children took no notice of what I said. The Medical Council said it had to do something because of the lack of training in various county hospitals. That is due to a lack of consultants. Naas General Hospital has one anaesthetist consultant on duty at a time. It shares consultants with Tallaght Hospital. Naturally it could not make an agreement in regard to the training of anaesthetists there, so how could the casualty department take it on?</P>
    <P>There are two obstetricians working here single handed. They are the last two in either the United Kingdom or this island. There are nine hospitals which have two consultants. The Institute of Obstetricians has said, while there is six months to go, it will not sanction training posts in those <Col N="1890" /> hospitals. What preparations are in hand for this eventuality? It is incredibly disappointing.</P>
    <P>Another shabby practice for non-EU doctors was that if they left the country to go to, say, a seminar in London they were charged for a re-entry visa. One Russian told me he had to pay £50. Was that not a great way of encouraging non-EU doctors to keep up our medical staffing? It is no wonder they have left. When the Medical Council made its regulations it also said that non-EU doctors had to do an examination before they could become accredited to work here. This was fair. However, in the past they did not have to do an exam. They could work here without doing an exam, while to work in Great Britain they had to have an exam. The cost of coming here was prohibitive for them. Instead of 200 or 300 coming every year only ten to 20 came. Given that I have raised this matter so many times I do not know why I am even discussing it again. This was bound to happen. Here we are on 30 June and the crisis will start on 1 July.</P>
    <P>While the inadequacy of the training programmes will not be addressed by £10 million, that sum is welcome. We have got to have consultants who have time for training. They are the individuals who train these people but they are running ragged from trying to keep the health service in operation. We are 1,000 consultants short of the number needed to get us up to Scottish levels. I do not think anyone has said the Scottish levels are excessive.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn said the other day there was a rheumatology programme in the Midland Health Board. I asked him afterwards who was the rheumatologist. He then explained that it was the hope of the Midland Health Board to have a rheumatology programme. The Midland Health Board deserves three to four rheumatologists but there are only about ten in the country. It is utterly ridiculous that there is such under representation of people in medial specialties, in particular neurologists. How many times have I told the House we have 11 when we should have 35? </P>
    <P>Senator Chambers called for a policy on strokes and more action on them. How can we have any action without some neurologists? On the issue of rheumatologists, do we not have arthritis in this country? Then there is the most serious problem of ophthalmology. The Lions Club pays for people from the Midlands Health Board, who have been on the waiting list for over two years, to come to Dublin overnight so that they can have day surgery for cataracts. While the country is supposed to be awash with money and the Minister for Finance is telling us to party this is what is being done to those who are blind.</P>
    <P>There was the recent scandal about the 78 year old locum who had been working as a pathologist in Letterkenny Hospital and Tralee General Hospital. It was a minor miracle that we were able to get a 78 year old to work anywhere. There are more consultant singlehanded posts in the country than proper set-ups. How can these people get even a day off if they do not manage to <Col N="1891" /> get a consultant from somewhere? I agree there should be some regulations regarding who can be appointed to consultant posts. As my colleague, Professor Sean McCann, wrote to <i>The Irish Times,</i> how would you feel if you were told that a 78 year old locum pilot was flying you across the Atlantic? Not too happy, I would imagine. We were fortunate to get somebody to take these positions. Not only are there far too few consultants on the ground but when anything happens we are in a dire situation.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council sees what is happening with the General Medical Council in England. It is not supposed to be in charge of staffing but rather standards. It cannot be held responsible for a decrease in staffing if it is trying to raise standards.</P>
    <P>Whenever there is a problem here there are angry patients and their public representatives are also angry. I was very upset this morning when Senator Liam Fitzgerald said on the Order of Business that he would like a course held on communication and an improvement in manners, although he was kind enough to say bedside manners, for consultants. When I raised this with him subsequently he did have cause for complaint. I suggest that those who are working in the hospitals are working on the run and under ridiculous conditions. Senator Glynn has said he cannot understand how the junior hospital doctors have managed to give a service in some situations, and he has seen the problems in the psychiatric services which are acute. He has not spoken much about the shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors but it is an important issue. The position with consultants is very bad. At certain times there would not even be an office into which one could take a patient to try to speak to them about something private; everything would take place in the middle of a clinic. I can understand Senator Fitzgerald's annoyance with the complaints that have been made to him and I will certainly take them up.</P>
    <P>There have been such scandals in Great Britain that members of the General Medical Council yesterday took the serious step of voting for the disbanding of the body because they felt that as a regulatory body it had not been vigilant enough regarding members. They were right. We have only to look at the heart operations which for years were carried out on babies in Bristol where there was a totally unacceptable mortality rate. For several years the anaesthetist who pointed out the deficiencies in the service was not well supported by his own discipline. Indeed, he emigrated to Australia for a more peaceful, if not better, medical life because he believed his prospects of promotion would be diminished in Great Britain because of his whistle blowing. Perhaps there is something to be said for the criticisms of patients that people who work within the service are not fast enough to criticise colleagues.</P>
    <P>The General Medical Council now has serious problems because of Dr. Shipman, who killed <Col N="1892" /> goodness knows how many people, and Dr. Ledward, whom women say mutilated them over his 18 years of operating. He is now able to work in Ireland as a pharmacist and could well be working as a locum pharmacist. The Pharmacy Acts contain no provision for a fitness to practise committee. Would that not be a new issue to tackle in the autumn? There were other consultants and general practitioners in England who did serious damage before their paths were arrested.</P>
    <P>The key to solving the problem in this area is the appointment of more consultants to ensure training in posts where there is currently none. The Minister of State concluded his speech by saying, &ldquo;With the full co-operation of all concerned and a commitment to making the best use of available resources, the effect on services can be minimised.&rdquo;  What does he mean by that? I would have thought that all we can do is consolidate services. Navan, Cavan, Monaghan and Drogheda have serious problems regarding anaesthetists. The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will be aware that it is unsafe to run a casualty department without anaesthetic cover. People should be told that certain hospitals are closed for accidents and emergencies until the situation is sorted out.</P>
    <P>We are now in the holiday season, which means there will be locums in hospitals who are not familiar with those hospitals. I am aware that efforts are being made to recruit abroad and that the Internet is being used to search for German doctors, for example. However, the Department will have to assess them and ensure they speak adequate English. It will take some time for the accreditation processes to be completed.</P>
    <P>There has been a terrible lack of a sense of urgency in the Department of Health and Children in the last few years. It takes at least a year in the voluntary hospitals and longer in local authority hospitals to fill a consultant appointment. Why does this process begin at the time the resident consultant is retiring? Why does it not begin a couple of years prior to that? That is what happens in most health services and in some it is considered desirable for the incoming consultant to work for six months with the consultant who is in place. That system could be introduced immediately. One need only look at the age range of employees and start filling the replacement posts at once.</P>
    <P>A total of £10 million is being spent on the waiting list initiative. Who will operate on the patients? Surgeons from different hospitals have contacted me to tell me, for example, &ldquo;I played golf on Monday to deal with my anger; I had to cancel my list because no anaesthetist was available.&rdquo;  In another hospital, one of the major teaching hospitals in Dublin which shall be nameless, there is such a shortage of anaesthetists that, to ensure fairness, the surgeons operate a rota to determine who will have to cancel a list. Is this any way to run a health service?</P>
    <P>Introducing legislation such as this is like running a health service with bits of Elastoplast. I <Col N="1893" /> cannot welcome it because I do not believe it will do any good. I doubt that any of the non-EU doctors, who might have been induced to stay if they had been approached three or six months ago, are still in the country. Why stay here if one knows one will be treated in this manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Joe Doyle is a member of the ERHA and is aware of what is happening at NCHD level. He recognises that there are difficulties, as does the Government, even if it was slow to react. That is a fair criticism but at least the Government is reacting and, hopefully, its reactions will be of benefit.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Doyle's comments about St. Vincent's Hospital. The practice of GPs working there should be of benefit. Throughout the country hospital administrators are inviting GPs to run such a service. It will alleviate problems in accident and emergency departments. Senator Glynn said the extension of the time limit from five to seven years should be useful. He commented on the long working hours, which has been a hobbyhorse of Senator Henry's for some time. She is absolutely correct. It is time this matter was straightened out. I am still not happy with the EU directive on it. We will make progress, however. The Minister, Deputy Martin, is approachable and far seeing. He knows that things cannot be put on the back burner forever. We must confront our problems.</P>
      <P>It is a short Bill but, hopefully, it will be significant. Senator Henry addressed the Bill to some extent and then went on to deal with other matters. I cannot disagree with most of what she said. However, it takes time to solve problems in the health sector. Throwing money at it is not the answer. The Senator drew our attention to problems with regard to nurses, NCHDs and home helps. I am disappointed to hear about the home helps.</P>

There might be other issues.</P>

      <P>That is right. There is a problem appointing consultants. It takes too long and we do not act in time, especially when numbers are increasing. There is a problem with Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Local Appointments Commission &ndash; we have pointed that out and it has been pointed out to the Minister. The Senator has also referred to it. There is no reason that cannot be fast-tracked and if we are to make progress, we will have to do that. There is no way around it.</P>
      <P>There are problems with obstetrics and gynaecology. I hope the manpower forum will arrive at solutions in that regard. I see some hope of getting three instead of two into the peripheral hospitals. There will have to be a minimum of three if we are to abide by the council's direction. That will have to be addressed also. It has been estimated that the number of consultants that will be required is between 800 and 1,000. We will make an attempt to achieve that. It will take a number of years but we must make a start if we are to achieve the high standards people demand and they have a right to demand such standards.</P>

    <P>I would not like to see hospitals or accident and emergency departments closing down. I have been talking to people in charge of smaller hospitals throughout the country who have been <Col N="1895" /> co-operating with consultants in order to continue a service which is of the highest standards. It is vital that high standards are provided.</P>
    <P>A number of measures are being taken to improve the conditions for NCHDs and the service in general. I am pleased the threatened industrial dispute will probably be called off. I live in hope. The 48 hour working issue for NCHDs will have to be taken off the agenda, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Health is always of interest and we probably do not pay sufficient attention to it. We put matters on the back burner and sometimes issues must go wrong before we address them. I thank Senators for pointing out many issues and I am sure the Minister will take cognisance of what has been said. I am aware that Senators do not want to waste their time making contributions and pointing out deficiencies unless some of them are taken on board.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be back in this House with the Bill which I initiated in this House, and to report to the Seanad on the Dáil amendments to the Bill. I took on board four amendments from Senators on Committee Stage following which the Bill was taken in the Dáil. It is widely reported in today's newspapers, including <i>The Irish Times,</i> that this is a very good Bill and the cross-party support it received is greatly welcomed in the business community. There was a very informed debate in this House in April and I am pleased the Bill stimulated a similarly lively debate on e-commerce related issues in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time the Oireachtas has debated such issues because these are new information technology advances. Given that fact, I am particularly pleased that such an informed debate took place in this House and in the Dáil. Contributions from all sides of both Houses demonstrated a keen awareness of the vital importance of e-commerce to the future of the country. A number of Dáil amendments were made to the Bill, both <Col N="1897" /> Government and Opposition, which I will now report.</P>
    <P>A new section 15 by way of a Fine Gael amendment was inserted in the Bill to clarify for the avoidance of doubt that existing consumer law applies to e-commerce in the State and that the Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for enforcing this legislation. Senators will recall that a problem with section 19 was highlighted by an amendment from Senator Costello on Committee Stage in the Seanad. In reply, I proposed to examine the issue in more detail and amend the section on Committee Stage in the Dáil. In fact, I did not have to table such an amendment because Deputy Yates came to the same conclusion to which I came. He proposed to delete the section, which I was pleased to do.</P>
    <P>The issue of the admissibility of electronic evidence in criminal proceedings was also raised on Committee Stage in the Seanad by an amendment to section 22 proposed by Senator Costello. I accepted this amendment in good faith. However, subsequently the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform pointed out that the amendment is in direct conflict with the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, particularly section 30 of the Act which provides on a general basis for the tendering in evidence in criminal proceedings of copies of documents, regardless of whether the original is still in existence. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform requested that the Bill be amended to state that it shall not prejudice the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992. This amendment meant that section 22(2), as inserted by a Seanad amendment, no longer made sense and was deleted on that basis.</P>
    <P>A new section on defamation law was also inserted in the Bill. Again this was an avoidance of doubt type amendment which clarified that defamation law applies to electronic communications within the State. A number of minor amendments of a technical nature were also accepted. While they will be clearly noted in the Bill they are not of interest to either House.</P>

For the past three weeks Senator Quinn, and I am sorry he is not here today, asked the Leader what stage this Bill had reached in the Dáil and whether it would be returned to the Seanad before the summer recess.

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to report back to the House on a number of amendments made by the Dáil in the Copyright and Related Rights Bill, 1999, which passed all Stages in the Seanad last year. We have spent a long time working on this Bill and I thank Members for their assistance. We have had 12 meetings on Committee Stage, gone to the Dáil and now we are back where it all began.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators anticipated in the course of their debate on the Bill, a large number of amendments were made by the Dáil. However, many of them were minor or technical in nature or were made in the interest of achieving the greatest possible consistency of expression across various parts of this very substantial Bill. In this report to the House I intend to concentrate on those <Col N="1899" /> amendments and groups of amendments that effect substantial changes in the Bill or relate to matters raised in the first place in this House. It will be clear that the two categories have a great deal in common.</P>
    <P>I will first refer to amendment No. 12. Senators contributing to this debate expressed major concerns about regulating relations between copyright and related rights collecting societies and users of protected materials in such a way as to ensure that both groups would be treated fairly under the law. This amendment addresses one major aspect of this concern. It introduces a new system to govern the playing of sound recordings in public and the inclusion of such recordings in broadcasts and cable programme services. Under this system commercial users of sound recordings will be afforded a licence of right. This will allow them to use such recordings in this way provided they agree to make fair payments to the rightsholder and make payments at intervals of not less than three months in arrears. A dispute resolution mechanism involving references to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks is provided for.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 73, 130 and 146 also deal with the supervision of rightsholder interests. These will require that all collecting societies operating under my part of the Act must be registered with the controller for the purpose. During debates in this House a number of Senators, including Senators Cox and Coghlan, proposed that collecting society registration be made compulsory. At the time the Office of the Attorney General advised me that compulsory registration would be a formality precedent to the subsistence and enjoyment of copyright. I was also advised that the imposition of formalities of this nature is forbidden by Article 5(2) of the Berne Convention on the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works at least as far as authors' rights collecting societies, such as the Irish Music Rights Organisation, are concerned. Following arguments raised by Senators and Deputies to the effect that compulsory registration was necessary to ensure transparency and the proper operation of collecting societies in general, I had the matter reconsidered. Following receipt of legal advice I was able to advance proposals to make registration compulsory by means of these amendments.</P>
    <P>The question of collecting society supervision was the major theme of the debate on this Bill in both Houses. The Senators were the first to raise this question in this House and I thank them for doing so.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9I to 94 provide for certain detailed improvements in the scheme of deposit of books to certain libraries. In particular, amendment No. 91 will allow the National Library of Ireland to seek delivery of any book circulated commercially in the State. This provision, which will effectively replace section 66 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, will facilitate the <Col N="1900" /> National Library in building up its collection of books of Irish interest, irrespective of where such books are first published. Amendment No. 94 will allow all deposit libraries to seek delivery of electronic copies of books in addition to hard copies where their first option is for a hard copy. This change, which was proposed by the Centre for Independent Living, is intended to facilitate deposit libraries in making modified copies of works for persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I should also mention amendment No. 95, which re-enacts section 65 of the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, in a slightly updated form. Section 65 has the purpose of allowing the book deposit scheme to be extended to certain other materials, such as compact discs, microfilms and videotapes. This extension applies only to deposits in the National Library. The intention is to facilitate that library in building up its collections of cultural materials of specific national interest.</P>
    <P>I understand that this section has not yet been commenced, but that my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, is considering commencing it in the near future, in relation to some materials of a cinematic nature. The re-enactment under amendment No. 95 is necessary to ensure that section 65 continues to be operable in relation to the new version of the book deposit scheme contained in section 181 of the present Bill, which is structured a little differently from the corresponding provisions of the Copyright Act, 1963.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that their work on Committee Stage in this House persuaded me to withdraw and replace what I now understand to be an inappropriate restructuring of the book deposit scheme, and I am grateful to them for drawing my attention to that problem. My Dáil amendments limited themselves to making modest improvements in the book deposit scheme, including the related provisions in the National Cultural Institutions Act, on the basis of consultations between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    <P>As I said in previous contributions on the subject both in this House and in the Dáil, I recognise that this scheme has considerable importance, in particular in the national heritage context, even though its association with copyright is now entirely an historical one. However, the scheme has grown in a rather unstructured and unconsidered way over the years. It remains my intention to initiate an interdepartmental review of the scheme that will, in due course, allow the Government to consider proposals for the future of the scheme that will take full account of the views of all interested parties.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other amendments of cultural and educational importance. Amendment No. 4 extends the definition of &ldquo;educational establishments&rdquo; in the Bill to include universities within the meaning of the Universities Act, 1997. I was happy to accept this amendment which, I understand, was suggested by the heads of the <Col N="1901" /> universities concerned. Of course, the definition currently appearing in the Bill is still not intended to be comprehensive. The Minister retains the power to designate additional categories of educational establishment where this is appropriate and I will consult my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, about the appropriate scope of such designations prior to the commencement of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 30 and 117 provide for the inclusion of museums and museum curators within the definitions of archives and archivists respectively and provide exceptions for certain types of curatorial copying of copyright works and recordings of performances which are, typically, carried out by museum curators. I am sure the House will agree that these amendments will be of value in the development of our cultural services.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments are designed to improve the practical operation of various exceptions that were already contained in the Bill when it left the Seanad. For example, amendments Nos. 20 and 21 will allow the non-reprographic copying exception for educational purposes to apply, not only where the copying is carried out by persons giving or receiving instruction themselves, but also where such copying is carried out on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 considerably clarifies the previous text governing the exception in favour of lending by organisations such as public libraries. I accepted amendment No. 31 to ensure that the copyright exception in favour of inter-library loans, already implicit in the Bill, is made clear and explicit. Important in this category of amendments are amendments Nos. 17, 107 and 312, which relax the definition of fair dealing exceptions by replacing the qualification that the copying concerned be &ldquo;reasonably justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved&rdquo; with a qualification that it &ldquo;will not unreasonably prejudice the interests&rdquo; of rightsowners. This change is more realistic in terms of the legitimate use to which these exceptions are put, and more consistent with international practice in this area. In relation to all amendments aimed at improving the basic exceptions in the Bill, I am very conscious of the role of this House in helping me to focus my concern on the views of the cultural and educational sectors in particular and I am very grateful to Senators for this assistance.</P>
    <P>A matter of particular concern raised in debates on the Bill in this House was the question of whether exemptions in favour of research should be specifically in favour of &ldquo;private&rdquo; research. Senators will recall that I accepted a number of amendments from Senators Henry and Quinn to remove the qualification &ldquo;private&rdquo; in a number of instances, and I express my thanks to the Senators for their attention to this point. They may wish to note that Dáil amendments Nos. 36 and 232 make a similar change in the case of the folklore research exceptions in order to bring <Col N="1902" /> them into line with the research exceptions modified by amendments in this House.</P>
    <P>One innovative proposal made in this House, which I did not feel able to accept at the time, was the introduction of a specific offence governing false claims of copyright which was proposed by Senator Brendan Ryan. My legal advice at the time was that the introduction of such a measure would be superfluous and that it could confuse the operation of the other copyright criminal provisions. Following further argument from the Senator's colleague in the other House, Deputy Rabbitte, I had the matter re-examined and, on the basis of further legal advice, I was persuaded to accept this innovation. It is introduced, in a modified form, by Dáil amendment No. 55. Amendment No. 126 introduces a similar offence in relation to false claims of rights in performances. I thank Senator Ryan for what has turned out to be a very useful suggestion.</P>
    <P>I feel I must mention two groups of amendments which, though technical, have an important role in the overall operation of this legislation. These are amendments Nos. 72 and 74 to 79, inclusive, in Part II of the Bill and Nos. 131, 132 and 133 in Part III, which deal with qualification of works and performances for the protection of Irish copyright and performers' rights law under this legislation. Senators will recall that as a gesture in favour of a more liberal trade in intellectual property materials, the Bill as circulated would have extended Irish copyright and performers' rights protection, in effect, &ldquo;to the world&rdquo;. It was subsequently represented to me that this was inappropriate in view of the persisting unevenness of protection levels for these rights in some jurisdictions, in particular in the performers' rights area.</P>
    <P>These groups of amendments will effectively limit qualification for the rights in question under Irish law to materials protected by corresponding laws in countries with which we share obligations under international law, in accordance with the principles of national treatment. This change brings the Bill into line with normal international practice in the area of copyright qualification.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 80 to 85, inclusive, deal with Government and Oireachtas copyright. In the debates in this House, Senators expressed concern about the abnormally lengthy duration that the Bill as published would have afforded to some Government copyrights and amendments were proposed which would have had such copyrights expire &ldquo;in the normal way&rdquo;. I could not accept these amendments because, in the absence of a measuring life, Government copyrights are incapable of expiring in a manner similar to normal copyrights. However, Dáil amendment No. 80 responds to the wish of Senators and Deputies for a more reasonable term of Government copyright by setting it a fixed term of 50 years.</P>
    <P>As regards Oireachtas copyright, Senators will recall that I accepted amendments in this House transferring the copyright in Bills and Acts from the Government to the Oireachtas. At the time, <Col N="1903" /> I indicated that the Government had originally been assigned copyright in these materials on the basis that it could exercise the copyright interests concerned more conveniently than the Houses. Indeed, it has proved difficult to devise a provision through which Oireachtas copyright can be managed effectively, which can be seen to be consistent with the honour, dignity and privileges of the Houses of the Oireachtas and which can, at the same time, allow the citizen the most open access possible to legislative materials.</P>
    <P>The management of Oireachtas copyright is now governed by the measure introduced by Dáil amendment No. 85, which contains a permission for free copying of materials covered by Oireachtas copyright, subject to conditions laid down by the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, such conditions to be laid before both Houses as soon as may be after they are imposed. This is viewed by some as a restrictive formula, but it is not intended as such. My advice is that this approach is both effective and consistent with the dignity of the Houses and consistent with their need to manage and protect their own documentation. Given the views expressed both in this House and in the other in favour of the most liberal approach possible to the making available of legislative materials to the public, I have no doubt that this provision will be operated in a manner consistent with these views and that the current Government practice of allowing free use of these materials will continue, subject only to such reasonable conditions as the Houses may see fit to impose.</P>
    <P>I will reserve my final comments until I am summing up. I thank the House for the work it has done since initiating this Bill. When we started out we could not see the end of the process. This Bill was always signalled as the most complex and comprehensive Bill in the history of the Oireachtas. We discussed issues ranging from music and folklore to libraries and software, to name but a few. The Bill was detailed and technical. As Minister of State, my officials and I relied on the experts in this House. That is the purpose of the Seanad &ndash; for people to bring their experience to bear to improve legislation. That has happened as a result of our lengthy deliberations and I am pleased to have arrived at this point. I thank the House for its co-operation at all levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive address on the amendments made in Dáil Éireann to this extensive Bill. I did not play any part in the Bill's passage through the House but I note it is a Bill of 371 sections. It is a sizeable and complex Bill but it is a wonderful example of how our democracy works. A Bill is initiated in the Seanad, the Minister of State keeps and open mind and listens to the views expressed by Senators, examines the amendments, and takes some on board. He then hears other arguments in the Dáil, seeks legal advice <Col N="1904" /> and accepts other amendments. It would be of great interest to Members such as Senator Coghlan who proposed the collection of registration fees being made compulsory. Senator Ryan should be pleased that the Minister of State sought legal advice having heard his argument for a specific offence governing false claims of copyright. The Minister of State listened to his colleague in the other House and made the amendment.</P>
      <P>It has been a good day for the Oireachtas that this Bill, initiated in the Seanad and amended in Dáil Éireann, has come back for its final report. I have no difficulty in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a mammoth effort and I congratulate the Minister of State. It has been a philosophical exercise and I congratulate the officials and the Minister of State's secretary, whom I tortured while this Bill was being debated. At times they felt I had too many cultured and educated friends and it would have better if I had been left to my own devices.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that the entire section on deposit libraries was altered. That was very important. The changes in relation to the National Library will definitely be to its advantage.</P>
      <P>I was glad our amendments on fair dealing were taken on board. It could have caused enormous problems if those trying to do private study had difficulties with copyright. The officials explained to me why there is a difference between the number of copies allowed for librarians and the number allowed for fair dealing and it was a reasonable explanation. The Minister of State dealt with the amount of a journal which could be copied. Frequently these journals cease publication.</P>
      <P>There may be disappointment about the copying of Bills and Acts of the Oireachtas but the Minister of State did his best. It is interesting to see that in two cases he got contradictory legal advice. It is always worth getting a second opinion.</P>
      <P>When prescribing libraries, I am sure the Minister will consult with professional bodies because they will want to be involved. While lending between libraries is explicitly stated, does that mean borrowing between libraries is implicit in the Bill? In Part III of the Act, there is a lack of clarity about the lending of recordings. Will the Minister clarify that matter for me in his concluding remarks.</P>
      <P>An enormous amount of work went into this Bill and the Minister and his officials are justly proud of it. I am equally happy that the Minister of State's speech is printed on both sides of the paper. I can never understand why ministerial speeches are always only printed on one side of the page when we are supposed to be involved in waste management. This uses half as much paper but the words are just as good.</P>

Until now the scheme for the collection of copyright was badly structured. The many contributions made and amendments accepted make the Bill very worthwhile. I thank the Minister of State and his staff for the huge amount of work they have put into the Bill. It is one of the largest ever to pass through the Oireachtas and credit is due to all concerned. I look forward to the benefit it will bring to those involved in music.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the Fianna Fáil spokesman on the area covered by this Bill for 11 years. This is the most important legislation to come before the Seanad in the last 20 years. It is of enormous importance to employment. Only last week the Tánaiste announced 1,000 new jobs and £2 billion of investment at Intel over the next few years. All of this is a vote of confidence in the regulations and laws governing the economy. The manner in which this legislation deals with intellectual property is highly important. The wealth of our nation depends on how we handle software and intellectual property rights in the future.</P>
      <P>We can learn from the Berne Convention of 1936 and the 1963 Act. This Act was long overdue and took a long time to put together. Those who have attended the world music publishers conference in Cannes every January for the past 32 or 33 years will know how important intellectual property is in the music, film or computer industries. We all know how investors in intellectual property in America have expanded the market over the years.</P>
      <P>I accepted the bona fides of certain people from different industries during the passage of this Bill. When the Bill was sent to the Dáil from this House some organisations had concerns and I am glad the Minister of State has addressed them in the Dáil. The registering of the music rights organisations and the works of writers, composers, record company employees and publishers must be protected on the one hand but, on the other, the playing of such music in venues for the enjoyment of the public is equally important. An eminent Member of this House for more than 20 years, former Senator Bernie McGlinchey, who is alive and well and is still a member of Donegal County Council, has done a great deal for the music industry in general by employing young people down the years. I commend him for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do music organisations have a right of appeal on decisions when they seek licences or renew licences? Are venue owners charged exorbitant fees, particularly in towns in rural Ireland with populations of less than 5,000? Music rights organisations cannot be permitted to put a gun to the heads of such venue owners who have kept the entire industry going for generations. Acting Chairman, I refer to your part of the country, the north-west, where the music industry has been a great source of employment for many young people over the years. A member of your family <Col N="1906" /> has been employed in the industry similar to family members of mine.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State stated:</P>
    <P>The amendment addresses one major aspect of this concern. It introduces a new system to govern the playing of sound recordings in public and the inclusion of such recordings in broadcasts and cable programme services. Under this system, commercial users of sound recordings will be afforded a licence of right allowing them to use such recordings in this way provided that they agree to make fair payment to the rights holder and make payments at intervals of not less than three months in arrears. A dispute resolution mechanism involving references to the collector of patents, designs and trade marks is provided for.</P>
    <P>Is an appeals system now in place? I understand that up to now some rights organisations took it upon themselves to collect royalties on behalf of publishers and the creators of the original work. They charged prices which the venue owners could not afford, whether it was in Cashel, Letterkenny or Castlepollard. It must be understood that there must be a criterion for a certain level of population so that a blanket criterion could not be adopted. For example, a Dublin venue would have 1.5 million potential customers whereas a venue in a town or village in rural Ireland might only potentially have between 1,000 and 2,000 customers.</P>
    <P>Common sense must prevail in all legislation. This Framework Document is the second largest Bill to come before the House in the past 20 years. The Companies Act, 1990, has more sections than this Bill. The House has debated this legislation for 87 hours while the Dáil spent 95 hours considering it. That demonstrates how important is this legislation. In 25 or 30 years countries throughout the world will refer to the Kitt legislation. Ireland is a leader in this field. Since the Minister of State took office he and his officials have invested enormous resources in this legislation. I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>I have no other reservations regarding the issues raised by the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and others which were affected by this legislation. One section provided that hoteliers would have to pay for the use of televisions in every bedroom. Hotels in rural Ireland might only be busy for three or four months or the year while in Dublin city they might be busy for eight or nine months and the owners have fantastic businesses. However, that is not how business operates. Businesses must be kept open during the quiet months. I would like the Minister of State to respond on the appeals mechanism and to confirm that common sense will be used at the end of the day in regard to the playing of music.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. All of us <Col N="1907" /> have taken ownership of the Bill in some way and, hopefully, we have copyright on it. I thank Members for welcoming me and their kind words regarding the work that has been undertaken. I also thank my officials. There is an intellectual property unit in the Department which deals not only with copyright but also with patents, trade marks and many other issues. It is a growing area which is socially, economically and educationally important, not just culturally important. There are many important aspects to our work.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Henry, borrowing between libraries is implicit in the legislation. If one lends, another borrows. Section 226 provides for lending of copies of performances between prescribed libraries. I thank Senator Cassidy for the work that has been done. There were huge disputes between night club owners and collecting agencies, which was a well documented problem for many years. I was anxious that it should have been addressed.</P>
      <P>We consulted far and wide with the organisations involved and all the issues referred to by the Leader can be referred to the controller for determination. We have strengthened the controller's hand by time limiting copyright arbitration allowing the controller to seek removal of overly slow arbitrators and to appoint assessors to assist in appeals. There were problems and the Leader correctly stated that there is a new licence of right for people who want to play music. Even if there is an ongoing dispute one has the right to play the music. There is also a dispute resolution mechanism involving the controller. Another important issue that was raised was the registering of all agencies. People wanted more transparency with regard to PPI and IMRO. They will be registered.</P>
      <P>I have a strong interest in music and it a common characteristic of many Members. One of my sons is pursuing a musical career, so I suppose I had better put that on the record also. I am conscious of the many struggling artists, whether they are working as singers, songwriters, in film or as authors. This country is proud of the many tremendous artists it has produced over the years, and another stream of young artists is now coming to public attention. I have just returned from Expo 2000 in Hanover where Eavan Boland, Donal Lunny and many other artists were present, representing many different artistic sectors.</P>

      <P>That is correct. In Hanover, 100 of the 153 days of the Expo 2000 have been set aside for cultural activities by the Irish pavilion. That represents much more than any other country and it demonstrates the importance of culture to this country, which is one of my areas of responsibility. It is important to demonstrate the strength <Col N="1908" /> of our arts and culture from street theatre to song and literature.</P>
      <P>We have all sorts of tremendous artists and we must protect their interests and property rights. Whether we are talking about people in the music business, film industry, writers or economic activity linked to the software industry, we needed to update the existing legislation and we have now done that. Thanks to our work, modern legislation will now be in place and that was my ambition in introducing the Bill.</P>
      <P>When I became Minister of State three years ago and saw the agenda, including labour, trade and consumer affairs &ndash; three very active areas &ndash; I saw this Bill as one of the greatest challenges of all. I have been to the House already to introduce labour legislation on trade union recognition and I will be brining more Bills before the House, but this Bill was always going to be the most complex.</P>
      <P>Senators have helped me greatly by bringing their own expertise to the debate. I came to the House originally with a good Bill, but I am convinced that it is now a better one following its passage through the Seanad. On my own behalf and that of the Government, I wish to thank everybody for having helped me in getting the legislation through all Stages.</P>

      <P>I am not too sure exactly what Senator Norris wanted to say about Tibet this morning. It is an area of the world that I have an interest in, but I feel the Dalai Lama has been deified by various people. The Chinese Government has been totally and utterly condemned because of the situation in Tibet. Before the Chinese went in, however, the situation in Tibet was atrocious. It was a feudal system in which certain members of a particular religious society dictated who would become the leader and they brought in these people at three or four years of age.</P>
      <P>I would prefer that this debate would not take place because the Senator who called for it was not in the House when it began.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed that the statements are being taken in this manner. There was confusion about it and to a certain extent it is almost redundant having the matter on the Order Paper in this manner at this time. I was given repeated assurances that No. 23, motions 18 and 19, would be taken, yet they are not being taken. That is a pity because it neutralises what we were trying to do. It is important for us to regard ourselves as a Parliament. We may take decisions here that may advance things slightly beyond what Iveagh House might be comfortable with, but that is the way politics should work and it is certainly the way a parliament should work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say precisely what I want to say without any help from Senator Lanigan.</P>
      <P>The two motions concerned are very important. The first one was passed by the French Government. It states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes:</P>
      <P>Whereas governmental and non-government organisations have reported an increase in political repression and restrictions on religious freedoms in Chinese occupied Tibet in 1999;</P>
      <P>Recognising that bilateral dialogues on human rights with the Government of the People's Republic of China have failed to produce meaningful improvements in the human rights of the Chinese and Tibetan peoples;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> Commending the Government of the United States for introducing a resolution on China at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;</P>
    <P>Calls on the European Union to co-sponsor a resolution on China at the 56th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;</P>
    <P>Expresses strong support for His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Five Point Peace Plan containing the following components: (1) transformation of the whole of Tibet into a zone of peace; (2) abandonment of China's population transfer policy; (3) respect for the Tibetan people's fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms; (4) restoration and protection of Tibet's natural environment; and (5) commencement of earnest negotiations between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama or his representatives on the future status on Tibet.</P>
    <P>I took part in the composition of this motion at a meeting in Brussels and it was also a little difficult. However, we managed to get it through unanimously. It was subsequently passed by the European Parliament and the French Parliament. The House should not be too timorous in passing this resolution. We owe it to a figure such as the Dalai Lama who has struggled peacefully over so many years in an appalling situation for his people for whom the only alternative is violence. We often prate in the House about peace, but we sometimes do little to encourage the most prominent campaigners for peace on the world stage.</P>
    <P>However, there is something we could note and we could send a request that something practical be done for the people of Tibet. Some months ago members of the Sub-committee on Human Rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had an opportunity to meet people from the IMF and the World Bank. We expressed our concerns to them about the developments in Tibet under the Chinese regime and particularly the construction of a large dam project and the resultant movement of substantial sections of the Tibetan and Mongolian populations.</P>
    <P>A critical point is approaching because a decision will be made shortly. Ireland has a representative, Ms Terrie O'Leary, at the World Bank and I ask the House to recommend to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that she be instructed to urge the cancellation of the project. The independent World Bank inspection panel in its report accused the bank of flagrant policy violations in Tibet. The report cites a climate of fear that was inspired among local Tibetan and Mongolian populations, the blatant disregard for minority issues and the inadequate environmental assessment that was carried out.</P>
    <P>The independent inspection panel found that the World Bank violated seven out of ten of its policies in planning the China western poverty reduction project &ndash; CWPRP &ndash; a controversial proposal which would resettle 58,000 Chinese <Col N="1912" /> farmers on Tibetan and Mongol herding lands. The report, which was commissioned by the World Bank in response to international controversy about the project, including the meeting that took place in Kildare House, finds that the bank violated its policies on indigenous peoples, information disclosure, environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, confidentiality, dam safety and pest management. This means that 70% of the cardinal points underlying the World Bank's policy were violated by itself. It is outrageous to permit this project to continue in light of the assessment by the independent group charged with reviewing it by the bank itself.</P>
    <P>The report vindicates the claims of Tibetans and activists who have maintained that the CWPRP will have a negative impact on the local populations and that conducting an adequate social assessment in such a repressive area is impossible. According to the report, the bank failed to take into account minority concerns and when conducting social assessment surveys, blatantly ignored the Tibetan and Mongol populations who would be affected by the project the most. The report states:</P>
    <P>Most striking is the fact that in the entire move-in-area only three Tibetan households were included in the survey. This is in spite of the fact that the project occurs in a Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous region, and the physical infrastructure for the Project (its supply-canals) passes through Tibetan villages.</P>
    <P>None of the 2,411 Tibetan nomads, whose seasonal migrations will be disrupted by the project, was consulted. The people who were interviewed were required to give their names, a violation of bank policy on confidentiality. The report also detailed numerous environmental violations, including an inadequate assessment of the ramifications of doubling the local population and forcibly converting the land to agriculture. This would be highly dangerous in that area because it could lead to desertification.</P>
    <P>The report was delivered to the board of executive directors along with a recommendation from bank staff and a personal letter from bank president, James Wolfensohn. In the letter, Mr. Wolfensohn assured the directors that the project, despite its policy violations, could be fixed. An action plan has been submitted and the board is set to vote on the plan on 6 July 2000. This is why it is so important that the message goes out.</P>
    <P>Mr. Andrew Bryson, director of the Milarepa fund, a non-profit human rights organisation that has lobbied extensively against this project, said: &ldquo;The bank has violated nearly every policy it has in planning this project and now they're trying to tell us that it can be fixed.&rdquo;  He continued: &ldquo;But the project itself is fundamentally flawed. Tibetans and Mongols have made it expressly clear that they view this project as a death sentence. The only logical plan of action, with a report such as this, is to cancel the project outright.&rdquo;<Col N="1913" /> Attempts to fix up the plan behind the scenes will be a continuing disaster.</P>
    <P>The second motion that should have been discussed today, in light of the undertaking so clearly and repeatedly given to me by the Government side that has been broken, states:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs:</P>
    <P>(1) to seek to persuade his EU colleagues to co-sponsor the US resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission currently under way in Geneva; and</P>
    <P>(2) to raise with the Chinese authorities the detention of Mr. Zhao Ming: Trinity College (Changchun City, Jilin Province); Ms. Yan Fang: Dun Laoghaire Senior College (Shenyang City, Liaoning Province); and Mr. Liu Feng, Dun Laoghaire College of Further Education (Dalian City, Liaoning Province), all formerly resident in Ireland, who were arrested merely for engaging in Falun Gong meditation practices.</P>
    <P>It says much if a political authority can be threatened by the practice of Falun Gong whose principles are peace, harmony and meditation. It is a matter of shame for me that, although Trinity College employed one of those persons and was written to, it appears to have done nothing whatsoever about it. A fear of China's economic might is probably the reason.</P>
    <P>Anybody who takes that line should look at the analysis produced by the London School of Economics and two of its senior professors concerning the current financial situation of China. It is in this respect, as in so many other respects, merely a paper tiger. For example, in Taiwan, it threatened all types of war, murder and bloodshed if the Taiwanese elected a particular person president. However, when he was elected, it entered negotiations immediately.</P>
    <P>We should stand up on a matter of principle. Ireland in particular should do this because it supported Tibet honourably in its darkest days in the 1950s. It also even handedly sponsored the inclusion of what was then known as Red China in the United Nations. Ireland has a certain moral authority in this area and I hope the House will take a strong line on this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope we will return to this matter properly and in an orderly manner, not during a maelstrom of business being rushed through the House on the last day. I would have been grateful if the original undertaking to take motions 18 and 19 instead of statements had been honoured. This was done successfully in the past and it helped to push out the borders with regard to East Timor. In the meantime, we should act on the requests from within the funding agencies as well as from Tibet support groups, etc. We should try to insist that the current project regarding Tibet and China is withdrawn and cancelled in its entirety. The board of the bank should not allow management to try to <Col N="1914" /> fix the problems with the project but should cancel it outright. No amount of tinkering around the edges will fix the fundamental flaws in the project design, nor can it adequately address the climate of fear that pervades the project region and will continue to undermine the principle of full and informed consultation.</P>
    <P>If this project were to go forward it would demonstrate to the international community that the bank lacks the commitment to enforce its own policies and standards. It would result in increased public and governmental scrutiny of other bank projects in China and elsewhere, particularly those that involve resettlement, and it would put an international stamp of approval on China's policy of population transfer into occupied Tibet.</P>

      <P>The Committee on Foreign Affairs has decided that a delegation will visit Tibet on 14 September for five days. I am not a member of that delegation but, perhaps, we should wait until after that visit to reassess the situation there. We should ask for meetings with the Dalai Lama. He said four days ago he would begin consultations with the Chinese Government on the situation in Tibet. Perhaps he is doing so because he has two possible successors, although I do not know the politics of that area. Perhaps we can discuss this subject as early as we can once we have the report of the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>

      <Col N="1915" /> I have no sympathy for the Dalai Lama or his sponsors. As regards China and its human rights violations, it is not too long since we were involved in human rights violations.

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue which has been discussed in the House on a previous occasion and in international fora, including the United Nations and the EU. We should not take it lightly. We are talking about a group of people in Tibet who are part of a nation. A nation is made up of people with a similar language, religion, culture and tradition.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to whether this is a legally recognised state. It was an independent entity until 1949 or 1950. However, it lost that status when the Chinese invaded it and suppressed its people. The recognition of a country as a state should not be based on subjective but on legal criteria. That depends on whether the state has a government which people can recognise and whether it can conduct foreign relations with other international countries.</P>
      <P>We must examine the situation in Tibet. What has happened in Tibet since the Chinese occupation in 1949 or 1950 has not been pleasant. Religious practice has been suppressed by the Chinese and more than 6,000 monasteries have been destroyed. Strict laws have been implemented in relation to rebuilding those monasteries. Limits have also been set in terms of the number of monks and nuns who can live in them.</P>
      <P>There is a history of suppression which could be equated with what happened in this country many years ago. As a small nation, we should use our position in the EU and the United Nations to ensure this situation is examined with a view to stopping what is happening there at present.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan said Tibet is a feudal society. It may not be our preferred system but we have no right to impose that on anyone. If it is the wish of the people of Tibet to return to the type of system they had prior to 1950, they should be allowed to do so under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case to be answered. Although we are only a small member state of the European <Col N="1916" /> Union, we are in a position to raise this issue within the EU and to insist that it brings influence to bear on the international community. The Government should urge the EU to co-sponsor the United Nations resolution with the American Government. I commend the American Government for taking this action. There is an onus on us to ensure the EU follows suit.</P>
    <P>We should not be quick to jump to conclusions about the Dalai Lama and his system in Tibet. The invasion and suppression to which the people have been subjected by the Chinese over the years should be condemned. We should not support the Chinese Government's policy of settling Chinese people in Tibet with the long-term objective of diluting the influence of the Tibetan culture because it is contrary to international agreements, protocols and United Nations conventions.</P>
    <P>A delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs will shortly visit China at the invitation of the Chinese Ambassador. It should raise this issue with the Chinese authorities. The delegation should also visit Tibet to see at first hand what is happening there. It is a remote and, perhaps, inaccessible area but, as part of an international community we have a moral responsibility towards it. We have as much right and responsibility as anyone else to exercise that moral authority. I hope the Irish Government will take that on board at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate, in finishing the business of the House this session, that we have ranged over such a wide variety of subjects today and that we should travel as far away as Tibet to conclude our proceedings. It indicates the extent of the interest of this House in internal and external matters.</P>
      <P>The two resolutions proposed by Senators Norris and Ross in relation to China and Tibet are appropriate and necessary in that they are at the cutting edge of fundamental human rights. We must remember that the People's Republic of China does not have a desirable reputation on human rights, either in respect of its own citizens or other nationals. In demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, a large number of students were viciously trampled, killed and injured in the pursuit of liberty and basic rights for the Chinese people, and many other Chinese people have been involved in that pursuit. We have seen the arrest and suppression of members of Falun Gong, which has members here in Ireland, throughout Europe and in China itself. China has used a great degree of suppression against its own citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a simple fact that Tibet was occupied by the Chinese half a century ago. Those of us in this country have a memory of the reality of occupation by a foreign power, and it behoves us to be particularly sensitive to the suffering of a small nation in very similar circumstances. The proposals made by the Dalai Lama on political and religious reform are excellent in attempting to <Col N="1917" /> bring about a resolution to the problem. Tibet would be made a peace zone and the disgraceful population transfer policy would be ended.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by Senator Lanigan's remarks to the effect that the authorities in the People's Republic of China are operating in a reasonable fashion, particularly in relation to the shift of population to a much smaller country. It will be only a short time until the Tibetan population has been disproportionately diminished and the Chinese population increased. As a result of that, the Chinese authorities will say that Tibet is largely Chinese. That is an artificial way of dealing with the question of sovereignty. Senator Lanigan would have taken the position of the Palestinians to heart in relation to the Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory which was seen, and which he would see, as occupied Palestinian territory. On many occasions in this House he staunchly protested against that very undesirable policy perpetrated by the Israelis in relation to another oppressed people.</P>
    <P>The whole area of human rights has been to the fore in terms of the operation of the Chinese authorities. When our former President, Mary Robinson, sought the position of United Nations High Commissioner, the Chinese authorities, through their representative on the Security Council of the United Nations, opposed it simply because Mary Robinson had espoused, when she was President and a Senator, the cause of Tibet. They opposed her nomination to that very important human rights position in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We need a fresh approach. The Chinese authorities must negotiate directly with the Dalai Lama and establish a situation whereby Tibet could get its own sovereignty. The Chinese authorities should respect both the fundamental rights of the Tibetan people and their sovereignty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because my colleagues have made all the important points. Some years ago I attended a meeting in Beijing with an interparliamentary union group. As Senators know, the Panchen Lama is a very important person in Tibet. When he was recognised years ago by the Buddhist community in Tibet, he was a small child, only three years old. He and his family were taken by the Chinese authorities to China. Some years later, the Chinese authorities decided that another child was in fact the new Panchen Lama. When I was in Beijing I asked about the whereabouts and the circumstances of both Panchen Lamas, and I did not get a satisfactory answer. I was told that both they and their families were well but when I asked if it would be possible to see them, I was told that was not possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In concluding these statements today, I hope that this country, whose Constitution cherishes the children of the nation, will cherish the children of the Tibetan nation who need to be cher<Col N="1918" /> ished too. I ask that we try to discover better particulars on the Chinese Panchen Lama and the original Panchen Lama, who was chosen by his own people, in terms of where they are living and the circumstances under which their families are being enabled to bring them up.</P>

A total of <Col N="1919" /> 500 houses have been built in the past four years and there are major plans for expansion in development. A total of 400 units of accommodation are planned for Pelletstown and development is planned for the Phoenix Park Racecourse&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is always a downside when the country is doing well. We must provide the necessary facilities and the amenities as well as the built environment. While an inordinate amount of residential development is planned for Pelletstown and the Phoenix Park Racecourse area, which are part of the same parish, major developments have taken place in recent years, including the Riverstown development and developments in the surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>As a result the school is bursting at the seams. It has a changing room that is currently used as a classroom and as a resource room. This school requires three extra classrooms immediately. The number of pupils enrolled will warrant the provision of an extra classroom teacher in September. The existing number of students warrants the provision of an extra classroom. The school requires a classroom for the visiting resource teacher, Mrs. Flynn. It requires a multi-purpose room for parents and various activities.</P>
      <P>I am sure that even by this time next year a further one or two additional classrooms will be required because of the nature of the expansion of the school. If arrangements for the provision of additional classrooms for that school are not fast-tracked to meet the immediate requirements, the requirements will have doubled by this time next year.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's Department is in a position to speed matters up depending on their degree of urgency. Given that there is no shortage of funding available, there should no problem in providing the best educational and classroom facilities for the students concerned. The staff in the school are conscientious and they have requested extra classrooms in the normal fashion, but they are concerned they will not be provided in time to meet the need that exists.</P>
      <P>That is at the basis of my request. I urge the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure that all the necessary work will be carried out during the summer to ensure bright and shiny classrooms await the bright new students in September as they enter their next year of education.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science regarding the provision of additional accommodation at St. John Bosco Senior Boys' School, Navan Road, Dublin.</P>
      <P>The current staffing level of the school includes a principal, 15 assistant teachers, a remedial teacher and a shared resource teacher. The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the management authorities of the school seeking grant assistance towards additional permanent classrooms and ancillary accommodation.</P>
      <P>This application is being examined in the context of a range of factors, including proposed housing development and the capacity of other schools in the general area. This examination will enable our Department to establish the likely pattern of future enrolments and, in that way, to determine the amount of school accommodation required. If necessary, the school authorities may apply to the Department of Education and Science for the provision of temporary accommodation for the short term.</P>
      <P>The Senator will appreciate that there is a large number of school building projects on hand within our Department. Because of the priority this Government has given to reversing the neglect of our primary schools evident previously, the spending Estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increasing by an unprecedented 186% from the 1997 budget allocation. In addition, we have reduced significantly the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that the application by the management authorities of St. John Bosco Senior Boys' National School will be processed as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>To the Acting Chairman, the Assistant Clerk of the House, the staff and Members of the House, I wish to say how grateful I and my Government colleagues are for the co-operation that has been afforded to us during this session. Members can be assured that the Government intends to ensure there is peace, economic progress and political sustainability in Oireachtas Éireann for at least another year and we will review the matter this time next year. I wish the House a very good summer recess.</P>
