    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. On No. 1, Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, Second Stage will be resumed. Each Senator will continue to have eight minutes for their contributions. However, I propose to give the proposer of the Bill ten minutes in which to reply instead of the usual five minutes. No. 2, statements on the new national agreement, resumed, to be taken from 1.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4 p.m. Business shall be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. May I have an assurance from the Leader that if Second Stage of No. 1 finishes today and is passed, it will not be referred to any other committee but to a committee of the House as is normal with Bills here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the Lee case in the Supreme Court yesterday, but the contents of the case do not matter. In the course of judgment the Oireachtas was criticised for its failure to remedy defects in legislation, in other words, to find remedies to legislation which has been found unconstitutional. It has emerged, according to Government sources, that no system or procedure exists for reviewing legislation which has been found unconstitutional. Apparently each Department is asked to deal with it, but that has not been done. There is a problem for which we, as Members of the Oireachtas, have been severely criticised. I believe the primary responsibility does not lie with the Departments but with the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is the Oireachtas which makes the laws and, if found to be defective, it is our responsibility to remedy these defects. I suggest the responsibility for reviewing legislation which is found to be unconstitutional should be put into the remit of one of our committees or, preferably, that a special joint committee be established to review cases which have been found to be unconstitutional. The criticism of the Houses of the Oireachtas made yesterday in the Supreme Court is valid and we have a responsibility to see how <Col N="506" /> we can meet that criticism. Perhaps the Leader would convey this to the Government as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a day when we get notice of the sad news of another elderly person in rural Ireland reaching an untimely and violent death, would it be appropriate to have a discussion here? I do not mean a reactive discussion about more laws or zero tolerance but ways in which the community can be strengthened to support independent elderly persons who want and are well able to live on their own. There is a sense of fear among elderly persons. If it is only to send out a signal that we care and are concerned, it would be a job well done. Certain things have been done in the past few years. This is not an occasion to have a go at the Government but it is a way in which we could consider how we can give strength to local communities and the elderly to communicate with each other with a view to putting safety procedures in place. In this case the woman, like the Cathaoirleach, was a member of my union, was active as a retired teacher and gave much to the community. I do not wish to dwell on the details of the case. In each case somebody will know the person and see that person as part of the community. I wish we could do something to strengthen rural communities to support such people in this day and age when people want to live independently.</P>
      <P>In the past week Members will have received notification from the Committee on Members' Interests about the review of Oireachtas committees and allowances. We do not want people whingeing in two years' time about what came out of the allowance. Only two people have responded with views on what should be put forward. If people have something to say let us hear it. Now is the time to respond, not in two years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning points about the Supreme Court decision in relation to the Coroners Act, where it found the Oireachtas had been deficient in addressing areas of defective legislation. Once the Supreme Court makes that ruling, it is time for us to ensure the provision of a mechanism to remedy matters. We have a responsibility to close the loopholes we have allowed to develop over the years.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the alarming admission that a third children's hospital took various organs, without the parents' permission, from patients who died there? This matter is causing considerable concern. Temple Street hospital is in the news today, admitting it was involved in taking the pituitary glands of children without their parents' permission over an 11 year period. A matter of that nature and significance should be discussed by the House with the relevant Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the new Minister for Health and <Col N="507" /> Children on the nursing shortage? There has been a great deal of publicity about this recently. Last year there were 5,000 applicants for nursing positions, only 1,100 of whom were offered places. Thousands of Irish girls are forced to go to England, Wales and Scotland for their nursing education. They can qualify in other countries but they cannot qualify here. I urge the Minister to examine the education requirements because nursing is more of a vocation than a profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, did not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole criterion for a nursing place is points achieved in the leaving certificate. This is not adequate because nurses require other qualities to be successful. The vast majority of nurses have an average leaving certificate but they got on very well in nursing and are doing an excellent job. Unless we tackle the education criteria and move away from the notion of leaving certificate points, this crisis will deepen and continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Leader is considering having a debate on Northern Ireland, following a request made yesterday. It would be of benefit to focus in such a debate on the question of the cross-Border institutions, particularly in the area of food, which is close to my heart. Dr. Patrick Wall spoke last night in Belfast &ndash; I commend his words to the House for consideration &ndash; on the question of maintaining and enhancing the reputation of Irish food. It is clearly of benefit to North and South for such an institution to focus on that. This House could play a valuable part by considering that.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole on the need to identify how neighbourhoods and communities can protect themselves. Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert schemes can be organised by communities themselves without having to ask a great deal from the Government. However, it is a question of reminding people what can be done to help avoid the problems Senator O'Toole described.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform my grave concern about an event that happened in a court in Kanturk yesterday? A young woman solicitor, who was acting as an advocate in a family law case, was charged with contempt of court, arrested, held in Garda custody for almost an hour, convicted of contempt of court and fined £2. Did the alleged incident merit this draconian measure? Did the judge&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be very careful in relation to the comments we make on decisions of the courts, in that we must always bear in mind the separation of powers.</P>

    <Col N="508" />
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="ÜfcMiss Quill ÜfcMiss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand that but I want to pursue this question. Did the judge consider that a conviction of this nature could prevent this young solicitor from reapplying for a certificate of fitness to practise and that, by so doing, he could have destroyed her livelihood? Did he consider that when he was making his judgment? The two people in question are solicitors. Was there any other manner in which this difficulty &ndash; if there was a difficulty &ndash; could have been dealt with, rather than by the draconian measure I described? It is important that I raise this issue here. I can accept bizarre decisions and eccentric utterances but I had to raise this issue&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has no function in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I merely ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader update the House on the proposed new single regulatory authority for financial institutions because Government thinking on this matter is unclear? Will he outline if it is intended to subsume the Central Bank? If not, how will it interlink, if at all, with the Central Bank? This matter is too important to allow fuddled Government thinking on it continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is debate at the moment on where cigarettes should be smoked. Can we have a debate on this matter, which would include all drugs, including alcohol, which is the most lethal legalised drug? The advertising of alcohol should be banned. One drinks company spends £6 million on advertising. Given our serious problem with alcohol abuse among youths, advertising of alcohol should be completely banned.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on the composition of cigarettes. Companies are deliberately putting addictive materials in cigarettes. Tobacco on its own is not so bad, the problem is the materials added to it. The materials listed in a recent newspaper were scandalous. Given the number of people marching about health issues, it is time we marched on those big companies to stop this activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that in the past two days senior colleagues in this House have raised questions about the legislative role of this House and the Oireachtas. The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, referred yesterday to the Shannon River Council Bill and today he and Senator O'Toole referred to Supreme Court judgments. Perhaps the Leader or the Cathaoirleach could give guidance on the role of the Oireachtas committees and their relationship with Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language, along with Senator Ó Murchú and some others Members of <Col N="509" /> this House. The select committee is currently taking Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill. I had always assumed that select committees dealt exclusively with the Committee Stage of Bills. However, I discovered in the past two weeks that the committee, and possibly others, has been taking submissions from third parties. Non-elected organisations are making submissions to the select committee exclusively. I feel, as a Member of this House and of the joint committee, that I should have the same right as our colleagues in the other House to hear these submissions. It is a complex question and the whole concept of committees is relatively new to this Parliament, but in some instances they may have been created on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without considering their eventual role.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole is intimately involved in the pay agreements, which have now been widened to include social, economic and political matters rather than simply wage restraint and bargaining. The voluntary sector, known as the fourth pillar, has not only entered these talks &ndash; I refer to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness &ndash; but has also taken a pro-active role in concluding agreements with the Government. There is a danger to the democratic process inherent in that development. I ask the Leader to reply on those two matters. I accept that this is a complex question. Perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might examine this and decide the best way to progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a procedural matter. A select committee of Dáil Éireann has the power to consider legislation referred to it by the Dáil. The terms of reference of a select committee of Seanad Éireann do not include the power to examine legislation. It arises from different Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Cathaoirleach for clarifying the matter but my point is that this concerned outside bodies providing oral submissions to the select committee in the context of the debate on Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader provide a date for the debate which he promised on the question of a national holiday on St. Brigid's day? He could consider Wednesday, 8 March which is International Women's Day. It would be appropriate if he made provision for a short debate on that day &ndash; it would be important to celebrate it.</P>
      <P>Could the Leader refer to the appropriate Minister the question raised on RTE Radio this morning where a garda was quoted as saying that the gardaí in Limerick had been instructed not to apply the litter laws because of pressures from commercial sources? If this is true, does it apply to other cities such as Cork and Dublin? If so, it seems to be an extraordinary subversion of the will of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="510" /> Could there be a debate on the European Union? We have such wide-ranging debates from time to time. It is timely in the light of the situation regarding Austria and the continual remarks by Jörg Haider, including his recent remark that Turks had question marks over them because of their lack of respect for Austrian institutions. He may be right &ndash; perhaps he was thinking of institutions such as Mauthausen concentration camp, which is sufficiently close to Vienna for the citizens to enjoy picnics in its environment.</P>
    <P>I echo the sentiments of my colleagues who expressed concern about the comments made in the Supreme Court about the lack of response by the Oireachtas to certain gaps in the legislation, particularly on the question of compelling people to attend autopsies. Perhaps a proper channel of communication should be opened up between the Judiciary and Parliament so we do not have this embarrassing megaphone diplomacy between the court and Leinster House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Denis O'Donovan in highlighting the acute shortage of nurses. At a recent graduation of nurses in Limerick, at diploma level after two years, only ten of the 49 who were graduating intended to pursue nursing as a career. The rest were to enter teaching and some were to go abroad. Although they are entering nursing, they are not continuing with it. We must discuss this matter with the recently appointed Minister for Health and Children because there are barriers and blockages to this career, relating to the shortage of beds, the waiting lists and the pressures that have not been resolved, despite the nurses' dispute. These present a very bad image of nursing to young people. He must take a pro-active role in the promotion of nursing as a career. Incidentally, there were no males among the 49 graduates, despite pro-active measures to achieve a gender balance.</P>
      <P>I have just attended a meeting of the Committee on Health and Children where a very large deputation from the Southern Health Board discussed the Blood Transfusion Services Board's decision not to continue with the service in Cork. That should be debated with the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the comments made by Mr. McGoldrick of Enterprise Oil to members of Mayo County Council in the past week. Could the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, update us on this gas find off the Mayo coast? Some of us have raised this issue for over two years and eventually we succeeded in the provision of £20 million by Mr. McCreevy for the development of Killybegs Harbour, which was the preferred harbour for on-shore activity by Enterprise Oil. The people of the north-west are concerned there may be some indication that this facility will be developed in Galway. We would like to hear the Minister's reply on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> Could the Leader raise a related matter with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, concerning the actual pipeline from the gas find? I have raised this issue before. There are no gas lines going to the north-west. This would be an ideal opportunity to pipe gas at least to Sligo, for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>A line has been developed as far as Kingscourt and it is only a matter of connecting from Sligo to Kingscourt. Access for the gas to the European market is available already. I would like to be updated on this. There is a gasline coming to Galway and there is no need to connect this line with Galway. It is a very important issue for the inhabitants of the west, particularly those in the north-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on the cross-Border bodies. This would be very positive and useful. A great deal of co-operation has been instituted between the two parts of the island and it would be good to debate something positive. There is an amazing amount of co-operation in the area of health. Senator Quinn stressed what has been done already in the area of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House bring the testing of cars to the attention of the Minister for Environment and Local Government? Older people must leave their cars idle rather than send them for the test because the cost of repairs is considerable and they cannot afford it. There was a scrappage scheme for cars not long ago. It is time that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government brought in a scheme to help those older people. It causes them considerable expense, which they find difficult to afford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Denis O'Donovan, for a debate on nurse shortages. I come from that profession and I would not agree with him that nursing is a vocation. We consider ourselves professionals in our own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that nurses and members of the medical profession should be considered not only on their academic qualifications but on characteristics necessary for that profession. Following the establishment of the Commission on Nursing, this would be a good time for the Minister to update us on developments in the training of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for Health <Col N="512" /> and Children the urgent need for a review of the charges for respite care? Where respite care is available to families and they get a rest from their caring, some health boards are charging those families for that service, which is wrong. It is retrograde and should be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday Senator Finneran sought a debate on access to public transport by wheelchair users. I also support that call. The Cathaoirleach, being from the west, will recognise that the only place that wheelchair users have access to on CIE trains is the dining carriage where they must stay for the whole journey. There are no ramps or facilities for people getting in or out of the train. By virtue of being in these carriages they are probably placing themselves in danger. It is unlikely that the new facilities will be available on the trains if they are not available in a new building such as Heuston Station, where the facilities are totally inadequate, if there at all. I call for a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Bonner's proposal to invite the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to update the House on the gas find off the west coast, particularly on the plans of Enterprise Oil to bring the gas ashore. Enterprise Oil has given a commitment to bring the gas ashore on the coast of County Mayo and I hope nothing will interfere with that plan. I support Senator Bonner's call for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on national primary and secondary routes? It was recently said that the Taoiseach and various Ministers are taking urgent measures to make our road network more streamlined and to have roads constructed more quickly. As the Government has given sole responsibility for our national secondary and primary routes to the National Roads Authority, will the Leader arrange for that body to come to the House and outline its plans for our national routes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked for an assurance about further debate on No. 1. This will take its normal course on Second Stage and will then be debated by a full committee of the House as it progresses. I am sure all Members will welcome this, in view of the long-standing request from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning and Norris expressed their views on yesterday's ruling of the Supreme Court. The Courts Service Act includes a provision to establish a committee to deal with this question and the matter is already in hand. I am assured by Senator O'Donovan that this is the case. If a debate is required I will see that time is allowed for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Quinn called for a debate on community alert measures, following the tragic deaths which have taken place and which were not commonplace until a few years <Col N="513" /> ago. We are all appalled by these horrific deaths. I attribute them to the bad example of television and to the cruelty depicted on that medium which provides ideas for many of these terrible crimes. Of course I will allow time for this matter to be debated.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to the Minister the views of Senator Costello regarding the removal of organs from children who have died, without the consent of their parents. Senators O'Donovan, Jackman and Leonard called for a debate on the shortage of nurses, the difficulty of recruiting nurses and the need to create extra nurse training places. Senator O'Donovan and Senator Leonard, who is very experienced in this profession, have expressed their views strongly. I cannot understand why, if 5,000 students apply to train as nurses, at least 2,500 places cannot be provided. I will allow time for a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Henry called for a debate on the cross-Border bodies. An open-ended debate on Northern Ireland will be held next week and I ask Senators to use this opportunity to express their views on all aspects of this question. The debate need not end next week. One or two Members have told me they will not be available next week and I can allow further time the following week. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed to attend for the debate. On the Order of Business yesterday I said I would inform the House today when the debate would take place. However, events are happening by the hour. I will inform the House of the time of this debate at the beginning of the Order of Business next Wednesday.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the views of Senator Quill regarding the events of yesterday. The matter raised by Senator Coghlan has been passed to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, some of whose members are party colleagues of his.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised a valid point. If the Senator puts his proposal in writing it can be placed on the agenda for the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, with your permission, Sir. Senator Norris called for a debate on 8 March, International Women's Day, on the holding of a national holiday. I will do my best to accede to his request. I will pass on his views on the allegation regarding litter in Limerick to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As you said yesterday, Sir, many matters are raised on the Order of Business which would be more appropriately dealt with in Private Member's time or on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>Senators Bonner and Burke both expressed their concerns regarding the gas find off the coast of County Mayo. I was interested to hear Senator Bonner state that a line now comes to Kingscourt and may have to be continued to Mayo, Galway and Sligo. I am sure that line will come through <Col N="514" /> County Westmeath and I will be very interested in pursuing that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly allow time for a debate on it. Senator Hayes expressed his views on the new car testing measure, which everyone must welcome. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that vehicles are roadworthy. Road safety is vitally important. There are many marketing schemes which include £1,000 to scrap an old car and they provide good value.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the views of Senator O'Dowd to the Minister. Senator Coogan called for an improvement in wheelchair access to public buildings, as Senator Finneran did yesterday. This is something all Members support.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke sought a debate on the National Roads Authority. When the Government came into office in 1987&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 1997. The Leader is not here that long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We also came to power in 1987. In 1997, the Government's first Private Members' time was devoted to a debate on the National Roads Authority. I will be happy to allow time for a discussion on national primary roads and all related matters. The national development plan stipulates that only one contractor may be appointed for all major projects. For instance, one contractor would be appointed for a dual carriageway or motorway from Dublin to Galway and it would not matter where the contract started. Local authority members have an opportunity to begin real investment in their areas immediately, if the land has been acquired. Westmeath County Council has shown a lead in this and the Mary Nea's Bridge and the Mullingar bypass are great examples for other authorities. Local authority members have real power in this area and I urge them to take this opportunity, in the interest of their country. The Government has money to give local authorities if they have acquired the necessary land.</P>

    <Title>Shannon River Council Bill, 1998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said last week when the debate on the Bill commenced, in 1995 when <Col N="515" /> there was severe flooding of the Shannon Deputy Daly, then a Member of this House and one of the most experienced parliamentarians in either House having held eight portfolios, brought before the House with Deputy O'Kennedy, a former Minister and EU Commissioner, a Bill which received the approval of all sides of the House on Second Stage. Senator Manning was then Leader of the House. Deputy Daly had enormous experience of the Shannon having been Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works. The Shannon Navigation Act, 1990, linked the Shannon and the Erne. The Shannon River Council Bill was brought before the previous Seanad. It has now been brought back by Deputy Daly's constituency colleague on the opposite side of the House, Senator Taylor-Quinn, and her colleagues and we are accepting it on Second Stage. In the words of a former parliamentarian, Paudge Brennan, &ldquo;There is never the wrong time to do the right thing&rdquo;. The right thing to do is to accept this Bill. The Shannon touches 13 counties &ndash; half the counties in Ireland. It is a great national resource that has never been utilised to its full potential. This Bill proposes appointing a council with total responsibility for developing the Shannon from a tourism and industry point of view, not to mention making it practical for people to remain farming along the banks of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>There are 26 local authorities with responsibility for various matters relating to the Shannon. This Bill makes common sense. People in the Shannon area presented me with a short submission from 1986 which I in turn gave to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, last week. Those people commissioned a report from an eminent engineer which stated that at least 30 per cent, and perhaps up to 40 per cent, of the flooding could be alleviated with a five year plan which would cost no more than £50 million. We want this council put in place, as it can then appoint experts who will review and investigate the possibilities of reducing Shannon flooding.</P>
      <P>Does anyone realise the hardship involved in having one's home flooded? I visited the flooded area at the end of December and it was heartbreaking to see people having to be evacuated in agricultural vehicles and not being able to go home for 14 days, especially as it was happening at Christmas when their families were home from the UK, America and Australia. It is impossible for them to continue in farming as previous generations of their families have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flooding has been very high only in recent years. The increase in the water level in Lough Ree this year was seven feet two inches. This is unbelievable, as seven feet two inches of rain did not fall. What is happening? Water is being stopped by various organisations, such as the ESB, for their own interests. In the interests of everyone living in the Shannon area and on a non-political basis, we in Seanad Éireann call on the Government to allow the Shannon River <Col N="516" /> Council to be appointed so that a planned strategy can be put in place for the Shannon. As Governments of all political parties have neglected to do this, let us start the 21st century with a co-ordinated council in place which can come to the Houses for funding for projects. We will not be found wanting if it does so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and assure the House that we on the Government side will lend our full support to it on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Leader's warm and open comments on the Bill. Once we conclude Second Stage today I appeal to him to make time available in coming weeks &ndash; the week after next, if possible &ndash; for Committee and Report Stages. He can be assured that nothing will be done on this side of the House to retard the Bill's progress.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a great initiative from the Seanad, though it is obvious there are Members on the Government side who are not enthusiastic about it. That was reflected in the contribution made last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, which was quite ambivalent. This initiative strengthens the usefulness and relevance of the House and we could not do a better day's work than deal with all Stages of this Bill and send it to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The need for a Shannon River Council is an unanswerable case. The Shannon is the largest river catchment in Great Britain and Ireland; there are approximately 70,000 hectares in the catchment area, mostly in the midlands and in the north. There have been controls on the Shannon for over 200 years and two bodies &ndash; the ESB and the Office of Public Works &ndash; have a major influence on the flows and levels of the Shannon. The ESB's authority dates back to an enactment in the 1920s relating to the Ardnacrusha power station because it needs levels in Lough Derg to be such as to allow adequate hydraulic pressure to drive the turbines there. The Office of Public Works is the other major player and has a statutory role relating to maintenance of and navigation on the Shannon.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees that the lock system on the Shannon is the problem. The ESB uses its locks to control flows and for water storage in the major lakes for hydro-electric purposes and the Office of Public Works also operates locks. Those locks are antiquated and to my knowledge they were all installed in the 19th century. They are manually operated and some take at least one day to commission and almost one day more to reopen. It is surely totally unsatisfactory that these control systems should be so antiquated and that they have not changed since the 19th century. This Bill proposes bringing together all bodies with a major interest in the Shannon on a council which would form policy on the running of the river on a day to day or month to month basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers have a major interest in this matter. I referred to the 70,000 hectares in the catchment <Col N="517" /> area. During the September and December floods last year most of the flood plain was flooded, causing enormous damage to agriculture in the Shannon catchment area. Approximately 73 per cent of the land in that catchment area is grassland and a very high proportion of that &ndash; probably 60 per cent to 70 per cent &ndash; was flooded in December and over 50 per cent was inundated in the September flood. There were huge losses in grassland that was being kept for silage, harvesting and so on, particularly in September, and many farmers had a complete loss of stored fodder or silage in December when their sheds and outhouses were completely inundated in an unprecedented experience for some of them. Everybody accepts that the control of the locks has a bearing on the lateral spread of water in times of flooding. Many people feel that neither the ESB nor the Office of Public Works acts with any sensitivity to agricultural interests. It is important that a strong agricultural voice should be elected to any council. Dúchas, the ESB and the Office of Public Works must also be represented.</P>
    <P>There must be a co-ordinated approach by all of the parties which have a major interest in the River Shannon. We all agree that a major arterial drainage programme cannot solve the problem. I was interested to note in the Official Report of last week's proceedings that Senator Mooney spoke about his father, an old friend of mine and a former Member of this House. He recalled a lady saying to him one day, &ldquo;We'll come and say a prayer for Mr. de Valera and for the drainage of the River Shannon&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the council is established, it should represent all the interested parties and should have the necessary resources to carry out its work. One of the problems with the river is that there is no channel clearance or maintenance. Machines are not deployed to de-silt the river. Silting is a major problem. In places such as Lanesborough and Tarmonbarry, one can observe rapidly expanding silt banks because the <Col N="518" /> slow current constantly carries silt from Bord na Móna operations. The silt expands into islands and blockages in the main river channel. No action has been taken to remove these blockages which have a detrimental effect on the flow of the river which, in turn, begins to flood.</P>
      <P>Fifty years ago, some 14 per cent of land in the Shannon catchment comprised raised peat bogs, the finest example of such bogs anywhere in the world. Bord na Móna has now removed most of those bogs which, prior to their removal, acted as giant sponges which held millions of cubic feet of rainwater and released it slowly into the system. Now the rainfall drains into land channels which, in turn, quickly drain into the main stem of the River Shannon resulting in flooding. The removal of the bogs, nature's way of controlling water disposal, was a very shortsighted policy. Nothing was put in place to deal with the problems which would result from their removal.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna operations result in millions of tonnes of silt being deposited in the river every year. The fall between Lough Ree and Killaloe is only a few metres, yet that is the stretch of river in which the highest proportion of silt is unloaded and accumulates. It is very important that the council, when established, should not just be a talking shop but should have the resources to tackle problems in the river channel and ensure the river flows properly.</P>
      <P>At present, 3 per cent of the Shannon's land catchment is under forestry and that percentage is increasing rapidly. Trees are often planted on cutaway bogs. It is important that a policy be developed to deal with the effects of forestry on river systems in contrast to the absence of policy in regard to the removal of the peat bogs. Forestry pollution can have a major influence on waterways and rivers. Twenty-five years ago, Lough Ree was one of the cleanest lakes in Ireland but it is now heavily eutrophic and severely polluted as a result of the disposal of industrial waste, agricultural phosphates and sewage.</P>
      <P>Until recently, very few towns in the Shannon catchment had a proper waste water treatment programme. It is important that water treatment systems are modernised and upgraded, east and west of the Shannon. For up to 50 miles in many cases east and west of the Shannon, all waste water flows towards the river. There is a great deal more I would like to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see this very important Bill before the House. We are very fortunate to be able to introduce a Bill such as this as it is not often that a country is in a position to establish a council for a major river and its tributaries. It is extraordinary that a council has not been established before now. When one considers the disasters which occur on the Continent with rivers in one country causing difficulties in other countries, one realises it is a privilege to be able to monitor the Shannon's tributaries. The Tisza which flows through Romania was badly polluted by a spillage from a Romanian cyanide mine <Col N="519" /> recently. That has had serious effects on the Danube's water, thereby affecting countries which are very remote from the Tisza.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat concerned that a great deal of the debate on the Shannon has focused on the flooding of the areas around it. Naturally, the impetus on this issue has come from farmers whose land has been flooded. We must pay greater heed to the geographical and geological studies which have been carried out which show that it is virtually impossible to make flooded areas flood-free. Studies carried out around Gort, where the land is karst limestone, have revealed that some of the turloughs are connected underground to the Atlantic, thereby making it impossible for drainage to occur.</P>
      <P>I was not in favour of the unilateral action taken by farmers to drain their land. I do not think it made any difference when there was flooding this year and they may have caused a great deal of ecological damage by creating a channel into bays with a considerable amount of shellfish. This has been to the detriment of those farmers.</P>
      <P>Flooding cannot be solved by the construction of major drains. We have read the reports which initially suggested it was due to plastic hay covers in drains. However, it was found to be connected to the fact that these were either flood plains or connected to the Atlantic Ocean. It is important to remember that Holland and Germany, where the most amazing structures have been created to enable them to narrow rivers and build on flood plains, have also experienced serious flooding in the past ten years. It is impossible in many cases to control the amount of water which flows into some of these rivers. Senator Connor spoke about how nature's way of controlling water has been greatly changed by man. This is a valid point which must be taken into account. It is impossible to control some elements and we must be careful about this.</P>
      <P>One issue which I hope the council will seriously examine when it is established is the appalling pollution in the Shannon basin which is occurring for numerous reasons. As Senator Connor said, some towns still have no proper sewage treatment plants or water supply schemes. It is ridiculous that in 2000 we do not have proper sewage treatment when we have known for decades the damage done by the emptying of raw or semi-treated sewage into rivers. With the money that is now available, I urge that councils are given the funding to undertake these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also be concerned about private water schemes. I recently read a report which stated that 50 per cent of private water schemes in the west are infected by e.coli. In a large number of cases this is due to improperly situated septic tanks or too many of them in an area. One frequently reads of houses being granted permission for septic tanks where it was unwise to place them. I have a great deal of sympathy for councillors who are abused by the public because <Col N="520" /> they will not give planning permission. They know it would be unsuitable to build more houses in an area. They are abused because naturally people wish to build houses in the countryside. However, one must remember that an area can become overloaded with septic tanks. They affect private water schemes which can result in serious damage. Uncontrolled spreading of slurry can also affect private water schemes. Harsher measures should be implemented to prevent people spreading slurry in certain circumstances, particularly when it is raining and it is obvious it will flow straight into the nearest waterway and then into local streams, causing great problems.</P>
    <P>The eutrophication of our lakes has been constantly referred to. While inadequate sewerage schemes in some towns are an important consideration, so is the over-spreading of phosphates, which is still taking place. Teagasc was supposed to measure phosphate and nitrate levels in farms and advise farmers of the necessity not to spread more phosphates. I have not heard or seen much of that. Reports suggest that in some areas phosphates or nitrates do not need to be spread for five years because there is such an over-abundance. This must be considered.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is an important asset as regards tourism. The fact that our major lakes, which were so clean some years ago, are now so dirty it is impossible to swim in them will become well known rapidly. This also applies to the deterioration of our fishing. These significant assets are not being given sufficient attention. The control of silting is important as regards boating which has not been as prosperous in the past few years as it was previously. The difficulties people have had with navigation have significantly contributed to the fact that people are not coming here as much.</P>
    <P>New difficulties have arisen on the Shannon which must be addressed. Every day that goes by without addressing them creates more problems. The spread of the zebra mussel began ten years ago at the estuary. However, now they have crept a considerable distance up the river. We need to look at these new problems, including the development of cyanobacteria in some areas of the lakes. This has serious implications for people and livestock. These are the problems which I hope the council will undertake to resolve as soon as it is established. I hope this Bill will have a speedy passage through the Seanad and Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel like a fraud in attempting to discuss this issue, having listened to previous speakers who have a great knowledge of and affection for the Shannon. I do not live on its doorstep so I do not experience the problems associated with it. I know from travelling across the country, however, what a phenomenal asset it is to the country and that it has been under-utilised over the years. We must look at what can be done to ensure the reversal of the damage which is spoiling such a wonderful waterway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> This Bill was initially introduced in this House by the then Opposition Senators, Deputies Daly and O'Kennedy. This possibly demonstrates that introducing Private Members' Bills is helpful in moving out of this House to the upper one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lower House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Lower House, with higher pay. I compliment the former Senators on their commitment in introducing this Bill. I also compliment the then Government, of which we were part, which allocated time to debate this Bill. This demonstrates that both sides of the House are genuinely committed to the preservation, enhancement and utilising of the Shannon. Speakers have raised issues regarding this river and suggested how it is possible to reverse some of the damage.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor spoke about the lip-service paid by the Government, when in Government and in Opposition, about how it would drain the Shannon. I recall one wit saying that if we could reverse all the blowing the Government did about draining the Shannon, it would have been sucked out long ago. However, I do not think arterial drainage, to the degree to which Senators have referred, can be undertaken on the Shannon. I know the Minister said the flooding could be due to the worst rains in 50 years. However, as has been referred to in this House and as is pointed out in newspapers daily, the effect of global warming will result in more rain. This problem will not be solved by us saying it will be another 50 years before it happens again. We must recognise that it can happen continuously.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the flooding in Gort, which is in my constituency. We are aware of the difficulties experienced by farmers there. The damage to houses was irreparable and people could not live in them. This is due in no small way to the limestone base and the fact that water cannot be carried away. There may be an element of this in the Shannon but the truth is that there are a number of reasons for this flooding. Senator Connor spoke about the removal by Bord na Móna of the bogs which acted as a natural sponge for soakage. This means the water must be drained by some other means. When passing over the bridge in Athlone, one will notice the river continuing to spread away from the centre and on to good farming land which cannot be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Senators O'Toole, O'Meara and Taylor-Quinn on introducing the Bill. I recall many years ago when studying social policy coming across an interesting issue relating to the waste of resources. It involved two local authorities and did not relate to the River Shannon; it involved another river. In this case one local authority owned a weed killer which collected gravel and weeds and did drainage work also. The second local authority rented a machine while the other was lying there for 11 months of the year and not being used. I am talking about the proper use of resources. A body such as the Shannon <Col N="522" /> River Council could make proper use of resources because it would be aware of the facilities and machinery available along the river. It would perhaps have a right to decide what machinery to utilise. It would be able to oversee local authorities and say to them, &ldquo;You do not need to buy a machine because one is already available. We will draw up a scheme for a year.&rdquo;  The council should be given proper financial resources &ndash; I would double the allocation of £10 million in the initial stages &ndash; to enable it to buy the machinery. A plan could be drawn up and the machinery could be allocated to each local authority. This would alleviate double resourcing. There would be just one resourcing which would be properly planned and maintained.</P>
    <P>There was reference to pollution. I drew up a list of rivers to acertain the degree of pollution in each one. I asked for a report to be drawn up but this has not happened. This indicates the high degree of pollution in every river, not just in the Shannon. The causes for this are well known. It would be wonderful if the Minister of State could say how many pipes are carrying raw sewage into the Shannon without being properly treated, and I am not talking about secondary treatment but about tertiary treatment. Septic tanks and slurry pits were referred to. I was speaking to someone who has some knowledge about concrete and how it can deteriorate over time. This person told me that within 20 years of the establishment of a concrete base it begins to leak. All slurry pits and septic tanks leak if they are more than 20 years old. Each year they continue to deteriorate, leading to more and more leakage. I am not blaming those who installed them. I am sure at the time they thought it was a permanent job and that they were doing the right thing. However, they do not work properly after 20 years. The person to whom I spoke, who has a deep and abiding knowledge of this matter, said that the water is being polluted as a result of this leakage.</P>
    <P>Some Members spoke about eutrophication and zebra mussels. It is true that initially zebra mussels were found at the mouth of the estuary. Now they have crept into the estuary and into some of the tributaries also. This ensures that fishing on the Shannon, which was a wonderful tourist attraction, has almost disappeared. There are no trout to be found and if the zebra mussels continue to extend along the Shannon, there will be no pike, leading to no fishing on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I am familiar with Lough Corrib. Most of the restocking of fisheries is done by the fishermen's associations, clubs, etc. A restocking programme could be part of a plan whereby each local authority would give a commitment to restock particular rivers at particular times.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and the Government for accepting it and I am sure more time will be given to this issue in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate and the Leader of the House for allowing additional Government time <Col N="523" /> this morning to conclude Second Stage. The debate has been extremely important and productive in outlining the urgent need to establish the Shannon River Council. The contributions reflect very strong views on all sides of the House which must be incorporated in the Bill. It is important that amendments are tabled on Committee Stage. Members on this side of the House will be tabling amendments but we will welcome also amendments from the Government side to strengthen the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that this course of action had to be taken. This side of the House repeatedly sought Government time to debate the Bill. Eventually we were forced to introduce it in Private Members' time. This was dealt with last Wednesday night. Earlier that day, it was indicated to us that the Government parties would be voting down the Bill. On further reflection, they reconsidered their position and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, suggested the Bill would be referred to the Committee on Public Enterprise for consideration and detailed examination with a view to making clear recommendations to Government on the exact method of bringing this important matter to finality. I am pleased the Government saw the light and has come to its senses on this matter. It has now decided to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage through the normal course. I invite the Government to table amendments to strengthen the Bill further.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the contributions of Senators that many are concerned about problems relating to the Shannon from its source in County Leitrim to the mouth of the Shannon between Loop Head and Kerry Head. The council will have specific authority from County Leitrim right down to the mouth of the Shannon, including all the catchment areas and tributaries.</P>
      <P>The issue of pollution was referred to by a number of Senators. A Lough Ree/Lough Derg report has been drawn up on pollution in the Shannon catchment area. This indicates clearly the increased level of pollution and eutrophication in our rivers between 1971 and 1996. As Senator Connor said, Lough Ree is heavily eutrophic. A number of other rivers and lakes are strongly eutrophic and others are polluted to some degree. This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The problem is a lack of co-ordination between all the bodies with specific responsibility for the River Shannon. These authorities include the county councils, urban district councils, the ESB, Bord na Móna, Teagasc, the Inland Waterways, Office of Public Works and Dúchas. All these bodies have a specific input into the Shannon. As Senator Henry rightly said, the geographical and geological nature of the catchment area of the Shannon varies considerably. The result is that the underground water systems and the actual sources of the water systems have an input, to the advantage or disadvantage of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="524" /> We must recognise that the River Shannon is a wonderful resource and that the river and the livelihoods and general interests of the people in its catchment area must be protected. This can only be done if a body is put in place which is representative of all the various interests. It must also be in a position to force the various authorities to fulfil their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It became evident recently, particularly during the flooding in the Roscommon, Offaly and Westmeath areas and also the River Fergus area, which is another tributary of the River Shannon incorporating the Ennis, Corrofin and Ruan areas in County Clare, that nobody is taking specific responsibility. People are being seriously affected by this problem and this is unsatisfactory and intolerable given the current economic boom. I hope the Bill will assist in that regard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the flooding which occurred over six weeks ago in the areas I mentioned, will the Minister of State ask the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development to take into consideration the plight of the people whose houses and property were damaged? Farmers lost bales of silage and also after-grazing in September because of flooding. I ask the Ministers to show a humanitarian response and to have the Red Cross distribute funding to people who have been seriously affected in financial terms. It is unacceptable that they have been left waiting and that nobody is taking an interest. This is a poor reflection of our social conscience and our Christian attitude to people in distress.</P>
    <P>There is support on all sides for the Bill. A total of 16 Senators contributed to the debate and I thank them for their sound and supportive comments. Strong points were made about the responsibilities which should be vested in the authority and I hope that on Committee Stage amendments will be tabled to strengthen the functions and enforcement powers of the authority. Timeframes under which certain works need to be done should also be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Tourism and fisheries matters must be addressed. Bodies with responsibilities in this area, such as local fishing and angling clubs, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the inland fisheries boards need to be involved and to have an input. I invite those groups to make submissions on their views on the Shannon River Council between now and Committee Stage because it is an important matter. I discussed the canal from Lough Neagh to the River Shannon with Senator Maurice Hayes earlier. It is a wonderful facility and it would be great if eventually there was a successful development from Lough Neagh to Loop Head. This would be highly commendable from a tourism point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development has specific responsibilities. We are delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, is present and I welcome him to the <Col N="525" /> House. He has major responsibility in this area with regard to the Office of Public Works. However, for some reason, it is difficult to get the Office of Public Works to identify its responsibilities. There is always confusion between the Office of Public Works and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which now has the responsibilities of the former Land Commission, and local authorities. It is always difficult to identify who has responsibility at local level when an issue arises in regard to a sluice gate or a flooding problem. I hope this matter can be ironed out on Committee and Report Stages.</P>

I would not like to think that the Office of Public Works is not vested with sufficient powers or that it did not take specific responsibility for the River Shannon. I am sure that, before the Bill concludes, we will do something to ensure the current position is changed. I hope we will get the full support of the Minister of State to that end because I am sure he would welcome additional powers and responsibilities in his Department and additional funding to execute those powers.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for bringing the Bill to this point. I look forward to Committee Stage being taken at an early date so that something concrete can happen locally to improve the lot of the people in the river's catchment area.</P>

    <Title>Programme for Prosperity and Fairness: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. My remarks on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness have not, to date, been very complimentary and I do not intend to vary too far from that vein of thought. I received a copy of the programme by post today, weeks after the deal was done. Members of the Oppo<Col N="526" /> sition are as irrelevant as ever; they are not deemed part of the social partnership. I note the Taoiseach's complimentary remarks in the final paragraph of the foreword to the programme which reads:</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the many people who took part in the negotiations and who worked so hard to bring about this wide-ranging and very ambitious agreement. We in Government look forward to working closely with the social partners in making it a reality.</P>
      <P>Those not consulted were also Members of the Oireachtas. I would like to see that changed so that all social partners and representations from the Opposition would be included in this document. We should ensure we have a wide-ranging debate in advance of future documents being signed.</P>
      <P>The debate last night, like many recently, gave me no great sense of belief that this will be a successful agreement. I note that the ASTI has withdrawn from congress on the matter. A meeting of all teachers unions, held last weekend, condemned the agreement and a large number of grassroot members were very unsupportive of it.</P>
      <P>I noticed during our debate on overseas development aid last night that this programme gave no succour to anybody. While we are maintaining funding and increasing the amount contributed, the percentage increase is not being made <i>pro rata. </i> This is a great shame. We are no closer to reaching the figure of 0.7%, decreed by the United Nations as the appropriate amount of GNP which each member country should spend on overseas development aid than we were when the previous Government left office. That amount was increased four-fold between 1992 and 1997 while it has been increased by only one third in the three years since the current Government took office. A disparity exists in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I commend the process of partnership as the ideal way forward and would like to see it extended to include those currently omitted, I have many problems with the content of the agreement. It is quite lengthy in its documentation and words but is more modest in what it achieves. The proposed 15% wage increase is very modest in the context of the current inflation rate. I gave warning in December about the inflation rate when the Minister proudly predicted in his statement about his prudent fiscal rectitude and the inflation rate increasing by 1.6%. The preliminary figure for 1999 was set at 3.9% and today it is 4%. That is a 350% increase on what it was six months ago. The increase has quite clearly been dramatic in the latter half of this year. Many commentators have said it is not good enough. The Government say this is due to unusual factors such as the increase in the price of cigarettes, oil and petrol. The price of oil and petrol in Ireland is nothing like that in the United Kingdom where it is far more expensive. Anyone living around the Border who travels from North<Col N="527" /> ern Ireland to the South to purchase petrol and diesel will know this.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why tobacco, a dangerous drug, is part of the consumer price index in the context of the basket of goods which make up our inflation rate. The increase in the price of cigarettes was marginal and could not have resulted in fuelling inflation. Much relates to how money is spent. The budget is skewed in favour of the well off and luxury consumer goods are paid for with a currency that is strong against our punt.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with the main thrust of the document. While the wage increases are modest, the aspirations are very strong. I am concerned that, as SIPTU stated yesterday, the programme will have to be reviewed if inflation does not taper off. There is little margin for progress with an inflation rate of 4% and a 5% wage increase. A great deal of this document was compiled on the basis that the Minister for Finance stated there would be a 1.6% increase in inflation over 1999 and that this would hold good for the coming year. An inflation rate three times that mentioned is not very good for those who bought into this deal. I am concerned, given its policies, that the Government is in danger of allowing the economy to overheat and endangering the whole programme of social partnership.</P>
    <P>I said I was worried about the aspirational nature of the agreement and the number of things which are not specific. As in the case of ODA, instead of specifying targets and amounts, it seeks an increase in the substantial gains that have already taken place. There have been no substantial gains in recent years.</P>
    <P>There are some specifics in the area of housing but they are inadequate. According to the programme more money is to be spent on social housing. We note that 22,000 houses will be built by local authorities over a four year period. That is in the region of 5,500 per annum, only 700 more than is currently being provided. That does not meet the need. While the need is escalating all we have is a modulated increase from the Government.</P>

      <P>I am sure he will redress the balance when he gets started. I have to point out the lack of specifics in the document. Where there are specifics they are inadequate in terms of need. It is my job to point them out and if the Senator does not like it he will have an opportunity to say so.</P>
      <P>How long have we been waiting for the housing forum? I have been calling for it since the Government came to office over two and a half years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us the good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, came before this House time and again when the Leader kindly arranged debates on numerous occasions and said there was no need for a housing forum, that the Minister had got it in hand. Two and a half years down the road with a major housing crisis he has agreed to set up a housing forum. Why did he not agree to set it up when it was demanded so that the matter could have been dealt with two and a half years ago? I look forward to seeing how the 20% social housing, provided for in the Bill, pans out. That is one of the most progressive measures the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, has provided but there is a danger, given the opposition from the building and construction industry, that it may be watered down considerably. We do not know yet when that will kick into operation since the Planning and Development Bill is moving slowly.</P>
      <P>In respect of child care and family friendly policies there is a commitment to provide capital funding. That will result in an increased number of child care places. There is also a commitment to the training of child care workers and community groups, all of which are desirable but there is nothing, contrary to the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, in relation to tax breaks for working couples. We know what happened to the Minister's individualisation proposals.</P>
      <P>No national system of pre-school education is suggested, yet the new Minister for Education in the North, where there are limited resources, had no bother in achieving that as his major initiative in a two-month period in the power-sharing body which, sadly, has been suspended. Can something more specific be provided in that area? Child care was one of the areas identified by everybody as one that would be addressed in the budget but it was not, nor was it addressed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, other than as an aspirational target to be dealt with over the three years. We do not know when, how or if it will be dealt with. There is absolutely no indication of specific worthwhile proposals to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What can one say about health care? This has been a disaster area for the Government. Its handling of the health crisis has been disastrous, the same as the housing crisis. There are no specific proposals on health care improvements. One has to acknowledge that in the past two and a half years the Minister has provided a 45% increase in <Col N="529" /> funding for health care but it has literally gone into a black hole. The waiting lists have grown, casualty is impossible and the level and quality of service has deteriorated. There is no proposal in the document for a change in structures. We need a system that will provide a proper health care service for all, irrespective of means. That must replace the current two-tier system where 42% of the population is covered by BUPA or VHI while the other 58% is not covered. The gap in the delivery of services to the two groups is a scandal. There is no proposal to restructure the health service with a view to proper delivery. While it is admirable that the Government should have spent 45% extra over a two year period, it is not good enough that there are no restructuring proposals on health.</P>
    <P>The carers who met all parties yesterday are seeking a full system of non-means tested funding. Perhaps there will be some progress in that area. They are neglected in this document.</P>
    <P>While there was a certain level of rebalancing &ndash; as it was euphemistically put by the trade union movement &ndash; in relation to matters badly addressed by the Minister for Finance in the budget and while the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will have to address that area, the document is short on specifics in the key areas that provide for a caring and civilised society, health and children. Therefore, while I commend the process of social partnership I find it difficult to commend this document to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and to welcome the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In 1986 and 1987 it was not easy being a member of the Oireachtas. I recall Holy Thursday in 1987 as a member of the Midland Health Board when we had to approve cutbacks at a board meeting. That is something I hope I will never have to witness again. At 4.30 p.m. on that Holy Thursday evening, 32 people in my local hospital were given protective notice. There were over 20 cars outside my home, people waiting for me to return and tell them whether those people would keep their jobs. The then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, had taken over from the coalition Administration. Fortunately for those people, they kept their jobs because they were working in the emergency section.</P>
      <P>I opened my address with those remarks to put in context how programmes of social partnership &ndash; which was then known as the national understanding &ndash; have been the main plank of our achievement as a nation from 1987 to date. It has been the big success story of all political parties in Government. I want to acknowledge the intellect of the man who created it, the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. I also want to put on record the name of Michael Mullen, the leader of the trade union movement at that time. Those two men were mainly responsible for putting in place the framework for today's Celtic tiger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> At that time it was not unusual for various sectors of industry to march from Parnell Square, down O'Connell Street to the gates of Leinster House every Wednesday. I do not have to name the big national organisations involved. Thousands of people protested on the streets and hundreds of thousands of working days were lost because of strikes and uncertainty, doom and gloom, lay-offs and emigration.</P>
    <P>Westmeath was in division one of the national hurling league in 1987. It was the only team that year to beat Galway, which won the All-Ireland. It also beat Tipperary, the cream of hurling. The following year I went to see Westmeath play Galway in the North American hurling final in the Polo Grounds in New York. No fewer that 11 members of that senior hurling team had emigrated and were working in America. That shows what can happen when there is no Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    <P>The employers, trade unions, farmers and everyone involved in generating employment have a master plan. This master plan is giving a 15% increase in salaries over 33 months and a widening of the tax bands to give a further 10%. As an employer is it difficult, but also heartening, that every worker will have a 25% increase in their take home pay in 33 months' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Less the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone can plan their future with confidence. The labour exchange in Castlepollard in those days had in excess of 600 people signing on every week and seeking work. Today, thank God, about 200 people are signing on and looking for work. That is the barometer of the success that has happened.</P>
      <P>In 1987 about a million people were working in Ireland. Today, 1.5 million people are working here. In the past two years, in excess of 45,000 people each year have returned to Ireland, bringing back their expertise and investing in the economy. In the words of the poet, &ldquo;Where is the one who does not love the land where they were born?&rdquo;. No one emigrated from Ireland, particularly those who left to get work, without hoping in their heart they would return some day to rear their families and live the rest of their lives here. They did not have an opportunity to do so at that time or in the 1940s.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello spoke about housing. There were never more houses built in this country than were built last year. However, the big difference is &ndash; thank God it has happened &ndash; that they are being built by the private sector. Every boy and girl is now able to afford a loan to build or buy a bungalow or semi-detached house. That is the way it has been planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member of this House is fortunate that local authority members have placed their confidence in us and elected us to this House. I welcome the former Deputy, Colm Hilliard, who is in the Visitors Gallery. His late father was a Minister. They have given a lifetime of service, like <Col N="531" /> the Leas-Chathaoirleach's family, to the people of Ireland since the foundation of the State. These people had the foresight to make us Members of this House.</P>
    <P>We must be factual and state what we see happening in our country. We could not have imagined in our wildest dreams that the economy would be as it is today. That has happened because of the national agreement drawn up in 1987-8 by Charles Haughey and Michael Mullen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>And the support of the Opposition parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the total support of the Opposition parties. In regard to this programme, we know it will take every ounce of everyone's ability to continue the growth of our economy. However, factors outside our control &ndash; I know Senator Ross is going to speak after me &ndash; such as the price of oil, could deal an evil blow with regard to future inflation.</P>
      <P>Having said that, the challenge facing us is no greater than the one we faced in 1987. We were told in 1986 that if that year's budget did not work there would be power sharing and that the EU Commission would do this and that. We have come a long way since then. Every young person, in particular, can feel proud of their contribution since those hard, dark days. Those of us in employment did not know whether income tax would increase to 65% or 70% in the next budget or whether bank interest rates would be 20%, 21% or 22%. In 1989, when I was employing over 100 people, I paid the bank 22% interest on money I borrowed to keep the workforce going. That was the climate then.</P>
      <P>I remember visiting friends in Toronto for St. Patrick's Day when I was chairman of Westmeath County Council. I had gone to school with them and we hurled together for the county and Castlepollard. They had three carports in their house and a lake and beautiful surroundings. I asked them how they could afford such prosperity and they replied they were paying 6% interest while we were paying 18% and 20%. We were basically working for the banks &ndash; that was the case for every employer, farmer and self-employed person since the foundation of the State until the past two years.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that working people, those people who are creating and providing employment, or the workers on the factory floor, have an opportunity to make money on the banks' money. This is an example of why we should be members of the European Community. Joining the single European currency has brought down interest rates so that people can invest the money in their businesses, in their homes and in improvements to their family structure in general, instead of using it to keep the big profits of the banking institutions up to the levels of previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> The banks are doing well now but one can borrow money at reasonable rates, 5% or 6%, and one knows that values are rising by 10%. Senator Ross, who is a financial wizard and an expert on these matters, will know that one could not make even 3.5% or 4% on the stock exchange for many years. We all, to our eternal cost, know that. However, we are fortunate to have a climate that encourages people to start up and invest in business. Up to the past three or four years, they were working day and night for the banks.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive aspects of this national programme. I welcome the massive investment in health in particular and pay tribute to the Minister, formerly at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for securing up to a 40% increase in the allocation for health services in the various budgets since the Government took office. The health services need a never-ending supply of money and I hope, in the interests of patients, nursing staff, and everyone in the health services, that the money allocated in the national plan for the coming 33 months will meet their requirements in a way that will ease the burden on them.</P>
    <P>A debate on the problems facing the nursing industry was proposed on today's Order of Business. Young nurses are not being given the opportunity to train &ndash; they have to go to London, Edinburgh, Paris or New York. They cannot be trained in their home country, yet there is a shortage of nurses. It defies logic that 5,000 young students wished to train as nurses and only 1,100 places were available. Why can there not be 2,500 places? There should be an in-depth examination of this matter by the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. He is a popular young man with the younger generation and they are looking to him to address this situation. He has been known in the past as a man that will act quickly and I look forward to him addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation made over the lifetime of the programme for roads and for all the other categories included. It is welcome that there is a programme for the next 33 months and if we make as much progress in the next 33 months as we have in the past programmes, we will not be too disappointed. It was not an ideal conclusion for many of those who took part in the negotiation of the programme, but common sense has prevailed. I hope the progress made to date will continue and the country will prosper from the proposals in this programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the tenor of this debate but we ought to be grateful we are having a debate at all. There is a myth being promoted by all parties, which has just been promoted by Senator Cassidy, that our prosperity is apparently due to the fact that there have been four national pay agreements. How does he know that? He may or may not be right. It is a very simplistic explanation put about by many economists and there are many economists who would back up the comments made by Senator Cassidy <Col N="533" /> However, it is mostly politicians who find these particular agreements extremely convenient as a method of buying industrial peace and buying off vested interests.</P>
      <P>To say that our national prosperity is due to the fact that we have had a pay deal for the past few years is patent nonsense because it cannot be proved and is extremely unlikely. One of the most extraordinary things about our national prosperity is that Senator Cassidy is the only person I have heard who can explain it recently. Most people do not know why it has happened &ndash; they cannot explain it. When it is examined four or five different reasons are given. It may be convenient to say here that partnership is the reason for it and that is why this programme was produced but there are other reasons. Multinationals must have something to do with it and they do not give two hoots about this national pay deal. The EU funds would have helped as would our wonderful education system. I would have thought there are a host of reasons, but I do not know. However, to give the credit to these extraordinary deals is to whistle in the wind. It is quite possible that we would be far more prosperous had there been no national pay deals but free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>I oppose national pay deals, not just in specific terms, but on principle because they lock people into situations built on premises which we cannot possibly guarantee. That happened in the last one. It was negotiated on the basis of a growth rate of about 4.5%. The growth rate was running at 10%, yet the deal, to some extent, was kept on the basis that there would be 4.5% growth. The current one is negotiated on the basis that there will be a growth rate of about 6%. This is a very dangerous hostage to fortune even with 33 months to go because, and Senator Cassidy mentioned them, yesterday diabolical inflation figures were released.</P>
      <P>It is no good dressing them up and saying that there is no need to worry, that the price of oil cannot be helped. The price of oil affects every other nation in Europe. It is not sold at a different price to that in France, Germany or anywhere else and it hits them in the same way. Why is our inflation figure now over double theirs? One cannot say it is the price of oil, if so their figures would be the same. It is not much of it at all. It has nothing to do with the difference between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons are very, very different but EMU is probably the principal reason &ndash; Senator Cassidy paid great tribute to it for keeping the interest rates down, although that is debatable. One of the reasons is that we are importing so much from the United Kingdom, who did not enter EMU although we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the same consensus about European Union in this House as we have about the social <Col N="534" /> partnership. Economic and monetary union has not proved of great benefit to this country and is the cause of much of the inflation. We cannot do much about it. Economic and monetary union was much like this debate &ndash; we did not have a debate on it at all. It was decided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My principal objection to this particular document, glossy though it may be, is that it has been negotiated by people with no democratic mandate whatsoever. It is negotiated by powerbrokers, IBEC, the trade unions, the farmers, who did not have much input, and a few others. The Oireachtas is a rubber stamp in this process. Not only are the Dáil and Seanad rubber stamps, the Cabinet is also a rubber stamp. There was very little consultation with the Cabinet on this matter. In this country, above all countries in Europe, there is a democratic deficit which is dangerous, and we accept it. We do not even vote on this question. We merely make statements on it. This is because most party politicians are frightened of standing up to interest groups and saying this agreement is a great idea even though they have not read it and do not understand it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we can vote on a financial motion. Senator Cassidy should not be ridiculous. He knows the Standing Orders of the House as well as I do.</P>
      <P>Who signed this deal? It was signed by those same people. It was also signed by someone on behalf of the Government, possibly the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach, who has many conciliatory characteristics, is the man who, whenever he is asked a question on RTE, does not say he must ask the Cabinet about it, he says he must go and ask the social partners. Why should he ask them? Nobody gave them a mandate to govern Ireland. Nevertheless, this document is longer and more comprehensive than the programme for Government. Why is that?</P>
      <P>The document deals with issues which have nothing to do with the pay agreement. They have headings such as, Commitment to the Wider World. What does this have to do with trade unions negotiating pay? The social partners are telling the Government what to do about foreign policy. John Dunne and Peter Cassells, who are the big chiefs in this matter, are telling us what our commitment to the wider world is. The document deals with our emigrants abroad. What does this have to do with farmers who will sign this agreement or with Father Seán Healy and all those other people? These are matters for Government and it is doubtful if our emigrants are even a matter for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document goes on to deal with Ireland's relationship with our EU partners. Why on earth should the social partners tell the Cabinet what to think about our relationship with our EU partners? Our policy on the reform of the EU treaties is being dictated to us by Liberty Hall. This is an <Col N="535" /> amazing document. It tells us how much overseas development aid we should pay. It tells us who is in charge, and it certainly is not Senator Cassidy or me. He and I are political eunuchs. We sit back and rubber stamp what is in this document and Senator Cassidy is happy to do that.</P>
    <P>The sight of Senator Cassidy's party colleagues, after the budget, saying they did not like individualisation made one realise that this was their first awareness of their power. There had been no input by Government backbenchers or by any other Members of the Oireachtas in the formulation of the budget. The input had come from the trade unions and the same old friends who are governing Ireland through this document. The rebellion of the backbenchers was the first encouraging sign. They were insulted because they had not been consulted and were aware that a terrible mistake had been made.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have got out of touch by talking to the oligarchs who come into Government Buildings from time to time and tell the Government how to behave and how to govern the country. I have no principled objection to a pay deal but I have a principled objection to its being dictated by people outside this House. Senator Cassidy is not the only person who is guilty. Other Governments have done the same thing because this is the price they are prepared to pay for industrial peace. It is time Governments and politicians on all sides of the House stood up to the public service and told those people that they have got enough money and very good jobs.</P>
    <P>The role of the Government in the negotiations was shameful. One would not have thought the Government was taking part in these talks at all. Day after day we saw pictures on television of people going in and out of Government Buildings and eventually, when they had agreed a deal, a Minister came in and signed it. This applies to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and even the Minster for Finance who went along with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. There was a great deal of shadow boxing in making this agreement. We <Col N="536" /> were told the midnight oil would be burned and it would be very difficult to reach an agreement. Brinkmanship tactics were used. We were told an agreement would be impossible and we would be forced to return to a free-for-all. It was said that one side was demanding 20% while the other was offering 10% and this was an unbridgeable gap. What everyone foresaw happened. The lads clapped hands, had a drink, split the difference to 15%, fooled the people and off they went. This had been inevitable all along. It suits the leaders of IBEC and ICTU to sell the deal to their troops, enjoy a quiet life and dictate to the Government from time to time.</P>
      <P>This would be very well if a real agreement had been reached. The figure of 15.7% was headlined, the equivalent of 5% per annum compound interest. Of course this is not the true figure but it can be sold to trade union members as a good deal while IBEC can claim to have defeated the trade unions. The real figure is much higher. The headline figure is meaningless. The Government will give generous tax breaks which will make the 15.7% figure meaningless. Various allowances will be given, local bargaining deals will be made and the figure will rise to at least 25%.</P>
      <P>Like every Member, I got a notice in the post the other day saying I would receive a 2% increase as well as 2% back money for last year. I was curious about this and I telephoned the official who had sent me the notice. He told me it was a productivity payment. I told him I have produced less this year than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only true of Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right. I told him I had produced much less this year and asked him what I could do about it. He told me I could do nothing about it. It had been negotiated on my behalf. This is what happens in the public service. We are given money whether we like it or not because we have strong unions. I do not deserve a 2% increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did Senator Ross send it back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I did not send it back. I am not a lunatic. It was negotiated on my behalf but it should not have been. This is what is happening in the economy. The public service is negotiating deals which are not related to performance. This has been totally fudged in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who say this agreement is inflationary, but it does not appear to be so. The programme was negotiated on the basis of an inflation rate of 3% or less. The AT&amp;GWU, for which I have a great deal of sympathy, was very quick to point out when the inflation figures were announced yesterday that a pay rise of 5% is worthless if inflation is running at 4.5%. The deal is built on the basis of an inflation rate of 2.5% or less. Trade unions will very quickly apply for <Col N="537" /> an increase above the rate in the agreement. The agreement will then be in tatters.</P>
    <P>The agreement is already in tatters because on the same day the inflation figures were produced the bus workers were looking for an increase of 20%. I would have thought their union would tell them this was an impossible demand. The 20% they are looking for does not come within the last deal or this one, but they are still looking for it and they seem to think they can get it. Why do they think they can get it? They think they can get it because the last deal was a bit of a joke. It is a guideline for some, a straitjacket for others and a blessing for the rest because it was broken by the gardaí, nurses and firemen. I am delighted they did. Everyone broke it but the pretence went on that there was a social contract which was binding on the public service. The public service just ignored it and that is what will happen with this agreement.</P>
    <P>This programme leads to serious expectations which we cannot fulfil. It is fashionable to say that we are enjoying an unprecedented period of prosperity, which is true, but there is an irresponsibility in the Government which is dangerous. I noticed yesterday in the Dáil the Taoiseach was asked about inflation after the pay deal and he said the Minister for Finance will do what he can to combat inflation. He chose his words carefully as he always does. The question that should be asked by those who negotiated this pay deal is what can he do to combat inflation. The answer is that the Minister for Finance can do damn all to combat inflation. Why is that? The reason is simple. He has sacrificed the two weapons for combating inflation here and he is virtually powerless. This Government has given away power overseas and at home. To combat inflation the most basic, fundamental, crude weapon at our disposal is to put up interest rates. For reasons which everyone in this House supported we gave up the power to alter interest rates. Therefore, when our inflation goes up nothing can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Our inflation rate will not be a cause of great worry to Wim Duisenberg or the President of France, Mr. Chirac, who dictate interest rates here. It will be a great worry for people in this country who have to pay more for basic commodities and there is nothing we can do about that. We have sacrificed that right. If inflation goes to 5% we will hear the same old excuses as we heard from Senator Cassidy that it is not domestically generated. He will say it is the oil price. That excuse does not hold any water whatsoever because oil prices affect our neighbours as much as us. But we will use it and say that it is part of it.</P>
    <P>Changing the value of our currency is another weapon we could have used but we sacrificed that as well. The other weapon we could use is to negotiate a deal which is not inflationary and have a non-inflationary programme for Government. All the programme titles use jargon like Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. They <Col N="538" /> sound nice but mean nothing. We could also negotiate a programme which is inflationary. We are now committed to overheating the economy internally because we have been told to do so by IBEC and ICTU but we can do nothing about inflation externally because we are powerless. That is not a great position to be in. It is a recipe for long-term folly when we are in the position where we really ought to be cautious. We have a great opportunity here for sustained gradual prosperity. We have had a huge injection in recent years and we are about to fritter it away. We are in the process of doing that because there is no caution in this document. This document promotes spending money and uncontrolled public spending while the economy is overheating.</P>
    <P>The whole Department of Foreign Affairs is tied up reading this document for reasons I do not understand. Is there anything in this document about housing, the great symbol of inflation here?</P>

      <P>Asset price inflation will increase by 30% every year. Housing is the real problem which affects our young people. They cannot buy houses because inflation has taken them over. I cannot find anything in the programme about it. The trade unions are bellyaching about it.</P>

      <P>We are not doing anything about it. I cannot find any action on it. The trade unions complained last year about this, saying it would not be acceptable to sign another pay deal unless young people could get houses here. Young people will not get houses if this document is anything to go by. House prices will rise again this year and go further out of the reach of young people. One of the great warning signals about this is the increase in credit rates here which is now the highest in Europe. But who cares? This signal is being ignored. There will come a day when all of the wise economists and people like Senator Cassidy will come back to us and they will say with the great benefit of hindsight &ndash; which they had on the prosperity of the economy but they never saw it coming &ndash; that if we had not given so much credit at that time we would have kept our prosperity.</P>

    <P>With regard to public service pay, there is no reason why the public servants should not be paid amounts which they deserve and the Exchequer can afford. They should be properly rewarded for the work that they do. This document lacks the promise that the public service will be reformed. We needed two things, the end of leap-frogging and catch-up pay which has been the scourge of the public service for so long and performance related pay. This was promised but has not been delivered. There is no reason why performance related pay could not have been introduced in the public service. It is absurd, both in the private and public sectors, that people who sit around as pen pushers will get a 15.75% increase plus all the tax breaks while others work hard. That is one of the great curses of the public service. It also happens in the private sector but we are responsible for <Col N="540" /> the public service because it is public money. That problem has not been addressed. If anyone interrupts and says there is a review body, they are correct.</P>
