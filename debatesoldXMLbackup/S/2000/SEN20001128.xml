    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to move a vote of sympathy to his wife and children on the death of Paddy Donegan. He was a Member of this House from 1957 to 1961, having been a Member of the Dáil from 1954 to 1957. Subsequently he spent a 20 year period in the Dáil from 1961 to 1981. He had a very long and distinguished record of service to the State and to his constituents in County Louth.</P>
      <P>Paddy Donegan was Minister for Defence from 1973 to the end of 1976 and is particularly remembered for the famous remark he made in Mullingar, which precipitated the resignation of the then President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh. It would be wrong, however, if that incident were to overshadow the contribution Mr. Donegan made. He was a very good Minister for Defence and intervened personally in 1973 when the <i>Claudia</i> was attempting to run guns into the country. That is something for which he should be remembered. He was also Minister in the Department of Lands from December 1976 until the fall of the Fine Gael-led Cosgrave Government in 1977. The Department of Fisheries was attached to that brief in 1977.</P>
      <P>I knew Mr. Donegan very well, not on a political level but through agriculture. He ran a major grain business in County Louth at Annagassan Mills. If he was as tough in politics as he was in discussing grain prices on the telephone, he was a tough politician indeed.</P>
      <P>I extend sympathy to his family, his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party, and the constituents of Louth whom he served so well for so long. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in these expressions of sympathy to the relatives of the late Paddy Donegan who was laid to rest this morning in his native Monasterboice. As Senator Dardis said, Mr. Donegan was briefly a Member of this House, <Col N="986" /> although most of his political career was spent in the Lower House. He spent four years in the Seanad, from 1957 to 1961. I first met him 35 years ago during the general election of 1965 when I was a student working in the Fine Gael press and information office in Power's Hotel. For a young person, that was an interesting and enlightening experience, and the friendships I made then were ones that lasted.</P>
      <P>One of those friendships was with Paddy Donegan, although we were on opposite sides in the debate on the Just Society document. I was an impertinent young student but I was on the side of Declan Costello in that debate. Paddy Donegan did not approve of the Just Society document, he was a conservative and did not think it would do much good. Nonetheless, he was prepared to listen to the arguments that others, on our side, put forward. Apart from listening to us, he would bring us for a drink afterwards. As students, we always remembered the people who looked after us and bought us a pint and a steak, commodities which were not plentiful for students in those days. On the basis of the arguments we had then, a friendship developed which lasted.</P>
      <P>Paddy Donegan held robust and strong views. As Senator Dardis said, he was tough in negotiations and discussions, but it never became personal. He could always appreciate the other point of view. He liked a good argument and would remember afterwards that his opponent had made a strong case. Within Fine Gael he came from the old Irish Party tradition with which, in 1965, I was very impatient. Over the years, however, as I got to know about that tradition, I came to respect it greatly. It contributed hugely to the development of stable politics in this country.</P>
      <P>When Paddy Donegan was Minister for Defence there was never any doubt as to where he stood on terrorism. He lived in a vulnerable Border area, yet there was never any equivocation or sense of a sneaking regard. He always put the security and safety of the State first. This was most vividly illustrated in the famous <i>Claudia</i> incident in the early 1970s.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dardis said, it would be wrong to think of somebody whose political life was so long and so varied as being pigeonholed in one Department. When he was Minister for Defence he brought to the Naval Service a sense of commitment which few previous Ministers had done. He loved the sea and knew much about maritime affairs, and that spilled over into the way in which he dealt with the Naval Service. He loved and understood the Army, whose personnel knew that and regarded him as a Minister for Defence with whom they could talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was very committed to his own county of Louth and was very much a Louth man. Louth people have their own particular charms which <Col N="987" /> are sometimes lost on the rest of us. One always knew where one stood because he always remained in touch with the people of County Louth.</P>
    <P>As a member of Fine Gael, Paddy Donegan was extraordinarily loyal. He would travel the country to help colleagues. He would speak at meetings in every part of the country. He was always loyal to the leader of the party, whoever it might be. To the very end, even when his health was failing, he would turn up at Ard Fheiseanna, as very few ex-Ministers do, simply to give his moral support and show how interested he was in what was happening.</P>
    <P>He had not been in good health in recent years. He suffered greatly because of ill health, but above all else he was lucky in his wonderful wife, Olivia, who gave him enormous support and encouragement. She was always there with him, always tolerant, right up to the very end. In that as in many other things in life, he was very lucky.</P>
    <P>It is with great personal sadness and regret that I learned of the death of Paddy Donegan. He was a friend and somebody of whom I have very warm memories. He was generous to me at key points in my life. I express my deep sympathy to Olivia and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In expressing our condolences to the family of the late Paddy Donegan who was a Senator, Deputy and Minister, it is difficult at times like this to look back at a person's career. It is in many ways a test of our understanding of democracy, the importance we place on participation and our sense of tolerance and a measure of our understanding of pluralism that we acknowledge and recognise the contribution made by those who held views different from our own. It is important that those of us in these Houses who may have disagreed with the comments and views expressed by others recognise their extraordinary strength of commitment at various times of their careers. I have no doubt that for a number of Members Paddy Donegan fell into that category. All I know about him as a Minister is that members of the Defence Forces were of the view that they were well represented, regarded and respected. He had that reputation. It is the only aspect of his work about which I have become aware in dealing with those who worked under him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always sad and unfortunate when a person's career and commitment is reduced into one single sentence. That will happen &ndash; many would say unfavourably &ndash; in the case of Paddy Donegan. In that sense, it is important that we outline his contribution, and I am happy to do so. He was a person who was direct, blunt and active. He was a person who got things done and did not worry about the downside. He was, certainly, non-PC. <Col N="988" /> We could use some of these elements in politics today.</P>
    <P>He was a person who made an impression, in particular, as a very colourful character. It is regrettable that a remark which he made when he was, clearly, tired and emotional should be the most lasting memory of him when people begin to talk about him. It is proper, therefore, to remember his contribution as a Senator, Deputy and Minister. His contribution to the building of Ireland should not be looked upon as insignificant. He participated in Government and made his contribution, and in that sense, I am happy to express condolences to his wife and family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour group, I wish to be associated with the expressions of condolences and sympathy to the wife and family of the late Paddy Donegan. Paddy Donegan had a very distinguished career in the political and business arenas. Like so many others who entered the political arena, he entered through local government &ndash; Drogheda borough council and Louth County Council. He served on the usual committees, the health board, harbour board, committee on agriculture and so on. In national politics he served initially in the Dáil and later in the Seanad before returning to the Dáil. He served at the highest levels as Minister for Defence, Lands and Fisheries.</P>
      <P>He was an outspoken and blunt man. At times he was emotional about matters close and dear to his heart. Members have referred to two major incidents, one involving the <i>Claudia</i> and the other the Emergency Powers Bill, the referral of which to the Supreme Court he opposed. The President was right to refer it to the Supreme Court although, ironically, there are even greater powers in place at present. Paddy Donegan opposed it in his capacity as Minister for Defence and out of concern about the situation in Northern Ireland and abroad. He was acting according to his beliefs.</P>
      <P>Mr. Donegan apologised for his remarks and offered to resign. At the time, I did not think much of his position as I was then the recipient of Special Branch attention. However, I respected the fact that he apologised and offered his resignation. At this time we must respect what he did, the beliefs he stood for and the fact that he bluntly and staunchly tried to implement them. I wish to be associated with the remarks of sympathy and condolence to his wife, children and the broader Fine Gael family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably one of the few Members of the House who knew Paddy Donegan and his family quite well and it was with sadness I heard last Sunday morning of his passing. To his wife Olivia and his family I extend deepest sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paddy Donegan was a Senator, a Deputy and <Col N="989" /> Minister for Defence. He served on Louth County Council and on Drogheda Corporation. He had a great interest in farming and in the milling business. He also had an extensive interest in and practical experience of the licensed trade. Members who have called to the Monasterboice Inn will be aware that high standards have been maintained there.</P>
    <P>He achieved a great deal as Minister for Defence. He was particularly concerned about the welfare of members of the Army and tried to implement improvements, especially in the canteen facilities and living quarters of ordinary privates. Basic improvements were introduced at that time.</P>
    <P>He was an active supporter of the Army showjumping team and was instrumental in the purchase of Rockbarton, whose many successes made it one of this country's best four legged ambassadors. He was also a keen sportsman and hunted with the Louth and Ward hunts. Sailing was a particular interest.</P>
    <P>Paddy Donegan played his part loyally in ensuring that the fabric of our democratic State would survive. He was rightly intolerant of those who cast doubt on the policies being implemented at that time. Obviously, circumstances were different then. His wife Olivia gave him dedicated care in the period since he suffered a stroke and his long illness commenced.</P>
    <P>I will end with the remarks of the priest who received the remains last night. He spoke about Paddy Donegan's career and the many people he had helped. Saying that nobody is perfect, he closed with the words, &ldquo;Paddy Donegan's life was a thundering success.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite approval of the stage 3 submission from the board of management of Ballyfeeney national school, County Roscommon, as the improvements involved are urgently needed.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. It will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 1, Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, will the Deputy Leader take Committee Stage only of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1999, as there are a number of amendments tabled on that Stage? We on this side of the House are of the view that the Minister is probably sufficiently open-minded to accept some of those amendments. We would prefer not to prevent that possiblity by calling for Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill to be taken today. The Deputy Leader will have full co-operation from this side of the House if he accedes to my request, as I hope he will, to take only Committee Stage of that Bill today.</P>
      <P>Last week we had a short, top of the head, instant debate on the question of taxis, for which the Leader must be thanked. It was held quickly at the request of Members on this side of the House. While we were grateful for it, it was a very quick debate. It is time to consider the taxi situation further. We have seen intimidation on a scale not witnessed here for a very long time. We have witnessed intimidation of those who fix taximeters in cars. It has been reported, and this has not been denied, that they have been told that if they fix the taximeters in any new applicant's car, they will be physically assaulted. We have also witnessed intimidation of TDs, some of whom have had their houses picketed by taxi people and have had threats made against them. We have witnessed the intimidation of the public by the blockading and threats of taxi people to snarl up the traffic system.</P>
      <P>That intimidation has no place in a democracy. The way is open for taxi people to put their case in a reasonable and structured way. If I were the Minister, and the taxi people came to see me in an intimidating and threatening way, I would quickly show them the door. No Government can tolerate that sort of behaviour. It is time the views of Members of this House were heard on this issue. We do not want to see a victory against taxi men; we want a proper taxi service. We want the rights of taxi men preserved as far as is possible, but we want it done in an orderly way. It is time we had a full debate on that issue and I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange it.</P>
      <P>This House should condemn unequivocally the action of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has undermined the Government and the Minister of State, a member of the Deputy Leader's party, by describing him as impertinent when he believed he was not being recorded. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, has two options. He could resign, and if he were honourable he would do so, as he is at variance with stated Government policy. If he does not resign, any Taoiseach with gumption would sack him. We cannot have undermining of public policy by a Minister of State who wishes to continue in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the views of the Deputy Leader, in particular on the undermining of his <Col N="991" /> ministerial colleague, Deputy Molloy, by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach is a teacher at heart and, therefore, a tolerant person.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of issues with the Deputy Leader. Will he indicate if there was a response to a request for a debate on the conditions of service and promotional prospects of Members of the Oireachtas and the importance of the implementation of the Buckley report? If not, will he raise that matter again? The Buckley report, effectively the benchmarking of salaries and allowances of Members of the Oireachtas, has been completed and submitted to Minister for Finance. I ask that the report be brought to Government and implemented. Members of both Houses should make the case for doing that as quickly as possible. It would be appropriate for Members to receive copies of the report to enable us to have a debate on it in this House. We did not debate the outcome of the Buckley report or the earlier Gleeson reports. It is appropriate to debate them, to enable us to offer publicly our views on the way this job should be organised. I ask that this be done fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>I will not go into the issues raised by Senator Manning, other than to say that I agree with him. I repeat my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and the Government on taking a strong stand.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy O'Dea, that is no more than the usual Fianna Fáil loosening up of muscles so they can rush out to the plinth on the day of the budget to undermine their Minister. I hope there is more discipline this year than last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is not but I could not resist it. The budget next week is very important and Fianna Fáil Members should at least support their Minister if he does the right thing, despite whatever phone calls he gets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might interest those who ran out to the plinth last year on behalf of people who missed out to know that the current review of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has brought forward a proposal, accepted by the Government, to extend paid maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks. This is a significant improvement on the current situation and arises from the programme. It requires a minor change to the existing maternity legislation. Will the Leader find out when the Government intends to do this and put pressure on it to do quickly? It is important that that be done quickly for those who have confidence in the <Col N="992" /> PPF. It should also be brought to the Seanad in the first place.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Manning abut the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is also important to the Independent Members. I ask the Deputy Leader to halt progress after Committee Stage. We will co-operate fully with the remaining Stages when they are taken but we need that time between Committee and remaining Stages. We seek the Deputy Leader's indulgence in this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan has put a lot of effort into the committee report on the Shannon River Council and we should have a debate on this matter so that we can move matters further along the legislative route. The Leader would wish us to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the requests to take Committee Stage only of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill today as there are quite a lot of amendments. There was a good debate on Second Stage but there are many issues to be teased out with the Minister, who is reasonably receptive to suggestions for change. It would be proper to take Committee Stage only today.</P>
      <P>I wish to move the following amendment to the Order of Business, &ldquo;That No. 12 be taken.&rdquo;  I ask the House's permission to print the Central Bank (Amendment) Bill, 2000. This Bill is very short and is directed at the proper and orderly regulation of the banking system. The intention is to ensure the banks maintain a sufficient number of branches and other offices to meet the reasonable requirements of their customers. As we know, there has been a huge spate of branch closures which seem to be happening willy-nilly, with no criteria being applied. The Bill seeks to empower the Central Bank to extend its existing powers to look at this whole area and to ensure that permission would have to be granted by the Central Bank before branches or offices could be closed.</P>
      <P>I also raise the issue of the Pakistani businessmen who were detained at the airport and imprisoned in Mountjoy. We should invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Seanad to discuss the immigration issue and related matters. It is dreadful that <i>bona fide </i>businessmen with valid passports and visas had those documents, their flight tickets and their money confiscated and were also imprisoned for a period.</P>
      <P>Other related issues need to be raised also, such as the proposed detention centre in Butlins at Mosney. This is causing a huge furore, not just in the Irish Refugee Council, but because of the closure of a holiday camp for children from the north inner city. This is the area where most of the children go in the summer and it is not a suitable facility for a detention centre for asylum seekers. Also, it would totally undermine the Community Games if it were to close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a further debate on the taxi issue, <Col N="993" /> which does not appear to be going away despite the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, taking place today. Arising from that meeting with the Minister of State we should have a debate before the end of the week because there are serious issues, raised by Senator Manning, in particular, and others and in the media, that need to be addressed. It is important that the Oireachtas is seen to state clearly where the Houses stand on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange an early debate on the possible health hazards relating to mobile 'phones? I would like the Minister for Health and Children to be present in the House for the debate because in recent days there have been many serious revelations regarding the dangers of these 'phones, even to the point where it is now believed that they will have to carry a health warning. The most worrying aspect is that recent findings show that these 'phones are more dangerous for children than adults and, as we know, many children now have mobile 'phones. This Christmas it appears that they will top the wish list of presents among young people. We should remind ourselves that while tests in the past have not proved that there are dangers, it has never been proved that they are harmless. I would like that debate to take place before Christmas because of the danger of children getting mobile phones as presents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader tell us if a date has been fixed for the debate on education, particularly in reference to the Cromien report on the Department of Education and Science? We are concerned about the teachers' strike and I know many parents are worried about those children who will undergo examinations next year. It is particularly pertinent at this time that we would have a debate on education.</P>
      <P>Is the Deputy Leader aware of a new campaign launched by the Department of Health and Children which is called &ldquo;Think Twice Every Time &ndash; It's Up to You Both&rdquo;? The timing of this campaign launch is interesting because we have heard there is a mini-epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases in this city. It is remarkable, however, that such a campaign was launched at a time when the partners who would normally be associated with it were not contacted about the best way to go about it. It would be interesting for us to debate that issue and I would ask that education as well as health be on the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader appeal to the Minister for Finance to give special consideration in this year's budget to people with a disability? Statistics show that people with a disability are more likely to experience poverty in their lives and in 1997, an ESRI report indicated that 72% of families headed by a disabled person were living below the poverty line. Perhaps a special range of measures would be considered by the <Col N="994" /> Minister for Finance so that people with disability can live with dignity and independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business in the name of Senator Costello. That is a very important matter. Banks are treating their customers with contempt. They are also treating them on an age and class basis. They are extinguishing local branches of banks in a way which is disadvantageous to people who do not understand information technology and this is of a piece with the closure of rural post offices.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Keogh in what I believe is a timely call for a debate on the question of sexually transmitted diseases. There is a very worrying rise in these diseases. For example, today's newspapers refer to the incidence of syphilis. We are also through the first wave of AIDS but young people do not take this issue seriously. This House played an important role in the early days by intelligently and seriously discussing AIDS and we should do so again.</P>
      <P>The case of the Pakistani businessmen was a lamentable advertisement for this country. Seven people came to this country and were treated in an atrocious manner and imprisoned. These people had valid passports, airline tickets and visas. Reports stated that officials at the airport believed these men intended to travel to the UK and this was precisely the point made when this Act was going through the House. I do not entirely blame the people at the airport as they were required to imagine what other people intended to do which is impossible. This case is an outrage.</P>
      <P>Coincidentally, this morning I received a letter concerning a distinguished Egyptian doctor and novelist who applied for a study visa. This man had all the necessary documents but was refused permission to attend a three week summer school in Trinity College. We hear talk of fortress Europe but this is turning into fortress Ireland and we need to debate the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse Senator Kett's appeal to the Minister for Finance on behalf of the disabled who have an exceptional case. Disabled people have special needs and expenses over and above ordinary people, particularly disabled people who find themselves in the poverty trap. However, I wish to refer specifically to disabled drivers. I ask the Deputy Leader to convey to the relevant Ministers my concern and annoyance at the selfish, inconsiderate, insensitive and unfair behaviour of motorists who park in spaces designated for disabled drivers. I receive many complaints about this abominable behaviour and we should introduce whatever enforceable regulations are required as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senators Manning and O'Toole in calling for a break after Committee Stage of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill. The House has tabled quite a number of amendments to this legislation. The Minister for Arts, Heri<Col N="995" /> tage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, has shown her intention to make this a good Bill and it would be a mistake to rush it through the House in one day. I would welcome the deferral of Report Stage until next week.</P>
      <P>Last year for many weeks the House sought a debate on Partnership for Peace. The debate eventually took place on the last day of the session in July. The European rapid reaction force has come to fruition and it is an ideal time and the ideal forum to debate the matter. We should use this opportunity to invite the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to the House to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to the decision of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to acquire Mosney holiday camp. Most Members will be aware that I have a long association with the National Community Games and I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the Minister to the House as a matter of urgency to make a statement of intent on this issue. This decision will cause severe disruption to the National Community Games movement but will also create enormous disappointment for hundreds of thousands of children who aspire to their own mini-Olympics each year.</P>
      <P>Many Senators, in their capacity as Members of this House or as chairpersons and members of statutory local bodies, attend the national games each year to give support. They also give financial support in their capacity as Members of this House and will share the general concern at this decision. We need clarification on this issue.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to place on the record of the House any implied criticism of Phelim McCluskey and his wife who have done great work in providing these facilities for many years. I know the McCluskey family well and this is obviously a business decision. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, as a State body, has an obligation to clarify what exactly it intends to do and the impact this decision will have on the future of the games. No other venue has the same facilities or can accommodate the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people who use this venue at weekends.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of deep concern to parents and, in particular, children and I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise it. The Department must clarify the position as matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the taxi drivers dispute. I condemn the intimidation and death threats sent to the Minister who is upholding the law. This is scandalous. I hope the people responsible are caught and that taxi drivers will comply with the law and help the detectives who are trying to trace those who issued the death threats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very annoyed at the way taxi drivers have treated disabled people. I come into this category, but at least I am mobile. Yesterday I listened to <Col N="996" /> reports on how people in wheelchairs have been treated by taxi drivers. It is scandalous that disabled people, who are on low incomes, have been charged £30 instead of the usual fare of £14. I hope taxi drivers get their act together and co-operate with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which is trying to trace the people who issued the death threats to the Minister.</P>

This dispute is unfortunate for all concerned, particularly examination students who seem to have been overshadowed in the media by the antics of the taxi drivers. By the end of this week students will have lost six days at school, with the prospect of further lost days in the weeks to come. We had a debate on the taxi drivers dispute last week and it is unfortunate that we have not yet had a debate on education and, in particular, the ASTI dispute.

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello referred to item No. 1 on the Order Paper. I am anxious to dispose of this legislation as quickly as possible as a number of other Bills will come before the House for debate before the Christmas recess. I cannot defer the Bill but one way of dealing with it is to have a recess of three quarters of an hour between Committee and Report Stages. I will propose that. The Minister may be able to give an indication at that stage as to the progress being made on the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Farrell referred to public transport and the taxi drivers' dispute. I fully agree with Senator Manning that intimidation has no role in our democracy. No one can condone such threats. Even though we are used to confronting protest groups outside the gate, we were intimidated while crossing the street last week. It was also wrong that a person who was reporting on the incidents should have been threatened in the way that he was and told to put his microphone in a certain place. That was wholly unwarranted.</P>

      <P>It is highly regrettable that the Pakistani business people were detained in Mountjoy Prison.

It is essential that people are treated with the dignity they deserve. It is indicative of a certain frame of mind with regard to ethnic minorities that they are not dealt with in the same way as anybody else from inside or outside the country who is white.</P>

    <P>I will try to get the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the &ldquo;think twice&rdquo; campaign and the sex education issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Kett and Liam Fitzgerald raised the issue of disability. I share their hope that the Minister for Finance will continue last year's progress in next week's budget in ensuring disabled people are given the rights to which they are entitled, are able to live with dignity and can go about their business properly and easily.</P>
    <P>The use of disabled parking spaces by able-bodied people was raised and it is so wrong as to beggar belief. I recently came across a case where a person in a wheelchair had reason to have words with an able-bodied person who parked in a disabled person's parking space outside a supermarket and he was virtually assaulted for having the effrontery to raise the issue with the person. Something must be done quickly to ensure the rights of people with disabilities are vindicated. We cannot always legislate for boorishness and loutishness. Nonetheless, where such spaces exists, they should be available for the people who require them, and something must be done to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the Pakistani matter raised by Senator Norris. Senator Quinn raised the matter of defence, Partnership for Peace and the Rapid Reaction Force. He is right in saying matters have progressed substantially from the time we entered Partnership for Peace. I welcome the Rapid Reaction Force and I would welcome an opportunity to discuss the issue more widely within the House.</P>
    <P>The issue of Mosney was raised by Senators Mooney and Costello. It would be regrettable if the Community Games did not have a venue of that nature for the annual games.

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 10, after &ldquo;standing&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a Fellow or Member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of my amendments Nos. 1 and 15 is to introduce a reference to the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in the section setting out <Col N="1000" /> the qualifications of an arbitrator. As it stands, the section requires that the arbitrator appointed be a solicitor or barrister of seven years standing, and that is all right as far as it goes. There is a specialist professional organisation of arbitrators and it seems logical that fellowship or membership of it would be an alternative qualification for the particular appointment. We are making an assumption about the competence of a solicitor or barrister of seven years standing to act as an arbitrator. I have no problem with taking this leap of faith. An even smaller leap of faith is due in the case of someone who is qualified to carry out arbitrations. It seems illogical, therefore, to exclude membership or fellowship of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators as an alternative qualification. If we were examining another area we would not ignore such a professional qualification. My amendment is sensible and it would improve the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 will allow the Minister to appoint and remunerate experienced arbitrators. The function of such arbitrators will be to hear and determine appeals under section 12 which deals with the creation of rights of way and section 13 which deals with the extinguishment of easements. A similar provision is made in section 19 facilitating the appointment of arbitrators to hear cases regarding ministerial consent to works in natural heritage areas. In both cases it is stipulated that an arbitrator shall be a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing.</P>
      <P>If the proposed amendments were accepted, it would mean that a fellow or member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, regardless of his or her qualifications, could be appointed as an arbitrator for the purposes of sections 12, 13 and 19. As the work of an arbitrator in this context would include dealing with complex and technical legal arguments, it is deemed appropriate that the person involved would be an experienced barrister or solicitor. Sections 10 and 19 do not preclude the appointment of an arbitrator who is a fellow or member of the Chartered Institutes of Arbitrators provided such an individual satisfies the minimum requirement stipulated in regard to qualifications and length of service. Similar provisions exist in relation to the appointment of arbitrators under the habitats regulations which deal with the designation of special areas of conservation, otherwise known as SACs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the SAC cases, the Senator may be happy to hear that my officials have engaged with the institute with a view to identifying those among its membership who would be eligible and willing to undertake the role of arbitrator. Arising from this, a number of cases have been forwarded to the institute to organise arbitration. While I appreciate the point being made by Senator Quinn and expect that members of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators will sit on arbitration on some NHA cases, I do not think it <Col N="1001" /> would be appropriate to accept the amendments to alter the minimum requirement for arbitration in relation to the sections involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said and I understand her point. It seems to me, however, that if there is a professional body &ndash; in this case the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators &ndash; recognition of that professional body and of its qualifications would normally be sufficient. I will not push the amendment but the Bill would be favourably enhanced if this happened. I would ask the Minister to consider, in future, recognising professional bodies such as this when making other appointments.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's point on arbitration on special areas of conservation, what role is envisaged for the arbitrator? Is it an arbitration concerning a dispute as to whether or not a site should be designated as an SAC or does it relate to disputes over compensation for an SAC, such as the cessation of turf cutting scheme as was operated by the Minister's Department about two years ago and is still ongoing? That usually affected SACs.</P>

      <P>On Senator Quinn's point, there is no prohibition with regard to the arbitrators being involved as long as they have the necessary legal qualifications and the appropriate time. There are technical legal issues that will have to be decided upon and it is for that reason that the qualifications outlined in the Bill are extremely important. I recognise, of course, that this institute is a very eminent one, hence the discussions that my Department officials and I have been having with it on foot of what is proposed.</P>
      <P>The question of arbitration was also raised with regard to the scientific approach. Senators know that SACs are always determined purely on a scientific basis and that there are no criteria other than that scientific basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), line 24, after &ldquo;determine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and shall also cause such notice to be published by electronic means&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these amendments will be accepted. Their purpose is to bring a long-standing legislative practice in line with, one, new advances in technology and, two, stated Government policy &ndash; that is the important part &ndash; on using information technology to conduct the nation's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-standing legislative practice is about ensuring that certain information is open and available to the public by law. Long before the Freedom of Information Act, this need was recognised in many Acts in order to underpin the right of the public to access certain information. One mechanism for doing this was through State bodies being obliged to publish annual reports. Another was to require the State or another body <Col N="1003" /> to keep a register of particular information and to make that register open to inspection by the public. A third, which is where we are at the moment, is to require the State to make some information available to the public so that due process can be done and be seen to be done in advance of a ministerial act.</P>
    <P>This Bill requires the Minister to publish certain information but it is drafted as if the new information technology did not exist. It is drafted in apparent ignorance of stated Government policy to do as much of the State's business by electronic means as a matter of urgency in order to underpin our credentials as an information technology aware nation and our claim to be recognised as a European hub of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of last month, I was invited by the Attorney General to speak at an international conference, in Dublin Castle, on emerging trends in legislative drafting. I made the point that one sometimes gets the impression that the drafters are writing for a world that no longer exists. This certainly seems to be the case with regard to the publishing requirement. The world has moved on since the only means of communicating to the public was through the printed media, such as local and national newspapers, or even in the glorified reaches of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. The Bill recognises that the world has moved on because at one point it provides for radio advertisements to be part of the publication process. However, it does not fully recognise the way in which the world has changed because it refuses to acknowledge the existence of the Internet and the worldwide web as technologies that have transformed a communication tool-box that is not only available but required to be used if the aims behind the communications process are to be fully achieved.</P>
    <P>My amendments do not seek to rely only on electronic means of publishing. They seek to add the new electronic means to the other means which have been available down through the years and which offer to broaden and deepen the thrust of the publication process. One of the happy advantages of publishing by electronic means is that it is cheap. It costs virtually nothing to publish electronically. Equally, it costs virtually nothing to access information published in this way at any time and place a member of the public chooses.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks Senator Norris and, in particular, Senator Henry and I have appointed ourselves as watchdogs with the aim of ensuring all new legislation takes full account of the relevance of new technology to traditional legislative needs to ensure &ndash; although it is hardly our job to do so &ndash; it gives effect to the Government's declared policy on information technology. When I first entered the House about six or seven years ago, Senator Henry and I took on the mantle of ensuring a date was included in legislation for the publication of accounts. For the first year I found myself tabling an amendment to every Bill introduced that accounts be published within three <Col N="1004" /> months. After a while the Government usually accepted that accounts should be published within six months. After one year I was delighted to discover that every Bill provided for the publication of accounts within six months, although I would prefer if they were published within three months.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that most Ministers accept our point of view. About three weeks ago the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, accepted the amendments we had tabled in this regard to the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill, 2000. Last week, another of the Minister's colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, accepted the gist of similar amendments to the Insurance Bill. He tabled his own amendment with a slighty different wording. I hope the Minister will see fit to join her colleagues with Senator Henry and me in the 21st century, especially since it is now Government policy to do as much of the State's business as possible electronically. The Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill provides for the publication of a register. In order to see what the register contains a person from Killybegs has to travel to Dublin during opening hours. It would be so much simpler to access the register on the Internet from one's own home without having to travel.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister wants this to be the perfect legislation. Everything she has done so far shows her commitment to it. I urge her to consider accepting the amendments which make much sense and would bring us into the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Quinn for a particular reason, that is, there is a history of these amendments being tabled, especially by himself. From very early on in this House, Senator Quinn pioneered the introduction of such amendments which have been accepted by a large number of Ministers with a degree of alacrity and a feeling that we are entering the new information age. If there were cogent arguments, therefore, against their acceptance, I imagine that they would have been made by the Minster's colleagues.</P>
      <P>There is nothing intrinsically peculiar about the Bill. There are no sensitivities in the wildlife which infest hedgerows, for example, that would be prejudiced by the publication of information about them on the electronic services. One is simply left with one conclusion, that is, if the amendment is not accepted, it is a question of practical politics. Because the Bill has already been passed by the Dáil, it would be inconvenient, especially in the run-up to Christmas, for the Government to accept an amendment which would mean the recommissioning of the Bill and sending it back to the Dáil. It is, therefore, easier, handier and cleaner not to accept it, but it would make a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant &ndash; I hope attention will be paid <Col N="1005" /> to this &ndash; that this House is making the running in pushing us towards a more sophisticated application of the communications system. I strongly urge acceptance of the amendment because of its intrinsic merit and also because it will demonstrate whether we are in a situation, which is not unique to the Minister &ndash; we frequently come up against it at this time of year &ndash; where pressure is exerted and we do not want to hear of the Bill being recommmitted to the Dáil. It will be most interesting to see whether it is accepted.</P>

      <P>I fully support the amendments tabled by Senators Quinn and Henry and on which Senator Norris has been outspoken. They are extremely valuable and innovative in the sense that the legislation has been introduced without reference to the publication of material by electronic means. The purpose of collating the data specified in the Bill is to ensure it is disseminated to as wide an audience as possible. According to the Bill, this will be done by way of placing a notice in a newspaper and by way of radio services, including local radio services.</P>

      <P>The one method that is missing is the one that is available across the board. It is the cheapest means of all, the simplest and most accessible. This is an excellent amendment. Given that the Minister is living in County Clare and Ennis is to the forefront in information technology, it is highly appropriate that the Minister should be seen to be forward looking by accepting all the amendments on the grounds that they are in keeping with Government policy. The Government is selling the country not only as the e-commerce hub of the Europe but, if one listens to the some of the statements being made, of the world. At the very least, we should have legislation which reflects this in terms of the dissemination of information on the Internet and the worldwide web.</P>
      <P>This is an eminently desirable amendment which marks the way forward. I envisage that, probably from next year, this kind of amendment will be included automatically in legislation by parliamentary counsel.</P>

      <P>The amendments are similar in nature in that they propose specific insertions in the Bill stipulating the publication by electronic means of the relevant information where, in section 12, the Minister proposes to make a right of way order over land not in the Minister's ownership; in section 16, the Minister gives notice of his or her intent to make an order designating a national heritage area, including where the address of the landowner cannot be found after reasonable inquiry; in section 18, the Minister proposes to amend or revoke a national heritage order; in section 36, the Minister publishes lists of holders of commercial shoot permits; in sections 56 and 57, the Minister designates ports, airports <Col N="1006" /> and other places through which protected species may be imported or exported to or from the European Union, and where, in section 58, the Minister makes, amends or revokes a designation for the purposes of regulating trade in protected species of wild flora and fauna.</P>
      <P>In the case of amendment No. 24 which relates to section 51, Senators wish the Bill to specify that it is prohibited to publish by electronic means an advertisement, catalogue, circular or price list relating to the buying or selling of a protected wild bird, wild animal or related elements. Apart from amendment No. 24, which I will deal with separately, there is no need for a specific provision of the type proposed by Senators Quinn and Henry in the Bill. The requirements already included in the relevant sections of the Bill normally to publish such information in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and-or at least one local newspaper represent only the minimum such requirement on the Minister under the Bill. From a legal standpoint, publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is of paramount importance as it effectively indicates to the Judiciary that the Minister has fulfilled his or her responsibility under the relevant section of the legislation. Publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is provided for in sections 15, 18, 56, 57 and 58.</P>
      <P>Publications in newspapers, as is provided for in sections 12, 16 and 18, is the most effective way of informing the people who are most likely to be interested in, for example, the designation of an NHA. This was brought home to me through the feedback received in my Department from the public as a consequence of the publication of such notices, particularly in local newspapers. The Senators might note that there is nothing in the Bill to preclude the Minister from disseminating such information in other ways also, including by electronic means, where it is considered necessary to do so. If I believe the information is not circulating satisfactorily to the people concerned, the use of electronic means to improve the situation will be considered. I do not wish, however, to have too many stipulations in the legislation as to how such information should be published.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24, which relates to section 51, is not necessary. I am satisfied that the publication of such an advertisement, catalogue, circular or price list by any means, including electronically, is comprehended by the existing wording. I accept the Senator's point that technology should be embraced to enhance the dissemination of information, including that relating to legislative affairs. Indeed, I have initiated work on the redesign of my Department's website and great improvements can be expected next year in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although it does not fall within my area of responsibility, it might be of interest to Senators to note that publication of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on the Internet is under consideration by the Government's supplies agency at present. When this happens, it will go a long way towards satisfying the Senators who have raised the issue of the dissemination of official information electronically with<Col N="1007" /> out the need to have it specified as a requirement either in this Bill or others. For the above reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most disappointed. There is no comparison between publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and publication on the web if we are trying to achieve easy access to information. The Minister says that publication of <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>on the Internet is under consideration. That is a reflection of how backward-thinking we are even though this nation has declared that it wishes to become the e-commerce hub of Europe. As Senator Costello reminded the House, the Minister comes from County Clare, and Ennis is setting high standards in this area.</P>
      <P>The same case has been made by other Ministers. However, they will find it hard to claim that something is sufficiently available to the public if it is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and that there is no need to publish it on the web. I am stunned by the Minister's remarks. It is her intention that this Bill will last for generations, yet she is not prepared to recognise how the world has changed in the past five years. It has changed dramatically. My children no longer communicate with pen and ink. They communicate from around the world by electronic means. The current generation is already doing so.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I can understand, with regard to amendment No. 24, that there might be distinctions among the various amendments. The Minister made such a distinction. I seek the Leas-Chathaoirleach's advice in this regard. I do not wish to put each amendment to a vote. If I put one of them to a vote, does that mean I cannot resubmit any of the other amendments on Report Stage?</P>

      <P>Thank you. I feel strongly about these amendments. I am not sure the Minister understood my point and I might not have been sufficiently articulate to explain it. I outlined a number of cases. There can be no excuse for excluding this means of communication. The Minister says there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Minister from publishing electronically. This is the 21st century, not the era of the pen and ink or, indeed, the quill. This is the era of electronic communication. I accept that the Minister wishes to communicate and to make this information available. A freedom of information Act will not be required to drag information from her because she is actively showing a willingness to provide it. I urge her, therefore, to reconsider and to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is significant although I doubt it will be accepted. I thought <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>was already on the web. That is the direction we are moving and I hope we will do it rapidly. It is important and would obviate the necessity for these amendments. Amendments such as these have regularly been accepted &ndash; indeed, I do not know of any occasion on which they have been refused. It is a practical political measure.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a little defensive on this issue and it is a characteristic in the Bill. However, I wish to take this opportunity to put on record the great help and courtesy I received from her staff in preparing my case for some amendments. They have been most helpful and I greatly appreciate it. That does not mean, however, that I will not put a few of the amendments to a vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the type of principle I have heard outlined from time to time and have seen in the Official Report of the proceedings in the Dáil on other matters. Ministers tend to say something is not really necessary because &ldquo;she can if she decides to do something&rdquo;. I am not sure that is the best way to handle matters, especially this type of technical amendment. It means a multiplication of labour. If the Minister must actively take a decision on each occasion, he or she is wasting his or her time. It is a waste of time to have to take niggling, footling decisions about whether to publish something. There are broader and more significant issues to concern the Minister.</P>
      <P>The beauty of these amendments is that, like the sexual orientation clause I pioneered in social legislation, once the Government accepts the principle and the amendments are included, they fill themselves in at every appropriate juncture in the legislation and automatically go into the system. It becomes inevitable, therefore, that there is publication on the web and the Minister and her officials need not waste their time worrying about it. It will happen as a matter of course. Senator Quinn is right to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister will not accept the amendments. The purpose of this House is to examine legislation and improve it, and that is what we are doing with these amendments. They are a definite improvement of the legislation. Just because legislation was drafted in that form in the past, it does not mean we should stick with it. It does not do justice to <Col N="1009" /> the Bill, which is fine legislation, that we would not incorporate the best means of providing access to information in relation to the areas with which it deals.</P>
      <P>There will be no better means available that is more accessible than using the Internet and the worldwide web. Rather than the Minister saying she will definitely not accept these amendments at this stage, it would be worth her while to speak to her advisers and the parliamentary counsel to ascertain how these amendments could be incorporated into the text of the Bill. Given that the Bill has been drafted in this traditional way and the Minister probably does not want to bring it back to the Dáil, or considers there is not enough time to do so, it would be disappointing if this legislation were to lose out on the inclusion of this imaginative and desirable series of amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who have taken part in this debate and I appreciate they all come from a genuine standpoint on this. I emphasise it is not the case that I am living in the dark ages and do not recognise we are moving into new technologies and that I am not prepared to accept them. We will incorporate the best possible means of disseminating information and that is being done in the approach taken in the Bill. There is no prohibition in the Bill on publication through electronic means. The Bill provides for what we refer to as &ldquo;the minimum requirements&rdquo;. We do not list every option, but what is in the Bill is the minimum requirement. I have checked this matter with the parliamentary counsel who is well aware of the importance of information technology but deemed it was not necessary to include the provisions proposed by the Senators.</P>
      <P>As some Senators said, I proudly represent a constituency that includes Ennis, the information age town. It is at the cutting edge of technology and I am proud of that. This section does not prohibit the use of new technologies and I will use the Internet when and where appropriate. There is no need for the Senators to voice the anxieties they voiced.</P>

It would be much simpler and much less costly to put this information on the Internet rather than in the newspapers. Newspapers are referred to in the Bill. I understand there is no prohibition to putting this information on the Internet. I thought the Minister wanted to ensure this would be good legislation that would last. <Col N="1010" /> The Minister used the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; when responding, but she will not be the Minister with responsibility for this area for the next 25 to 50 years. A future Minister may not feel obliged to be as open as the current Minister has shown herself to be. I urge her to reconsider her decision, as the inclusion of these amendments would enhance the Bill and achieve what she set out to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 26 and 27, to delete &ldquo;development by a local authority or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment. I ask the Minister the reason local authorities should be exempted from the definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; as laid out in the Bill, which includes any activity which destroys or significantly alters, damages or interferes with the integrity of a site or species in communities or habitats that come within the definition of a natural heritage area. Local authorities should set the example and we should not have an exemption for them.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are the bodies that should be the most responsible in ensuring that natural habitats are preserved and not damaged in any way. Local authorities have large areas of land in their ownership. They do a lot of work such as road building, drainage and road widening which would interfere with much of what would be determined as a natural habitat. I would have thought that the local authorities would be the obvious partnership body that would be to the forefront in ensuring that natural habitat areas were protected.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why an exemption should be given to a development by a local authority. It would have been sufficient to refer to development which is not exempted development for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I could have agreed to some degree with such an approach. Any developments by a local authority should also be included as works which would come within the definition contained in the Bill and the local authorities would be to the forefront in ensuring that works would not be undertaken by it or by any of its staff that would in any way undermine the intention of this legislation in relation to preserving our natural heritage areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I would like the Minister to explain the reason local authorities should be exempted. If we are talking about a designated natural heritage area or even a special area of conservation close to a public roadway, is it right for the local authority to acquire a portion of the designated area to widen or to realign that roadway? That is a practical example of the way a local authority could be involved with what is a designated natural heritage area or indeed a special area of conservation.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;works&rdquo; in the Bill includes any activity which destroys or significantly alters, damages or interferes with the integrity of the site or any of the species, communities or habitats. Many natural heritage areas, especially those in the west, are raised bogs and an amount of domestic turf cutting still takes place on these bogs. This was a controversial issue last year, especially in areas of Counties Galway, Roscommon and Sligo, and the Minister met a number of deputations in that regard. She also had to respond to some debates on it, including an Adjournment matter I initiated.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the agreement the Minister has arrived at has any statutory force because, as I understand it, she has allowed persons to extract, for their own domestic use, peat or turf from an area of bog that is in an SAC or an NHA. Am I to take it from this section, however, that that is banned because it can be argued easily that extracting turf or peat from a site in the ordinary way turf is cut or extracted on a raised or a blanket bog has the effect of altering the nature of the site? I would like the Minister's comments on that point as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would imagine that a very large number of developments would be developments undertaken by local authorities. It could even be a majority and for that reason it would substantially weaken the Bill if we exempt the majority of works. Local authorities are highly political and sometimes partisan entities. The Mullaghmore development is a classic example. If a local authority decided that it wished to pursue the inter<Col N="1013" /> ference with a site that was a natural heritage area, presumably it would have no difficulty if it were exempted under this clause. It would be difficult to restrain a local authority from embarking on the kind of development we saw at Mullaghmore and it is important, therefore, that we hear cogent reasons why all local authority works should be, by definition, exempted from the operation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Obviously there are certain reasons, for instance public health and safety, for which they can take action, for example, on the question of the line of vision on a dangerous curved road, and that is already addressed. I would be quite worried about this matter. Senator Costello has raised a valuable and interesting point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those of Senators Costello and Norris. On Second Stage we congratulated the Minister on the admirable and worthwhile objective she is trying to achieve in the Bill but we find that the greatest threat, local authorities, are to be excluded from this section. It does not seem to have been thought out. The rest of the Bill is worthwhile but the local authorities are often the very bodies which are not sympathetic to natural heritage areas and the Minister should think again before she excludes them from the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 is the first in a series of sections in the Bill that will form the legislative base for the protection and conservation of natural heritage areas.The section provides interpretations for terms used in the following nine sections dealing with NHAs, including the term &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Works in this context will not apply to any activities which require planning permission from local authorities. Such activities will be decided upon by the relevant local authority under planning legislation and taking into account the requirements of the NHA involved.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;works&rdquo; will not cover local authority own developments, which will be dealt with under the Planning and Development Act, 2000. With regard to works requiring planning permission and local authority own development, there are controls in planning legislation and in this Bill to ensure that NHAs are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to set out the protection afforded to NHAs in the case of local authority own developments. Section 24(2) repeals section 12(3)(f2&gt;b) of the principal Act and is one of the most important improvements introduced in the Bill. Section 12(3)(b) of the principal Act effectively exempted local authorities from having to consult the Minister concerning works affecting nature reserves or refuges. This provision was wholly inappropriate and is being repealed to strengthen the protection afforded to nature reserves and refuges and to notified and designated NHAs. Local authorities will be compelled under the Bill to consult my Department concerning works in <Col N="1014" /> such sensitive areas and to take steps to avoid and minimise any interference with such sites.</P>
    <P>Wildlife legislation is not alone in affording protection to NHAs, as such provisions are also included in planning legislation. Part 10 of the 1994 planning and development regulations sets out the procedures to be followed in respect of local authority own developments. Under these regulations there is a specific requirement on local authorities to notify my Department in respect of proposed developments affecting sites of geological, scientific or nature conservation interest. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has assured me that any similar regulations to be introduced as a consequence of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, will specifically provide for consultation with my Department in respect of local authority development within NHAs. For these reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The issue of special areas of conservation does not arise under this legislation but I wish to clarify the points raised by Senator Connor. The Minister has responsibility for the designation of SACs and there is an appeals system. Compensation and activities allowed within SACs are open to an arbitrator. The Senator expressed concerns regarding the cutting of turf and I presume he is referring to raised bogs in his locality. I met with those concerned about this issue. The Senator is correct to state that there is some cutting of turf for domestic use and this is allowed. There has been a derogation, if one wishes to call it that, for ten years since I initiated this programme concerning the cutting of turf for domestic use. We are referring only to the cutting of turf for domestic use. Senator Connor has strong views on this issue, which does not come within the ambit of this Bill. Perhaps the Senator will write to me so we can clarify further points he may wish to raise on this matter.</P>

      <P>In advance of writing to the Minister, do I take it that the cutting of turf for domestic use does not involve &ldquo;works&rdquo; as defined in this Bill? Domestic turf can be extracted by machinery which is not banned under the Minister's ten year moratorium. I am not talking about bogs in SACs but raised bogs in many areas of the west which are in natural heritage areas. These bogs are not as yet defined as special areas of conservation but are designated as natural heritage areas.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister I am more confused than before. The Minister is exempting developments by local authorities from the definition of works which refers to destroying, altering, damaging or interfering with the integrity of NHAs. The Minister has done so because this issue is covered by planning legislation or the Planning and Development Act, 2000. I do not see how this is the case. What planning provisions cover developments by local authorities? Even if such developments are covered, it is highly suspect that local authorities are excluded from the legislation as they deal with developments which do not have to conform to the precise definition in the legislation. Local authorities own large areas of land and deal with an enormous amount of building and development. We are not talking about one body but about the plethora of developments which take place under the aegis of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting this matter is covered in other legislation, so why not dovetail all legislation so that every organisation is subject to the same provisions and take it out anyway? If it is covered already then it does not need to be included in the first place. By exempting developments by local authorities from the legislation, the Minister is raising the suspicion that, in some way, the application of the legislation to local authorities is different from its application to any other person or body who might intentionally or unintentionally interfere with a natural habitat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken the issue of NHAs extremely seriously and understand and respect the fact that they are of unique and out<Col N="1016" /> standing national importance. When drafting the legislation I decided it was not enough to provide temporary protection for NHAs, as proposed up to now. Rather than rely on compulsory purchase orders, which are divisive and cause long-term bitterness, I wanted to ensure a fair, open and equitable approach to natural heritage areas and the implementation of that regime. I assure Senators that there is a strong package of safeguards in place under the Bill and planning legislation to ensure that NHAs are comprehensively protected. Section 24 places new and clear obligations on a local authority to safeguard NHAs, including in respect of activities requiring planning permission. Under this section local authorities are compelled to consult with my Department in relation to such sensitive areas and to take steps to avoid or minimise interference.</P>
      <P>Further protection for NHAs is provided directly in planning legislation. As a consequence of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, each county development plan prepared by a local authority shall include mandatory objectives for the conservation and protection of NHAs. Section 178 of the Act provides that no development may be undertaken which would materially contravene a county development plan. This section, when taken in conjunction with section 10(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Act, affords specific and mandatory protection for NHAs in the case of works which are subject to planning permission. It is not a question of local authorities having less obligation with regard to NHAs than an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a local authority draws up a county or city development plan does not mean it contains a comprehensive protection mechanism. Plans are drawn up every five years but the work does not begin until the end of that period, which means that the timeframe is relatively short. As we are all aware, plans omit huge areas, for example, buildings and areas of land which have not been identified at the time. It is not, therefore, an infallible document in any sense.</P>
      <P>The fact that the local authority has to consult with the Department in relation to developments is not the same; it is the provision of information. What mechanism exists within the Department to examine in detail the plans submitted by a local authority? I imagine that the case put forward by a local authority will generally get the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Minister. It is very unlikely that a Department official will survey and examine a development which has been described in a certain way by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that if a development materially contravenes a development plan it will be contrary to the legislation. She said that the body of legislation set out in section 24 covers local authorities and, therefore, she will not accept my amendment which specifically refers to local <Col N="1017" /> authorities. If she is so sure that the legislation already in place covers local authorities, why not include them in this legislation so that the exact same provisions apply? I am not satisfied that local authorities are covered in all cases under the Bill and I, therefore, press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the Senator's mind at rest, I have established within my Department a <Col N="1018" /> section which deals with planning matters and applications and ensured there is adequate staff to deal with these issues. The Planning and Development Act, 2000, and this Bill will dovetail and be complementary as regards the provision of protection for NHAs.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the points I made earlier concerning the term &ldquo;works&rdquo; and where this places turf extraction by machinery from a raised bog designated a natural heritage area. The Minister put in place an agreement last year, which I understand is not statutory, which places a moratorium of ten years on the prohibition on turf cutting and extraction for domestic purposes and I understand it covers NHAs and special areas of conservation. It is a pity it is not stated in the legislation, especially if the concession the Minister made is to have the full force of law and is not to be questioned under this section of the Bill. Local authorities are excluded. The Minister placed a moratorium of ten years on the prohibition of something which could easily be defined as works, especially if the extraction is done by machinery.</P>
      <P>None of us deny that the extraction of peat on either a raised or blanket bog changes the character of the bog. Nonetheless, the extraction of turf for domestic heating purposes is a timeless pursuit in rural Ireland. I agree with the Minister's concession but I require clarification. We do not want to find her concession set aside when the Bill is enacted. It will be deemed that what people do by extracting turf amounts to &ldquo;works&rdquo; as defined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the issue of raised bogs under the regime of SACs. We refer in this legislation to NHAs. The Senator's question as to what constitutes works is important and forms the kernel of the debate. Works in terms of domestic turf cutters may continue as long as there is no significant damage. Works may continue using machinery and, if there is no significant damage, they may continue until the ten years period is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still unhappy, although I am delighted with the assurances the Minister has given. It is a case of defining what is meant by damage. Where does one cross the point between what is and is not damage? The definition of works is very wide. If a local authority wishes to realign a road through a natural heritage area, for example, a raised bog, it will not have any difficulty in gouging out a large section of the raised bog to insert metal to realign the road. However, it will obviously generate great anger on the part of people who rely solely on their own turf for domestic heating, which they extract from a site which belongs to them, that they cannot extract a small amount of peat on an annual basis beyond nine or ten years while the local authority can <Col N="1019" /> gouge out a great section of the bog to realign a road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We could continue this debate indefinitely. It is sufficient to say that these issues are of concern to many people in rural areas. I always believe in progressing these issues with a great deal of consultation to see where we can achieve agreement. What I said about domestic cutting can and will continue, if that is the wish of the land owner, for the next nine years. As long as there is not any significant damage those works can continue. This is done on a case by case basis and it is impossible to generalise. If the Senator has any specific cases he wishes to raise, and he has raised this matter in the context of <Col N="1020" /> SACs in an Adjournment matter, I will be only too happy to attempt to answer them in writing. The issue of the SACs is not part of this debate. The NHAs are an important part of it and the significant damage criteria will apply to NHAs as well as SACs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (1), line 36, after &ldquo;area.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Any person may notify the Minister in writing of his or her wish to have a particular site or sites designated as a natural heritage area. The Minister, having received such a letter, shall cause an assessment to be made of the site having regard to <i>section 16(6)(a)</i>. Where the Minister is of the opinion, having regard to<i> subsection </i>6)(a), that the land forms, or is part of a natural heritage area, the Minister shall inform the proposer of the site of his or her intention to make an order designating the land as a natural heritage order.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is by no means intended as a vexatious amendment, although phrases including the word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; were used in earlier debates, with, I am sure, no disrespect whatsoever intended to the NGOs involved. Since the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, I have been lobbied by the Irish Wildlife Trust to table this amendment again. It opens up the possibility of the ordinary citizen notifying the Minister of a wish to have an area declared as a natural heritage area. In terms of openness, accountability, transparency and public participation, this is a valuable amendment. We should be involving the public as much as possible in the declaration of these sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have looked at the debates that took place both in Select Committee and on Report Stage in the Dáil. In reply to a similar amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister says the responsibility for proposing and designating sites rightly resides with the Minister. She has run two ideas together. Nobody could quarrel with the fact that it is a proper function of the Minister to designate sites, but should the Minister alone have the absolute right to propose sites for designation? There is a distinction between proposing and <Col N="1021" /> designating. The ordinary citizen should have a right to propose such sites.</P>
    <P>I noticed that during the debate in select committee, Deputy O'Shea said representations had been made to him. He said he looked at the situation and, on balance, decided that the Minister had a good case. It is very interesting to see, however, what happened when the Bill was considered on Report Stage in the Dáil Chamber. Deputy O'Shea said that while he had reservations on Committee Stage he now felt more strongly as a result of the debate that the Minister should consider the matter. He felt that the points made in the debate were sufficiently persuasive for him to wish that the Minister would take this matter into consideration. In a second contribution, Deputy O'Shea referred to the matter again and said that by the time the Bill reached the Seanad, he hoped the Minister would have had the opportunity to review the matter, either proposing an amendment herself or accepting such an amendment.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons this amendment should be accepted, in addition to the general one of principle that I have stated. The first is that the current provisions of the Bill represent a top-down decision-making process. In other words, the Minister makes the decision and the local authorities, individuals and NGOs fall into place and have no real role. I recognise that, as the Minister said, they can write to her &ndash; big deal. She could not prohibit them from writing. She does go one small stage further, however, in saying she would welcome such letters, but that is weak stuff, particularly when one realises that we are all part of the European Union. One of the principles we have been hammered with time and again is that of subsidiarity. In this section, however, subsidiarity is turned on its head.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the issue of Agenda 21, which was agreed at the earth summit and specifically requires the Government to encourage participation in precisely these kinds of areas. The Government gave its assent to this idea, yet it goes against it when it has an opportunity to support it in the Bill. For all those reasons, there is a strong argument in favour of accepting this amendment.</P>
    <P>The question of vexatiousness may be raised and there may be a real element in this &ndash; for example, if a landowner wanted to cause trouble by trying to have his or her neighbour's land registered as an area of natural heritage. That is just an incidental by-product, however. In Roman Catholic theology there is some phrase which describes the law of second effect &ndash; I cannot remember exactly what it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I am on very dodgy ground. <Col N="1022" /> I agree wholeheartedly with that and I shall speak privately to the Senator later. It is not the specific, primary intention of the amendment. In any case, if it is a valuable area of natural heritage, it may not have been the intention of a vexatious proposer principally to preserve the heritage, but that will be the effect. The annoyance caused to a neighbour is incidental and I am sure there are other ways of mitigating it.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment. I will be pushing it, although I am sure the Minister knows that I do not intend to be difficult. I had tabled at least one other amendment which, after consultation, I withdrew from the Order Paper because I was satisfied. The only amendments I have left down are those where I still have a clear cause for concern.</P>

      <P>My amendment says much the same thing as that of Senator Norris, although his has the advantage of being shorter, more to the point and clearer. Both amendments are concerned with the speedier provision of fuller information to the owners of designated sites. I will not repeat the case made by Senator Norris. I will withdraw my amendment and I think we should concentrate on the amendment in the name of Senator Norris, rather than complicating the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 sets down procedures for the publication notice of NHA designation proposals and the notification of those with an interest in the land. The amendments would, on a statutory basis, allow any person to recommend a site for designation as an NHA. If a formal role in the process was given to the public generally under law, there would be a real danger that the process would become unwieldy and unworkable. There would also be the possibility that dubious motives might be behind such proposals.</P>
      <P>It will, however, be open to the public to make suggestions regarding designations. While my Department will consider any suggestions made by NGOs or other groups or individuals regarding the appropriateness of areas for designation, given my statutory responsibility generally for NHAs, the real implications of designations for private landowners, the adminstrative effort involved and the risk that formal third party input could be divisive, it is appropriate that definitive responsibility for designations should remain with the Minister of the day. In this instance, it would be unwise to go down the road proposed. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they would create extra work. I would strongly support the Minister in looking for extra staff. There is a strong case to be made for extra staff in this entire area. The Seanad would support the Minister in her efforts to secure more staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> What is vexatiousness? The motivation of the person making the recommendation would not really matter if at the end of the day the effect would be to protect our heritage. That is the crucial aspect.</P>
    <P>If one wants the people to be involved and cherish the wildlife of the country and our heritage in this area, taking this rather paternalistic or, in the case of the Minister, maternalistic approach to the subject does not encourage the public to become involved, although I absolutely accept the Minister's good intention. I am quite certain, knowing the Minister, that she would take seriously representations made, although they would have no formal status.</P>

I have always had an open door policy, as can be seen from the work done on the Bill. This is ackowledged not only by the NGOs with which I have been in contact but also by many Dáil Deputies. Organisations and individuals with an interest in the area have been waiting well over a decade for legislation such as this to be published and placed on the Statute Book.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 specifies that every affected person be notified of a proposed NHA designation. How far has the designation of such sites progressed? Does the Minister consider half of the potential sites are identified and designated? What percentage of them are not designated? I take it a summary investigation has been carried out of all the possible sites throughout the <Col N="1025" /> country. People, especially in the area from where I come, are confused as to why certain sites have been designated as NHAs and SACs while others, which appear to be equally important, have not been designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Connor said. It would be helpful if a map of such sites was placed in each local authority, as many people are confused about how sites are designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As of yet, there has not been any formal designation of NHAs. Where possible we would be happy to provide at local level the information, including maps, sought by Senator Burke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>NHA sites and SAC sites are well identified in the area in which I live. They are coterminous in that many NHAs are also SACs. I am often asked if there are many other areas in respect of which preliminary investigations show a possibility of designation as NHAs. Many counties in the west, including Roscommon where I live and counties Longford and Mayo, typically have relatively small sites of 200 acres or 500 acres or larger sites of 1,000 acres of untouched raised bog. People are surprised that some of those sites have not been designated, especially when they consider the sites that have been identified for designation. I understand the Government is under pressure from the EU to designate a much greater area of sites, especially as SACs. I ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to address those issues. The Senator interweaved the SACs and the NHAs. We are referring particularly to NHAs, not SACs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed designations of SACs have been sent to the European Commission and the full number of sites will be submitted by the end of the month. With regard to NHAs, some preliminary work has been done on that, but there has not been any formal designation of such sites. The identification of sites as SACs is carried out on a scientific basis.</P>
      <P>The Senator is correct in saying a number of NGOs and individuals would like a far greater number of sites designated than are currently designated, but that is a debate for another day. We are talking about two specific issues, SACs and NHAs. With regard to the preliminary work that has been done on NHAs, we will do our best to furnish the Senator with any information we have on that, particularly regarding his local area. We would welcome further discussions with him on those.</P>

      <Col N="1026" /> SECTION 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (1), line 30, after &ldquo;measures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including management plans&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The concept of this amendment is to include management plans in order to avoid provisions that may be too general. Rather than having vague guidelines, the inclusion of more detailed plans would be much more likely to protect the environment in the manner sought. That is the reason Senator Costello tabled this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be proper to refer specifically to management plans in this section. An NHA order may include whatever provisions are required to provide for the conservation of the site, including stipulations concerning the management of the site. In addition to management plans, there are various other types of plans or protective measures that could well be relevant to the conservation of an NHA. Examples of these could include the habitats conservation guidelines, commonage framework plans, individual farm plans and aquaculture zoning plans. It would not be appropriate or necessary to detail all of those in primary legislation.</P>
      <P>One danger of detailing such a list is that the validity of employing a measure not included on the list could be called into question. Additionally, it is possible that further types of conservation measures, which are not currently in existence, could be devised at a future date. Therefore, I cannot agree to include a reference to management plans, as sought by the Senators, as to do so is not only unnecessary but ultimately it could weaken the protection afforded to NHAs by limiting the range of conservation measures the Minister could employ to ensure the conversation of NHAs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 20, subsection (1), line 2, after &ldquo;land&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or where the Minister has issued a notice in accordance with <i>section 16, </i><Col N="1027" /> and where a decision under <i>section 17 </i>or <i>18 </i>has not yet been made&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reply to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 is pivotal in relation to the protection that can be afforded to NHAs. It provides for the imposition of restrictions on the carrying out of works which are likely to destroy or significantly damage an NHA. Such works may not be carried out without first obtaining the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. Where consent to works is refused, the affected person may object within 30 days and has the right to have the case heard by an independent arbitrator whose decision shall be binding. These amendments concern the issue of protection for notified as opposed to designated NHAs. In effect, it proposes to afford the full protection of the Wildlife Acts to notified NHAs.</P>
      <P>The issue of the potential damage that may be caused to NHAs during the notification stage has been raised during Committee and Report Stages of this Bill in the Dáil and it has also been raised by a number of NGOs. I recognise that the interim period between notification and designation is a potentially dangerous one. While the vast majority of farmers and other landowners would not set out to cause damage, I am conscious that proposed NHAs could be open to damage by unscrupulous individuals during the notification stage.</P>
      <P>In recognition of these concerns, I have devised a package of amendments to the Bill aimed at ensuring the damage to notified NHAs can be prevented. These improvements, which I introduced on Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, will secure my overall objective, which is to have a system for NHAs that guarantees their permanent protection in a fair and balanced manner while eliminating the need for compulsory purchase. Specifically, in section 19(2) I have introduced an amendment which requires that a person shall not carry out any potentially damaging works in a notified NHA without first giving three months' notice to the Minister. Proceeding with works without such notification would constitute an offence. In most cases it would be possible to make a final decision on the designation of an NHA within the three month period. These provisions could be considered together with section 20 of the Bill, which enables me to apply to the courts to seek the prohibition of such works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also introduced an amendment strengthening section 21 of the Bill to enable me to order the restoration of a site damaged during the notification period once the site is designated an NHA. I am advised that it would not be proper to invoke such a power prior to designation. In addition, I introduced an amendment to section <Col N="1028" /> 24 to place a requirement on other Departments and certain public bodies, including planning authorities, to consult with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to any proposed works and to avoid damage to important sites. That has been extended to cover notified NHAs in addition to designated NHAs. Section 50 of the Bill places a similar obligation on the Commissioners of Public Works when undertaking drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>Overall, these are reasonable and appropriate measures to ensure that notified NHAs can be protected without placing an overly onerous or unfair burden on the landowner. In light of the legal advice afforded me I have gone as far as it is possible to go in providing protection to notified NHAs. I am satisfied that the Bill clearly provides that significant damaging works in notified NHAs can be prohibited. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to be difficult but I support amendment No. 10. My amendment No. 11 is similar to it. I repeat the point I made on Second Stage that it is difficult to restore a site of natural heritage. It is not the same as restoring a building, as that can be done easily, but here one is talking about a delicate eco-system and restoration is not a completely parallel situation. However, I will not push the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor made a good point about another section which also applies to this section. The Minister gave concessions to people allowing them to cut turf on their own lands for ten years. Nobody cuts turf with a slean any more, while the sausage machine has not been used for years. Most turf is cut by large excavators, which can cause a fair amount of damage if the turf is being cut on a commercial basis. What constitutes significant damage?</P>
      <P>One year of the ten-year concession given by the Minister has already passed. Must those with such concessions apply to the Department for permission to cut turf according to section 19 of this Bill? The Minister has not put the same restraint on local authorities. What happens if a gas line goes through one of these areas? There would be significant work involved in putting a pipe line through western areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Minister allowed people to cut turf in SACs for ten years, which was very much appreciated. In some situations alternative bog sites were bought to relocate people. My reading of this is that there is no guarantee in an NHA that permission will be given to extract peat and that should be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, the Senator keeps referring to issues that come under the special areas of conservation or SACs. He referred to the compensation scheme intro<Col N="1029" /> duced last year and the fact that domestic turf cutters were given ten year allowances.</P>
      <P>I refer again to the situation I mentioned when replying to Senator Connor. When we are talking about what works entail we are concerned only where significant damage would be caused to the particular bog. The Senator asked for a definition but this will be taken on a case by case basis and one cannot make sweeping generalisations about such cases. We are talking here about cases where there is significant damage and a great deal of the works carried out by domestic cutters would not cause significant damage. Where there is significant damage there would be a case to answer. However, this would be seen on a case by case basis in consultation with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister is saying is that before a person cuts turf he or she must apply to her Department. Is that the situation? She said it will be taken case by case. Does it mean that every landowner wishing to cut turf for domestic use will have to apply to her Department on an annual basis once this Bill passes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand why Senators are trying to make some play out of this, as it is an issue that affects a number of people. However, the situation regarding SACs is well understood; we are looking here at protection for NHAs. We want the domestic cutter to be able to continue cutting his or her turf, if that is their decision. There was a compensation scheme for those who wished to end cutting if they did so in the first year of the proposals put forward last year. If the cutter decides to continue cutting, as long as there is no significant damage that work can continue for the following nine years. Whether or not that work is damaging will be assessed on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>If the Senator has any particular issues he wishes to raise about the SAC scheme already in existence he is welcome to contact me about specific cases. In general terms I have always approached these issues based on consultation and openness.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 is an alternative to amendment No. 12 and they are to be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 20, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), to delete lines 23 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(iii)not later than 6 months after the Minister is notified in writing pursuant to <i>section 19(1)(a)</i>, the Minister shall notify the occupier or owner of his or her decision; the Minister may extend the period in <i>section 19(1)(b)(iii)</i> by a further period of up to 3 months and when so extended the Minister <Col N="1030" /> shall inform the owner or occupier of the reason for this decision before the first 6 months period has lapsed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from a stipulation in section 19 requiring a landowner to notify the Minister if he or she wants to carry out work on a designated natural heritage area. In that case the Minister can either immediately prohibit such work or agree to its being carried out. If the Minister does not do either of those within six months of being notified, the landowner can proceed with this work without any hindrance.</P>
    <P>That provides a kind of lacuna within which an unscrupulous person can operate and it opens up the possibility of an undesirable development taking place. It could be argued that this is unlikely but it is clearly possible and we are putting a legal requirement on the Minister to reply within a six month period. That is not too onerous and I do not know why there should be so defensive an attitude to it. It is perfectly appropriate that there should be a legal requirement. It may be unlikely, and I doubt if it will happen to this Minister, but if there is a dereliction in duty by a Minister, why should there not be a legal sanction? No citizen, including a Minister, should be seen to be above the law. I do not understand why anybody should be exempt in this way from the provisions of the Bill and, therefore, we are right to press the amendment.</P>
    <P>In the select committee the Minister accepted it was possible that there might be a systems failure within the Department. Human error is possible and the way we try to safeguard against that is by saying there will be fairly serious consequences if it happens. A Member of the other House raised the possibility of postal failure and so on. They are all possibilities but it is important that we protect our heritage in every way possible. I do not understand why there should not be a requirement because it is clear that if there is neglect or an oversight, or if something does not happen, landowners could inadvertently find themselves being able to proceed with a completely undesirable development. That is without even contemplating the possibility of a corrupt Minister. I am not raising that question because I do not believe it is likely. It is a possibility but it is not likely. Far more likely is something happening by accident and we indicate the seriousness with which we take this matter by implementing this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's amendment No. 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that a landowner must notify the Minister if he or she wishes to carry out work on a designated NHA. The Minister can either prohibit such work or agree to its being carried out. If the Minister does neither within six months of being notified, the landowner can proceed with the work. It is reasonable that the landowners have an assurance that they will have a decision on these proposed works <Col N="1031" /> within a specified period. The Attorney General's office is also strongly of this view. I am satisfied that six months is a reasonable period within which to make a decision both from the point of view of the landowner and of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Senators Norris and Ross would put an obligation on the Minister to notify the landowner within a six month period or, failing that, to extend the period for decision by a further three months, in which case the Minister would be obliged to give a decision before the expiry of a cumulative nine months. Variations on this proposal arose in the Dáil and the Attorney General strongly advised against such a provision as it would leave the Minister of the day unduly and unnecessarily exposed to legal action. Furthermore, the placing of an obligation in law on a Minister to reply within a set date, while allowing that Minister to vary the time period involved, would not constitute good law.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, O'Meara and Ryan propose that an onus be put on the owners, occupiers or users of land to give a further 14 days' notice to the Minister at the conclusion of the stipulated six months period for a decision on proposed works on a designated NHA. That would not be satisfactory. Effectively it would involve the use of the applicant as part of the management process to ensure that his or her application was not overlooked. That would be unfair. It would be a most unusual approach and would not constitute good legislation, neither would such drafting be to the liking of the Attorney General's office. I appreciate, however, that the amendment is motivated by a desire to avoid the damaging of any NHA through the failure of the Minister to communicate a decision within the six month period.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some NGOs raised concerns about the possibility of the Minister not replying within six months on purpose to allow development to proceed in a somewhat underhand way. Such fears are not well founded. I would not approach my responsibilities in such a cynical way. There is always the possibility of replies not being issued due to pressure of work, oversight, etc. However, that is something I intend to have addressed through proper management systems in respect of processes in my Department and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put her finger on it. She has admitted this could happen because of pressure of work. We heard during the day, and I am sympathetic to this, that Department officials, particularly in the areas of scientific inquiry, may be over-worked and understaffed so we have opened up a situation where, with no ill will at all, this may happen within the six month period. Some of the research into the nature of an area to determine whether it is to be considered an area of natural heritage could be complex and <Col N="1032" /> might need, for various reasons &ndash; the light patterns of the insects, animals, birds or plants involved &ndash; a longer period than that proposed. We are looking for a three month extension.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to record that I would exonerate the Minister from any cynical intention to benefit somebody by default or by neglect, but the possibility exists because of the situation of understaffing and overwork and the complicated nature of the work involved.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General is an extremely able, gifted and fine person but he is probably a little conservative in these areas and it will not surprise Members on any side of the House to hear me say that. This is a significant amendment and it would be helpful if it were accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given these reasons on great reflection. In a Department such as ours we would like to see greater staff and resources. Everyone in this House and in the lower House would support that particular view. In my tenure of office I was pleased to increase the number of rangers. We have 40 extra rangers on the ground to support us in what we want to do. I also have over 20 extra administrative staff and three regional colleges working within their own respective areas. I understand some of the arguments being put forward by Senator Norris but his amendment is not the way we should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In the select committee Deputy O'Shea said he would like to see a provision which approaches the matter in a different way in that, at the end of the six month period, the onus would be put back on the applicant to indicate to the Minister that he or she has received no decision in the matter. That would allow the Minister a further period of grace of a fortnight to make that reply. During the select committee hearings the Minister indicated she thought this was a reasonable proposal which she would examine. However, as I understand it, no such amendment was tabled by the Government and the legislation has not been amended. Why not? I would be prepared to accept this proposal in substitution for my amendment just to show I am fairly reasonable. However, I do not believe the Minister has included it in the legislation.</P>
      <P>It does not seem much to ask that an applicant be given a decision as whether he or she is or is not allowed to proceed. Why should an applicant not be entitled to such a decision? If my amendment is not accepted, why not give applicants the opportunity to be informed if it is merely a case of an oversight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable proposal from a lay person's point of view and that is why I put it to our legal advisers. Their advice was that it placed an onerous task on an applicant and, therefore, would not be fair or just. That is why I am unable to accept the proposal. From a lay person's point of view, the proposal sounded emi<Col N="1033" /> nently reasonable but I am told that, in law, it would not be seen as such.</P>

      <P>In page 20, subsection (2), line 32, to delete &ldquo;3&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello tabled this amendment to strengthen the Bill by providing for six months rather than three months notification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to amend section 19(2) which requires that a person shall not carry out potentially damaging works in a notified NHA without first giving three months notice to the Minister. Proceeding with works without giving such notification will constitute an offence. In most cases it will be possible to make a final decision on designation of an NHA within the three month period. Furthermore, section 20 enables the Minister to apply to the courts to seek the prohibition of such works.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the notification period given to the Minister before undertaking works in a notified NHA can be extended from three to six months. It is considered that the requirement for three months notification amounts to placing a burden on a landowner. The Attorney General's office is clear that any burden placed on a landowner in such circumstances must be reasonable and the legal advice is that a period of three months is appropriate. However, the imposition of a restriction of six months on a landowner runs the real danger of being found to be unreasonable and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of allowing sufficient time to the Minister, a period of three months is adequate to facilitate necessary action. Three months allows time for the Minister to undertake an assessment of the implications of the proposed works to a notified NHA, to move to designate the site as an NHA if deemed appropriate or to proceed to seek a court injunction in the event of it being considered necessary to do so. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to limit the application of section 21, which gives the Minister powers to order restoration of damaged NHAs. There is a danger that this amendment could lead to a weakening of the protection afforded to NHAs. In general I do not anticipate <Col N="1035" /> that a direction to restore a site will be made after consent has been given to works under section 19. However, I draw the Senator's attention to the fact that conditions can be attached to a consent issued under section 19. In such cases works will be carried out pursuant to section 19 consent. It would be prudent to have the power to require that restoration be undertaken in regard to such cases. It could well happen that a person who obtains consent to carry out works under section 19 does not subsequently abide by the conditions attached to the consent. If damage is caused to an NHA in such cases it could well be that restoration would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>If the words proposed by the Senators, &ldquo;otherwise in accordance with section 19&rdquo;, were inserted in this section it could be a matter of argument or interpretation as to whether the person who had consent, albeit subject to conditions, had acted in accordance with section 19. The Senators' proposal would, therefore, leave open the possibility that a person could seek to evade having to carry out restoration on an NHA in cases where restoration would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>It may be that the Senators are concerned about a hypothetical scenario where a person could be directed to restore a site after they had carried out works in good faith, having obtained consent under section 19. I assure them it is not the intention that this section could be used in this manner. I have absolutely no doubt that it would not be proper nor would it be legally feasible to given a person consent and then require him or her to restore the site if damage was caused as a result of actions taken on foot of that consent. I cannot, therefore, accept the proposal as it would lead to a weakening of the protection of NHAs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before section 22, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;22.&ndash;Where works are carried out on land, an application under <i>section 20</i> may not be made, nor may a direction under <i>section 21</i> be <Col N="1036" /> given, later than 10 years from the date of the carrying out of the works concerned.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>While I understand the intention of the Senators in the amendment, having considered it in detail I cannot accept it for a number of reasons. The amendment would give rise to practical difficulties. The essence of the problem is the requirement that would exist to establish definitively when the alleged works within an NHA were carried out. This would necessitate establishing the specific dates involved. It would be extremely difficult to prove the exact date or dates when the relevant works were carried out, particularly if a number of years had passed, which is likely in the scenario envisaged by the Senators.</P>
      <P>The obligation on the Minister to determine precisely where works were carried out could be used quite effectively by owners/occupiers of lands as a way to avoid having to restore the lands in question. I am determined when restoration is an option in the case of alleged damage to NHAs that my Department should act expeditiously to remedy it by endeavouring where appropriate to have the site restored as soon as is reasonably possible.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage a scenario where my Department would intervene more than ten years after the works had allegedly been undertaken to order the restoration of an NHA. In any event I expect that after such a period it would prove extremely difficult to restore an NHA effectively. I cannot agree to the amendment on these grounds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment draws attention to one of the principal changes which will result from the legislation that will affect our approach to the conservation of wildlife in Ireland. The House may be surprise to note that the Wildlife Act, 1976, excluded from its general scope all fish and aquatic invertebrate species. In practical terms, such an approach at the time meant that tens of thousands of species from both marine and freshwater ecosystems were off limits from conservation consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While such a scenario may have been understandable in 1976 it would be completely at variance with events today when an ecosystem or holistic-based approach to biodiversity conservation is adopted. The legislation brings all wild <Col N="1037" /> animal as well as wild plant species within the scope of the Act, apart from certain species relevant to fisheries, whether commercial or recreational, which will be excluded. The section contains a provision which provides for the exclusion of species relevant to fisheries which will in turn be specified in regulations to be made under the section.</P>
    <P>The intention is that species relevant to any type of fishery can be excluded by listing them under the regulations. Species listed are likely to be relevant to existing commercial fisheries or to other types of fishing such as sport or recreational fisheries, for example, coarse fish. Species which are not yet subject to commercial exploitation but which are under consideration or are the subject of trials to investigate their potential for exploitation or which may become so in the future may be listed under the regulations. Limiting excludable species, as proposed in the amendment, to those fit for commercial exploitation would be overly restrictive.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the overall change in the scope of the Act to comprehend the vast majority of wild species represents a fundamental departure in wildlife conservation in Ireland. Such broadening of the basis of wildlife legislation is of great significance as it establishes a new and comprehensive framework within which the conservation of biodiversity can be addressed in advance. I cannot accept the amendment in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 44, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>)(i)in subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), by the insertion of the following after &lsquo;ditch':</P>
      <P>&lsquo;provided cutting is confined to strictly what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety',</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;provided cutting is confined to strictly <Col N="1038" /> what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety',&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The matter has been discussed at some length on various Stages of the Bill. It is intended to confine the cutting of hedgerows and ditches and so on strictly to what is necessary for reasons of public health and safety. Nobody is arguing against public health and safety if these questions are involved but, if not, we feel that the hedgerow and its life should be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the cutting of hedgerows and other vegetation during the restricted period by those involved in the practices of forestry or agriculture should be permitted only where public health and safety concerns apply. Such an amendment is not appropriate. I have already introduced a number of new provisions in the section which have strengthened the protection afforded to hedgerows, principally because of their key role as nesting places for birds.</P>
      <P>These provisions include a categorical statement that the section applies to hedgerows; a six week extension of the period during which hedgerows and other vegetation may not be cut &ndash; the revised period will run from 1 March to 31 August; permitting Government Departments and statutory bodies, including local authorities, to cut hedgerows during the restricted period only where public health and safety concerns arise; and empowering the Minister, where it is considered necessary, to request details from Government Departments and statutory bodies, including local authorities, of works undertaken and specifically the public health and safety reasons for such works.</P>
      <P>The Senator will agree that these provisions represent major progress in the protection of our hedgerows and the species nesting therein. These restrictions are sufficient in the present climate. Imposing restrictions on members of the farming community, for example, could be counterproductive in that it could encourage farmers to regard hedgerows, ditches and vegetation as a hindrance or an inconvenience, which is not the message I am trying to get across in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Hedgerows in Ireland originated for the most part in the 17th century. We must not forget that many of our hedgerows would not exist were it not for the farming or forestry practices in recent centuries. The way forward is not to have farmers living in fear of prosecution when they cut back a hedgerow, but instead to build on their goodwill by encouraging them to manage their hedgerows in a conservation-friendly way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The REP scheme administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, which promotes the conservation and maintenance of features that make up the farmland landscape, constitutes a good <Col N="1039" /> example of this approach in action. Among the measures included in the REP scheme are controls over the removal of field boundaries and requirements for farmers to maintain and repair hedgerows. Such measures are backed by incentives.</P>
    <P>The popularity and success of the REP scheme demonstrate that, where farmers are properly informed and advised and where potential loss of income is offset, practices can be adopted by the agricultural community that will protect and preserve these precious corridors of life. I also propose in the context of the national biodiversity plan which is being prepared in my Department at present to highlight further the importance of maintaining our hedgerows as part of the process of heightening public awareness.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by the Senators could be counterproductive in that it could cause hedgerows to be regarded as problems rather than assets. This would undo a great deal of the good work achieved under REPS and in other ways and would prejudice what can yet be achieved through continuing consultation and encouragement. For the above reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>These amendments would oblige Departments and public bodies, including local authorities, to provide details to the Minister every time they carry out the cutting, grubbing or destroying of vegetation for reasons of public health and safety. Under the provisions I have proposed, the Minister will be empowered to request such details in any case where it is considered necessary. The Senator's proposed amendments are neither necessary nor workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of debate during the passage of the Bill through the other House <Col N="1040" /> and the Seanad as to whether my Department has the resources to implement it effectively. I explained on Second Stage in this House the progress I had made on additional resources since my appointment and I referred to them again today when I referred to the 40 additional conservation rangers who have been recruited in that period.</P>
    <P>It is not just about staff numbers, however. It is also very important that efficient and effective use is made of the resources available to me. Were this amendment to be accepted and public bodies to be legally obliged to submit details to me every time they carried out cutting or grubbing of vegetation, including hedgerows, it would place an obligation on my staff to examine each notification and make a determination as to whether the works were carried out for public health and safety reasons. The majority of hedge cutting undertaken by public bodies which would be permitted under this section as public health and safety issues would be likely to be involved.</P>
    <P>To have my staff examine hundreds if not thousands of notifications each year would be most wasteful of time and resources. Equally, to compel local authority officials to submit details to me each time it was proposed to cut a hedge during the restricted period would be impractical from their perspective. In any case, where I have reason to believe that there may be a problem, I can request details from the Department, public body or local authority concerned together with information on the public health or safety reasons involved. I intend to monitor the effectiveness of this provision in coming years. For example, if there is a concern that a local authority is regularly acting outside the terms of the legislation, I can request it to provide me with information on a regular basis if I consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the provisions in place in this section are sufficient and workable. The amendments proposed would amount to overkill and would be largely unworkable. Hence, I cannot agree to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>

    <P>Will the Minister accept this very sensible amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to include in the Bill a provision such as Senator Manning's obliging the Office of Public Works to consult the Minister prior to carrying out any maintenance work on existing arterial drainage schemes. Most such drainage schemes have been in place for many years and are ongoing works necessary to avoid flooding. The imposition at this stage of legal requirements on works and schemes which have already been sanctioned would be both inappropriate and unnecessary. It is also probable that the passage of this amendment would necessitate the revision of arterial drainage legislation.</P>
      <P>The schemes being examined or undertaken under the 1995 Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act deal in the main with localised urban flooding. All wildlife and environmental considerations are assessed in the development of these schemes and they are also subject to a consultation process. Furthermore, every new arterial drainage scheme must go through a public exhibition process prior to confirmation of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be appreciated that, while isolated wildlife problems have arisen regarding drainage maintenance, the overall position is not wildly problematic. In general, drainage maintenance does not have significant adverse effects on wildlife. On the other hand, a recent independent review of drainage found the economic benefits <Col N="1042" /> of drainage maintenance to be considerable. Current weather conditions bear out the importance of drainage works. Recent experience shows that not only can flooding have an economic cost but it can cause serious disruption and real hardship and misery for many people. Not only can such problems arise as isolated incidents but on severe occasions they may be widespread and affect many people in both urban and rural areas. The matter is best addressed through consultation and agreement.</P>
    <P>To address any potential problems, an interdepartmental committee comprising representatives of my Department and the Office of Public Works has been established to deal with wildlife issues involved in drainage work. This committee has been very successful in preventing problems and resolving difficulties where they arise. I intend to continue with the successful co-operative and practical approach as it is the most appropriate mechanism to deal with wildlife issues arising from drainage maintenance.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 28 will amend section 74 of the principal Act, which outlined the level of fines that may be imposed for offences committed under the Wildlife Act. The principal Act outlined three levels of offence with varying penalties applying, depending on the level of offence committed. In the case of lower level offences, the level of penalty varied also depending on whether a first, second or subsequent offence was involved. Through section 68 of the Bill I am maintaining the graduated system of penalties, while substantially increasing the level of fines applicable. I am also providing for the imposition of prison sentences at all levels of offence. Under the principal Act the maximum fine was £500 with no possibility of imprisonment. I am increasing the maximum fine to £50,000. Terms of imprisonment can be combined with a fine or imposed separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum term in relation to a lower level first offence is three months and this rises to a maximum of two years at the top of the scale. The Senator's proposal would end the current graduated system of penalties for ordinary offences under the legislation as outlined. I do not favour this approach and I am backed up in <Col N="1044" /> this regard by the advice of the Office of the Attorney General which is that it would generally be inappropriate to have the same level of penalties for first offences as for repeats.</P>
    <P>Many circumstances could arise where an individual, through an oversight perhaps or through a lack of knowledge of the relevant legislation, might commit a relatively minor offence under the wildlife legislation. In such cases it would be unreasonable to impose a sizeable fine, possibly £1,500 and/or 12 months imprisonment, on that individual, as envisaged under the Senator's proposals. My proposed maximum fine of £500 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to three months, provides adequate scope for an appropriate punishment.</P>
    <P>Under my proposals, if the same person was to commit a further offence, he or she would potentially be liable to increased fines and a longer term of imprisonment, as a defence based upon on ignorance of the legislation would not hold as much weight. On a third conviction, the maximum level of punishment would be the same as for a summary conviction of a more serious offence under the Wildlife Acts.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 68 generally, the provisions stipulate that offences committed in respect of NHAs will fall within the category drawing the heaviest penalties. I have decided to also provide that offences committed in special areas of conservation will be dealt with similarly. It would be inappropriate to impose a lighter regime on SACs than on NHAs. Substantially increased penalties taken in conjunction with other measures introduced by the Bill will serve to enhance greatly the protection and conservation of our important habitats and of our wildlife generally. I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The motion refers to the need for the Minister for Education and Science to expedite approval of the stage 3 submission from the board of management of Ballyfeeney national school, County Roscommon, as the improvements involved are urgently needed. I thank the Cathaoirleach for accepting it. He has a particular interest in the school in question, which is located close to where he resides. As such, he has a good knowledge of the school, its teachers, pupils and parents. He supports the request of the board of management. The local councillor, Eugene Murphy, is also involved with the school. I tabled the motion following receipt of representations from the board of management, teachers, pupils and parents.</P>
      <P>Ballyfeeney national school is a rural school in the parish of Kilglass, County Roscommon. It was originally built as a two classroom school to accommodate two teachers and 30 to 40 pupils. Two other schools in the locality, Carrigeen national school and Northyard national school, were subsequently closed and amalgamated with Ballyfeeney national school. As a result of these amalgamations and the larger catchment area, Ballyfeeney national school now has three teachers and approximately 70 pupils.</P>
      <P>The amalgamations occurred separately more than 20 years ago. To accommodate the extra pupils and additional teacher a large prefab was provided at that time and located adjacent to the main school building. It was not a new prefab, it had been in use for many years at a school in County Sligo. Teachers, pupils and parents were assured that it was only a temporary arrangement. Parents of pupils attending the schools which were closed were assured that their children would be better off in every respect in the amalgamated school, but this has not proved to be the case.</P>
      <P>The prefab brought to Ballyfeeney national school 20 years ago is still in place. Three classes are being accommodated within it. Its condition has to be seen to be believed. When I visited the school last Saturday week I could not believe that such a structure could be used as a classroom for children anywhere in Ireland in the year 2000. It was obvious that it had been repaired on many occasions during the years. It is no longer capable of being repaired. It is being held together by a mass of rotting crumbling timber. It would not pass a health and safety inspection and be capable of withstanding even a moderate storm this winter. It is a danger to teachers and pupils. Is it any wonder that parents and the entire locality are losing their patience with the Department of Education and Science?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> The Department of Education and Science has at long last agreed to the carrying out of certain works at the school, but progress is unbelievably slow. The works in question are the provision of an urgently needed general purpose room and two classrooms; the urgent replacement of flat roof and windows; the provision of a hard surface playing area &ndash; the playing area currently in use is wet, mucky and has pools of water; and badly needed improvements to the electrical and heating system.</P>
    <P>What is being sought is approval by the Department of the stage 3 submission submitted in July. Queries have been raised and clarification sought. These have been dealt with by the school's design team. I appeal to the Minister to approve the submission without further delay. The school can then apply for a fire certificate and prepare tender documents which will have to be submitted to the Department for approval. If they are to be completed by September when the school will reopen after the summer holidays, works will have to commence by Easter.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent case. Anybody who has seen the prefab would say that it is inappropriate and unsafe for parents to send their children to it. Certainly, I would find it very difficult to send children of mine to the available accommodation. It is the most unsafe school building I have ever seen. There is an onus on the Department to expedite the approval of the stage 3 submission. On behalf of the board of management, teachers, pupils, parents and everybody concerned, I appeal to the Minister to do so immediately to enable the school to progress to construction stage by Easter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for listening to my submission. I hope he will have good news for us in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, regrets he cannot be present for this debate. I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Finneran on his success at the recent convention in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding accommodation at Ballyfeeney national school. At present, the school has a staffing level of a principal, two assistants and one shared remedial teacher and has a current enrolment figure of approximately 69 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March 1999, the Department of Education and Science authorised the initiation of architectural planning for the provision of an additional two classrooms and upgrading works at the school. However, following consultation with the school authorities, the proposed brief was subsequently revised in May 1999 to include a gen<Col N="1047" /> eral purpose room and store. Architectural planning for this project is under way at present. The stage 3 submission, that is, developed sketch scheme, has been examined by the Department's technical staff. Additional information was requested from the school's design team concerning the stage 3 submission and this documentation is currently being examined. A response will issue to the management authorities of the school as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of the school authorities in this matter and I assure the House that it is the intention of the Department to provide adequate accommodation for the future needs of Ballyfeeney national school. The Senator will appreciate, however, that there are a large num<Col N="1048" /> ber of school building projects on hand within the Department. Because of the priority which the Government has given to improving the primary education system, the spending Estimates show primary school building and renovation funding increased to £93 million in 2001. In addition, the Minister has significantly reduced the burden of fundraising faced by schools and communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the request submitted by him and the management authorities of Ballyfeeney national school will be dealt with as speedily as possible. No doubt there will be a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 November 2000.</P>
