      <P>I have notice from Senator Chambers that, on the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to examine the replacement of Bellacorrick peat power station, County Mayo, which is due to close in 2005, with a new natural gas fired electricity generating station.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce measures to force truck drivers and others to comply with speed limits in view of the high percentage of trucks, relative to the number on the roads, involved in fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that workers on the Whole Time jobs initiative in the north inner city are retained in their current employment pending alternative employment becoming available.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Chambers and Caffrey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is Nos. 2 and 15, motion 2: Committee Stage of No. 2, Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, 2000; item 15, motion No. 21 to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business shall resume thereafter if not previously concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I will begin by expressing my very sincere compliments to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to all of those who were involved in the talks and discussions which led to what appears to be a very significant breakthrough in the peace process. The amount of commitment, the work done and the extent of the progress made has come as a welcome surprise to most people who felt that the talks were bogged down and were going nowhere. We have had many false starts in the past in relation to a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland and perhaps it might be a little premature, but I do not think so, the progress made was very significant and very solid. We should put on record our appreciation of what has been achieved. Perhaps at some stage in the near future &ndash; this week is probably too early &ndash; it would be worthwhile if the Leader could arrange to have a debate on Northern Ireland to hear at first hand exactly what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the Fine Gael Private Members' motion this evening which concerns the laws of libel and defamation. In the context of the scandals we see around us at present, it is important to address our laws on libel and defamation to see if they are a hindrance, as some people say, to a fully open public life. It is an issue we need to discuss in some detail. I ask the Leader if, instead of the normal Private Members' format, he would agree to take this as an ordinary motion with, say, 15 to 20 minutes for each speaker and not to conclude it this evening &ndash; there will be no vote on it &ndash; but to leave it on the Order Paper because I suspect there are a number of people who would like to contribute in a measured way on this topic rather than the normal eight minutes contribution.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate, not today but perhaps tomorrow, the main legislation he intends to take this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by Senator Manning regarding the developments in the North. The response from people in the North has been an uninhibited welcome. It is a bit like the difference between night and day in the few months when there was political representation and political Government there. It made a huge difference and anybody who had experienced that wanted it back. It is the way forward and is a most significant step. In the area of education in the North, the area I know best, this is a most welcome move and will be welcomed by colleagues of mine on all sides of the political spectrum. They look forward to working with the newly constituted Executive again and I look forward to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dogs in the street are talking about what is going on in Dublin Castle. We are in a situation where we cannot deal with the matters being discussed at the tribunal. It is fair to say there is more than a little rotten in our State and that we have all been tainted. In the body politic there is <Col N="271" /> a stench from it and we all have a difficulty. It is no longer any good to say that only some people are involved and that it is not everybody. We have to be seen to respond. I am not talking about the individual issues, they will be dealt with in the process. I am not discussing individual issues but the deteriorating reputation of public representatives which bodes ill for democracy. We as a House should address that.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Leader that we should have an open debate on this issue, not on the issues being discussed in Dublin Castle, not on one item or other, not on one disclosure or other, but on how we as a House of the Oireachtas will deal with these issues. We do not want a defensive debate. We have to be seen to tidy up our own act, to clean up our own House. I have said many times previously it is no use taking external people into politics to try to clean it up. If it is to be cleaned up it must be done by ourselves. That is best done before there are names on the table. I speak on behalf of all politicians everywhere. We need to address this issue before parties get into a defensive or collegial mood. Let us look at the issues. How will we deal with this when it blows completely? We need to be seen to take control of it now. I will speak to the Leader after the Order of Business but I ask him to make time available very soon for a discussion to allow people to put forward their views on what should be done about these issues.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the tribunal, which are not being discussed there, require the intervention of the Criminal Assets Bureau. People other than politicians profited from crime and their cases should also be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole in relation to Northern Ireland. The progress made at this late hour is wonderful given that many of us thought it was most unlikely within the timescale of the Good Friday Agreement up to 22 May. It appears that, at last, a formula has been found that will put arms beyond use and provide a satisfactory inspection process. We compliment the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and also the British Prime Minister on their good work. We hope that a suitable response will be forthcoming from the official Unionists on 20 or 21 May. Immediately after that would be an appropriate opportunity for the House to debate the matter. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate soon after 22 May.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second item raised by Senator O'Toole, I wish to refer to No. 15, motion 18, in relation to a register of lobbyists. I ask the Leader to respond to that item because we have sought a debate on the issue. I do not accept Senator O'Toole's point that all politicians are being tarred with the same brush. We cannot all be lumped together. Certain parties have not been identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I allowed some latitude to Senator O'Toole to make general comments on this matter but it is difficult to divorce the general from the specific. The specific matters come within the ambit of the tribunal and there has been a long-standing ruling that we do not impinge on the work of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt that some of Senator O'Toole's comments reflected unfairly on us. Certain parties in the House must get their acts together and put their houses in order. It is not the responsibility of the House as a unit to do it. We have our act together and our house in order and we would like everybody else to do likewise. I previously sought a debate on No. 15, motion 18, and I ask the Leader to indicate when he will facilitate us in that regard. We are now aware of the amount of harm done by uncontrolled and unregulated lobbyists. The House deserves an opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should join in the general congratulations to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Mandelson, and all the parties in Northern Ireland for the progress that was made so rapidly and decisively in recent weeks. I hope that when the Assembly and the Executive are restored, the normal democratic institutions and procedures, to which we are used, will be operational in Northern Ireland. I hope peace will prevail and that guns will be permanently taken out of politics on this island.</P>
      <P>The other issue is important and I recognise the strictures on Members with regard to dealing with the particular matters which are being discussed in Dublin Castle at the tribunal. However, I have a certain sympathy for Senator O'Toole's view that there are general issues arising from tribunals and the exercise of public life which could be usefully considered. The House could undertake a useful debate with regard to how the funding of political parties and lobbyists should be regulated. This would not impinge on the tribunal, although I understand the Cathaoirleach's point of view that it could be difficult because people might particularise and that would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of Members entered public life in the belief that we could do some public good and not because of a wish to enrich ourselves or secure personal gain. That still holds true. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge there are serious and grave matters arising from the tribunal. These issues should be discussed at some stage in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Leader over a number of months for a debate on radon gas, which is more important today than it was some time ago. He indicated that he recognises the danger inherent in this gas and the fact that the <Col N="273" /> Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland published a document on the national survey of the areas with a high level of this dangerous gas. In view of the fact that new EU regulations on natural radiation in the workplace, with particular reference to radon gas, are now in the Government's hands, it is time for this debate so the issue can be clarified once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group published its report last Thursday and one of its recommendations is that the groceries order should be repealed. I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on this matter because Members of this House should have an input into whatever decisions are made. I have raised this matter twice in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children is involved in ongoing talks with the non-consultant hospital doctors about deferring their strike. In view of the fact that some of the employing authorities are reported not to have paid them the most recent increase to which they are entitled and have not implemented the nurses' agreement, I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come into the House to explain how he proposes to deal with the health services when junior doctors and possibly nurses are not gainfully employed. The Minister is not being helped by many of the employing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>For as long as I can remember the Irish version for Knock in County Mayo was Cnoc Mhuire. I am now told that the word Mhuire will be officially dropped from the title and it will be known as An Cnoc. This is either abbreviation or secularisation going too far. Over 98% of the local people have voted to retain the old title and their wishes should be respected. I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Taoiseach to ensure this travesty is not implemented because it does not do us credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ó Murchú. If 98% of the people in a district want to call it one thing, surely the elementary courtesy of allowing them to name the area in which they live should prevail. I would have no difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When does the Leader envisage asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House for a wide-ranging debate on a number of issues of concern to people? We nearly had race riots sparked in Parnell Street and we had another gangland slaying in Summerhill. Such incidents are increasing. I remember when we heard about zero tolerance. There seems to be zero tolerance for refugees but a lot of freeway is given to criminal elements in the city. Perhaps the Minister could, in the context of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, where we have given in to a powerful lobby of vested interests, outline what the judges are doing in awarding licences year after year to pubs where there are riots and <Col N="274" /> customers get shot and what the Garda are doing in not objecting to the granting of such licences.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to outline when we can have a brief debate on Tibet. He indicated he would give time to this matter and I would appreciate it if this could happen. More than 100 French parliamentarians have already signed two resolutions, so they are not quite as controversial as people might imagine.</P>
    <P>I agree with the positive welcome given to the developments in Northern Ireland. I have been a critic of republican elements over the years but the IRA seems to have moved a long way.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Manning's comments about the libel laws. I take a slightly different view on the newspapers. They appear to have been pusillanimous in taking on wealthy vested interests, yet they are content to abuse their power and their reporting of events when they are dealing with an individual who does not have the money&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris will have an opportunity to make those points in the debate later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his encouragement. I will do so and with much greater force. I hope my remarks will be reported in some of the newspapers I intend to criticise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in commending the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, for their efforts over the past number of weeks. There has not been as much publicity, which has probably benefited all the people of Northern Ireland. I also welcome the statement last weekend. The people of Northern Ireland have had many ups and downs, especially in the past few years. There is definitely quiet optimism north and south of the Border and I hope the Unionists will have the courage to move forward.</P>
      <P>I also support my colleague, Senator Cregan, in his call for a debate on the groceries order and for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come into the House to discuss its repeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on an urgent matter of the drugs problem and request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come here and listen to what we have to say? There was a time when drugs were a problem in our cities but now they are problem in towns and villages throughout the country. I saw at first hand the devastation of a family in Bansha, County Tipperary, in the past few days and of people in the village and the surrounding area. Our sympathy goes out to that family. We need to address the problem. We have heard often enough about the zero tolerance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is time he got to grips with this serious problem.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the tribute paid to the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on the progress made over the weekend. I pay a special tribute to the extremely hard work of Irish and British Government officials in having moved matters to this point. As one who has been critical over the years of the republican movement, especially of the IRA, for its failure to declare its intentions, we should recognise the significance of the statement and the courage required to make it. It has transformed the situation. However, we are not yet out of the woods. The air of welcome in the North is not as universal as has been suggested. There are still things to do but I hope the Unionists now show the same courage as Sinn Féin.</P>
      <P>I declare an interest as a director of Independent News and Media in supporting Senator Manning's call for a wide and measured debate on the question not only of the libel laws but also of the balancing rights of privacy and the right of people to redress when they feel they have been done down by newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the recent advances and events in the North and congratulate everyone concerned with bringing them about. No doubt it was very time consuming but much worthwhile labour went into it. There is no doubt that it is the soundest basis yet laid and I hope it will hold, grow and prosper. I support Senator Manning and my other colleagues in their views on it.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator O'Toole who is right and wise in his comments regarding some of the issues surrounding other recent events. It is true to say that, from recent comments in the House, the Seanad is united in how the State should proceed regarding lobbyists and other related matters. In that regard I support the views expressed.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned by the discrimination provided for in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill regarding small shops and the sale of beer; I hope we can get around it. I concur with Senator Cregan and others regarding the groceries order. That is a unanimous view in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points that can be made in the debate that has been sought. There is near unanimity. I want to draw the House's attention to motion No. 10, item 15, which states that Seanad Éireann supports the retention of the groceries order because of the stability it has generated since its introduction in 1987 in providing a fair trading environment for all practitioners in the grocery trade, in having consistently delivered on low prices, quality stores, consumer choice and in ensuring that food inflation has been lower than general inflation and indeed lower than the UK or the average EU inflation rate. That <Col N="276" /> motion is dear to the Chair's heart, dear to the Leader's heart and there is near unanimity on the matter. The House could usefully pass this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in congratulating the Government on its work in Northern Ireland. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach for their perseverance and ability to overcome setbacks in having new proposals adopted by the British Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland parties to set up the Executive. This is a great opportunity and I hope the supposed new obstacle of changes in the RUC will not be used to the detriment of setting up these structures.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on the euro? I have spoken on this matter several times as Government spokesman on finance in the Seanad, but it is now appropriate, considering the turmoil it has endured since its launch, that the Seanad has a full debate on the euro and how it has fared with its sister currencies &ndash; sterling, the dollar and the yen &ndash; as we want to establish its stability. We should have the view of the Department of Finance and those of Senators also.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Cregan's call regarding the groceries order. Senator Coghlan made a long speech on this matter. I raised this issue on the Adjournment some months ago and I hold the same views today that I did then. The almost unanimous view of the House is that there should not be a change in the groceries order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to call for a debate on the groceries order, though I would be happy to have one. I interrupted Senator Coghlan to make sure he was clear that there is not unanimity on the matter. I would welcome a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the raft of legislation that is to be published in the next few months. I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the huge damage alleged to have taken place in the Philippines last week as a result of cyber-terrorism, when 45 million computers were put out of action at a cost of $10 billion. A spokesman in the Philippines said that the crimes were too modern for their archaic laws. We have not even taken our first steps to protecting ourselves and I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give priority to that action, whatever other legislation is <Col N="277" /> brought forward in the next few months. Let us ensure that we are not singled out, along with the Philippines and so many other countries that have not taken the first steps to protect themselves from cyber terrorism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader any hint of news from the Government about the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill? It has only been a year or more since it was published. I want to give him notice that if he does not bring forward the Bill, my party will move a motion that it be taken&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and I will have the pleasure of seeing the Government refuse to take its own Bill. Its inconsistency at least would be consistent after what it did to the Shannon River Council Bill. I am informing the Leader now, through the Cathaoirleach, that I, on behalf of my party, will propose that the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill be taken at some future date because it is important legislation from which the Government is running away.</P>
      <P>I wish we could have a debate on the issues, in terms of politics, that are being debated everywhere else so that I could say I am very happy to be in a party that is not involved in any of this activity, that has not been accused of any of it, that took a position of principle throughout all these scandalous events and that will continue to take a position of principle on it.</P>

      <P>We did not get paid to vote either way, which is something of which we are very proud. We voted the way we believed was correct and we did not expect anybody to pay us beforehand or afterwards because of how we voted, and I am very proud of that position. I deeply resent the fact that other people's actions have been used to besmirch the reputation of people like myself and many other people in politics but I do not accept that it is a problem with the body politic. It is a problem for individuals and the sooner they learn the difference between right and wrong, the better for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue that Senator Quinn raised quite legitimately, I am sceptical about the figures quoted in relation to these matters. We had a wonderful marketing exercise by the whole software industry leading up to the Y2K bug which turned out to be largely a marketing exercise to sell a lot of computers and new software. I sometimes wonder who is behind some of these software scares. We need further reflection on the <Col N="278" /> whole area of electronic commerce because all we have had so far is facilitating legislation. I would like to have a serious debate on all this area because both the scale of the opportunities and the threats, and indeed the significance of the whole area, is probably grossly overrated. It is doing a wonderful job making many people rich but at no great benefit to society.</P>

      <P>I wish to make an appeal to the Leader in relation to the business ordered for tomorrow, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. That Bill is comprehensive legislation but many of the people interested in it, like those representing the vintners' interests, the people promoting abstinence and those who are concerned about under age drinking, are dissatisfied with the Bill. I understand a proposal will be made in the Dáil that the Bill be sent to the Oireachtas joint committee for further submission from various interested parties.</P>

      <P>In the light of that taking place, I ask that this Bill be taken off the agenda for tomorrow and that we return to it at a later stage because, after an examination by the joint committee, we will all be in a better informed position to deal with it. We will have a better idea as to more appropriate amendments etc. I appeal to the Leader to reorder the business for tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I understand from remarks made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the media this morning and from what I read in the media over the weekend that an amendment will be made to the Immigration Act. A new immigration Bill will be brought before this House and the other House very soon. I do not see the need for that and it is a great pity because the Immigration Bill which we passed in this House a few months ago was quite controversial if it were only to be measured by the level of anger it generated in the Minister and in the contributions made on all sides of this House. If this Bill is being brought forward as a result of fairly outrageous remarks made by a certain Member of the other House, the Minister might have certain constituency difficulties in that regard.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Leonard, Maurice Hayes, Coghlan and Finneran welcomed the events in Northern Ireland during the past week. As Leader of the House, I join Senators in welcoming the progress that has been made. I congratulate the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the <Col N="279" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State, all party leaders and everyone that made this possible. I call on the Unionist community to display the courage that is necessary and which the majority of people would support. Everyone wants lasting peace and the guns silenced forever. I welcome the announcement by the IRA that it is not one step forward but three steps forward.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair. Many Senators expressed concern about what is happening in Dublin Castle. As the Chair correctly pointed out, there are matters we cannot discuss here. The Deputy Leader of the House, Senator Dardis, and other Senators said we could have a <Col N="280" /> useful debate on the funding of political parties. I will discuss that with the party Leaders and the Whips after the Order of Business today to ascertain how we can facilitate such a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan called for a debate on radon gas and I can agree to allow time for such a debate during the next few weeks. Senators John Cregan, Leonard, Coghlan, Finneran and Henry called for further clarification and a debate on the announcement regarding the groceries order. I have no problem in allowing time for such a debate.</P>
      <P>I can pass on Senator Henry's views to the Minister. I understand various discussions are taking place regarding a possible strike by the junior doctors. When I have further details on that, I can review the Senator's request in that light, perhaps on Friday's Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú and Norris called on the Minister to take note of the views of 98% of the residents concerned with regard to Cnoc Mhuire. I can pass on their requests to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris expressed serious concern regarding events, particularly in Parnell Street, over recent nights and the horror experienced in that area of Dublin, just off O'Connell Street. I share the views that were expressed. The Garda Síochána and all concerned have a duty to implement the Act and deal with the matter for once and for all. These people represent nobody in this country &ndash; 99.9% of the population was horrified by what happened. I support Senator Norris and I look forward to a speedy conclusion with regard to what happened there. I will be speaking to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about it this evening.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also called for a debate on Tibet. I have already agreed to this. Senator Tom Hayes sought a debate on drugs. I will allocate time for that debate. Senator Finneran called for a debate on the euro. It would be timely to have such a debate and I will allocate time for it. Senator Quinn referred to the events in the past week as a result of a computer virus which allegedly emanated from the Philippines. It is a very serious matter, particularly given how damaging it was, leading to computers being closed down in parliaments and in many industries. It is an alarming development and I have noted the Senator's comments.</P>
      <P>I told Senator Ryan on the last day of the last session what the Minister said. The Minister's views have not changed with regard to the Telecommunications Bill. When there is a change, I will be glad to inform the House.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 to 11, inclusive, 15 to 18, inclusive, and 21 and 22 relate to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. Amendments Nos. 5, 7, 9 and 11 are for the purpose of withdrawing functions and responsibilities from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Section 5 allows for the appointment of international inspectors by any of the three bodies responsible for the provision of information required by the protocol. The same powers were allocated to each of the three responsible bodies to allow for flexibility in the event that such powers would be required. The only functions that are allocated to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are to supply relevant data with regard to dual use products being imported into this country. Accordingly, it is not envisaged that the appointment of authorised officers will be necessary for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The amendment will remove this responsibility from that office.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides for the appointment under warrant of as many authorised officers as is deemed necessary by the National Authority, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The issuing of warrants to authorised officers is unnecessary for the Office of Revenue Commissioners. The amendment will remove this function from that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 empowers the National Authority, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to prosecute any person in connection <Col N="283" /> with an offence committed under this Bill. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has its own powers for prosecutions in relation to false declarations or misleading information given on customs documentation. Accordingly, additional prosecution powers in respect of that office are unnecessary. The amendment will remove the additional power from that office.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6, 8, 10, 15 to 18, inclusive, and 21 and 22 as tabled by Senators Ryan, Costello and O'Meara relate to the title of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. When the scheme of the Bill was being drafted reference was made to the Revenue Commissions in the term most commonly applied to that office. The Revenue Commissioners was established by the Revenue Commissioners Order, 1923, as the Revenue Commissions and is listed as such in the Schedule to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.

      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 48, before &ldquo;An&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Subject to any claim of legal professional privilege,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with inspections. I am concerned that having extensive powers of inspection which the awesome threat of nuclear weapons generates might take away from standard legal privileges. This amendment seeks to inhibit an authorised officer from doing anything which would interfere with the normal professional privileges, say between a lawyer and a client or a doctor and a patient, which are recognised as exempt from being used in evidence in court or any other way. We wish to ensure that normal claims of professional privilege are not overturned by the fairly considerable powers of inspection given in section 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 7(1) which sets out the powers of authorised officers to allow them fulfil their inspection functions and ensure compliance with the Bill. It is unusual to find specific reference in legislation of this nature to a claim of professional privilege. Indeed, the Chemical Weapons Act, 1997, on which this Bill is modelled, is worded in exactly the same way as section 7(1) of this Bill. In the circumstances, it is unnecessary to spell out this privilege. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise an issue which is not amenable to an amendment, the seizure and destruction of property. I am concerned that suspicious material could be destroyed. There should be a provision for compensation. We accept that these are substantial powers. Under subsection (1)(<i>n</i>) the authorised officer may &ldquo;cause any thing found in, at or on the place the possession or use of which appears to the authorised officer to con<Col N="285" /> stitute an offence under this Act, to be dismantled or subjected to any process or test (but not so as to damage or destroy it unless it is in the circumstances necessary for the purposes of this Act. . . &rdquo;. That is a judgment by an individual to dismantle or subject to any process or test and possibly even to damage or destroy something.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not provide that if an authorised officer makes an erroneous judgment, as could happen &ndash; and one might argue it would be preferable that it be done erroneously than to have the intent of the Bill breached &ndash; we will recognise the right of the victim to seek compensation. I know such a right exists under general civil law but I would like to hear what the Minister has to say regarding compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 sets out the powers given to authorised officers to allow them fulfil their inspection functions and to ensure compliance with the Bill and the Protocol. It provides that an authorised officer may apply to the District Court for a warrant to gain entry to a place should an attempt be made to prevent entry for inspection purposes. It also defines what constitutes an offence and stipulates penalties of a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment or both on conviction of such an offence.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to subsection (1)(<i>n</i>) which stipulates that an authorised officer may, for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill and the Protocol are being complied with, enter any place under warrant, inspect such a place and request any person in such place to allow an authorised officer access to any area, material or equipment in the place identified by the Protocol under Article 2 or listed in Annex I and II. I note the Senator's views which appear to reflect the view that compensation is not appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Subsection (1)(<i>n</i>) states:</P>
      <P>An authorised officer may, for the purposes of ensuring that this Act is being complied with&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>n</i>) cause any thing found in, at or on the place that possession or use of which appears to the authorised officer to constitute an offence under this Act. . . . .</P>
      <P>[This is not a court, this is an authorised officer making a judgment call]</P>
      <P>. . . . .to be dismantled or subjected to any process or test. . . . .</P>
      <P>[In other words, the officer can cause something, because he or she believes it to be an offence under this Act, to be dismantled or subjected to any process or test]</P>
      <P>. . . . .(but not so as to damage or destroy it unless it is in the circumstances necessary for the purposes of this Act,. . . . </P>
      <P>It leaves open the possibility of testing, dismantling or destroying something because an officer believes it constitutes an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> I would not necessarily disagree with that provision but what happens if the officer makes a mistake and something is destroyed? I am not suggesting any bad faith. A citizen who is a victim of a mistake by an authorised officer of the State ought to have a specific right to be compensated.</P>
    <P>That is what the amendment was about, which the Cathaoirleach, both in his wisdom and quite correctly, I suppose I have to say, ruled out of order. The issue is important. Why would we not recognise that if the State makes the mistake, people should be compensated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty comprehending the purpose behind this. Senator Ryan has clarified the position but it does not appear to make sense in the context of this section of the Bill. Surely any action of an officer would always be subject to court review and an aggrieved party would have the possibility in the first instance of seeking an injunction to prevent it or going to court to have the decision reviewed. To put in something like that on a topic as important as this, the control of nuclear weapons, would not be prudent and could be used as obstruction to the proper and diligent exercise of the duty of the officer in person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for this, that if I were to be at the wrong end of a bad call by an authorised officer and attempted to sue for damages, section 11 states that subject to this section, information and documents obtained pursuant to this Act or the Protocol are privileged. I would have great difficulty in court proving that something wrong had been done when virtually everything connected with the activities of this Act or the Protocol is privileged. Privilege is written into the Act rather than must be argued in court, which is what I would have thought would have been the case. It would be rather difficult to sue since it is already privileged and since the documents and the information are privileged.</P>

      <P>The idea that the State can seize somebody's property and destroy it and make it virtually impossible for the person to seek compensation for an error on the part of the State because of the quite extraordinary provisions on privilege in section 11 seems to me to be quite peculiar. My advice is that this provision, if there is not a clear route to obtain compensation, is probably unconstitutional anyway. It amounts effectively to the State claiming for itself the right to expropriate property, a right in which I do not believe.</P>

      <P>But I would like to. I remind the Senator that we are dealing with the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill, a very serious and important issue on which there must be total clarity. There can be no doubt about it. If people are going in there, they have great knowledge and are totally involved and in control of what they are doing. It is not a tiddlywinks board or something silly like that. This is serious, important legislation about which we must be serious. There is no point in the semantics in which the Senator is indulging.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at Senator Ryan seeking to dilute the powers of an officer on a matter of such gravity. On Second Stage, we discussed the implications that arise for the population at large as a consequence of accidents or anything else related to the nuclear industry. We have had much evidence of that. Chernobyl, which is much in the news even currently, is a stark reminder to us that we cannot be over vigilant in this regard. We should examine how we can strengthen the powers of the authorised officer rather than putting obstacles in the way.</P>
      <P>The courts would adjudicate on all legislation enacted by these Houses of Parliament. With regard to the comments on privileged documentation, I am sure the court would exercise its own discretion with regard to the relevance of documents and right to privilege in a situation where somebody gave cause to a judge to believe that they had a case to make. The argument being made is not a strong one. We are debating it for debate purposes rather than making a serious argument on what is a most serious issue.</P>

      <P>On a more serious note, it is very important that we should clearly and unambiguously point to what Senator O'Dowd and Senator Walsh have referred to, which is that any legislation going through this House or any other House is preceded by the constitutional rights. No individual, property owner or otherwise, can be deprived of his constitutional rights by virtue of any legislation. The corollary to that, as has been articulated so eloquently by my colleagues, is that the issue is far too serious to attempt in any way to dilute the powers of the inspectorate, who will have to be of the highest calibre and expertise. To attempt to do so by introducing a reference to compensation would be folly and would water down one of the most important issues we have to face as a threat to world peace and stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the State makes a mistake, the question of compensation of the victim of a State mistake should be mentioned explicitly in legislation. The idea that that would inhibit an authorised officer is to suggest that perhaps authorised officers are going to err at the expense of citizens. I do not believe that. If an authorised officer believes legitimately that the situation described in paragraph <i>(n) </i>arises then they should be authorised to take whatever action they need. The rights of citizens are also to be protected and one of those rights is the right not to have their property expropriated. If I thought we could expropriate property there are other places where I would start and it would not be here. We do not have the right to expropriate property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of the absence of a reference to compensation where property is destroyed, <Col N="289" /> together with the extraordinary demands of privilege under section 11, to which we will come later, would make it very difficult to seek compensation. I agree with Senators on the Government side that constitutionally they would have a case, but we should not pass legislation in this House and then hope that the courts will vindicate the constitutional rights which the legislation attempts to remove.</P>

      <P>We must remind ourselves what we are talking about &ndash; the containment of nuclear weapons. There is strong feeling throughout the world about this subject. We should also remember that one gentleman in the Middle East almost got away with making a bomb. This tightens up the situation. We want strong legislation and implementation provisions and this Bill provides those. The kernel of everything is inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not strike too many poses about nuclear weapons. The truth is that every Government of this State has said that we do not allow vessels carrying nuclear weapons to visit any harbour in the State. We never ask any of them if they have nuclear weapons on board. We are so concerned about these weapons that we do not even ask people if they have them on board their ships because we know that if we ask them they will not tell us. When the Government of New Zealand suggested 15 years ago that the United States ought to tell it if a vessel was carrying nuclear weapons before it visited New Zealand, the United States got extremely annoyed. Other nuclear powers feel exactly the same. If we want to create a genuine nuclear free zone here, we should legislate to provide that we will not allow any vessel to visit our State unless we can verifiably ensure there are no nuclear weapons on board. We cannot, however, do that.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the lesser problem of components of nuclear weapons, it is perfectly reasonable to suggest that a citizen of this State should not have his property expropriated.</P>

      <P>I hold no brief for the nuclear industry and I am delighted to see a Minister from the Fianna Fáil Party here to deal with this Bill. Nuclear weapons represent an horrendous hazard for the world and we have seen the consequences of the failure to contain them properly. Is Senator Ryan representing Labour Party policy? Is the Labour Party acting as advocate for the nuclear industry? If it is, let him say so. If not, he should accept the section.</P>

I said that, in terms of the powers of the authorised officers under this Bill, I would not necessarily start with an expropriation without compensation. If, however, the power to expropriate did exist, I would expropriate the property of those who corruptly got permission to develop all over County Dublin by buying the votes of members of Fianna Fáil, in particular, and, to a lesser extent, Fine Gael. I do not, however, have that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is extremely technical material involving a succession of technical judgments. I refer to section 7(1)(<i>n</i>) where something appears to the authorised officer to constitute an offence under this very technical legislation. Section 8 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects, on reasonable grounds, that an offence <Col N="294" /> under this Act has been or is being committed in, at or on any place or by any person, the member has and may exercise in relation to that place or person, in addition to any powers that he or she may have by virtue of being a member of the Garda Síochána, any of the powers of an authorised officer under this Act.</P>
    <P>That is fairly sweeping power and it relates to technical material. The powers of search and arrest of the Garda Síochána are adequate without giving them the additional powers of an authorised officer under this Act. I would like the Minister of State to indicate why it is necessary to extend these powers in such a blanket fashion to any member of the Garda Síochána. A garda might be just out of the depot but will have these powers in what is a tricky area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a follow on from the discussion we have had on section 7. It would appear to be absolutely incongruous that we would agree that an authorised officer would have certain powers but that we would try to deprive the Garda Síochána of stepping into their shoes. Most legislation can be enforced by the Garda. In an area such as this, where the common good may be at such risk, it seems sensible that the Garda would have similar powers. In instances envisaged in the Bill it is imperative that the authorities move with the utmost haste.</P>
      <P>Often authorised officers find it difficult to assert the authority they have without the assistance of the Garda. That covers a wide range of activity and controls. In this instance there is absolutely no divergence between the duties of authorised officers and the Garda. It would be surprising if we did not confer the same level of authority on the Garda.</P>

      <P>The kernel of this section is inspection and policing and the strength to implement the legislation. The section provides that where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence under this Bill is taking place the garda has the powers of inspection etc. of an authorised officer as provided for in section 7. As in all cases in policing here the Garda Síochána provides back up to officers who are specialised in this area. I would have thought, because of the enormity and the seriousness of the subject matter, it was incumbent on us to extend those powers to the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to Annex II, the list of specified equipment and non-nuclear material for the reporting of exports and imports. Solvent extractors and solvent extraction equipment will be found in virtually every pharmaceutical plant here. This is our second biggest export after agriculture and is larger than information technology. Chemical holding or storage vessels are referred to and some of the others mentioned have specific nuclear resonances, to coin a phrase. Rotary shaft seals, compressors and gas blowers are also referred to. This is equipment which I teach my students about. To make a judgment as to whether that material is being used for legitimate purposes or in breach of this requires technical expertise. That is the point I am making.</P>
      <P>Of course, the authorised officers should have the full support of the Garda Síochána but we do not do this, contrary to what somebody said, as a matter of course with authorised officers. There is considerable provision in company law for the appointment of authorised officers. There is no provision in company law of which I am aware for a garda, because he or she suspects an offence under company law, to take on himself or herself the powers of an authorised officer. A garda who is untrained and unskilled can come to the conclusion that there is a breach of the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill because he sees a solvent extraction unit where he did not expect to find one. I do not know how a member of the Garda Síochána would know where to find a solvent extraction unit.</P>
      <P>We should not give to the Garda powers that are beyond their capacity to implement. This is, by definition, very technical material. It is like saying one would allow the Garda into a chemical plant to decide if it was safe in the event that the Health and Safety Authority was to inspect it. Maybe they should, because in many cases, particularly on building sites which are obviously unsafe, even the most unskilled lay person would realise it.</P>
      <P>This is very technical and it overlaps a great number of other areas. I will not make an issue of this but I do not think it is an area in which the average garda could have the technical expertise to make a judgment.</P>

      <P>The Senator's point would make much sense in relation to other legislation, but it does not make sense with regard to this Bill. This serious and fundamental legislation deals with nuclear weapons or parts of such weapons, or any activity which could be deemed to be related to the use, manufacture or movement of such weapons in part or in whole. There probably is a significant problem in relation to international ter<Col N="296" /> rorism but all the powers of this State and every other state must be used if there is any doubt. The Bill must give power to people who form such an opinion to act immediately without ambiguity or lack of clarity.</P>
      <P>Ireland would be criticised by the world if it was an indirect party to an act which involved the non-containment of nuclear weapons. The discharge of such weapons would have catastrophic effects, not only for the generations present when it happened but for future generations. It is a most serious matter and it is important that the State uses the maximum legal powers to act if there is any doubt in this area.</P>

      <P>That is the least valid argument for doing anything. We could have done without an enormous amount of earlier legislation. As I said, I want to know why this section has been included. Who will train a garda sufficiently to make these judgments? This is the issue. I have no problem with the Garda being given powers to assist, support and protect authorised officers, but this does not relate to larceny. This involves equipment which in many cases can have only one or two uses, one of which is non-threatening and benign in relation to the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>I have no idea why this section was included because either unfortunate gardaí will make mistakes or they will have to be trained as authorised officers. The Minister said there is a similar provision in the Chemical Weapons Act, but I am sure there is no provision in the Companies Act to enable a member of the Garda Síochána to take upon himself the powers of an authorised officer. I do not understand the position.</P>

      <P>For the information of the Senator, section 8 states, &ldquo;Where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects, on reasonable grounds. . . &rdquo;. The Senator's suggestion will not apply. A garda will not be strolling along on the beat, decide to call in and confiscate a piece of property. It does not happen that way. The Bill will safeguard the position with regard to enforcement. The Minister is correct to identify that enforcement is critical to the effective implementation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The aim of the legislation, which is the containment of nuclear weapons, appears to have been forgotten in the meandering discussion that is taking place. It is much better that any errors in this area are on the side of caution rather than with regard to a nebulous argument on property rights, which, in any event, are safeguarded by the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to explain to the Members who perhaps are trying to get industry located in their areas that the Bill states that, except as authorised by or pursuant to regulations, no person shall produce, use, acquire, transfer or process any equipment or material listed in Annex I or II. Annex II mentions, among other things, items <Col N="298" /> such as solvent extractors, solvent extraction equipment and other equipment which would be used in the production of many items, including microchips for the information technology industry.</P>
      <P>My point is that this is a technical matter. Under the Bill, it will be an offence for somebody to produce a solvent extraction unit or to use a solvent extraction unit. I do not know if a person would be prosecuted for doing so or whether the pharmaceutical and chemical industry is aware that once the legislation is passed it will have to get permission to build a further solvent extraction unit or if the Environmental Protection Agency is aware that yet another layer of regulation is being imposed on an already well regulated industry. However, adding the Garda to the list of regulators in this technical area only follows what existed already. It is wrong and it should not be included. It is rubbish.</P>

      <P>I would be grateful if the Minister would explain the need for this section. The explanatory memorandum states that this section provides that information obtained arising from enforcement of the Act and the Protocol is privileged, subject to certain conditions. This is a wonderful explanation of what the section contains. Why should all this information be privileged? It is fine if it might be covered by the Official Secrets Act or provisions of confidentiality. However, privilege is a layer beyond either official secrets or confidentiality. Arguably, it makes it difficult even to have it disclosed in court. What is the reason for it?</P>

It states: &ldquo;Information and documents are not privileged to the extent that they are required to be disclosed or communicated for the purposes of an emergency involving public safety.&rdquo;  This dilutes the power of privilege which concerns Senator Ryan, although his query is legitimate and I am glad he raised it.</P>

      <P>We need clarity about when, how and in what circumstances the privileged information for which the Bill provides is covered. Section 11(2) states that it is not privileged in all circumstances. It states that &ldquo;they are required to be disclosed or communicated for the purposes of an emergency involving public safety&rdquo;.

      <P>We are talking about commercial secrecy. Section 11(2) states: &ldquo;Information and documents are not privileged to the extent that they are required to be disclosed or communicated for the purposes of an emergency involving public safety.&rdquo;  I have missed the Senator's point, although I am sure it is apt. We have digressed a lot on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11(4) states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other Act or law, no person is required, in connection with any legal proceedings, to produce any statement or other record containing privileged information or documents, or to give evidence relating to it or them, unless the proceedings relate to the enforcement of this Act.&rdquo;  This means that information assembled under the Bill cannot be used to pursue another issue, for example, the way this Act is implemented or enforced. If someone wants to take a civil action to see if the Act is being enforced properly or someone wants to look at a plant which has been <Col N="300" /> inspected by the Health and Safety Authority to see if the job is being done properly, we are saying that information collected by the authorised officer cannot be used for the purposes of prosecuting criminal offences under health and safety, environmental protection or any other legislation. I want to know why such information is privileged.</P>
      <P>Section 11(2) states: &ldquo;to the extent that they are required to be disclosed or communicated for the purposes of an emergency involving public safety&rdquo;. I do not regard it as much of a concession that information which would enable us to avoid the consequences of a major emergency would not be privileged. It would be a step closer to totalitarianism if that was not included in the Bill. Why is this level of explicit privilege written into the Bill? It could state that it is confidential and there could be a penalty for unauthorised disclosure. The courts could then decide whether under a particular set of circumstances the information was confidential.</P>
      <P>The normal process of discovery in a court action could not be used to extract information if, for example, someone was dismissed and wanted to take a court action for dismissal. An authorised officer, for example, who might infer that he or she was unfairly dismissed will not be able to seek this information because it is privileged. Why is that the case? I reassure Senator Walsh that this is not a filibuster but a genuine concern.</P>

      <P>Section 11(4) states that documentation in any court case taken as a consequence of this Act is not privileged.

      <P>The Preamble states that the agency must, among other things, &ldquo;take every precaution to protect commercial, technological and industrial secrets as well as other confidential infor<Col N="301" /> mation coming to its knowledge&rdquo;. Senator Ryan wants to know why that is the case. The reason is that we aspire to ensure that commercial secrecy obtains. The powers in the Bill are strong but we must protect commercial confidentiality and the information obtained via those strong, almost draconian, powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This country has built its prosperity on two big industries. One is the information technology industry which is epitomised by Intel in Leixlip, although not exclusively. It has been successful commercially because it is good at what it does and people cannot match it. However, it must still make everything it does known in considerable detail to the Environmental Protection Agency, although some of it is confidential and cannot be disclosed to third parties. The Health and Safety Authority and the planning authorities are also entitled to know precisely what it is doing.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any assertion of privilege in the legislation governing the EPA or the Health and Safety Authority. Privacy and commercially sensitive material are protected and we have patent law and copyright and many other measures to copper-fasten that. Why is this different? It is that someone thought of including it. I suspect that the inclusion of draconian measures which are stronger than those which previously existed is a reaction against freedom of information. Dreadful penalties were once incurred if one disclosed anything confidential. Now it is the case that not even the nasty old courts can gain access to information because it is privileged. There is no need for it.</P>
      <P>I read the Preamble and it understandably states that there is no desire to inhibit economic growth, which is fine. However, I am not convinced that what the Preamble wishes to achieve will necessarily require the level of privilege provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Walsh about section 11(4) and proceedings relating to the enforcement of the Bill. In my experience that means a person being penalised under the Bill, not a person suing under civil law because of an abuse under the legislation. However, I could be wrong about that.</P>

      <P>Everybody agrees this is a very serious business. The penalties on summary conviction are a fine not exceeding £1,500 and a period of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both. My understanding was that the maximum penalty on summary conviction was two years, or three &ndash; I am not sure which &ndash; and I would have thought that someone found guilty under this Bill, which relates to containment of nuclear weapons, is guilty of a serious offence. I do not see why 12 months was picked instead of two years for a very serious offence. I do not want to make a big issue out of this, but this seems a classic case for the maximum penalty under the law.</P>

      <P>I empathise with Senator Ryan. We have talked about the seriousness of the Bill and on Second Stage we highlighted the consequences of failure to enforce safety standards at nuclear plants and throughout the industry, which could endanger large sections of the world's population. <Col N="303" /> The onus is on us to ensure that the penalties are commensurate with the magnitude of a crime in this area. I agree with the Senator that the maximum penalty possible should be imposed.</P>

      <P>I concur with Senators Walsh and Ryan. We should send out a powerful, unambiguous signal on this issue, as money means nothing to some operators in this area. We should send out a strong signal relating to the severity of a prison sentence and I am strongly in sympathy with the sentiments of both Senators, as 12 months is not enough. I am not worried about the provision for the fine not exceeding £100,000, as some people in this field could be fined £1 million and it would mean nothing to them. That and the provision allowing for imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years are both totally inadequate and do not send out the kind of unambiguous signal we must send to those who perpetrate these kinds of offences and who are putting the world at risk.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 are related and are to be taken together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 12, lines 1 to 4, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)Where a person is convicted of an offence under this Act, the court by which he or she is convicted may order that any thing listed in Annex I or II or other thing seized, by means of or in respect of which the offence was committed, be forfeited to the State, and anything so forfeited shall be disposed of as the Minister may direct.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 relate to section 15, which allows that following conviction of an offence under this Bill, any material and equipment listed in Annex I or II of the Protocol in the possession or ownership of that person can be seized by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the reason for amendment No. 20. In the course of an inspection it may be necessary to dismantle equipment to ascertain if it contravenes the terms of the Protocol or the Bill. As currently drafted, the section leaves open the possibility of a lawsuit on behalf of the owner for damage to his or her property. However, for legal reasons I wish to rephrase it by the insertion of <Col N="304" /> this new subsection which allows a court that convicts an offender to determine what is to happen to the material or equipment in question. In those circumstances, amendment No. 20 would be unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to withdraw my amendment because the Minister of State's amendment meets our concerns. We are in the peculiar position now, however, where there is no absolute right to confiscate the property of somebody who has been convicted of an offence under this Bill but there is an absolute right to destroy it before somebody has been convicted under the previous section on which we had all the fun. It is rather peculiar that there is an unqualified right to destroy something where somebody suspects something but where somebody is convicted of an offence, the court has to decide, correctly in my view, whether the property should be confiscated. I hope that in most cases the court will decide that the property ought to be confiscated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls upon the Government to indicate what changes, if any, it proposes to make to the laws of libel and defamation and to outline its policy and proposals on the question of ownership and control of the media.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for agreeing to change the nature of this debate. It takes place in a particular context. Its timing is not accidental. It would have been easy to choose a bland motion for this evening's Private Members' Business, but it is more important in the current climate that we examine the proposition that our libel laws, as at present constituted, hinder the pursuit of openness, protect the guilty and make the unearthing of scandal and wrongdoing much more difficult than it should be in a free and democratic society.</P>
      <P>In a passionate article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the distinguished and fair minded journalist, Mr. James Downey, asserts this is so and lays the blame fairly and squarely at the feet of us politicians. He states we have failed to address the issues and to tackle reform and we have ignored the many proposals for reform from various bodies over the years. In an even more wide-ranging series of articles in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> in recent days much the same point was strongly made by, among others, Mr. Pat Brosnan and Mr. Carl Brophy, and I suppose most people would say they have a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question is whether in making their case they are telling the full story. If this debate is to make progress, we must begin by accepting the good faith of both sides. Not all opposition to radical change is based on fear or on personal interest. Much of it is based on an understandable desire to ensure age old civil liberties are not swept away, on a determination to ensure the <Col N="307" /> worst excesses of media intrusion are not tolerated here and on a justified suspicion of the over-concentration of media ownership in very few hands and the scope for abuse that allows.</P>
    <P>Opposition is also based on a reluctance and inability of the media to install an effective supervisory regime that would generate public confidence. It is also based on the fact that the media is not a homogeneous entity, that there are many agendas, not all of them open, that ethical standards within the media can and do vary and that in some cases standards can be very low.</P>
    <P>These are real fears and those who want reform do not serve their case by ignoring them or regarding them as being ill-motivated or self-serving. It is in the nature of things that there should be tensions and a degree of mutual suspicion between politicians and media figures, be they journalists or media owners. The last thing that would benefit anybody would be a degree of cosiness or intimacy, but that does not mean each side cannot listen to the other in the interests of ensuring our public life is as open as possible.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that reform of the laws of libel and defamation has not been given the urgency it should have been given over the past decade. Immediate changes could and should be made to these laws. Not all the resistance to change is based on reaction, hatred or antagonism by politicians as some media figures would make out nor, in spite of much that has been said in recent times, is there a media crisis, certainly not in economic terms. The fundamentals of the media industry are sound.</P>
    <P>The largest newspaper group, Independent News and Media, has become a world player, one of the most important media groups in the world. It deserves every credit for achieving that position and, rather than begrudging it, we should applaud its success, although whether there is a danger of its achieving undue dominance within the Irish market is a question we can address later. The second major group, The Irish Times Limited, may not have an international presence but it has an international reputation and, as far as can be judged, is economically sound, expanding and consolidating. The third group, the Irish Examiner, has poured large sums of money into improving its product, moving from being a regional to a national player and, by all accounts, doing so with some degree of success. The evening market is not expanding, but this is due more to social conditions than to factors related to the evening paper. There is no financial threat in this sector.</P>
    <P>We have a thriving tabloid industry, some of it generic, some of it imported, but in economic terms all is profitable and competitive. We have never had more Sunday newspapers. With the exception of one, all seem to be profitable, some of them enormously so, others less but comfortable and none in any danger of collapse. By and large our provincial papers have adapted to change, some have fallen behind, but the majority <Col N="308" /> are healthy and as influential as they have ever been.</P>
    <P>I am talking largely about the print media, but it is important to make the point that, whatever else about our laws in this area, they do not appear to have damaged the economic strength and underpinning of the media industry. The media has been one of the great beneficiaries of the economic boom.</P>
    <P>What then of the legal framework? Many journalists expressed the view that there is some sort of repressive legal regime here, that there is a legal climate which is hostile to honest investigative journalism. I would like to hear these views elaborated and developed further.</P>
    <P>The freedom of the press is strongly embedded in our Constitution, our law and in many aspects of our culture. We may in the past have had a regime of official secrecy and secretiveness but, by and large, that has been broken down over the past number of years, particularly by the Freedom of Information Act which is far reaching and wide ranging, despite what some people in the media say. The Act is policed by an Information Commissioner whose philosophy leans on the side of openness and discovery. I could elaborate further on this issue but it is not central to the point of the debate.</P>
    <P>Our lives have opened up in virtually every area and in the way public business is carried out. Society is more open than it was even a decade ago. We now also have the tribunals which have been doing their bit to unearth the less healthy aspects of public life.</P>
    <P>The media enjoy strong economic underpinning and a strong constitutional position. Whether that position is strong enough is the point I wish to deal with. What are the specific issues of libel and defamation reform which are of principal concern to the media? Many of the points made by the National Newspapers Association of Ireland are well made. Elements of the law should and could be changed as a matter of urgency. For a start, there must be a speeding up of the libel litigation process. The period within which an action can be taken should be shortened and the process accelerated. Under the present system an individual might have to wait three or four years from the date of publication to the case coming to court. These delays are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I agree with the association that the judge in a defamation case should be able to give financial guidelines to a jury when deciding awards. If that happens, perhaps some of the large awards of recent years might not recur. However, there is no guarantee that this will be so. When juries were abolished in the insurance sector the level of awards did not drop. Nevertheless, judges should be in a position to give financial guidelines to juries even if it is no guarantee that awards will be smaller.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that defendants in defamation actions cannot make a lodgement in court without admission of liability. That is archaic and <Col N="309" /> unfair. Another matter which is of great importance to journalists who work under great pressure is the genuine mistake. Where an apology is offered, it should not be viewed as an admission of liability. Of course, there are apologies and apologies. If allegations are made on the front page in large capitals, the apology should have equal prominence and not be slipped into a corrections and clarifications column or behind the racing results. There should be some degree of parity between the charges made and the apologies. I have great sympathy where a genuine mistake is made by a journalist working under pressure, where there is a genuine desire on the part of the newspaper to amend and apologise but where it finds itself facing a libel charge which I believe to be unjustified.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for the establishment of either a commissioner or ombudsman within the industry which is supported by the national newspapers, an independent entity which could resolve complaints speedily, fairly and at low cost. This is something upon which the newspapers have dragged their feet. They say it will only come with a proper reform of the libel laws but I believe it would, in current parlance, be a confidence boosting measure if the newspapers were seen to establish such a council or ombudsman.</P>
    <P>These are the main changes sought by the National Newspapers Association of Ireland. It is a modest list and should not create huge problems. It should be acted upon. I suspect, however, that it is only the start. It would not go far towards satisfying more radical demands for change. Mr. Sam Smyth argued strongly in a recent article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> for a defence of qualified privilege, where persons in public life have to prove recklessness and/or malice before they would be entitled to compensation in a libel case. I would like to know more about the operation of such a system. How does one prove malice? I suspect it is not easy. How does one prove recklessness? In the US this practice means that anything can be said with impunity against a public figure. Such a proposal is wide open to abuse and I would like to hear Mr. Smyth elaborate on how it would work in practice.</P>
    <P>A good question we could ask is whether these changes would have led more quickly and directly to unearthing the various scandals of recent years. That the media played a vital role is not in dispute. However, would the naming of people on the basis of suspicion or unsubstantiated allegation have moved the process on in a situation where hard evidence is the only tradeable currency? What of the enormous damage and hurt done to those named and shamed and subsequently found to be blameless?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What of the damage to their families and reputations, the mental torture and obloquy? I have heard names bandied about, <Col N="310" /> names which would have been published in a more liberal regime. However, from what I know of these people, the charges would not find their way into any court, let alone survive five minutes scrutiny therein.</P>
      <P>Before journalists respond by saying that it is part of the price paid for public life, part of the rough and tumble, in the interest of the greater good and so forth, it should be pointed out that we are dealing with people who have families, reputations and dearly won constitutional rights. In my experience, the most sensitive people I have dealt with, when it comes to reputations, are journalists. They react with shocked outrage if their <i>bona fides</i> is questioned. They expect universal acceptance of their good faith and integrity while reserving the right to lash out at those whom they believe, often on flimsy evidence, to have transgressed. What is involved is the balance of rights. The only overwhelming right is probably the safety of the people but if the protection of constitutional rights requires a certain amount of press restraint, it is a small price to pay in the overall context.</P>
      <P>There is another problem with reforming the libel laws which few journalists will confront. Theirs is not a homogeneous profession. Standards vary. There are high and low ends of the market. Not all of the low material is tabloid nor <i>vice versa.</i> However, there is a segment of the media which is intrusive, abusive of privacy, unforgiving, vindictive and sensational. We are spared the worst excesses of, for example, the US or Britain, in part because of innate decency and restraint on the part of many journalists but also because of the fear of libel. There is no evidence that serious media people are prepared to address this problem. Most dismiss it as a triviality and an unfortunate fact of life that is not of their making or concern.</P>
      <P>The reality is that within the media sector there are many agendas, many of them competing and not all of them open. By its nature, there is much in journalism that is individualistic, highly competitive and forever seeking to push back frontiers. We have benefited from the pushing back of frontiers, but when the frontiers become important personal rights and constitutional freedoms we must ask which right is more important. There also has not been any real discussion about the dangers of abuse on the part of the media. The history of newspapers and television in other countries offers many examples of abuse by over-powerful owners &ndash; the waging of personal vendettas and the use of media power as an arm of commercial interests or as a means of political favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we want a situation where political parties and politicians go, cap in hand, to powerful media figures or shrink from decisions for fear of offending their interests? Can we not accept that not all journalists are operating to the highest ethical standards and that some swim very close to the bottom of the pool? The law is the last line <Col N="311" /> of protection both of the individual and politics against such abuse.</P>
    <P>The debate on media reform would carry more credibility and weight if, in addition to seeking reforms which will alleviate and strengthen their position, media leaders and practitioners would acknowledge the validity of the worries about media excess and abuse. It is the biggest obstacle in the way of meaningful reform. These fears and reservations are not just the preserve of politicians. They are more widely shared among the general public than many in the media would like to admit.</P>
    <P>It is important that this debate start, that much needed reforms be introduced as a matter of urgency and that the balance of rights which must characterise any relationship between the various estates &ndash; the Houses of Parliament and the so-called Fourth Estate &ndash; be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Manning on his very fair and balanced submission. I am quite sure that the subject is close to his heart. He spoke with both affection and great knowledge of it.</P>
      <P>I welcome this timely debate. It is important that issues be debated. The Defamation Act, 1961, is not very old legislation because we still use the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861, and other legislation. The 1961 Act is relatively new as legislation goes.</P>
      <P>I concur with the view that we are dealing with a total conflict between two rights preserved in our Constitution. In the first instance we have the constitutional protection which guarantees that the good name of every citizen will be protected from unjust attack. On the other side of the coin, we have Article 40.6.1º which guarantees freedom of expression. These are important constitutional provisions which should be retained at all costs. A central ground that can accommodate both sides should be put in place.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Manning's remarks when he said that he was worried that the ownership and control of the media may fall into very few hands. That is a major danger and is something this House should be concerned about.</P>
      <P>In the past six years there has been much debate about the need to change the libel laws. I am cognisant of a huge lobby by the independent press that these laws should be changed. I concur on some of the issues they raise but I have great reservations about others. Most of our national newspapers, journalists, editors and sub-editors are decent people. However, I strongly believe there are a number of bad apples in journalism who debase and devalue the coverage of events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past decade tabloid newspapers have come to Ireland. I concur with Senator Manning that not everything printed in tabloids is of a low <Col N="312" /> nature or swims close to the bottom, but by and large they have resulted in a significant increase in the amount of money paid out in libel actions. Substantial libel actions against newspapers were rare until about 15 years ago. In the past 15 years huge claims have been made. In many instances the claims went through the court process and some were appealed. In most cases it was found that libel, slander and the defamation of a person's character had taken place.</P>
    <P>The newspaper industry told us recently that it had paid out £10 billion in claims and that sum includes costs. That is an enormous sum. In this regard the newspapers cannot say, &ldquo;Let the politicians, the legislators, change the law and this will all come right.&rdquo;  It will not come right. One of the most important findings of the commission set up to look at the newspaper industry in 1996 was to suggest succinctly that an ombudsman or watchdog body for the press should be put in place. I accept that the newspapers are now saying the legislators should change the law first and then they will put that in place. In all of the recent publications, some of which I have read, no journalist adverts to that important issue. If there was an ombudsman or complaints body in place to deal with someone who published an article that was untrue, slanderous, libellous or defamatory, then one could have the right to access someone independent. The newspapers, television and radio have a monopoly and are in control but they have failed to grasp that nettle. It would be an important indication of good faith on their part if they recognised that they were not perfect. They are not perfect. They should agree to have an ombudsman who would deal with complaints.</P>
    <P>The law, as it is currently framed since the 1961 Act, means that when a newspaper prints something that is untrue, whether by accident or design, the only redress available is to seek an apology and High Court writs are then issued. Some of those writs are necessary.</P>
    <P>A very low, guttersnipe press has come here, admittedly it is a minority. I suggest there are certain journalists who can be categorised in some ways as &ldquo;guttersnipe&rdquo; and &ldquo;cheap shot&rdquo;, going right down to editors and sub-editors. If these matters were redressed among themselves they would save a lot of money and reduce the number of claims.</P>
    <P>With regard to the significant claims against newspapers, they claim they were innocent in most cases. I read an article in yesterday's <i>Irish Examiner,</i> formerly known as the<i> Cork Examiner,</i> that most of these journalists were innocent. Some of them may be innocent but there has been a lot of gross negligence in some of their reporting. Two newspapers had to print apologies to me. I never pursued these matters in a court of law because they were small matters.</P>

      <P>On both occasions I knew the journalists. If they had rung me up and asked if I agreed with their article I could have told them that they were not telling the truth and not to print it. I could have cried halt but I was not given that opportunity. They took the third hand information from another source which was unreliable and then they apologised to me. In one instance, but for the fact that I am not a litigious person, I would have pursued the matter in court and been awarded compensation. Twelve years ago a Cork newspaper printed a front page headline which was absolutely untrue and brought my reputation into question. At the time I was a Senator and my family and I were alarmed by it. I got a front page apology but the damage had been done. That type of journalism was not innocent &ndash; it may not have been malicious but at the least it was mischievous. The source that perpetrated this had, at the minimum, mischievous intent.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Examiner</i> journalist, Carl Brophy, used the headline, &ldquo;The Irish press are the most persecuted and prosecuted press in Europe.&rdquo;  I disagree with the first adjective. With regard to the second adjective, a lot of it is due to their approach to journalism and reporting. If the Irish press got its own house in order, examined its conscience and if the National Union of Journalists put a framework in place, they would weed out, chastise and reprimand those who are guilty. In most instances the same few journalists are repeatedly negligent, mischievous and, in some instances, malicious and very careless when reporting. That type of reporting results in litigation and huge awards.</P>
      <P>There is a large picture on the front of the newspaper, which is unfair, of Proinsias De Rossa getting an award of £300,000. As far as I am aware, that case went through the courts, through appeal and the award stood. The press suggested it is totally clear and that if politicians were to act the situation would be resolved. That is not correct. One of these journalists said that a few years ago 50% of the litigants before the highest courts in the land were politicians. That is an alarming suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If it is true, politicians of all creeds must be wrong or, alternatively, the media see politicians as fodder. At the same time, they want our goodwill to change the legislation and to introduce a new defamation Act. Yet, they still destroy politicians lives willy-nilly and, sometimes, most unfairly.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that in the case of these awards great care was taken by the judge and jury in coming to a decision. The decisions were not taken lightly. One of the main defences of libel or slander is justification. When the cases went before the highest courts in the land, the newspapers concerned were unable to justify their actions and the matters printed. This is a serious indictment of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Since taking office, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has met the various organisations and media groups concerned and is seeking to put together a framework for change. Certain changes would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I studied carefully the report of the Law Reform Commission and I agree with some of its points. Reference is made to the abolition of a distinction between libel and slander and a new definition of defamation. I would not have a difficulty with that. It would be wise and would make matters more concise and correlated. The report also makes reference to a provision whereby defendants in defamation actions might be allowed to make payments to court without an admission of liability. I do not have a problem with that. It is common in civil law, in negligence and tort cases, and it should be agreed.</P>
    <P>The report also states that an apology is not to be construed as an admission of liability but in any defamation action it shall be lawful for a defendant to give in evidence of litigation or damage that he made or offered an apology to the plaintiff in respect of a complaint. I have mixed views on that. Why would newspapers print an apology unless, within 24 to 48 hours having got a solicitor's letter and a threat of a writ, it felt that perhaps it was wrong and should make an apology? I have no doubt that newspapers would not print either a headline apology or a subtle apology on the racing pages or near the death columns, unless they had reservations in that regard. A banner apology would not be printed unless there is a strong degree of neglect or liability. Therefore, I am not sure if that change should be made.</P>
    <P>The report also refers to a provision for a defence against a claim for damages in cases where the plaintiff has not suffered any financial loss, that the defendant should exercise reasonable care prior to publication in attempting to ascertain the truth of the allegation. I do not have a difficulty with that. If a person has not suffered financial loss or serious damage to his reputation, I do not see why he should be awarded major damages. I found it interesting that the commission set up to examine the newspaper industry stated that in many instances where, say, in respect of politicians, something is printed innocently and not maliciously, there should be a method where one could apply <i>ex parte</i> to a court or an ombudsman to obtain a certificate of apology and a record that a mistake was made. Some errors made by newspapers are inoffensive. That is an interesting aspect which should be considered.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report also states that a provision should place the burden of proof on plaintiffs in defamation cases as in all other cases. I do not agree with that. The newspapers would be delighted with this and it is something they have highlighted. Articles are written by professional journalists and, if I am correct, articles are seen by sub-editors and some<Col N="315" /> times major headlines would be seen by the editor. I do not see why the burden should be shifted. If one defames or slanders somebody and the matter is given a banner headline I do not think the onus should be on a person to prove his innocence. If I accused any of my Seanad colleagues of doing something alarming, that a Senator was drunk last night or that I saw him in compromising circumstances, it can be extremely difficult for him to prove his innocence. I would not go along with that suggestion.</P>
    <P>The newspaper industry wants changes on guidance to a jury and I would not have a difficulty with that. It would not be wrong for a judge to advise the jury with certain directions. I am not happy with the suggestion, although the newspaper industry would be in favour of it, that juries should be abolished in actions of defamation and libel. I would be in favour of retaining the jury. As a practising lawyer, juries in most instances in Irish courts seem to be disappearing from decade to decade. Various courts are purely judge-driven but, back to the time of the Magna Carta, it was a fundamental principle that the ordinary citizen would have a say in the way justice was administered. By abolishing juries in such cases we would diminish their value in the legal system. That is a policy I would not support. I do not have a problem with certain directions being given to juries but I do not agree with abolishing them. In fairness, the Law Reform Commission did not see any strong sense in it either, but it might be simpler for the newspapers were that route taken.</P>
    <P>This is not a simple matter to deal with and I have no doubt the Minister is doing his best. There are great conflicts of interest but in the past two or three days <i>The Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Examiner</i> and other papers, including the Sunday papers, have portrayed a notion that the politicians and legislators are dragging their feet. I would like to kill off that notion because it is untrue. Up to ten or 12 years ago, the notion of reforming our defamation laws was new. The Defamation Act, 1961, which I think came into effect in 1962, is not old legislation. There is room for reform and I would like see it. Unless the newspaper industry and other media have self-regulating measures and agree to the setting up of an ombudsman, there will not be new legislation on the Statute Book before this Government falls &ndash; probably in two years' time. They should look at themselves before accusing Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Manning for tabling this motion. It is an important matter to examine and it is a significant opening shot in a debate which is fairly wide-ranging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the visual attention of the House to the press gallery which is not decorated by one member of the press. This House and the other House are constantly lectured by journalists, who should know better, about there being only three, four, six or eight Members present in <Col N="316" /> this House during an important debate. They know that Senators are following the debate on their monitors while doing the job for which they are paid by the taxpayers, yet they consistently lie and lie about politicians. Let us draw attention to the fact that we have an empty press gallery during this important debate. That says something about journalists' concerns about the questions we are discussing, even though the proprietors of the newspapers have beaten little tracks into Leinster House to lobby and cajole us and put a certain little element of threat into what they have to say.</P>
    <P>It is important that we all state our interest and I will do so. I am honoured to be a politician. I regard it as a vocation. It is a considerable honour to be elected by the citizens of the State to represent their interests. The only time I was approached in a car park in the environs of this House by somebody bearing a brown envelope was when a Member of the other House wanted to write down the name of my insurance company as I had inadvertently scraped his car. I am in the clear there. I am also a journalist. I write a regular column in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and I quite enjoy doing it, although I find the deadline a little intimidating. I have in a sense a foot in both camps and my position is a little delicate as I am in the process of applying for membership of the National Union of Journalists. It will be interesting to see how my contribution colours my reception there. I will be watching carefully. I also think journalism is an honourable trade.</P>
    <P>I recently mourned the death of a dear friend, a man of the highest calibre, Michael O'Toole, who wrote for the<i> Irish Press, </i>the<i> Evening </i>Press and the Independent Group. I do not take seriously the kind of squawking we get from the newspaper lobby on the subject of libel law. One of the reasons is that I have been consistently libelled myself. I do not see any reason we should accept the arguments put forward that people in public positions ought to accept a lower level of pain threshold when they are lied about in the newspapers. My position remains, if newspapers have the truth and can justify it, let them publish, publish and be damned, but have the courage to publish and take the consequences if it is subsequently determined in a court of law that they have traduced the reputations of decent people and printed lies.</P>
    <P>Let us scotch this nonsense about qualified privilege. There was a classic example of that across the water when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, sued <i>The Sunday Times</i> whose proprietor is the notorious Mr. Rupert Murdoch. He won the libel action and he was awarded, first of all, no damages and then the judge improperly intervened to alert them to the fact that that decision could call the whole case into question and he was awarded the insulting damages of 1p. The Times Group fought that case to institute qualified privilege in British case law. An individual would have to prove malice against the vast machinery and enormous resources of <Col N="317" /> wealth of newspaper empires. I would not accept that and I make no apology, even though I was, once again, misquoted and misrepresented by <i>The Irish Times</i> on this very point as a result of the Order of Business a few weeks ago when Senator Manning raised the question of libel. A person, apparently from the National Union of Journalists, wrote in rebuking me, misquoting what I said and saying it took place in the context of the recent libel debate in the Seanad. There was no libel debate &ndash; it was the Order of Business. I looked up what I said on the record and I stand over every syllable of it. I intend sending a copy of my contribution to the newspaper. I did not say newspapers should be punished and humiliated.</P>
    <P>We should stand by the truth. We do not want to go down the English road or the American road. Does anybody here want a situation where because Rupert Murdoch, the nasty little Australian creature that he is, felt snubbed by the Royal Family, somebody listened in to a private telephone conversation between Prince Charles and Mrs. Camilla Parker-Bowles and it was published in<i> The Sun</i>? That should be a criminal offence. If it is not a criminal offence in this country, I hope the Houses of the Oireachtas will rapidly make it a criminal offence to listen in on a private telephone conversation and publish the details. <i>The Sun</i> got away with it for motives of personal spite on behalf of the owner of the newspaper.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Sun</i> and other newspapers have also libelled other people in the public eye. Elton John is gay. Does that give a newspaper the right to say he holds drug crazed parties where rent boys are provided? That is what the English newspapers said. Of course they lost. They had to pay £1 million but it was worth it because their circulation went up. Is that the road the newspaper proprietors of Ireland want us to go down? If it is, I would advise both Houses of the Oireachtas to very carefully observe that situation and make sure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>It was recently stated in a newspaper that 50% of litigants in libel cases are politicians. I would love to see those figures. I believe it to be a lie. The courts are full of libel cases. We do not have enough politicians, mathematically speaking, to supply 50% of those involved. I do not believe they do. Nobody with knowledge of the courts would believe this is true. It is not. Some people, particularly newspapers, get stung when they lose a case. I am glad Deputy De Rossa won his case. He had great guts to take on the newspapers. It is very difficult for an individual to do so.</P>
    <P>I take a particular interest in this matter because I have been at the receiving end many times. I have had, by and large, a pretty good run from the media in this country. Many of my friends are journalists. Whatever the newspapers and certain journalists say, many of them have privately agreed with me that newspapers should be prepared to print the truth and stand over it, and take their medicine if they print lies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> Senator Manning drew my attention to an article by James Downey, a very distinguished journalist. It worries me a bit. He points out that Mr. Dunlop was no mean hand at using the telephone to gag newspapers by a kind of pre-emptive strike in terms of issuing writs&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Farrell)</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is currently before a tribunal and we are not at liberty to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I see. Various people have issued writs and threats etc. I do not believe there should be the possibility of pre-emptive strikes. We must speed up the process in the courts so that these matters can be properly determined early on. In a situation where the truth is known it should not be possible to gag the press. That is the one point I will concede. I was going to comment further but I have been gagged myself. I was going to make other comments on that. Let us be honest. I will put it in basic principle. We have been told that the publication of rumour will stop evil practice. That is nonsense. It is a matter of public record that people involved in this series of events have continued to this day, so that obviously does not work.</P>
      <P>Mr. Downey goes on to say that politicians whose personal probity is not in question have declared themselves in favour of making the libel laws not easier but harsher and they thus display a shocking ignorance of the role of a free media. That is not the worst aspect, we are accused of undermining the most important democratic institutions and the reason is the hatred of the media by the politicians. That is a little exaggerated. His article goes on to state:</P>
      <P>But if, at a time like this, the politicians refuse to give us civilised libel laws, the public will be entitled to draw their own conclusions. And their conclusions will be less favourable than those of the (far too tolerant) journalists. If the politicians do not act on the basis of democratic principle, they would be well advised to act on the basis of their own interests.</P>
      <P>That is a rather curious paragraph and I suggest that the House might like to dissect it in more detail than I have time to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to record some of my own experiences of newspapers. During the period when I had a row with the then Cathaoirleach, Deputy Seán Doherty, a very serious legal situation obtained and I was advised by my barrister, Mary Robinson, not to make a statement. I did not make any statement. I made no documents available but <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>obtained a 20 page document which I had drafted for my legal advisers. I did not give it to them, it had a limited circulation and they got hold of it. They published it and a photograph of me taken in the street with it, which gave every casual reader the impression that I had spoken to them and given them all this information. I had a very difficult conversation with Mrs. Robinson who eventually believed that <Col N="319" /> I was not involved. The newspaper then printed an editorial, saying the only reason I took on Deputy Doherty in this House was because I wanted to get myself onto a trip to South America. It was not even possible for me to go on that trip for technical reasons &ndash; I could not have gone. Naturally, it did not publish an apology?</P>
    <P>When I retired from Trinity College on health grounds, <i>The Star</i> and the <i>Evening Herald</i> printed articles with headlines implying that I was dying of AIDS. They said that I laughed off rumours that I was dying of AIDS after a serious illness and so on but, as the courts know, printing the denial of a rumour is tantamount to printing the rumour itself. The relevant case is Major <i>v.</i> The Spectator. The House will excuse the vulgarity of my language when I indicate that <i>The Spectator</i> ran a headline along the lines of &ldquo;Major denies screwing the cook&rdquo;. He was awarded £65,000 for it. The cook was badly advised not to sue because she would have made at least half a million on the same grounds because it was far more insulting from her point of view. Printing the denial of a rumour is tantamount to printing rumour.</P>
    <P>Recently, I have had a dose from <i>The Irish Times.</i> First, Kevin Myers wrote a wonderful, coruscating article, impugning my capacities as a teacher, a human being and everything else. I replied to him and it was all jolly japes and fun but, of course, my letter was toned down, not for libel reasons but for reasons of supposed good taste.</P>
    <P>Following that, the environment correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> wrote an article on the celebrated gates of North Great George's Street. I was quoted in every second paragraph and referred to in the paragraphs in which I was not quoted. I was never telephoned. I had no conversation with him. The illustration, which shows the gates with the headline indicating that we were closing the street off completely, was carefully cropped to give the impression that the gates stretched right across the street and there was no pedestrian access. That is an interesting journalistic standard.</P>
    <P>This was followed by a letter from a correspondent in Foxrock, lecturing about the dangers of snobbery. From where I live in Dublin 1, that came as a certain irony. It impugned me on the basis of abusing taxpayers' money and abusing my position in this House. I telephoned the editor and, naturally, he was too busy to take the call. I asked my solicitors to write. There were about 14 grounds of libel and defamation and I was advised by senior counsel that I had been seriously and grossly defamed and libelled. All I sought was a retraction of this poisonous, untrue and lying statement, and an opportunity to reply. Did I receive them? I certainly did not.</P>
    <P>All I own in life is my house &ndash; on which I have spent 25 years and which is now probably worth a considerable amount of money &ndash; the debt into which I fell in restoring it, a disability pension <Col N="320" /> from Trinity College and my taxed income from this House. Does anyone think I could take on <i>The Irish Times</i>? Although I was advised I had a strong case, I was also advised there might be a difficulty because juries sometimes like to buck the trend. It would not have been too much for <i>The Irish Times</i> honourably to withdraw a lying allegation that damaged and offended me. I was not even asking for my costs. I certainly was not going to pursue it, although I might yet.</P>
    <P>I have had sleepless nights previously when I took on the Goliaths of Irish society and I do not see why a newspaper that is looking for civilised treatment for itself should mete out treatment as I have had to one individual. If I, in my position in public life with my background and resources, tremor before the power of a newspaper, what about the little person who receives this kind of treatment? What about the politicians who are even considerably poorer than I am?</P>
    <P>I have grave reservations about the motivations of newspapers in seeking to have even more lenient laws. There would be some matters I would consider. People should not be gagged, but we have pusillanimous journalists in this country, who are now all congratulating themselves about what they knew about this and that. They knew much more than they are indicating because I fed them with much information about the property situation in this city and damn few articles were published, because they said they were worried about this and that.</P>
    <P>We should be grateful to Senator Manning for raising this important issue. I have declared my interest, I have a foot in both camps. I look forward to seeing whether I am to be punished now by my journalistic colleagues. I warn the House not to take the route which the neighbouring island has taken because that will lower the standards of public life. As a friend of mine, the playwright the late Denis Potter, speaking of Mr. Murdoch and all his works, said that he singlehandedly debased public discourse in Britain and used the newspapers to do it. We must not let this happen in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an interest to declare as a director of Independent Newspapers and as a writer. I am carrying a brief for nobody and have discussed this matter with nobody. I have even preserved myself from the reflections of my colleague, James Downey, in today's newspapers. I am not quite sure what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased that Senator Manning raised this important issue today. I congratulate him on that and also on the carefully modulated way in which he presented the matter. We do not do either politics or journalism a service by turning this into a gladiatorial struggle between good and virtuous politicians on the one hand and wicked and conniving journalists on the other or that journalists should see all virtue on their side and wickedness on the other. It is far too serious for that. I would argue for the importance of a free and active press, which nobody is questioning, <Col N="321" /> and for a strong press. Senator Manning made reference to the strength of some of the Irish newspaper groups but it is important that they are strong. There cannot be an effective press without organisations which have the resources, both of people and money, to mount the sorts of investigations that are needed.</P>
    <P>We need to maintain an Irish media presence in an industry which is globalising rapidly and in which Irish-produced newspapers are increasingly a decreasing proportion of the newspapers circulated in this country daily. There is another reason to examine the libel laws and the conduct of newspapers generally, that is the speed with which the industry in changing. It is changing at a rate of knots in a way in which people in the industry scarcely understand. That is particularly true of the Internet and other modern media. We must examine the extent to which the law can cover libel on the Internet. Britain has just had its first case of Internet libel and I know at least one Northern Ireland politician who has issued a writ for libel because of something that appeared on the Internet.</P>
    <P>There should be a trade off. Senator Manning talked about a balancing of rights. The public have a general right to know, particularly a right to know what their public representatives are doing and whether their actions live up to what they profess to be doing. The public, including public representatives, also have a right to privacy and protection. The libel laws have become onerous and counterproductive, not to the profitability of newspapers but to the freedom of journalists to get at the truth of difficult cases. Many of the recommendations which have been made would go a considerable way toward dealing with that.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that a person can get £500,000 for a slight loss of reputation or a slur on his character whereas the family of someone wiped out in a horrible car accident might get £50,000. I agree with the Senators who argue for the continuation of libel cases being heard by juries but there are strong arguments for advising juries on guidelines on the amount of damage really suffered.</P>
    <P>It is hard to withstand the argument that public figures, people who offer themselves for election, should be more durable than others and should have a slightly thicker skin; they should be more open to challenge. We do not have the absolute dedication to freedom of speech enshrined in the first amendment to the American Constitution and its interpretation, particularly in the <i>The New York Times v.</i> Sullivan case, but nevertheless there is a strong argument for greater ability to scrutinise the activities of public representatives in their capacity as public representatives. It has nothing to do with their private lives, their families or intrusion. I agree with Senator Norris that such things as phone tapping and the interception of private messages and the theft of private papers should remain a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> The newspaper industry, for its part, needs to get its house in order. I have argued for a long time for the creation of a newspaper ombudsman either for each newspaper, as is the case with <i>The Washington Post,</i> or, as would be appropriate given the size of the market in Ireland, for all Irish newspapers. It should be possible for a newspaper to retract an honest mistake. People should realise the pressure under which newspapers are produced &ndash; the whole process is truncated into a few hours at most and people work under severe pressure. The job of an ombudsman should be to receive complaints from people about the way they or their subject were treated in the newspaper.</P>
    <P>There should be a code of ethics for each newspaper. Again,<i> The Washington Post</i> is an outstanding example of such a practice. Its code of ethics is clearly printed and details the amount of verification required before a story can be printed.</P>
    <P>Journalistic standards should be regulated, as standards should be in all professions. They can be influenced and assisted by a press commission. I have not seen the outcome but it is interesting that a case was announced in London today where journalists in a financial column had been promoting shares and then buying them. I am not suggesting anyone is doing that in Irish newspapers but it was an indication that a press commission could deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Manning, I ask for an open and dispassionate debate about this extremely important issue. We should remind ourselves that all right is not on one side or the other. It is not healthy or beneficial for society if journalists feel that they are unnecessarily muzzled and restrained from doing the job good which reputable journalists want to do or, on the other hand, if politicians feel they are being put upon. We should try to find the best balance.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot hope to match the scintillating nature of Senator Norris's experience of the libel laws but I have had two experiences as a writer and as a citizen. As a writer, I published a book with a very obscure reference which did not even mention a name, I was talking generically about a class of people. One person said that there were very few of that class and he could be identified. The case never came to court but it cost me nearly all the royalties of the book to withstand the charge. On the other occasion, I felt that not only was I libelled but I was exposed to considerable personal and familial danger by a reference to something with which I was involved. I found that I could not get a retraction from the newspaper and I could not take a case against it. Libel cases are for people with deep pockets. It is one law for the rich and another for those with less. The people who suffer are those who cannot take cases.</P>
    <P>We should examine methods other than the rigours of litigation and the courts to deal with libel. Part of the problem is that this is a self-regulating industry and profession. Self-regu<Col N="323" /> lation does not work that well in any profession. It needs to be backed up by legislation. There should be a press commission and we should move quickly to establish one. We must particularly develop an approach to the media, communication and libel which can deal with the explosion of electronic media and the changes taking place in the industry.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Manning for raising the matter and hope the debate can continue.</P>

      <P>I have no interest to declare. I have been briefed by nobody, hence I am probably badly briefed. I have no axe to grind other than to say a few words in the interests of freedom and fair play. I compliment my colleague, Senator Manning, on tabling the motion and allowing the House to discuss this important matter. I listened with interest to much of his contribution on the monitor. I admired his even-handed, fair and balanced approach which has been the pattern of speakers here. The purpose of tabling the motion was to obtain an update from the Government of its intentions. In that regard I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to hearing an outline of his views and what he might have in mind by way of reforming legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the media, particularly the print media, is very powerful. With power comes great responsibility. What we are seeking to achieve is balance. I listened with great interest to my learned, distinguished colleague, Senator Hayes. I was delighted to hear from him about a newspaper which has a code of ethics. Perhaps there is room for such a code to be widely introduced and proper standards of verification in regard to stories to be laid down.</P>
      <P>We live in an age of openness, transparency and accountability &ndash; the new god, to quote other speakers. I have no objection whatsoever to that provided there is balance. I have no doubt some reform of the laws of libel and defamation are due and for that reason I compliment Senator Manning on this initiative.</P>
      <P>It is good that our newspapers are by and large successful. The Independent Group, of which Senator Hayes is a director, is extremely powerful and an international force. <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish</i><i>Examiner</i> are highly successful daily newspapers. We have suffered somewhat from the tabloid invasion from across the water. There is always the danger of an element of dumping where they are concerned. They are not subject to the laws of the land here and there are probably some difficulties inherent in that. I have no doubt the Minister will address that issue. As Senator Manning said, our provincial papers are doing well and we welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to read that an eminent lawyer, when speaking here recently, said that the right way to reform media law in Ireland would be to bring test cases to the European Court of Human Rights and by that means to force politicians to <Col N="324" /> make changes. I find that somewhat repugnant. I would like to think we could move by agreement among ourselves. That is why we have all welcomed this debate. Reference has been made to moneys in court and apologies without admission of guilt.</P>
    <P>A recent High Court decision was interesting in that in future a defendant in a defamation action can admit some of the innuendoes alleged against him or her and lodge moneys in court in respect of them. I was delighted to read that report in which Mr. Justice Peter Kelly said a 1991 Law Reform Commission report had said there appeared to be no obvious reason a defendant in a defamation case could only lodge moneys if there was an admission of liability when defendants in other actions could make payments into court without any such admission. The judge noted there had been a failure to act on the commission's recommendation that the rules of court be amended so a defendant in a defamation action could make a payment without admitting liability. He had to act on the law as it stood.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kelly gave judgment in an action by Norbrook Laboratories Limited against SmithKline Beecham (Ireland) Limited. SmithKline sought directions on whether a payment into court regarding some but not all the plaintiff's allegations of defamation would be a valid payment. The action arose out of a letter allegedly sent by the defendant to members of the veterinary profession which was allegedly designed to, and did, disparage one of Norbrook's products. Defence counsel had advised that as far as the allegations of defamation were concerned a lodgment should only be made in relation to some meanings of the alleged defamation. Mr. Justice Kelly said the defendant wished to admit certain of the innuendoes and to make a lodgment regarding these. However, it wanted to maintain its defence regarding others. Granting the application, the judge directed that a payment into court by the defendant was valid provided the notice of the lodgment specified the particular allegations for which payment was being made. That is an interesting case and one which, perhaps, the Minister could take further in amending law.</P>
    <P>On the question of apologies without admission of guilt, several speakers referred to this matter. A newspaper, inadvertently, can make a mistake. Genuine mistakes can be made. In such instances &ndash; this would obviate the need for law &ndash; newspapers often are not inclined to apologise. They should be much more willing and ready to apologise. It would be good practice if, when apologising, they were to give it more prominence than their original error. This would build up goodwill and trust in society in regard to our newspapers.</P>
    <P>On the question of an ombudsman within the industry, I was pleased to read that Mr. Louis O'Neill of <i>The Irish Times</i> said: &ldquo;The current state of the law dictates that the only course open to persons who feel aggrieved by a published <Col N="325" /> article is legal action.&rdquo;  An individual may be happy to receive an apology, but media organisations cannot publicly apologise without an admission of liability. I believe they can where they accept they are wrong. This would avoid getting into difficulties. Mr. O'Neill said:</P>
    <P>The case must go to court and can take up to three years before it will be heard. Evidently this is not in the public's interest.</P>
    <P>The newspapers could adopt a much better approach in regard to this matter. He also stated:</P>
    <P>The popular notion that the press only gets sued when it gets things wrong is far from the truth. [That may be so.] It is possible to expose a grave wrong and still lose extraordinary sums in damages. In addition, the Irish media often suffer undeservedly in terms of public opinion for the sins of their British and American counterparts. This can result in juries setting astronomical penalties.</P>
    <P>The director of the National Newspapers of Ireland, Mr. Frank Cullen, said: &ldquo;Recognising the need for an independent complaints mechanism, NNI had agreed to finance the appointment of an independent Ombudsman to investigate complaints of breaches of press standards.&rdquo;  That is welcome and I have no doubt the Minister will build on it in so far as there is goodwill there. Mr. Seamus Dooley of the National Union of Journalists said: &ldquo;If we wish to avoid another generation of tribunals into official corruption, reporters must be allowed to do their job without fear of swingeing and unmerited financial penalties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The matter has got to a stage where it must be addressed by everybody in political life. Freedom of expression and good investigative journalism are extremely important to us all. Equally, we value and pride ourselves on the constitutional protection regarding the right to one's good name which is offered to every citizen. As we are aware, sadly, there are bad apples in every barrel, but in dealing with this matter one must ensure balance. There is goodwill and I ask the Minister to outline the extent of the reform which I suspect could be introduced by agreement. This is the way we should proceed and I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on the matter.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not in a position to be present for Senator Manning's contribution. However, I look forward to reading it as soon as it becomes available. I compliment Senator Manning on initiating this timely discussion. It is particularly important that this debate should take place at this critical juncture in public life in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There appears to be a love-hate relationship between politicians and the media. However, we should not allow that to colour our capacity to examine our libel laws as they were framed generations ago and whether they are serving the greater good of the country at this time. As legislators, we should have the capacity to examine <Col N="326" /> our laws and consider whether they serve the greater good, bearing in mind the needs of democracy. The retention of a free and independent press is the cornerstone of any democracy. Anything which dilutes or diminishes the independence or freedom of the press at any time should be examined periodically.</P>
    <P>In 1995 the Law Reform Commission published a report on the reform of the libel laws. It pointed out at that time that our libel laws were archaic and it dealt with their genesis at another time in another jurisdiction. It also pointed out the need to reform the laws. My party believes that the libel laws should be reformed. We believed it on 20 February 1995 when the current Attorney General, who was then a Deputy in Opposition, acting on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, introduced a Private Members' Bill and argued for reform of the libel laws. He put forward a cogent argument and clear principles on which he believed modern, workable, fair and free laws should be framed in the context of the times in which we are now living. My party believed then that the libel laws should be reformed and it believes it now.</P>
    <P>It was a great pity the Bill did not proceed to Committee Stage and was not pursued by the rainbow Government. It was said then that more time was needed to study the provisions of the Progressive Democrats Bill and that the matter would be revisited in nine months. However, two and a half years later, when the rainbow Government went out of office, the Bill had not been revisited. In addition, the legislation which the then Minister promised in response to the Private Members' Bill had not been introduced by that Government. This was a pity and time has been lost as a result.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, events which have emerged in the meantime underline the need to revisit the issue now and to seek to put in place laws which serve the best interests of society. Much of what is now emerging at the Flood tribunal was well known when it happened. The argument can be sustained that because of our libel laws, journalists and others in the media were prevented from exposing events which are now coming to light. If they had been exposed then and action taken against the perpetrators of the misdemeanours, who are now being revealed on a daily basis, consider what the country would have been saved not only in terms of the cost of tribunals, whose workings I support, but the public's view of politicians.</P>
    <P>It is not in the best interests of democracy that the electorate now inevitably has a jaundiced view of its politicians. If action could have been taken by journalists to expose the carry on of people who allegedly took bribes to enable certain decisions to be taken at local government level seven or eight years ago, consider what the country would have been spared. It can be argued that politicians and public officials at local or national level were able to carry on the culture of corruption, safe in the knowledge that the press was not in a position to put a stop to their gallop. <Col N="327" /> If that argument can be sustained, there is a strong argument for changing our libel laws.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe that the media is entirely innocent. More could have been done, even within the restrictions of the current libel laws. For example, when Dr. Garret FitzGerald accused Mr. Charlie Haughey of having a flawed pedigree, the press rounded on Dr. Fitzgerald. Very few sought to probe or ask questions arising from that statement. In fairness, the only journalist I can recall ever asking Mr. Haughey about the source of his wealth was Vincent Browne.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I must be like the press. I should not have done it but I am trying to make the point that more than the libel laws need to be examined. There was a certain sluggishness on the part of certain people at that time. My belief is that the libel laws should be reformed, but I also believe that every right carries a corresponding responsibility. If the libel laws are reformed, we must seek to put in place a greater sense of responsibility in terms of the media.</P>
      <P>I detect a drift towards &ldquo;tabloidisation&rdquo; among the media. There is a tendency in this day of intense competition between different newspapers to go for lurid stories, to print and be damned. This is unacceptable. In the context of reform of the libel laws, we must also put in place strong laws which will protect the privacy of individuals. This argument was put forward in the Law Reform Commission's report in June 1998. I agree with the argument in the report that every citizen should be given legally enforceable rights to protect themselves from abuse of media power. That is important and we should not lose sight of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shortfall that there is no libel law to protect the dead. Families of dead persons can be deeply wounded when journalists print anything they wish after someone dies, without fear of redress. That is wrong. I had an encounter recently with a journalist &ndash; I cannot mention names as I must behave myself &ndash; who writes for a newspaper which is published in the city I represent, because of the scurrilous things he wrote about the late Jack Lynch which could not be proven from any record on which neither I nor academic or professional historians I know or politicians with whom I have contact could lay our hands. This man is writing a book and because he believes it will not sell well on the Christmas market unless it has some lurid details, he took it upon himself to write unsustainable things about a former Taoiseach. He was able to do so with impunity because of the nature of our <Col N="328" /> libel laws. That is wrong and it is something which should be examined. If we are to change our libel laws we must take into account the rights of the dead and their bereaved families to protect their reputation. The libel laws should be reformed to protect the privacy of citizens.</P>
    <P>There is a voyeuristic tendency in the press to use cameras in churches to photograph family members who are grieving as a result of personal family tragedies. Not only is this offensive but it is not decent or sensitive. We cannot prevent this from happening by introducing laws but we must establish a press council and a press ombudsman, as advocated by Senator Maurice Hayes. We must put in place a code of conduct which will prevent this from happening.</P>
    <P>I was aggrieved recently to see cameras lurking in the hedges waiting to photograph the wife of a judge who had to resign his position because circumstances required it, as she tried to take her little children from the house and put them into the car to take them to school. This meant that the following day the children's classmates were able to tell them they saw their mother on television putting them into the car and that their father was a bad man. That is how children interpret such a situation. That is appalling and outrageous.</P>
    <P>The people in the print media who ask us to reform the libel laws &ndash; they are pushing an open door when they talk to me &ndash; should look at their own standards of behaviour. They need a press council with a proper code of ethics and an internal system to ensure that such behaviour is not permitted.</P>
    <P>We saw recently where an unfortunate human being, a mother's son for whom life had dealt a bad hand of cards, was described as &ldquo;the beast&rdquo;. That was lower than low. Such language is steadily creeping into our newspapers. It is outrageous that human beings are described in terms of animals by some people who defend animal rights yet who have little respect for human beings who get into trouble for one reason or other and who have mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers.</P>
    <P>The libel laws should be reformed and rational discussion should take place here and in the other House so that we reach a consensus on the best law to enact to serve the greater good of the community. We should also enact a law to protect the privacy of citizens. We should require the press to put in place a press council and a code of conduct to prevent the worst excesses I have described from being repeated in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion deals with two distinct topics and I should at the outset make it clear that my direct responsibility relates only to that aspect of the motion which concerns the laws of libel and defamation. Matters touching upon the ownership and control of the newspaper industry are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have undertaken to indicate to the House her views on <Col N="329" /> the subject matter of the motion in so far as it concerns her. In my intervention, I shall endeavour to be as comprehensive as possible in relation to all the matters which have so far been raised in this debate and to anticipate some which may yet be raised. Senators should be assured that all points of substance made during this evening's proceedings have been and will be listened to and the differing perspectives offered will feed into the overall process of policy formulation.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Manning has given us the opportunity to discuss a number of issues which touch upon the role the media plays in society. As members of that society, it is in all our interests that there is a proper understanding of that role. A vibrant and functioning media is an essential element in any democracy. However, that democracy in turn has the right to demand a high level of responsibility from its media, particularly where the reputations of individual citizens may be at stake.</P>
      <P>The law of defamation in its civil guise represents the attempt of society to reconcile the competing interests which are undeniably present here. All of us cherish our right to our good name, on the one hand, and will defend that right resolutely against anything which seeks to encroach upon it. Similarly, there are few of us here who would willingly compromise that right to privacy which we believe is our entitlement in a fair and civilised society. At the same time, the right to freedom of expression is equally one which a civilised society should value and hold dear. Not surprisingly, therefore, given the complexity of this matter, one's perspective on this topic is inevitably coloured by the particular interest one happens to represent or be inclined towards.</P>
      <P>For example, many individuals will give greater emphasis to personal reputation and take the view that this should be the dominant right worthy of protection. Many of those who are active in the world of the media may feel that freedom of expression should be highlighted to a greater extent. The Government, and ultimately the Legislature must strive to take an overview and, through its laws, must strike a balance which will bring the competing interests into harmony which is capable of attracting a broad range of public support.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senators will understand that I cannot indicate in any concrete way what changes, if any, it is proposed to make in the laws of libel and defamation. A decision on these matters is the prerogative of Government and until such time as a legislative proposal has been presented for the consideration of the Government I can only speak in broad terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defamation both in law and practice is a civil matter and, therefore, I propose to make only the briefest of comments on the subject of criminal libel since this is only a small part of that area of the law which impacts most directly upon the media. There have been only a handful of criminal libel cases since the foundation of the State <Col N="330" /> and it is noteworthy that the Law Reform Commission report on this matter considered in some detail whether a criminal offence of libel should be retained. Ultimately, the commission's recommendations included the abolition of the common law offences of seditious and obscene libel. However, it recognised that some forms of behaviour are so despicable and unacceptable that they should be subject to criminal sanctions in exceptional cases and this was reflected in the recommendation that the crime of defamatory libel be retained, albeit in a more confined form. Examination of the Law Reform Commission's report on criminal libel and, if appropriate, the bringing forward of legislative proposals will be finalised in due course having regard to other work commitments and priorities.</P>
    <P>When we speak about the civil law of defamation we are not speaking of a single legislative text which prescribes the answers which inevitably follow when incidents arise. The law is never that simple and, in the case of defamation law, it is even less so. Regard must be had to the constitutional rights which exist and which are fundamental to our legal system. Statute law exists as represented by the Defamation Act, 1961, and the influence of the common law is also very strong in this area. The influence of the European Convention on Human Rights is also present and legislation to incorporate the provisions of that convention in Irish law is being prepared. More than most areas of the law, defamation law is one where each case is unique and where an examination is required of both motive and circumstance. This situation is unlikely to change regardless of whether a more comprehensive statutory regime is put in place.</P>
    <P>There are those who will argue that much of the work has already been done to ensure a modern defamation code is put in place, and I would be the last to decry the considerable amount of research and analysis which has been done and which will undoubtedly be a shaping force for future legislative proposals. The work of both the Law Reform Commission and the Commission on the Newspaper Industry is to be commended. I am also conscious of the research work commissioned by the newspaper industry. I am aware of the immediate concerns that industry has in this area and, in meetings with representatives of both the National Newspapers of Ireland and the Provincial Newspapers Association of Ireland, I was able to demonstrate the extent of that awareness.</P>
    <P>Drawing on their own experiences, I am sure Senators will appreciate that the task of drafting legislation is one which requires a deal of skill and more than a sufficiency of time. The work of my Department is such that it inevitably involves a substantial input into the legislative process. One third of the Government's legislative programme emanates from my Department. As Senators will be aware, priorities in this respect are constantly evolving and, inevitably, some matters will be advanced at a faster rate than others. <Col N="331" /> In the specific case of reform of the law of defamation, a degree of work has been done by my Department on a scheme of a Bill. However, I am not in a position at this stage, given the evolving priorities to which I have just referred, to indicate to the House when I will bring proposals before Government for its consideration.</P>
    <P>I indicated earlier that it would be inappropriate for me to go into detail at this time about the content of any proposal which I might bring before Government. However, Senators will be aware that, with regard to defamation law in particular, a number of specific proposals have been advanced by the Law Reform Commission &ndash; over 50 in number &ndash; and it may be useful if I refer to some of those proposals, albeit in a general way. Some of the Law Reform Commission proposals are essentially aimed at removing minor anomalies in defamation law which largely reflect the fact that this law derives from disparate sources and has evolved, not always in the most coherent way, over a considerable period. Recommendations dealing with abolishing the distinction between libel and slander and providing for a statutory definition of defamation would fall into this category, as would any consequential adjustments to the Statute of Limitations with regard to the time within which a defamation action would have to be taken.</P>
    <P>Other recommendations have as their focus the intention, which I would endorse, of moving the emphasis away from damages as the sole remedy in defamation actions in certain circumstances and on to other more appropriate remedies which would meet the concerns of plaintiffs who wish to vindicate their reputations in a speedy and public manner. An entirely new form of proceedings has been proposed which would allow a person within one year of the date of publication of an allegedly defamatory statement to seek a declaratory judgment that the statement objected to was both false and defamatory. No damages could be awarded in this kind of action. Furthermore, the menu of options available to a court would be broadened so that, even in a case where a plaintiff was actively to seek damages, new remedies in the form of correction orders and declaratory orders would also be available. The general thrust of these proposals seems to me to be unimpeachable. There will be times when a defamatory statement is so injurious of an individual's reputation that damages would be merited, but there will also be times when this is not so much the case.</P>
    <P>Linked in with this new focus on remedies other than damages are proposals directed towards removing any bar which there might be to the speedy issuing of an apology because of fears that an offer of an apology might subsequently be construed as an admission of liability. This is a sensible proposal and one with which few people could quarrel. There is another proposal, which I know would be welcomed by the media in general, which concerns amending a <Col N="332" /> provision in the rules of the superior courts so that a defendant in a defamation action, as in other civil actions, may make payment into court without admission of liability. I have indicated that this is a measure which I may be willing to espouse.</P>
    <P>The amount of damages which can be awarded in a defamation action is also a vexed issue and, again, the Law Reform Commission report includes recommendations which may be useful in this context. Statutory guidance for the courts concerning the factors to be taken into account when making an award of damages is recommended, as is a rebalancing of the respective roles of judge and jury when it comes to determining the amount of damages which should be given.</P>
    <P>One area of defamation law which has given rise to particular controversy is that which is generally referred to as the presumption of falsity. In broad terms, once a plaintiff shows that a statement complained of is defamatory, the law presumes that the statement in question is false and, where a defendant raises the defence of justification, the burden of proof is on that defendant to establish the truth of the relevant statement. It is a measure of the difficulty which attaches to this matter that the Law Reform Commission was divided as to whether any change in the law should be recommended. This is undoubtedly a vexed issue. I am not persuaded by the force of the arguments which seek a change in this area of the law. It is one thing for a plaintiff to deny that a statement is true, as would be the norm in most defamation actions. However, it is another thing for him or her to have to prove that it is not. Any such adjustment in the law could act to the disadvantage of individual plaintiffs and could effect an inappropriate shift in the power balance which exists between the media and more vulnerable citizens.</P>
    <P>In concluding this part of my intervention, there are two issues to which I would like to refer briefly. It has been argued that defamation law in this country is overly oppressive and that it acts to curtail investigative reporting in a way which is inimical to our democratic tradition. This is a point of view which I find difficult to accept. Defamation law is there to act as a protection but it is not a straitjacket, and I wonder whether in some instances there has been a reluctance to test the extent to which defamation law will permit that more robust style of reporting which some would argue is inhibited under our current laws. The law can never offer the media complete protection in this area, nor should it. The fact that defamation cases can be lost is not always indicative of the fact that the law is deficient. Sometimes it may be indicative of the fact that a case deserved to be lost.</P>
    <P>The second issue to which I would like to refer concerns the recommendation contained in the report of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry that the newspaper industry at large should appoint a person to act as ombudsman and should fund that person in the carrying out of <Col N="333" /> their functions. I am aware that the newspaper industry has evolved various mechanisms to deal with, among other matters, readers' legitimate complaints, and its efforts in this regard are to be welcomed. I am also aware that a link has sometimes been established between the industry's willingness to move further on this matter and progress with changes in defamation law. This link can be overstated. I can see no reason more work could not be done now to pave the way for a self-regulatory regime. Such a system would bolster the confidence of the community at large in the industry and that in itself is surely a laudable objective.</P>
    <P>Regarding the second aspect of the motion concerning ownership and control of the media, the principal mechanism whereby ownership and control of the media as well as other sectors in the economy are regulated is the Mergers and Take-Overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996. Under these Acts all proposed mergers and takeovers over a certain size must be notified to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The thresholds for undertakings are £20 million in turnover or £10 million in gross assets. If the undertakings are below that size, the Act does not apply and undertakings can merge or take over each other without the sanction of the Minister. However, because of its special nature, the newspaper industry has not been subject to such thresholds in Irish merger law.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1979 the then Minister for Industry and Commerce signed the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Newspapers) Order, 1979. The newspaper order of 1979 disregarded the threshold levels so that any takeover or merger involving a newspaper would be covered by the Act and thus would come under scrutiny. The procedure for merger and takeover control is that the parties notify the Minister of the proposed merger or takeover. The Minister has powers to seek further information from the parties within the statutory timeframe. The Minister can then decide to either allow the merger or takeover to proceed or can refer it to the Competition Authority for in-depth investigation. The Competition Authority states its opinion as to whether the proposed merger or takeover would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or restrain trade and whether it would be likely to operate against the common good. The Minister, having considered the Competition Authority report, may prohibit the proposed merger or takeover absolutely or may permit it on conditions. In either case the Minister acts by way of order which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Newspapers, as already indicated, have been given a special status under the relevant legislation. This is because newspapers have always been regarded as an essential part of our cultural and democratic system. The freedom to read accurate accounts of political, economic and social events has long been regarded as a matter of right and a free press goes to the heart of any <Col N="334" /> democratic society. It is the nature of a free press that many diverse voices can gain acceptance and thus prosper. However, notwithstanding the particular role which newspapers play in our society, they must be subject to competition law and this issue has absorbed a lot of attention over the past few years.</P>
    <P>In more recent years newspapers have attracted the attention of the public through the workings of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which published its report in June 1996 and which was established by the Tánaiste's predecessor. The commission was headed by Mr. Justice Thomas A. Finlay and the context of the establishment of the commission was the demise of <i>The Irish Press </i>titles and the then generally increasing competition being faced by the newspaper industry itself. The terms of reference given to the commission were wide and far-ranging, covering competition, press freedom, the competitiveness of the industry etc.</P>
    <P>A review group was asked to advise the Tánaiste on how best to implement the newspapers recommendations into law. The first thing the review group considered was the reference in recommendation 1(a) to UK titles. The reference to the newspaper titles of a specific member state of the European Union appeared to the review group to have the appearance of targeting those titles, which could be a breach of EU law. The review group, therefore, changed this recommendation and omitted the reference to UK titles.</P>
    <P>Having considered the three recommendations of the commission, the review group has recommended that the Mergers and Take-Overs (Control) Acts, 1978 to 1996, be amended to incorporate the criteria identified by the commission and that these criteria should be considered by the Minister when deciding whether to allow a merger or takeover involving newspapers to proceed. It should be noted that the motion before the House refers to the media and the review group has incorporated the term in its recommendations. However, the term is not defined. When the review group examined this area it first thought that the term could be defined by way of a statutory instrument. However, a recent court case appears to have put a question mark over the possibility of using secondary legislation to define this important issue. Primary legislation may be required to define what is a constantly changing phenomenon. We are all aware of media such as books, radio, television and newspapers. However, our era has produced new media such as the lnternet, CD-ROMs and computerised information services. While these newer media are not complete substitutes they replicate many of the features of the more traditional media. Therefore, any law attempting to define the media must be capable of adapting to a sector which seems to expand exponentially every few years.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the factors which the Tánaiste has stated she will be considering over <Col N="335" /> the coming months when deciding on what further action to take on the newspaper and other recommendations of the Competition and Mergers Review Group. The Tánaiste intends to revert to Government in due course with legislative changes when she has completed her consideration of this matter. I express my appreciation to Senators for providing the opportunity to exchange views on this important matter. Given the subject matter of the motion, I trust we can look forward to some interesting headlines.</P>

I remind the House that on the Order of Business I asked the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to my concern regarding our archaic laws and cyber-crime. I quoted the leader of a law reform group in the Philippines who said yesterday that archaic laws are no match for modern crime. One law we need to amend urgently is the law relating to cyber-crime and I urge the Minister to do something about that.</P>
      <P>However, we are talking about libel laws. If people in the Philippines are embarrassed by their lack of modern legislation dealing with cyber-terrorism, we should be embarrassed by our lack of libel legislation. Our libel laws are based on the 1961 Act, which I understand is almost a copy of the UK Act of 1952. The Minister said he is willing to espouse many of the proposals made by the Law Reform Commission in 1991, when Justice Keane put forward, to the best of my knowledge, 59 different proposals. That was 1991; what have we been doing? Foot-dragging is a mild term to use for what has happened. Those proposals were made by the Law Reform Commission in 1991, which was the last century. We are now in the 21st century and we have done nothing about this. I know efforts were made in 1994 and 1996, but the Minister has been in power for almost three years and this cannot wait any longer. Foot-dragging is not too strong a word for this.</P>
      <P>The Government published its latest legislative programme yesterday and the promised defamation Bill is No. 65 out of 66 on the C list, which is the list of Bills whose heads have not yet been passed by the Government and which have not, therefore, reached the bottom of the queue for drafting. Publication of the defamation Bill is not expected, on the Government's admission, before the end of the year. If that is not foot-dragging, it certainly shows a lack of urgency or political will to bring the matter forward. That lack of urgency is a test of the sincerity in much of the rhetoric we are hearing about rebuilding confidence in the political process. A key to rebuilding that public confidence is to be as open and transparent as we can. We should be looking for ways to open up the political process and remove barriers to transparency that remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> At present the burden is on the political process to prove itself to the people. Given the revelations now coming thick and fast &ndash; we heard some of them tonight &ndash; the public is right to be suspicious about any attempt to hold back information of any kind. The public is entitled to see reluctance to update the laws of libel and defamation as a last ditch effort to hold onto a culture of secrecy. I do not believe the Minister is doing that, but that is the image that will be given if we drag our feet any longer. There are 66 Bills proposed and this is No. 65 on the list. It is clearly not high on the Minister's list of priorities. The events of the past few weeks mean it should be not just high on the list of priorities but at the very top.</P>
    <P>I tie the libel and defamation issue to the political process because it is closely tied to political matters. Most of the people who sue in Ireland are politicians. Again and again we hear how journalists and newspapers have been gagged by the threat of libel laws, either through direct threats from those affected or by advice from the media's legal advisers. We are told that some of the revelations now being made at the Flood Tribunal could have been in the public domain a lot earlier had it not been for the threat, actual or feared, of libel actions.</P>
    <P>This is not to say the media always get things right or that there is no need for balancing the public's right to know with a person's right to his or her reputation. There will always be grey areas here. There will always be grounds for dispute. However, we have tilted the playing field too far in favour of keeping things secret and too little in favour of disclosure. We have changed laws. We have a Freedom of Information Act, which has helped a great deal in one regard, but we have not even taken the first tentative steps. We are still relying on a 1961 Act which is based, almost word for word, on the British Act of 1952.</P>
    <P>Neither is it true that those in the media have always given the best example in regard to dealing fairly with the people they use in their copy. Senator Quill referred earlier to the invasion of privacy but libel and defamation are concerned with a person's reputation, not with a person's privacy, and in dealing with people's privacy the media is showing less and less respect for the rights and the feelings of individuals. Senator Quill highlighted some instances which were quite horrific, and we have recognised that, but the media is being governed increasingly by what sells newspapers. I think in particular of the growing practice of intruding on people's private grief about which there does not appear to be any rules or, more importantly, any restrictions.</P>
    <P>Although these considerations are important in themselves and deserve to be examined for their own merits, they should not be used as red herrings to divert attention from the central issue. The central issue is that we have archaic laws that have to be changed. The Minister recognises that. <Col N="337" /> In 1991, the Law Reform Commission recommended 59 changes in this area, yet the Minister has placed this issue at number 65 on a list of 66 actions that have to be taken. Clearly, they will not be taken this year. I was delighted to hear the Minister say he is willing to espouse many of these measures. I realise he has so much to do it is difficult to get everything done, but I urge him to rethink the question of placing this issue so far down the list.</P>
    <P>I was not aware of the proposals that were made by Mr. Justice Keane in 1991 until I undertook an investigation. The Minister touched on one or two of those earlier. I was not aware of the question of an apology. Years ago, if somebody fell in one of our supermarkets I would immediately go to the hospital to visit the person and see how they were. I was told I should not have done that because it is almost an admission of liability, but I did not care. It appears that occurs in law here. One cannot apologise without it being taken as an admission of liability. The Minister touched on that and he said he is willing to espouse it. Let us do something about that because many of these problems could be solved with an apology &ndash; it is not necessarily a question of cost &ndash; and be kept out of the courts.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the Minister touched on, and I was not aware of this either, is that payments by a defendant cannot be made into court without an admission of liability. It is interesting that this particular aspect was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1933 and abolished in Northern Ireland in 1936. I had not realised they have different laws in regard to that. We should not always copy the British but if the law that we inherited from them was changed back in 1933 and if we are examining it now for the first time in 2000, surely it is time we did something about it.</P>
    <P>By internationally recognised standards, and our commitments under international agreements, our laws on libel and defamation are out of date. That alone would be reason enough to change them urgently but we have an even more urgent reason. For as long as we as a nation continue to drag our feet on this issue, we deepen people's cynicism about our sincerity in wishing to make public life more open and transparent and in wishing to be more answerable to the citizenry. We have to take action now. We have put matters on the long finger for too long and, on that basis, we must move this legislation to the top five on the Minster's list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Minister of State for taking this matter on the Adjournment. During recent public and political meetings in the north Mayo-Bangor Erris region, concern was expressed by the people of the area about the proposed closure in 2005 of the peat burning and electricity generating station at Bellacorick, Bangor Erris, County Mayo. Since 1950, Bord na Móna and the ESB station have provided the main employment in the region. Bord na Móna currently employs 98 full-time and 120 part-time employees. The ESB employs 70 permanent staff. The employees come from the hinterlands of Newport, Crossmolina, Ballycroy, Bangor Erris and the Belmullet peninsula.</P>
      <P>A recent television documentary by RTE concerning the Cosgrove family from Doohoma outlined the changes that have taken place in this north Mayo region and the important role that Bord na Móna and the ESB power station have played in the change in the economic life and prosperity of the region. Those two organisations have helped to stabilise the economy of the region and keep a number of people living in the area and raising their families there. Now is the time to examine the possibility of putting in place alternative employment that will continue to support the communities of the area and provide a future for the youth of the region.</P>
      <P>The recent decision by Enterprise Oil to bring the gas pipeline for natural gas into the north Mayo area provides an opportunity to examine the feasibility of building a new power station for the western region to supply the national grid. It will also provide low cost energy for the provision of jobs. Will the Minister consider establishing a task force to examine and plan the future development of this region, taking into consideration all the economic factors, along the lines of that established in relation to the provision of jobs when the Asahi plant closed? A combination of the development agencies should examine the socio-economic needs of this region. If the Bord na Móna operation is to close, or if its life is not extended, an alternative enterprise and planned development should be established for the continuous development of the region and the future of the people who live there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Chambers for raising this important matter and for affording me an opportunity to address the question of the replacement of Bellacorick peat fired station with a new natural gas fired electricity generating station at Bangor Erris, County Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the approval of all new electricity <Col N="339" /> generating stations, responsibility for the licensing of stations and the granting of authorisations to construct stations rests with the Commission for Electricity Regulation in accordance with sections 14 and 16 of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999. It will be a matter for the ESB and independent power producers to decide whether, when, what type and where they wish to build new generating stations and then they will need to seek the various necessary permissions from the Commission for Electricity Regulation, the planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency etc.</P>
    <P>To some extent, location will be influenced by where the market for electricity exists in sufficient volumes. Other factors also come into play such as proximity to the gas transmission system, ease of access to the high voltage transmission grid and availability of cooling water. Those are not matters in which the Minister for Public Enterprise has a function.</P>
    <P>Until there is clarity in relation to the scale of the gas discovery off the west Mayo coast and specific plans concerning the landing arrangements for any such gas, neither the ESB nor other parties is likely to consider a potential proposal for a gas fired station on the west coast. The ESB currently has no proposal for a gas fired station in Bellacorick or its environs. The ESB peat fired power station at Bellacorick comprises two 20 megawatt units, which were commissioned in 1962-63. For some time this plant has been scheduled for closure in 2004, by which stage the station will be well over 40 years in operation.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the outcome of the recent tripartite agreement between the Department of Public Enterprise and ESB management and unions, signed on 17 February 2000, all existing peat stations will close, including Bellacorick. For an interim period of up to five years, to be dovetailed with the opening of two new peat stations in Lanesboro and Shannonbridge, the existing stations will continue to operate. The closure date for Bellacorick will not be changed by this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise and I have kept in close touch with developments relating to the Corrib gas field since first being informed of the potentially significant gas find there. Enterprise Oil and its partners, who are operating the Corrib field, have indicated that further tests will have to be carried ut this summer before a final decision is taken by them as to whether the field is to be developed commercially. In the meantime, a number of parties are actively considering options for the carriage of gas from the Corrib field, if it is declared commercial.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann has applied to the Department of Public Enterprise for consent to construct a pipeline from Dublin to Galway and Limerick to complete a national ring-main. <Col N="340" /> Enterprise Oil has also notified the Department of its intention to build a pipeline from the west coast to link into the Bord Gáis system in the east of the country. However, under the legislation, the Minister for Public Enterprise has no function to determine the proposed route of a pipeline to be built by Bord Gáis or private operators. Decisions regarding routing will be made by the players involved on commercial grounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak on this important matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for coming into the House to reply to it. The recent litany of statistics revealed by the NRA on non-compliance by road users with traffic laws and regulations is mindboggling. It reveals an enormous disregard for the law on road safety.</P>
      <P>The Government's record in dealing with this problem is poor. A road safety strategy was launched by the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, in August 1998 with the objective of cutting road deaths by 20%. A major investment of £6 million in new technology was mooted on that occasion. Almost two years later nothing of major consequence has evolved in terms of tackling the enormous loss of life and injuries that occur as a result of accidents on our highways every day of the week.</P>
      <P>Legislation in this area is to be introduced and while some of it is necessary and a priority, more of it is not deemed to be so. In the previous debate some Senators referred to legislation that should have been introduced and implemented. Much of today's business was taken up with the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill. That would not be regarded by the public as a priority in any shape or form. Ireland has no nuclear weapons to contain. The only nuclear weapons are at the Flood tribunal and they are well contained at present. Legislation in this area is required as a priority and it should have been introduced by now. Every day lives are lost unnecessarily on our roadways. While the number of personal injuries as a result of accidents has decreased, the number of fatal accidents has increased relative to the numbers on our roads.</P>
      <P>With regard to the new technology that was promised almost two years ago, only six cameras are operating on the main highways out of Dublin. That number of cameras to deal with the volume of traffic on our roads is inadequate. If the Minister was to announce tonight the introduction of a raft of legislation, incorporating the measures outlined in the strategy for road safety, and report next year that two dozen to four dozen lives were saved during that period, that would be a major achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many drivers are ill-equipped to drive as they have not passed their test. We do not know the <Col N="341" /> degree of their driving competence. The waiting period for the driving test in some areas in Dublin is more than one year, while in rural areas, including my area, it is 39 weeks. Such waiting periods are ridiculous in a modern economy. There are not enough driver testers. The necessary computer technology is not in place to deal with the amount of summonses that should be issued to ensure compliance with road traffic regulations, if such regulations were enforced.</P>
    <P>Citizens could do a good deal to enforce the regulations if they used their imaginations and the necessary facilities were in place. Many motorists observe other motorists who disregard traffic regulations, but do nothing about it. Most cars are equipped with mobile phones. It would be a simple matter to report such offenders. While the 999 system is not equipped for that type of operation, a similar number that would be easy to remember could be dialled by people to report motorists who breach the law in this area. Such issues could be tackled. In this regard I blame the individual citizen for not being as conscious as he should be in detecting people who violate the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>With regard to testing, much of the theory about road safety and driving practices could be taught in secondary school. Most secondary school pupils from the transition year on can drive. Transition year could be used to inculcate the theory and practice of road safety. Although I could say more on this subject, I am running out of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Caffrey for raising this important matter. It gives me the opportunity to restate the Government's commitment to achieving tangible improvements in road safety, with particular reference to addressing the issue of speeding.</P>
      <P>One of the key targets of the Government's strategy on road safety, 1998-2002, is to reduce the incidence of speeding by 50% from present levels. The 1999 progress report notes good progress in the first year of the strategy with car and truck speeds slightly down. However, the Senator will share my concern and that of my Government colleagues in relation to the findings of the 1999 national speed survey carried out on behalf of the National Roads Authority which was published this week. The survey results serve as a stark reminder of the scope of the problem of speeding in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It reveals that over 50% of cars exceed the 60 mph general speed limit on dual carriageways and <Col N="342" /> national primary routes. In addition, over half the cars surveyed exceeded the 30 mph and 40 mph speed limits. The results in relation to truck speeds, which is a particular focus of this debate, show that 75% of articulated and 66% of rigid vehicles exceeded the 50 mph speed limit, the maximum speed limit applying to all trucks, on national primary roads. It also shows that 85% of rigid vehicles and 89% of articulated vehicles exceeded the 30 mph limit and 26% of those vehicles were in excess of 40 mph, where such speed limits apply. Clearly, this is not an issue that will disappear overnight. The solution is in all our hands as road users, whether car drivers, truck drivers or motorcyclists. All road users must slow down to prevent carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority has established that excessive speed has been identified as the primary contributory factor in over 35% of fatal accidents on our roads. Meeting the challenging target set in the road safety strategy for reducing the incidence of speeding by 50% by 2002 requires the full commitment of all relevant agencies. The National Roads Authority is progressing its traffic calming programme, particularly on the approaches to towns and villages on the national roads. By the end of 1998, traffic calming schemes were in place in 55 locations, a further 27 were completed in 1999 and 22 additional locations have been identified for the programme this year.</P>
    <P>Achieving safe speeds on our roads will continue to be critically supported by enhanced Garda surveillance and enforcement. Operation Lifesaver continues to provide a strong focus for Garda enforcement activities. The Garda recently launched a series of special enforcement campaigns under Operation Lifesaver which are targeted at specific groups &ndash; Operation Roadrunner which is focusing on speeding, Operation Overload focusing on overweight vehicles, Operation Belt-Up targeting seat belt offences and Operation Greenlight targeting traffic light offences. These campaigns have my full support and that of my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government. They will last until June 2000, at which stage their success or otherwise will be reviewed by the Garda national traffic bureau.</P>
    <P>In operational terms, Operation Lifesaver encompasses intensive patrolling, high visibility checkpoints and increased use of sophisticated speed detection equipment, both mobile and fixed, including six GATSOs, a mobile unit with on-board camera, radar and computer facilities. In addition, a pilot programme of fixed cameras in the Louth-Meath division is now operational.</P>
    <P>The Garda have also deployed sophisticated modern laser speed detection equipment, in-car video cameras and hand-held radar guns. For my part, I have made it clear to the Garda authorities that I will support any request for reasonable additional resources. Specifically, Garda requests <Col N="343" /> for funding for additional speed detection equipment will be granted where possible. There is a traffic corps in every Garda division with special responsibility for traffic law enforcement. The most recent figures show that there are a total of 431 traffic corps members. In addition, all uniformed gardaí are involved in traffic law enforcement.</P>
    <P>In 1998, a total of 131,931 on-the-spot fine notices were issued by gardaí, compared to 71,337 in 1997 &ndash; an 84% increase. The number of prosecutions in 1998 was 25,742. The provisional figures for 1999 show that a further significant increase took place with a total of over 170,000 on the spot fine notices issued. In excess of 65,000 on-the-spot speeding fines were issued by gardaí in the first quarter of 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government and all agencies involved are fully committed to achieving the targets set out in the road safety strategy. The National Roads Authority speed survey paints a particularly grim vision in relation to truck speeds. Road safety is a major public health issue. A prevented road fatality saves an average of 35 years of life, a much greater public health gain than the prevention of any of the major diseases. The Government's road safety strategy is focused on delivering these important public health gains but the support and co-operation of the public is essential if they are to be achieved.</P>
