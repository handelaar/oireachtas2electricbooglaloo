      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to continue the dental service at Ballydangan in South Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify the new regulations and new criteria for the allocation of taxi plates in Dublin, and to produce a package of proposals for hackney drivers which will give them access to acquiring taxi plates and use of the quality bus corridors.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is No. 1, statements on the new national agreement, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 30 minutes and all other Senators 20 minutes. Senators may share time. Business will be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and at 5 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to No. 1, Members have not been supplied with copies of the new national agreement. If not for the good offices of Senator O'Toole, the spokespersons of the various Opposition parties would not have received copies. That is absolutely disgraceful. This is the second House of Parliament and it is part of the process of Government. In the past there was also a failure to supply Members with copies of official documents. However, on this occasion it is unacceptable, given that the debate on this matter was scheduled last week, that copies were not supplied to Members in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> The person responsible for distributing copies of the agreement should be spoken to severely. All trade unions and chambers of commerce have received copies but Members of the Oireachtas have not. The Leader should, on behalf of the House, raise this as a matter of urgency with the person responsible &ndash; I would like to know their identity &ndash; and let them know, in no uncertain terms, the feelings of Members on this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to No. 4 on the Order Paper, will the Leader make time available for a general debate on the way the Freedom of Information Act has operated? I understand the Act contains a review clause which would facilitate this. The Freedom of Information Act has had very beneficial effects and opened up aspects of public life which deserved to be opened up. However, it is also clear that the Act is open to abuse, that it has been used in an intrusive and vexatious way and that it has impeded many routine aspects of the daily business of Government. Given that the legislation began its existence in this House, it would be useful to hold a review in the near future.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the workings of the House, will the Leader revert to the earlier practice where, in so far as possible, a provisional Order of Business for the succeeding three to four weeks was supplied to the Opposition groups?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Manning's point about the difficulty of holding a debate without people having access to copies of the agreement, it may be necessary to resume the debate at a later date when people have had time to read the agreement. I contacted the Department of the Taoiseach in the past number of days regarding the delay in publication. In the interests of clarifying the position to the House I should state that the agreement was not concluded until early on Monday morning. No trade union or chamber of commerce has received a complete copy of the agreement. I do not blame anyone for thinking that the opposite was the case. Many people have contacted my trade union to discover from where they might obtain copies.</P>
      <P>The first photostat copy of the agreement did not become available until late on Monday evening. Yesterday I supplied photocopies of a rough copy of the agreement I had received and I understand that printed copies have not yet been supplied to anyone. Speaking as one of those who negotiated the agreement, I did not receive a copy of it until late yesterday afternoon. In my opinion the agreement was launched too early and Senator Manning is correct that this is not the way to do business. The agreement should have been launched today and the debate held when copies had been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been developments today concerning Aer Lingus. The future of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and associated issues are important but have not been discussed in either House in terms of Government policy. There is a clear understanding that there will be an initial public offer <Col N="359" /> in the coming months or within the year and it would be helpful if the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, was invited into the House to explain her thinking on this issue so that we could share our views with her before decisions are taken. I had an informal discussion with the Minister and I know she would be happy to do so. The House could gain and give a lot during such a discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express concern about the unavailability of final copies of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Yesterday I obtained what I believe is a draft copy &ndash; I do not think it is even the final programme &ndash; from the Government website. That website is able to supply a copy but I understand that only six copies were made available to Senators this morning. I agree with Senator O'Toole that this debate will have to continue next week to allow all those who wish to contribute to do so, but also to have a properly reasoned and in-depth discussion on what is a very important agreement.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the serious matter which has arisen concerning Crumlin children's hospital and, perhaps, other hospitals. Medical legal experts have highlighted the need to update legislation on post-mortems and events surrounding the harvesting and use of organs and tissue from deceased children, babies in particular, which have been made available to pharmaceutical companies. We are all horrified by what is termed &ldquo;standard practice&rdquo; and there is a clear need for this matter to be addressed by way of legislation. Will the Leader raise this issue with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, at the earliest opportunity?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a review of the Freedom of Information Act at the earliest possible date. This is significant legislation but we must look at the issue of appeals, in particular. Due to the backlog the waiting period for appeals to be heard by the Office of the Information Commissioner now exceeds 12 months. This delay is undermining the value and effectiveness of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the House debate the proposed national stadium and related matters? There was a useful debate on this issue in the Dáil and there is a need for discussion on the matter and for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to outline the information at his disposal on whether we can attract some of the larger sporting events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue I wish to raise is more important and urgent. The Leader will be aware that there is disquiet in the Defence Forces concerning the discussions taking place. The Chief of Staff rushed back to Ireland from East Timor and it appears that would-be consultants are the driving force behind events rather than soldiers. It has emerged that if some of these consultants performed their tasks properly in other matters there <Col N="360" /> might not have been the need for some of the costly tribunals set up. Some of these consultants would get lost in Lebanon never mind sorting out any problems there. Will the Leader consider inviting the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, to the House to debate the issue and outline the Government's position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of grave concern. A constituent of mine went to buy a house for £130,000 on 31 January. When she went to the auctioneer the following day the price had gone up to £133,000. The auctioneer explained that the builder had increased the price because it was 1 February. The average increase last year for a first time buyer's house was £24,000 or £2,000 per month. There was no second phase development involved in this case nor were there any alterations &ndash; the builder just changed the price. If this is the case the cost of the average home will rise by £36,000 this year.</P>
      <P>We have all spoken about the crisis in housing and we have heard the promises concerning the 20% social housing initiative. It is time that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, came to the House to discuss this issue. I accept that we cannot control the actions of individual builders but we are going to create a monstrous bubble which will burst. Interest rates are rising and young couples and other first time buyers will face an appalling situation. The £3,000 grant is being sucked into the price of houses. I know that the cost of the house I referred to will go up by another £3,000 next month and I would like the Minister to be invited to the House to see if there is anything we can do about this appalling abuse of people's need for housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could have raised the matter more appropriately in other ways, such as on the Adjournment or by way of a Private Members' motion. However, I did not interrupt the Senator as she was making an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, a Chathaoirligh, and thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Members read the report of the Labour Party's housing commission which contains a considerable number of imaginative and radical suggestions to deal with the appalling situation raised by Senator Ridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the complaints expressed by Senators about the extraordinary delay in making copies of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness available. I work in the public sector and we have been hectored and lectured from the highest levels of Government about our apparent inability to modernise and deliver a service. However, if the Office of the Taoiseach takes two days to provide photocopies of a document of 128 pages then I have no doubt where modernisation, efficiency and quality service should begin. When they can <Col N="361" /> do simple things very well at that level only then should they lecture the rest of us who have been trying to get them to come into the 21st century for the past 20 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a review of the Freedom of Information Act. In one case it cost about £10,000 of taxpayers' money to answer a question. People should be charged whatever the inquiry costs. Is the information being sought in the public interest or in the interest of those making a living selling the information?</P>
      <P>We live in a compensation culture and in some settlement cases claimants are told by their legal advisers that they are settling the case for X amount of money. However, the claimants do not know the value of the settlement. In all cases claimants should be advised what they are getting and the total costs involved. It is scandalous that some legal eagles are charging up to 40% or 50% of the claim on a no foal-no fee system. We should debate this issue in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my wish that matters raised on the Order of Business would be relevant and appropriate to the Order of Business. Senators should remember that the Order of Business is not a free-for-all during which any matter can be plucked from the sky and raised. Matters on the Order of Business should be addressed by way of a request or a question to the Leader of the House. The Chair is reluctant to engage in confrontation with Members on the Order of Business as that does not enhance the dignity or the image of the House. I appeal to the Members to make their interventions relevant and appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has always appreciated the Chair's reluctance to intervene, I also support Senator Manning on the non-delivery to Members of this House of various documents from time to time. This relates not just to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness but also to the important report of the Committee of Public Accounts. That omission has since been put right, for which I thank the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>I asked the Leader yesterday about the Government's intentions on updating the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. Perhaps he did not understand my question and for that I apologise. Has the Government any plans to update that Act, particularly in the light of the Fianna Fáil Party's adoption of what I understand was the eighth draft of a code of conduct for its members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I drew attention to the hackers' attack on the US websites. I take into account what the Chair has said about raising only items which are relevant. However, this is very important both as a threat to and as an opportunity for Ireland. The attack on the US websites has damaged confidence in e-commerce, has damaged the possibility of reaching the <Col N="362" /> potential that was expected. There is scope for a debate on introducing new legislation in Ireland so that we can take the lead. Ireland is already moving in that direction, but the news yesterday and today makes it much more urgent not just to draw the Minister's attention to the need for legislation but to the fact that if we are to get to the top, to the position of authority that we in Ireland see as an opportunity, we should do something immediately.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the danger of overreaction to the situation in Austria? Austria has a democratically elected Government that nobody really likes, but the action that many countries are taking may be counterproductive. What would happen in Ireland if we elected someone to Government whom the rest of Europe did not like? There would be the same response as that which seems to be happening in Austria in reaction to the rest of Europe. There would be greater support which would be counterproductive. The Minister's handling of the matter up to now has been temperate and careful. I urge him to continue to be temperate and careful, not in order to avoid embarrassment to that party, but to make sure that the steps we take as Europeans are not counterproductive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it possible to have a debate on the question of car insurance and insurance generally? The huge increase in insurance premia for young people, particularly in the past six to 12 months, is enormous. I do not know how anybody can expect them to pay, even those who earn good wages. People who have apprenticeships must have a car in order to get to their workplace. Insurance companies have, in the past 12 months, imposed very steep increases. A number of Members have already called for a debate, and the matter has been debated many times &ndash; Senator Farrell called for a debate here a couple of months ago. We have a responsibility to young people in regard to insurance. We should have a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need to look again at the question of medical cards and, in particular, to take note that all people between the ages of 18 and 26 in County Louth who currently hold medical cards are being reviewed? Many mothers returning to work are losing their medical cards because no allowance is being made for their child care costs. This is a retrograde step. It is very difficult for young mothers and the matter must be looked at immediately. In his reply yesterday, the Leader said that he would allow for a debate on this matter. I ask that it take place as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's call for legislation on organs which have been removed from children following their death. If <Col N="363" /> parents were requested at the time of death, even though it is a time of great grief, they would be open to the possibility of offering the organs of their children to improve research.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago there was an attempted abduction of a child at the Coombe women's hospital. Subsequently, certain security measures were introduced there. At that time there were discussions on the possibility of installing closed circuit television in all hospitals as a security measure. Perhaps the Minister for Health and Children could come to the House to let us know how advanced these proposals are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Leader of the House to bring to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the delay in granting licences in archaeologically sensitive areas where local authorities have made it a condition of planning to get a licence. There is a huge delay which is causing widespread concern. I contacted the Department this morning and I was told that the office was getting a huge amount of flak from around the country. I want the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Chair made about raising issues on the Order of Business which could be raised on the Adjournment. However, Senators should be facilitated in putting questions to Ministers in the same way as Deputies. This would solve many problems for Senators. If a Senator writes to a Minister or a Department, he or she gets an acknowledgement within a week or a fortnight. However, it takes another two months to get a reply to the letter and that is disgraceful. We should have a facility for questions in the Seanad. Some moves were made previously in relation to this. It is something the Leader of the House should pursue on our behalf.</P>
      <P>I would like a debate in relation to Objective One, and on whether or not we are getting our fair share of funding from the Exchequer along with Objective One funding. It would be worthwhile. Perhaps the Leader will arrange such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, O'Meara and Coghlan expressed their regret that they had not received copies of the new national agreement. As Senator O'Toole said, it was concluded only last Monday. We in the Seanad should be congratulated on bringing this debate to the floor of the House. It is my intention not to conclude it today and to have it on the Order of Business for next week. In respect of those Senators who wish to wait until next week, time will be made available to facilitate them in reviewing the benefits of this new agreement. I hope that as many Members as possible will take the opportunity to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> Senator Manning also called for a three to four-week advance plan in relation to the Order of Business. I will see what I can do to facilitate party leaders in that regard. Senator O'Toole called for a debate on Aer Lingus. I will allow time for that.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Meara and Leonard expressed their concerns about the removal of organs and tissue from dead babies. I welcome the fact the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, established an inquiry yesterday into this matter. If a debate is required, I will respond positively.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave called for a debate on the national stadium. I have no difficulty allowing time for this matter to be discussed. It is wonderful that £300 million will be spent in an area of Dublin which was deprived for many years. Everyone, including me, who has been associated with sport throughout the years will be only too pleased to have a lengthy debate on it. It is a great opportunity for this House to let the nation know that we welcome the decision by the Government to go ahead with this project.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave also called for a debate on the Defence Forces. I will arrange for such a debate at the earliest opportunity. Senator Ridge called for a debate on rising house prices. I will put time aside for such a discussion. I will also arrange time for the requests made by Senators Farrell and Coghlan.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn called for a debate on the abuse of US websites. This would be a worthwhile debate and I will facilitate the Senator's request. I will pass on his views on the new Austrian Government to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien made a lengthy speech when he called for a debate on car insurance. I will be pleased to make time available for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called for a review of the medical card system. I know he is pleased that his constituency colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is one of the wonderful Ministers for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>He has improved the qualification guidelines for the medical card system. As a member of a health board, I am only too familiar with the wonderful work the Minister is doing. I will convey Senator O'Dowd's views to him after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Leonard called for increased security, including security cameras, at all hospitals. I will leave time aside for a debate on this issue over the next three or four weeks. I will pass on the views expressed by Senator Tom Hayes to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke called for a review of the Seanad and for the introduction of a form of question time. I will discuss that matter with the <Col N="365" /> leaders and the Whips. I will make time available for statements on the review of the Seanad in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke also mentioned Objective One, which is a six year programme. The Senator is a little early in his request given that this is only the second week of the second month of the year. The Senator is always ahead of his time. I will facilitate him with a review of this programme in the week before the summer recess.</P>

    <Title>Programme for Prosperity and Fairness: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to talk about the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and to hear the views of the Seanad on the new partnership agreement.</P>
      <P>This social partnership agreement is the fifth since 1987. These agreements have contributed significantly to economic and social development. They have been central to the economic stability which enabled the economy to grow more than twice as fast as the EU since 1987, to deliver six times the EU rate of employment growth and to raise living standards, as measured by <i>per capita</i> personal consumption, twice as fast as the EU average.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that the Government with the social partners sought to preserve and strengthen this key element in our broad national strategy for economic and social progress. The objectives of the programme relate both to economic and social progress. As well as the pay terms which have been agreed, the programme sets out a comprehensive series of integrated economic and social objectives and the operational framework to achieve them.</P>
      <P>The new programme is set in the context of the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, as recently reviewed, and of the national development plan. It has been crucially informed by the social and economic vision for the modern Ireland set out in the recent NESC report. It is the culmination of three months of hard work by all the pillars of the social partnership. It involved considerable and detailed discussions and tough negotiations and I thank all who contributed to its development.</P>
      <P>Implemented in the same positive spirit as it was conceived, the programme contains the basis for continuing the prosperity and progress we have enjoyed over the past decade. It has the capacity to ensure that past problems, such as high unemployment and pervasive social exclusion, involuntary emigration, stultifying levels of taxation and national indebtedness, do not return to crucify our people. However, it remains as true today as it ever was that no one owes us a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this programme as a vital ingredient in building the Ireland of the 21st century which <Col N="366" /> delivers further prosperity for all our people, achieves equity and fairness throughout our society and which helps us to realise our full economic potential and our full potential for social inclusion. We will not be thanked by future generations if we let this opportunity slip. We must not assume as a nation that our past success guarantees the future. It does not. All of us within each of the pillars of the social partnership must be prepared to play our part in ensuring the success of the programme. I stress this point because any failure by us to meet emerging challenges will imperil the future. While there are no guarantees of plain sailing, I remain optimistic about Ireland's economic prospects.</P>
    <P>The programme is predicated on and dependent upon achieving an average annual GNP growth rate of approximately 5.6% over the period to 2002 &ndash;<i>inter alia </i>on the basis of sustained improvements in productivity, that emerging supply side constraints will be overcome and that significant budgetary surpluses will be maintained through the programme. If economic growth exceeds this level, it may be possible to apply additional resources in a balanced way to accelerate progress towards the priority objectives of the programme, including social inclusion. Equally, if growth falls below this level it may be necessary to make more gradual progress. The entire package is carefully constructed to achieve a balanced outcome, offering a win win situation for all. If we each play our role in carrying its spirit forward, we can aspire also to the promise it holds out for each of us.</P>
    <P>I emphasise some aspects of the programme's content. The basic pay terms of the new agreement are the same in the public service and the private sector. The new agreement, if ratified, will commence in the public service on 1 October 2000 and will last for two years and nine months, expiring on 30 June 2003. It provides for the following increases in basic pay: 5.5% from 1 October 2000 plus a further 5.5% from 1 October 2001, plus a final increase of 4% from 1 October 2002. As in the private sector, there is provision for minimum increases of £12 a week in the first phase, £11 in the second phase and £9 in the third phase.</P>
    <P>In addition to the basic pay terms of the programme, a separate agreement has been concluded with the Public Services Committee of congress relating to certain groups colloquially known as &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo;. These groups have been arguing for some time that the local bargaining increases they received under the PCW were later exceeded by other groups. This agreement, which is conditional on acceptance of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, provides for an increase of 3% from 1 October 2000 for the &ldquo;early settlers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A resolution of the early settlers issue which would not give rise to new instability by sparking off further claims by other groups had to be found if a new programme was to be agreed. The 3% payment has been agreed with all the unions <Col N="367" /> involved &ndash; both early and late settlers &ndash; and will close the final chapter on the PCW.</P>
    <P>The agreement provides for a public service monitoring group to oversee the implementation of this and any future public service pay agreements. This group will provide a means of ensuring that the terms agreed between the parties at national level are implemented in practice within the various parts of the public service. It will be open to either side to raise any alleged breaches of the agreement in this forum.</P>
    <P>The industrial peace terms of the overall pay agreement also apply, of course, to the public service. In addition, the public service terms include a commitment to put in place voluntary codes of practice on dispute procedures to address, in particular, the maintenance of essential services. These codes of practice are to be agreed in each sector by 30 June 2000. If any difficulties arise in this regard, there is provision for the matter to be referred to the Labour Court or Arbitration Board as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The draft programme also outlines the key objectives to be achieved under the next phase of the public service modernisation programme. These will involve ongoing implementation of statements of strategy or service delivery plans within each sector based on the relevant policy documents and the SMI modernisation programme; design and implementation of performance management systems to support implementation; and implementation of challenging service standards set in consultation with the recipients of the service. It will also require greater organisational adaptability and flexibility in responding to service needs and that issues such as changes in grading, broadbanding and teamworking be addressed.</P>
    <P>The programme outlines the actions to be pursued in the Civil Service, the health services, the education sector and the local authority services. Corresponding actions are to be pursued in other parts of the public service. Overall, this represents a far more developed and sector-specific framework than was the case under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>To ensure that this ambitious programme is developed and implemented, the public service pay annex makes it clear that payment of the final phase increase of 4% is conditional on specific performance indicators being established in each sector by 1 April 2001, and achieving these sectoral targets by 1 April 2002 &ndash; with progress assessed at organisational level by 1 October 2002.</P>
    <P>The strong attachment to historical cross-sectoral pay relativities has bedevilled public service pay in the past. Apart from any other considerations, the rigidities inherent in the old system made it virtually impossible to deal with groups who might have had a justifiable case for a pay adjustment because of the knock-on effects which any such adjustment would have on other groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="368" /> A more recent problem is the perception of some public servants that their pay has fallen behind private sector pay, while private sector employees believe that public service pay has increased at a faster rate than theirs. Public service pay cannot evolve in isolation. It has to be set in the context of pay in the wider economy, to ensure equity between public service and private sector employees.</P>
    <P>The new agreement provides for a public service benchmarking body to undertake a fundamental examination of the pay of public service employees <i>vis-à-vis</i> the private sector, and make recommendations. This will not be an old-fashioned pay review. The benchmarking exercise will cover both pay and jobs in the public service and across the economy. It will examine and compare job content, duties and responsibilities in both sectors. The examination will also be based on in-depth and comprehensive research, examination and analysis of private sector pay across a range of employment types and sectors and will take account of the way reward systems are structured in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking body will be asked to produce its report and recommendations by the end of 2002, to allow the parties to discuss the implementation of its recommendations in the context of any successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Any increase which might emerge from the exercise will not take effect during the period of this agreement. It has been accepted that any outstanding claims or commitments relating to the pay of any group will be subsumed within the benchmarking exercise and will be dealt with solely in that context.</P>
    <P>The agreement makes it clear that cross-sectoral relativities are incompatible with the operation of benchmarking. In addition, the terms of reference make it clear that, even within a given sector, traditional or historical relativities between groups will not prevent the benchmarking body from recommending what it considers are appropriate pay rates on the basis of existing circumstances. There will be only one report covering all the groups involved, in order to achieve a coherent and integrated approach and to avoid the problems of the past, where an award based on the alleged exceptional circumstances of a particular group quickly led to a spiral of special pay increases right across the public service.</P>
    <P>The Government entered the talks on a new national programme determined that we needed, like any employer, to have certainty about the development of the pay bill over the period the agreement, to have stability and industrial peace within the public service, to advance the process of public service modernisation, and to tackle the issue of cross-sectoral relativities. I believe the draft agreement addresses all these issues, which have been the source of significant difficulties in recent years, in a constructive and balanced way and provides a logical and coherent approach going forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> The national minimum wage Bill will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the near future. The Government has decided, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government, that the national minimum wage agreement will be introduced with effect from 1 April this year, and that the minimum hourly rate will be £4.40. The pay agreement supports increases to £4.70 from 1 July 2001, and to £5 from 1 October 2002. I particularly welcome the agreement that no repercussive claims will be made by trade unions or employees as a result of the introduction of the minimum wage.</P>
    <P>Tax reform has been a key element of our approach to partnership since 1987. The combination of agreed pay increases with significant reductions in personal taxation has delivered substantial increases in net take home pay for all workers over the period of partnership. This approach will continue under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Over the period of the new agreement, up to and including budget 2003, take home pay of workers will increase by up to 25% or more when the taxation and pay elements are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Government has already begun a process of tax reform and tax reduction. We have introduced tax credits and have acted to remove substantial numbers from the top tax rate. We have pursued a policy of balanced tax measures, increasing allowances, widening bands and cutting tax rates. These policies have been welcomed by taxpayers and have contributed to increasing prosperity and fairness.</P>
    <P>The structure is in place for continued tax reform under the new agreement. Tax benefits can be delivered through increased personal tax credits, widening the standard rate band and reductions in the rates at which tax is levied. It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning below the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net.</P>
    <P>The social partners support the policy of establishing a single standard rate band for all individual taxpayers, and agree that the level of the standard rate band should be kept under review with the objective of ensuring that, over time, at least 80% of taxpayers are not subject to the higher rate of income tax. There is also agreement that a special working group will be set up to examine the role which refundable tax credits can play in the tax and welfare systems, and that employee share ownership, gain sharing and profit sharing and other financial employee incentives have a role in the development and deepening of partnership.</P>
    <P>I agree with the social partners that confidence in the fairness of the tax system is a prerequisite for successful partnership and that this must be maintained by determined action to combat tax evasion and fraud and to reduce opportunities for tax avoidance. The Government is fully aware of the need to maintain confidence in the efficacy of the tax system and I am confident that the major <Col N="370" /> and extensive new powers given to the Revenue Commissioners in the 1999 Finance Act provide a sound basis for tackling those who seek to evade their tax responsibilities.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said at Monday's launch, social justice, together with stabilisation and growth, are the key goals upon which the new programme is founded. It contains key objectives in the social inclusion and equality areas and outlines the various actions which will be undertaken to achieve these objectives. Together, the actions involved, backed by a £1.5 billion commitment to enable them to be implemented, represent a considerable demonstration of the priority which the Government accords to ensuring that the fruits of our new-found prosperity will be shared among all our people.</P>
    <P>In the central area of income adequacy, the real value of social welfare payments will be maintained and, where possible, enhanced in the context of making substantial progress over the period of the agreement towards a target of £100 per week for the lowest rates of social welfare. For pensioners, the agreement confirms that the level of old age pensions will be improved in line with the commitments given in the Government's review of An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>Senators will be only too well aware of the widened public interest and concern about the issue of child care. In the budget, I allocated £46 million a year for the child care area. This will be spent principally on increasing the supply of child care places throughout the country. There is unanimity that increasing the supply of places is the most urgent task in the whole child care area. This £46 million is the first instalment of the £250 million committed in the national development plan to assist the private and voluntary sector increase the number of child care places and to improve the quality of care provided. The issue of support for parents will be examined thoroughly this year, in consultation with the social partners, and the next budget will contain the Government's response.</P>
    <P>The agreement commits us all to creating a fair and inclusive society for everybody. To help achieve this, a wide-ranging programme of action has been agreed in areas such as disability, gender, refugees and equality proofing. In addition, several relevant institutions have been established, including the Equality Authority, the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations and the National Disability Authority.</P>
    <P>The partnership process which we have evolved in Ireland is unique and has served us well. The new agreement outlines a basis for enhancing both our economic prosperity and the inclusiveness of our society through the first three years of the new millennium. As I said earlier, it offers a win-win situation for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many factors have contributed to the improvement in the economy since 1987 &ndash; a well educated labour force which has adapted <Col N="371" /> well to the high tech industries, major urban renewal, an increase in tourism and European funding. One of the most important factors, however, in the improvement in the economy has been social partnership. This has been a feature since 1987 when unions, employers and Government struck a deal to get the economy out of the deep depression into which it had been dragged by excessive borrowing and unreasonable pay demands by public sector workers at a time of high unemployment. The various national wage agreements since that time have played an important part in creating the Irish economic miracle.</P>
      <P>There are some economists who argue that social partnership is no longer necessary because at a time of record growth and labour shortages pay should be allowed to find its own level. Central Bank data show that labour productivity in Ireland has grown much faster over the past 15 years than it has in our major trading partners, countries such as the UK, the US and Germany. The weakness of the euro has made the productivity gap appear even wider than it actually is. Over time, however, productivity gains here will start to converge with those in other countries.</P>
      <P>Some economists, including Professor Brendan Walsh of UCD, have argued that paying employees higher wages is a valid mechanism for slowing economic growth in a gradual fashion. He believes that rising wage levels will act to reduce competitiveness and thus act as a welcome break on the economy. There is no doubt that the economy is expanding at an unsustainable rate. Last week a leading firm of stockbrokers predicted that growth would touch 9% this year, having exceeded 10% last year. Given that unemployment has already fallen to 5% and job shortages have developed in a number of sectors, the desirability of such rapid growth at a time when the physical infrastructure of the State is unable to cope is questionable. It would generate strong upward pressure on wage levels in key sectors. Mr. Jim Power of Bank of Ireland is of the view that the wage element of the proposed agreement &ndash; 15.5% over 33 months &ndash; is largely irrelevant because market forces are already delivering this sort of pay growth. Wage growth, he states, will continue because we have reached full employment. He is of the opinion that social partnership was important back in 1987 when we faced high wage demands at a time of high unemployment but now it is just trying to impose restraint on wages and will not work in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While respecting the views of these economists, I am nevertheless of the view that national pay agreements play an important role in our economy. The alternative is local pay bargaining which has the potential for long disputes and tends to throw up widely different views on what is appropriate. At least a national pay deal acts as an anchor rather than as a ceiling to pay. It <Col N="372" /> gives some sort of stability and protection from the worst excesses of bitter industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>When negotiations opened before Christmas on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Peter Cassells, insisted that prosperity must be shared more fairly and the budget surplus used to improve living standards and to invest in services for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, people with disabilities and the homeless. If the recent budget failed to address these issues then the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness has gone some way towards bridging the gap. I am pleased to note that for lower paid workers there is a floor of a minimum payment of £12.00 in the first year, £11.00 in the second year and £9.00 in the last nine months. On top of that there is a special social welfare package which exempts the first £200 per week from PRSI and raises the exemption level for the health levy from £226 to £280 per week. This is worth £5 per week, which will push their cumulative pay increase over 33 months to around 20%.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that underpinning this new agreement is a growing recognition that the distribution of available resources must be seen to be fair. As a result, the allocation for social inclusion measures within this agreement are substantially increased. I pay tribute to those who argued the case for the less well off and the socially deprived in the new national agreement. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the contribution made by Senator Joe O'Toole in this matter.</P>
    <P>Reading and listening to the media would lead one to believe that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness was solely about a wage agreement, but seeing the document for the first time late last evening I realised the programme covers a wide range of issues. I am indebted again to Senator O'Toole for providing me with a photocopy of the document. It is only right and proper that if we are discussing an issue as important as this document in the House, then Members should be circulated with the document shortly after its publication. The agreement covers a wide range of issues and is one of the best social documents I have read in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness aims to keep the economy competitive, provides a strong basis for future prosperity, improves the quality of life and standards for all, and brings about a fairer and more inclusive Ireland. The programme is built around five operational frameworks: improving living standards; furthering prosperity and economic inclusion; achieving social inclusion and equality; adapting successfully to change; and renewing partnership.</P>
    <P>One could speak at length on the many issues covered in these frameworks, but I want to make some remarks on the third framework, which deals with social inclusion and equality. I can sum up in a simple way the objectives of this framework by stating that its main thrust is to create <Col N="373" /> the conditions where people will enjoy a better quality of life and where poverty and the causes of poverty can be eliminated from society. Under this framework disadvantaged areas are targeted for investment. Over the past ten years the success of the economy has been the envy of many European countries. Great wealth has been created and the standards of living of many people have improved, but unfortunately the rising tide has not lifted all boats. There are many areas which still have problems of social exclusion and deprivation. Some 25 areas have been identified over the past years where deprived urban and rural communities are in greatest need.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that an interdepartmental committee will be established to identify and clarify the range of existing and proposed social exclusion measures in the national development plan from which integrated targeted intervention measures can be developed. The committee will make recommendations to Government by December 2000, enabling the 25 areas to be designated with a prioritised list of measures which can be implemented within the three year framework.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the document refers to local government, which has an important part to play in future prosperity. I have always welcomed the special policy committees which allow local sectoral interests, including the social partners, to participate alongside public representatives in the development of policy for their local authorities. The county and city enterprise boards, which have been a great success, will now have an explicit social inclusion focus in their strategies. Under the urban disadvantage heading, the local drugs task forces will continue to be funded to undertake initiatives to combat drug misuse in their areas. Funding will also be provided to urban areas outside the local task force areas where an emerging drug problem is evident.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House will know that the city of Dublin has a serious heroin problem. It has been estimated that there are over 13,000 heroin addicts in Dublin city and the Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, has been endeavouring over the past number of years to provide services to combat the effects of drug abuse. Recently the board requested Dr. Michael Farrell and his colleagues from the National Addiction Centre, London, to assess the progress the board had made, and his report was published recently. The report gives the management and members of the board reason to feel a justifiable sense of achievement. The report confirms that by providing services for people who have abused drugs, already some drugs centres in the Eastern Health Board area have been able to record a return to work of 40% of those who have been provided with treatment and rehabilitation. I understand this figure is high in the league of international comparisons. The centres are also reporting reductions in crime levels of between 60% and 80% in their catchment area. This is a point which I hope might be taken into consider<Col N="374" /> ation by those residents groups who have resisted the establishment of drug treatment centres in their areas, some of which have been supported by &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; politicians.</P>
    <P>The more heartening point in the report for me is that there is a 70% reduction in heroin consumption. Such a reduction in heroin use has been reported to be associated with a similar reduction in offending behaviour and it would be reasonable to estimate that the treatment for these individuals has effectively reduced the level of criminal offences by 70%. It is also heartening that the report shows there are now 119 general practitioners signed up to the protocol who are providing methadone treatment for their patients in their own surgeries. I make these points because it shows that investment by successive Governments in the treatment of drug addicts can be beneficial and I am delighted that the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness proposes to continue this investment.</P>
    <P>Returning to the wage aspect of the agreement, the document has introduced a new word, benchmarking, to the vocabulary of public service pay. The trades unions have agreed to cast aside old relativities and sign up to a new benchmarking agenda. The aim of benchmarking is to recommend salary levels for the main grades in the civil and public services in the light of private sector pay. A benchmarking report will be published by 2002, with a view to being included in the next agreement. The trades unions have also agreed that any special pay claims will be dealt with through this channel, effectively agreeing not to exceed the terms of the pay agreement. As the Minister stated, the antiquated system of relativities has been a major flaw in public service pay policy over the decades and if benchmarking guarantees that relativities and knock on claims will be controlled by the new system, then it will be the hallmark of this new wage agreement.</P>
    <P>There is cause for concern that wage increases of the type agreed in the new deal will trigger further inflationary pressures and damage the competitiveness of the economy. The inflation rate of 3.4% is now the highest in the EU while the kind of wage increases proposed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness are two to three times more generous than those on offer in the economies of Ireland's main trading partners. There is also concern that the national wage agreement will be an additional contributor to the gradual overheating of the economy. The signs of overheating are clearly evident in the surging house prices, the infrastructure deficit and the labour shortages in almost every sector of the economy. On balance, however, the economic boom can be sustained, even allowing for generous pay increases, as the pay element proposed is broadly in line with assumptions made by the ERSI in its mid-term review that the economy would grow at 5% each year. There are risks involved in the new wage agreement but the benefits of a relatively peaceful industrial environment make those risks worth taking. As the <Col N="375" /> Minister stated, we are in a win-win situation. I hope on the way through the programme there are no own goals scored. I wish the programme success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the earlier presence of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. He has survived the onslaught which he faced before the Christmas recess. I am sure that after the publication today of the Finance Bill, he will finally put all his critics to bed. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, to the House. A White Paper which he is about to publish will address many of the items related to education which are referred to in the national agreement.</P>
      <P>We can hold this debate on the new programme, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, with confidence knowing that it will contribute positively to the development of the economy over the next three years. We cannot pre-empt the decision of the 540,000 trade unionists who will be voting on the PPF programme over the next seven weeks. The programme is very balanced and it guarantees that low paid workers will receive sizeable pay increases over the next three years. We all know of the great economic growth in recent times, but wealth has not been distributed evenly across all sectors of our society. This social imbalance needs to be rectified not only within the new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness but also within broader Government policies that are implemented across the board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the strong provisions included in the national development plan, which the European Commission is considering, outlining our social and economic investment priorities for the period 2000-2006. Serious priority is being given in this plan to target both European Union Structural Funds and national Exchequer moneys to combat youth and long-term unemployment, to help early school leavers, to promote higher standards of adult literacy, to support drug rehabilitation programmes and to fight key social problems which are prevalent in urban and rural blackspots. We must not build a two-tier society where the wealthy become richer and the poor become poorer. This would fly in the face of what has constituted the fabric of Irish society, not only for decades but for centuries past.</P>
      <P>We must realise that economic growth must be spread across all sectors of society. In the 1980s when an economic boom took place in Britain, the policies pursued by the then Conservative Government only ensured that social divisions broadened and that the poor would not gain from economic growth. We cannot and must not make the same mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national development plan, the Government's budgetary strategies over the next three years and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness must all work in tandem to help low-paid workers and target social difficulties. While we must consolidate the economic progress we have <Col N="376" /> made in recent years, we must also ask ourselves how such growth came about. It is well recognised, both within the European Union and in the broader world, that the policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987, in terms of building up a social partnership agreement between trade unions and employers, helped to lay the groundwork for strong economic growth in the mid-1990s.</P>
    <P>The benefits of social partnership are many. It reduces the number of days lost due to industrial unrest. It gives great confidence to both indigenous and foreign investors that Ireland is a good place in which to locate factories, because employers know exactly the level of wages which has to be paid over a specific timeframe. The situation is different in many other European Union member states. For example, in France bilateral talks take place between specific unions and the Government on a monthly basis. If that were the case here industrial unrest would grow, more industrial work days would clearly be lost and the climate for good investment would be diminished.</P>
    <P>Over the past 13 years consecutive Governments have always built on the need to promote social partnership in terms of the implementation of Government policies. The new Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is the latest of these programmes. I hope the 540,000 trade unionists who will be voting in the coming weeks will support the new programme; there are many reasons why they should. The programme ensures, as the Taoiseach has said, that everyone will gain a fair share from the prosperity we have gained. It offers cumulative pay rises of up to 20.5% and tax cuts of at least 10% by the year 2002. Besides tax cuts worth at least £1.5 billion over the next three years, the PPF provides for £1.5 billion in social inclusion measures. This will see basic social welfare payments move towards £100 pounds per week. The biggest gains will be by those earning less than £200 a week who will not have to pay PRSI, and public service workers such as teachers who will get a 3% early settlers pay increase. Lower paid workers will receive cumulative pay increases of 20.5% and early settlers a cumulative increase of 19%. Other workers will receive cumulative increases of 15.75%.</P>
    <P>I welcome the additional measures in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill &ndash; to be published on Monday next &ndash; aimed at improving the position of low-paid workers. The measures were announced by the Government yesterday. These changes clearly take into account discussions on the new PPF agreement which has been finalised in recent weeks. Changes in this regard will include PRSI exemption for employees. Employees paying classes A and H, earning £226 or less per week, will be exempt from paying PRSI. Over 460,000 employees will gain up to £5.67 per week from this additional measure.</P>
    <P>Some 172,000 employees and self-employed workers will be exempted from the health contribution levy. The earnings limit for exempting <Col N="377" /> employees from the 2% health contribution is to be increased from £217 to £280 per week. All employees earning between £217 and £280 per week and all self-employed people earning between £11,250 and £14,560 will benefit by up to £5.60 per week at a cost to the State of £52.6 million pounds in a full year.</P>
    <P>These measures are additional to further improvements agreed by the Government recently, including the extension of the new carer's benefit, increases in old age contributory pension, increases in the invalidity pension and a new means of assessment for unemployment assistance and non-contributory pension claimants with savings.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed by means of the Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness to ensure that real and tangible financial benefits are given to low-paid workers. This is also a central focus of the national development plan which outlines our economic and social investment priorities for the seven year period 2000-2006. The ICTU general secretary, Mr. Peter Cassells, described the PPF as the best deal that can be got out of this process for workers and people on low incomes. This agreement reached under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will guarantee that increases of at least 25% over the next 33 months will be secured for low income workers. While it may be difficult for trade unions not to support this deal, we must respect their democratic right to support or reject such an negotiated package.</P>
    <P>What will the package mean in real terms for ordinary workers? The income of someone now earning £200 a week will rise to £212 per week in the first year, £223 in year two and £232 in year three. If someone is earning £400 a week, this will rise to £422 in the first year of this agreement, £445 in the second year and £463 in the nine-month phase three. That is an increase of £45 over the period of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Last week I read carefully the article written by Father Seán Healy, director of the justice office of the Conference of Religious in Ireland. He said he believed that this national agreement would ensure that all benefits of our economic growth are distributed fairly. He rightly stated that this strengthens the democratic process while addressing the fact that consensus is needed if resolutions to social problems are to be found. There is also the question of sustainability within the PPF which, Fr. Healy believes, is also addressed by means of the text of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The PPF states that the need to ensure an achievement of improvements in living standards in the shorter term is consistent with the long-term sustainability of economic and social progress, including the protection of the environment. For the first time, a concerted effort will be made to agree on a set of national progress indicators which will include the value of unpaid work, the cost of environmental damage, the cost of resource consumption and a variety of other important measures that will help give a more rounded picture to our economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> While the pay deal will pour extra money into our economy, our competitiveness will not be lost. This is because our growth rates will rise to between 9% and 10% this year alone. The growth rate in our economy should and will ensure that these pay increases can be subsumed within the overall working of our economy. There is also a clear political consensus among many of the political parties in the Oireachtas that partnership is the way to solving many of our economic and social difficulties. Other EU member states look with envy at the manner in which many consecutive Irish Governments have secured social and economic agreements. Economic wage agreements give stability to an economy, which is one of the most important prerequisites if we are to entice new industry here and create more long-term sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness is a core theme of the programme, which has identified some key competitiveness challenges. To meet these challenges, we must secure a leading position in the emerging information society. We must promote lifelong learning as a national priority. We must move up the value chain of economic activity by investing in research and development, innovation and upskilling. We must continue to reform our regulatory and competition systems and modernise the public service to ensure the provision of quality services lies at the heart of all public service organisations.</P>
    <P>The programme contains a package of measures to develop key sectors of the economy, including indigenous and foreign-owned industry, small businesses and services, tourism, construction, energy, the food industry, forestry and the marine sector. The new programme reflects a shared commitment by the Government and the farming organisations to the continued development of a competitive, high quality and high value agricultural sector, which ensures increased living standards for farm families, in line with increased standards in the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is almost 12 months since the Government approved the Agenda 2000 reform package for the CAP for the period 2000-6. The Agenda 2000 reforms have resulted in price reductions in the beef, dairy and cereal sectors, while appropriate compensatory measures have been put in place to offset such price reductions. Under the Agenda 2000 programme, there is also increased funding for the rural environmental protections scheme and support is given for programmes such as the farm retirement scheme, on-farm investment and rural development measures such as the Leader Plus initiative.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness builds on the Agenda 2000 reform programme concerning the CAP. The PPF package for the agricultural sector involves continuing investment in agriculture policies for individual product areas, a deepening of the standard of service provided to farmers, a renewed effort to eradicate animal disease and a taxation system that underpins the long-term viability of this sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is not simply about pay but addresses other key social problems. The programme supports the tackling of the growing need for social and affordable housing, as well as the need to improve the existing social housing stock. There will be substantial investment in local authority homes in the next four years, as well as in the voluntary housing sector. The social partners and the Government will work together to tackle the urgent need for more affordable housing.</P>
    <P>The programme recognises that policies to support child care initiatives are a cornerstone of future social and economic progress. This includes a commitment to a substantial increase in child benefit over the period of the agreement, with a priority focus on progress towards £100 per month for third and subsequent children. The Government is committed to take key decisions to build an equitable framework to support parents with child care needs.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the health package under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will have a significant impact on the quality of life of our citizens and will be of particular benefit to disadvantaged groups. The programme includes a series of measures to target health promotion and preventative strategies. Major capital investment is also planned under the national development plan, as is the upgrading of facilities in the community health sector. Initiatives are set out to address specific needs, including those of children, people with disabilities and women.</P>
    <P>As a Member of Seanad Éireann representing the constituency of Donegal South-West, I wish to turn to the provisions in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness concerning the marine sector. One of the most important challenges facing the marine sector is the review of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002. Opportunities for the fishing industry in the context of this review will be maximised, including pursuing the long-standing case for a significant increase in Ireland's quota share and more effective fisheries management systems within the CFP framework.</P>
    <P>I hope the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources reads the parts of the programme relating to the marine sector. This is the first time I have seen an acknowledgement of the deficiencies in the fishing industry. The programme refers to the need &ldquo;to balance the objectives and parameters of the EU Common Fisheries Policy with the potential to develop the sector in coastal regions where alternative work programmes are few&rdquo;. I come from such an area, which relies totally at present on tourism and the fishing industry. Since the CFP was put in place, our industry has continued to reduce. It is only due to the initiative of many fishermen involved in the pelagic fleet that any progress has been made in the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" /> I am glad to see an acknowledgment in the programme that &ldquo;opportunities for the fishing industry in the context of this review will be maximised, including pursuing the long-standing case for a significant increase in Ireland's quota share&rdquo;. Year after year nobody pays any attention to this difficulty, which will only be redressed by political decisions rather than departmental decisions.</P>
    <P>The programme also refers to the need for &ldquo;more effective fisheries management systems within the CFP&rdquo;. We agree with conservation and management. However, it always seems that it is only our fishermen who have to adhere to conservation and management requirements. The fisheries programme will also address the difficulties that arose due to very lacklustre polices for the development of the industry. For years, it was a question of selling whatever one could for whatever value one could get in any market. I am glad to see an effort will now be made to maximise the value added potential of our fishery resource through the supply and demand chain.</P>
    <P>Another important factor is the development of aquaculture, so that we can realise the significant further potential of this industry for sustainable development. There has been a huge development of aquaculture in my county. Unfortunately, it has been hindered by a lack of resources. No proper sewage treatment plants exist, which means the water quality is deficient. Many people who have been in the industry for years cannot get proper licences now because of the poor water quality.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the industry, such as the development of the inland fisheries, to which we referred when we debated the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill before Christmas. The programme states, &ldquo;The fish processing sector will be supported to create a competitive value-added capability of scale at national and international level through development of new products&rdquo;. It goes on to state, &ldquo;Investment support strategies for the medium to long term will be informed by a comprehensive review of the processing sector to be carried out in early 2000&rdquo;. In addition, &ldquo;A first class national fish and shellfish health monitoring and research capability will be developed and resourced to provide the highest service delivery standards&rdquo; to the fishing sector.</P>
    <P>We must ensure &ldquo;safe products of top class quality for the consumer in line with the Food Safety Authority and export requirements&rdquo;. We are an exporting country and European consumers have great confidence in the Irish food products. Irish and European consumers enjoy eating Irish fish products. They are recognised as being of the highest standards in terms of food quality. This process must be continued. The PPF recognises this is a key objective.</P>
    <P>The agreement has been designed to ensure industrial peace. There is no doubt that the industrial peace that followed the previous agreements was instrumental in creating the Celtic tiger and developing the economic success we have <Col N="381" /> achieved in recent years with substantial current budget surpluses. The package will share the fruits of the economic growth more equitably than has happened in previous social contracts.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures needed to implement the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will be included in the social welfare and finance Bills being published this week. However, many other elements, such as addressing the child care issue and the removal of all those on the minimum wage from the tax net, will depend on securing economic growth of approximately 5.6% per annum.</P>
    <P>The programme also attempts to break the old system for pay relativities within the public sector by linking salary levels in the main grade of the civil and public service to private sector pay rates. Previous programmes failed in relation to this issue. An extra £2.8 billion will be spent by the Government to buy industrial peace in the public sector over the next three years.</P>
    <P>Many economists have claimed that this agreement will fuel an already overheating economy with additional cash and have advised against such a measure. They have warned that present surpluses should not be used in such a manner, that is, by giving large tax cuts and wage increases. This action can lead to higher inflation which was the downfall of our economy in the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. We have the highest rate of inflation in the EU at a projected 4% per annum this year.</P>
    <P>These same economists have suggested investing in infrastructure in the good times and giving tax cuts when the economy slows down. This agreement includes a bit of both. However, the promise of three years of industrial peace, generous wage increases for the low paid, the possibility of 80% of taxpayers being on the standard tax rate, the many measures promoting social inclusion and giving an acceptable level of income to pensioners and those depending on social welfare payments are positive elements which should be endorsed by all the social partners.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to some of the social welfare changes. The new carer's benefit, which would allow employees to take job protected leave of absence to care for incapacitated relatives, will be payable for 15 months instead of 12 months. The benefit, which is based on PRSI contributions and will not be means tested, will be approximately £88 per week payable from next October. The issue of carers is leading to much dissatisfaction and we, as public representatives, are faced with it on a weekly basis. It costs the State far more if relatives are institutionalised rather than being kept at home and their carer receiving the carer's allowance. More flexibility should be allowed in relation to means testing. I refer, in particular, to widows who have no means other than a small income. Many of the widows in my county have small British pensions. On a review, their pensions are calculated at a sterling rate and they find <Col N="382" /> that after a year their carer's allowance has been substantially reduced. They have budgeted their family income based on what they have received in the previous year. There should be more flexibility when deciding on that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new means assessment for unemployment assistance and non-contributory pension payments. The Government has given a commitment that all social welfare payments will be a minimum of £100 per week at the end of this agreement. The programme for Government promised pensioners a minimum of £100 per week, which will be reached in the next budget. The minimum social welfare payment will be reached by the end of this agreement.</P>
    <P>During the last general election I met unemployed people in a very rural and peripheral part of County Donegal. I asked what would satisfy them and one said an increase of £10 per week in the single person's social welfare payment. They have received an £11 per week increase over the past three years of this Government and under this agreement they will receive a further £28 per week approximately over the next three years. That shows the progress we have made in the past two and a half years and I hope further progress which will be made in the next 33 months.</P>
    <P>I said earlier the Minister is about to introduce a White Paper on education. This programme's commitment to recruit 1,500 new teachers over the next three years, the lifetime of the agreement, at primary and post primary levels is welcome. This is on top of the 1,000 extra teachers announced by the Minister in December. This is the largest number of new teaching posts created in a single year. It will assist in attacking the problem of early school leavers and will help give second chance education to many. The posts will be allocated to meet the greater needs within the partnership for education. The allocation of additional teachers will lead to smaller classes and an improvement in the pupil teacher ratio. It will also allow for concentration on subjects where standards and grades have been slipping. Money will also be provided to target areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Proper education for all, including lifelong learning and training for proper skills, is an important element of this agreement. Major funding will be provided for secondary schools to encourage adults to return to the classroom. The Government is committed to underpin lifelong learning with £1 billion in funding during the lifetime of the current national development plan. There is a great need to have more skilled workers available for the thousands of jobs coming on stream. Some 75% of the long-term unemployed have low levels of education and 50% of those between 25 and 65 years of age have no leaving certificate. These statistics show the relevance of education to employment. In my county, particularly on the Inishowen peninsula, statistics show the difficulties faced with huge levels of unemployment mainly due to a poor level of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> I mentioned the different items in the programme in relation to farming and the marine industry. Many infrastructural difficulties are being addressed in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, particularly transport. There is a recognition that public transport must be improved and that bottlenecks need to be overcome to improve people's quality of life and to sustain economic growth. A reduction in travel time to work in congested urban areas will be tackled. Public private partnerships will be used to speed up delivery of the new transport systems and there will be immediate investment in our national roads and motorways.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £17 million provided to my county by the NRA last week. There is a large number of roads in County Donegal. We hope that over the next two to three years the two remaining stretches of national primary road will be improved and restored. However, we need substantial funding, particularly in the west of the county, for the national secondary road, the N56. Donegal County Council plans to spend between £50 million and £70 million over the next five to six years. Last week, under the national roads programme, we received £4.5 million for specific projects from the Department of the Environment and Local Government from a total package of £15 million. However, the other £10.5 million provided for road maintenance and strengthening under the multi-annual programme is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The roads infrastructure may or may not contribute to the high levels of unemployment. We are told the national unemployment figure is 4.9%, that we have now reached full employment and that there are huge labour shortfalls. County Donegal still has 21% to 22% unemployment and special research should be carried out in counties such as Donegal and Louth where there are still high levels of unemployment. What is the underlying factor causing this unemployment? I know we have little hope of foreign investment, although the IDA has been instructed to provide up to 50% of new jobs in the BMW region. The annual report of Údarás na Gaeltachta, an agency which has dealt favourably with my county and other counties on the western seaboard, showed a decrease in jobs. I do not know where we will turn or what will happen in relation to unemployment but I do not believe we are tackling the issues which could create employment.</P>
    <P>I said earlier the marine industry needs to be sustained. Unfortunately, because the majority of the marine processing industry is based in Donegal and there is only a small number of public representatives from that area in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the issue is not being given high enough priority. The bodies representing the fishermen do not have the same national prominence as the IFA. There are other areas which we could tackle, such as tourism. I heard this morning on Raidió na Gaeltachta that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provided £250,000 <Col N="384" /> in additional moneys for marketing grants. We are marketed to death at this stage. The problem is that we have no basic tourism infrastructure other than the scenery and the welcome of the people. This specific area should be looked at to try to introduce tax incentives and possibly grants to enable people who want to develop tourism infrastructure to do so. The town renewal programme will be of no benefit even if a couple of towns in west Donegal are included. I would like the Government to expand the rural renewal pilot scheme in the upper Shannon region to west Donegal.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the efforts of all those who took part in the negotiations on the programme and who worked to reach an agreement on it. I pay particular tribute to Senator O'Toole for his efforts not only in working to finalise the programme but also in providing us with copies of the agreement, which were difficult to get yesterday, as they enabled us to prepare for this debate.</P>
    <P>The core objectives of the programme are to build a fair, inclusive society, to eliminate urban and rural poverty and to ensure that the economic success and benefits achieved are shared by all our people so that no one is left behind. I look forward to the progress of the programme over the next 33 months. I believe much progress will be made in tackling the many deficiencies in our society over the next 33 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his kind words. I very much appreciate them. Many people from all walks of life, the social community pillar, the trade union pillar, the employers pillar and Government employees in the Department and various Departments of State contributed to make this agreement possible. If I might single out one group, I would mention the extraordinary work done by civil servants during the negotiations on the agreement. I saw many of them working up to 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. and they were back at their desks the next morning at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. That contribution is often forgotten.</P>
      <P>The most important point about this programme is that it is a compromise document. It is a classic case of four interest groups with an overarching objective of achieving what is in the country's best common good. Those four groups negotiated to reach agreement on economic and social progress here over the next three years and they did that in a way that did not cut across the autonomy or discretion and power of any of the groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members raised the issue here about the participation of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the negotiations. This agreement is part of the implementation of the Government's programme. The Government implements it in consultation with the social partners. I could pick out a hundred things in this document that do not meet precisely my set of demands which I would like changed, but I am sure so could the community and employers pillar, the business pillar and the <Col N="385" /> Government. When employees, who are members of a trade union, get a copy of this document from a trade union, they must read it in the context that it represents an attempt to bring together the greatest needs and demands of all the different groups. It that sense, it will not satisfy fully any particular group. This is a starting off position which reasonable people must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>The programme is based on certain levels of economic progress. If I might gently tease the Minister of State on what he said, he reflected the cautious view of the Department of Finance, which is dependent on economic growth of 5.6% over the next three years. That rate has increased by 0.1% since I heard him speak about this matter a month ago. It will not have gone unnoticed that over the last two weeks Goodbody Stockbrokers indicated economic growth would be above 7.5% and ABN AMRO said that it would be closer to 10%. That is quite in order. It is also important to recognise that the one factor that could undermine the effectiveness of this agreement is inflation, if it got out of hand. Perhaps people over-reacted last month to inflation figures which seem to have gone very high. However, it should be recognised that almost 1% of that increase comes down to one issue &ndash; the increased excise duty on tobacco following the budget, so that was perfectly understandable and in order.</P>
    <P>The other issue to which the Minister of State referred is the establishment of a public service monitoring group. He clarified a matter that is somewhat unclear in the programme. That group will be established to oversee the current as well as future public service pay agreements. That is important.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers and the Minister of State have given an overview of the objectives of the programme, the elements that are in it in terms of the broad brush strokes. I would like to cherry pick some issues in it of which people should be aware. The programme underlines the Government's policy on individualisation, perhaps not in exactly the same words used by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech but it supports a move in that direction. Most importantly, there is the objective in the programme under taxation to try to bring all those who are paid less than the national proposed minimum wage out of the tax net. Members should reflect on that for a moment. That is probably of more value to the people concerned than any of the pay increases or other tax improvements. Effectively, if it is delivered, it will mean people who are entering the tax net at £110 a week will not enter it in future until they earn approximately £170 a week. That difference of £60 in their tax free allowance will mean they will have a net gain of approximately £25 or £30 a week. That would be of greatest significance. If I was to commend the Government to prioritise one issue in the programme, that would be it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> A question has been raised as to whether some unions are unenthusiastic about the agreement. Those unions, in particular my colleagues in MANDATE which organises employees in shops, are worried that people on low levels of pay will not get their full share of national wealth. That is perfectly understandable. I know they would welcome this measure.</P>
    <P>The agreement gives a commitment to the introduction of a national minimum wage and, more importantly, to increase the level from £4.40 in steps up to £5. The figure of £5 an hour is minimal. It is pretty parsimonious of industry not to agree to pay people more than £5 an hour. Any of us working in the Dublin area know employers will not get people to work for that kind of money in Dublin because people could not afford to pay their bus fares in and out of town to take up a job that would pay that rate per hour. It would have been a more generous gesture if they agreed to increase that figure.</P>
    <P>Under taxation, there is an objective that within the three years and under the next three budgets 80% of taxpayers will be on the normal or the basic tax rate. That is an extraordinarily important objective that will be met. Not everyone agrees with the detail of measure. There are many people in the trade union movement, myself included, who would say that the reduction of the tax rate, which is a major priority for the Minister, is the least important and that we would prefer there to be a widening of the bands. We would prefer more people to be brought into the normal tax rate and other improvements made, but nonetheless that was one of the compromises we had to make in our discussions.</P>
    <P>I will not go into the pay issue as it has been dealt with. While industry and business people talked about the importance of this programme to them in terms of giving them certainty and being able to plan for the future knowing what their wage costs will be, there are many ordinary working people, whether they work on the factory floor, in shops, schools, professions or wherever, who also appreciate knowing what their salaries will be over the next three years, as that will allow them to plan. It gives people a great sense of reassurance to be able to pick up this document and know, irrespective of whether they are happy with the level of increase, which they probably are not because none of us ever is, what their salaries will be next year, the year after and the year after that. People with repayments on a house will be able to look at the difference in disposable income that the increased salary will give them in the second and third years of the agreement and that will give them some comfort. They will have a chance to take a holiday that they cannot afford this year. It will also give them a chance to improve the quality of their lives.</P>
    <P>I would also draw more attention than previous speakers to modernising the public service. Outside the public service there is an unfair and unfortunate view of what happens in it. The area <Col N="387" /> I know best is education. Over the past four years teachers, management boards and everyone involved in primary education have taken on and managed elements and levels of change which have not been matched anywhere else in the private sector. This applies not just to teachers but it is mostly teachers. They have taken on a new curriculum. They joined the information, communication and technological age and are making it available to children, the next generation. That is crucially important. They are looking at new languages and science. We will have to sit down and negotiate with the Department of Education and Science about it. If restructuring is required it will have to be included in negotiations and monetary rewards given as we go along.</P>
    <P>Contained in this agreement for the first time is an overall structure for modernisation and change within the public sector. It goes through a certain number of stages outlined clearly on page 24 of the document. There is an overall statement of strategy which caters for education, local government, the health sector and the Civil Service. It outlines what we should try to achieve and how important are those targets.</P>
    <P>Reference is also made to a business or service, how it will be planned, how to provide a means to manage the performance within that system and how to deliver a quality service. First there is a strategic approach, then overall planning, followed by performance planning at local level and then service delivery. How does that happen? I will move away from business language and apply it to the health or education area. In the education area the strategy statement will include overall issues like the curriculum, the policies of the Department of Education and Science entered into in co-operation and by discussion with the education partners. That is the overall goal. That is what we are trying to achieve whether it is literacy, subjects or whatever. That is what is important. How do we make this work in a small school in Sligo or Dingle? We do that by putting in place a school plan in every school in Ireland. In the business world it would be called a business plan. The school plan might have been referred to in previous years as a scéim seachtanna or scéim bliana or weekly, monthly or yearly plan. The plan would outline all the subjects to be covered over the year. It also indicates what the school intends to achieve. Very often it might not be able to achieve certain goals but it is an honest attempt to outline what it is trying to do. The plan is also brought to the attention of parents and the school management. It is not a private document. Under the Education Act it must be accessible.</P>
    <P>We have the overall picture and school plans but how do we ensure they are put in place? How do we verify that the process is working? In primary education that can be done through an evaluation system conducted by the inspectorate. People should recognise that. In the document we <Col N="388" /> have an absolute model of how something is planned nationally, implemented locally and verified locally by an external agency such as the inspectorate. I can give similar outlines of what will happen in the health and local government sectors and in the Civil Service. I want people to understand that the public sector is modernising at quite a pace and this programme allows people to have confidence in the quality of the service.</P>
    <P>We must always watch the balance between reducing tax and the State's investment in the public service. We need good education and health services. We do not want queues in outpatient clinics. We do not want children in overcrowded classes. We must get the right balance between all those things but we must also give value to the taxpayer. As a teacher I can say that teachers wish to be accountable. Workers in the health sector and the Civil Service also wish to be accountable. All the people in the public sector unions with whom I deal on a daily basis are in the business to ensure that a quality service is being provided. It is not our job to protect people in the Civil Service who are not doing their job well. Taxpayers' money is used to pay people whether they are in the Civil Service, the wider public service or teachers. It is in all our interests that a quality service is provided for people who are depending on us. That is the modernisation of the public service.</P>
    <P>Another huge area is investment in lifelong learning. In this document there is a chronological approach beginning with early childhood education and learning. That also includes child care, primary education, post-primary education, third level education and adult education. This is the first time I have seen that type of an education spectrum outlined in a national agreement. Anyone will agree that is important and it is something about which we need to be aware.</P>
    <P>It is not just those broad brush strokes that are mentioned. The document goes into detail about ensuring that there will be teacher supply. Many Members will recall the late 1980s when there was a large number of unemployed teachers. They could not get jobs for love or money and had to leave Ireland. This programme puts in place a commitment from Government to increase the teacher numbers in schools by almost 2,000 over the next three years between primary and post-primary. There is also an agreement that the Department of Education and Science will sit down with the education partners to agree where new teachers are needed. They will decide if teachers are needed in rural schools which have too many children in multi-grade classes or whether more remedial teachers are necessary.</P>
    <P>A commitment has been given to invest in and provide special education. Special education gets a specific mention in the programme because it states that children with special needs and disabilities will be looked after. Many Members have asked me what is the position regarding principal teachers in small primary schools. There is a commitment in the programme to implement <Col N="389" /> the outcome of the review group on principal teachers within three years. That puts in place what we badly need. Principal teachers have phoned me to tell me what a bad job I have done and that it will take three years to implement the scheme but in my view it puts in place something which has been needed for many years and it will only take a couple of years to fully implement it.</P>
    <P>If we look at that balance in education and then go beyond that, we can say we are now looking at education from the womb to the tomb. Child care is now being dealt with in a serious way and money and tax credits are being made available. That makes it important also. These are fundamental and specific issues. I could also throw into that loop the fact that £1.5 billion will be invested in social inclusion policies. I have great difficulty coming to terms with these figures. When I was growing up people used the term &ldquo;billion&rdquo; with a sense of awe but now it is used every day. If £1.5 billion is invested in making this a more inclusive society, how can trade Unionists or other people vote against the programme? How can people vote against an investment in an improved quality of life for the most marginalised and excluded members of society? That is an important issue. The fact that the programme clearly refers to refugees, travellers and other marginalised groups and contains an understanding that these people are entitled to support from the Government, the State and the community is important in terms of granting them parity of esteem.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the issues about which people are concerned, such as traffic congestion in rural and urban areas, are dealt with in this document. Another important aspect of this document is that it contains rural proofing. In other words, it represents the first serious attempt to ensure that rural areas obtain their due share of the investment on offer. That development will be warmly welcomed.</P>
    <P>The programme includes a clear understanding of the importance of supporting people in disadvantaged communities and areas. It contains a set of objectives in this regard, including dealing with the drugs problem and tackling all forms of disadvantage. With regard to the latter, the programme contains two sections on housing which deal not only with local authority housing provision but with the needs of people in local and middle income groups who wish to purchase houses.</P>
    <P>I accept that many aspects of the programme may be aspirational. However, it is a serious attempt on the part of the representatives of all sections of society to put on paper a series of objectives under the heading &ldquo;A Programme for Prosperity and Fairness&rdquo; and set out our stall for the next two to three years. In my opinion the programme, which attempts to deal with issues of major national importance, represents the way to do business. It deals with the issue of pay and I accept that the pay deal is not good enough. As a trade union general secretary I would have <Col N="390" /> liked to see higher wage increases being granted. On the other hand, the Government has given a commitment to supplement the 15% increase with tax changes over the next three budgets which will improve people's net take home pay by a further 10%. That is an attractive package.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the modernisation of the public sector. I did not deal with the area of partnership and I do not have the time available to do so. However, it is important that we develop a partnership approach in the public and private sector. To put it simply and crudely, the programme recognises the importance of employers and businesses encouraging members of their workforces to use their intelligence at work. In other words, people will be asked to put forward their views and proposals and it will not be a case of their merely being directed to complete certain given tasks. The programme encourages those at all levels in the workplace &ndash; from board members to sub-board members to those on the factory floor, etc. &ndash; to discuss how their companies and institutions could be more efficient, deliver a better service and be more family friendly.</P>
    <P>This programme is the first serious attempt I have come across to try to achieve a balance between people's personal and working lives, to develop family friendly policies and to set out clear objectives on issues such as job-sharing, flexible working hours, teleworking, etc. We have reached the stage in our economic growth where people work harder and longer. To ensure that they retain their workforce, employers will have to be more flexible than heretofore. That cannot be a bad thing.</P>
    <P>The programme also makes a serious attempt to address the issue of equality. I am sorry that there are no women present in the House for this part of my contribution.</P>

      <P>The issues of equality and bullying in the workplace, which are very serious, are addressed in the programme. It is high time that this was done. There is no doubt that people suffer in the workplace. I am glad the problem of bullying in the workplace is dealt with in the programme because there is a great deal of nonsense spoken about it and we need to distinguish between people who lose their temper on occasion and those who make persistent attempts to undermine and bully others. The various committees to be established under the programme will try to address the problem of bullying and to put structures in place to deal with it.</P>
      <P>There are many other issues such as e-commerce with which I should deal. However, in the time remaining I wish to comment on the way the programme was put together. Some Members do not share my view but I believe that an efficient Government is one which consults. Regardless of the problems which have arisen in respect of Governments over the past 12 years &ndash; Members on both sides have criticised them in turn &ndash; they have all been prepared to negotiate with the trade union movement and the business sector to try to work through economic plans which had the support of all sectors of society. In recent years, the process has been extended to include people from the voluntary and community sector who represent those most marginalised in our society. Successive Governments presented their plans to these representatives who, in turn, put forward their views and a compromise was eventually achieved.</P>
      <P>The programme before us is a compromise and a model of consultation. It is, perhaps, not a model of efficiency in terms of how it was concluded. It is unfortunate that certain people had to remain in negotiations until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in order to hammer sense into the representatives of other groups. However, I am sure my views would be reciprocated by the representatives to whom I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme represents a consensus. There is nothing more important in a modern democracy than putting forward a plan for the country, the economy, the people and the marginalised which has been achieved by consensus. The programme considers people's position in the work<Col N="392" /> place, in the nation and in the broader world. It deals with people &ndash; young, old, disabled, refugees, travellers and the marginalised &ndash; in terms of their entire lives and looks at supporting them at important stages of their development. It also deals with the economy in terms of spending and saving, productivity, competitiveness, inflation and growth. I cannot think of a better model we could use to map out our future.</P>
    <P>The only criticism aimed at the programme is that there was not enough consultation with Members of both Houses. Perhaps Members should be allowed to put forward their views but there is always a danger that the process could descend into a party political conflict. This is a very good model from the point of view of a Government consulting with the people and I compliment this and previous Governments on the way they set about doing so. It has worked for the past 12 years and we have achieved unprecedented growth.</P>
    <P>Many of us are unhappy with the level of wealth sharing and more could have been done in this agreement for those on low incomes. I would like to see more money for those I represent and I could list 100 items which I would like improved. However, this agreement represents the consensus position of all the opposing groups. It is a creative manifestation of the tension between four groups with four different sets of demands which have been brought together with the over-arching objective of seeking the common good.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I wish the middle-aged Senator O'Toole well in the development of the social revolution to which he looks forward. I always realised he was literate but I did not realise until today that he was innumerate. Perhaps he will address that deficiency.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator O'Toole's endorsement of the programme and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats I wish to express great satisfaction at the successful conclusion of another three-year national agreement and the launch of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. We hope it will be endorsed by all the parties which subscribed to it.</P>
      <P>The partnership model has served this country extraordinarily well over the past 12 years. The combination of economic certainty and industrial peace has created a climate conducive to social progress, the prosperity of the country and its citizens and helped the significant growth in inward investment. This investment has also been assisted by the fact that this is an English speaking, stable western democracy. These facts are sometimes taken for granted but they contribute significantly to the attractiveness of this country for foreign investment and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without doubt social partnership has played a major role in the transformation of the economy since the late 1980s. The scale of that transformation has been remarkable by any standards. <Col N="393" /> Employment has surged to unprecedented levels considered unattainable six or seven years ago. Unemployment has fallen dramatically as a result and Ireland is well on the way to becoming one of the wealthiest countries in Europe &ndash; a fact thought impossible ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Last year the Progressive Democrats identified three elements essential to any new accord &ndash; it must facilitate responsible wage growth, it must allow for gain sharing in the workplace and it must embody a new approach to pay determination in the public service. The PPF satisfies these three requirements. The new agreement will give every working person a significant increase in nominal wages &ndash; 15% over 33 months. The real value of that increase will be substantially boosted by the tax reduction commitments set out in the agreement. When the tax provisions are taken into account, the PPF will deliver an increase in net pay of about 25% in less than three years. This is a significant increase by any standards and would have been considered unattainable a few years ago. Ireland is now the most rapidly growing economy in the developed world and we can afford pay increases and tax reductions of this magnitude. I do not share some of the fears expressed with regard to consequent inflationary pressures. I am aware of the recent increase in domestic inflation but the tax and pay elements are sustainable within the context of our economic growth.</P>
    <P>It has also been a fundamental belief of the Progressive Democrats that only an enterprise economy can generate the resources necessary to create an inclusive society. That is the essential philosophy which underpins the agreement. The new agreement will cut taxes, improve incentives, encourage and reward risk taking, and generate additional tax revenues for the Exchequer by generating new economic activity. These extra resources will fund the very generous initiatives and social provisions which are welcome and essential features of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago we were given a spurious choice between cuts in taxes or services. When I entered the House ten years ago there was a small audience for the argument that tax reductions would lead to increases in revenue which would make it possible to pay for services and lead to greater job creation. However, that philosophy is now widely accepted. In the past 11 years we have slashed the rates of corporation, capital and income tax. Since 1989 the two rates of income tax have fallen by a cumulative 22% and it is a matter of considerable satisfaction to me that 21 of those 22 points came off while the Progressive Democrats were in Government. During this period of tax reduction, spending on public services has raced ahead. For example, public expenditure on social services has more than doubled in that period and this is clear evidence that cutting taxes hurts no one and helps everyone.</P>
    <P>The new national agreement cannot be viewed entirely on its own but must be seen in the con<Col N="394" /> text of the ambitious programme set out in the national development plan. It is important to consider the two programmes together. It must also be seen in the context of the commitment which the coalition parties have pledged to deliver within the lifetime of this Administration.</P>
    <P>We can look forward to the decade ahead with real confidence. For the first time in the history of the State we can truthfully say that our future is in our own hands. There is no limit to what we can achieve in the coming years, including on important issues such as poverty. For years long-term unemployment had been one of the most fundamental causes of poverty, condemning successive generations to despair and preventing them from playing their full part in society &ndash; the social inclusion issue. Speaking recently, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, who has direct responsibility for employment, said that it was her objective, and that of her party and the Government, to achieve the effective elimination of long-term unemployment within the lifetime of this Administration. Such an objective would have been regarded as impossible five years ago.</P>
    <P>The Government has already achieved much and will achieve more. However, even if it does nothing other than eliminate the scourge of long-term unemployment, it will have done a great service to the people. We must now start to think in terms of quality rather than quantity. Let us consider employment and jobs policy where for years our position was so bad that we were happy to take whatever was going on the jobs front, and that was an understandable position. However, the result was that we went into competition with Third World countries for low wage jobs which are now unsustainable given our rapid pace of economic growth.</P>
    <P>We will have to enhance the quality of Irish employment and that is catered for under the training and education provisions in the agreement. We will also have to exploit the significant opportunities available in international financial services, electronic commerce and software engineering and consultancy. We have already shown that we can succeed in these areas and I have every confidence that these sectors can be the driving forces in the Irish economy in the years and decades ahead.</P>
    <P>The issues of quality and competition in consumer choice are also closely interrelated. A State-owned monopoly dominated our skies 15 years ago. Today, as a result of deregulation, we have one of the most vibrant and fastest growing aviation markets in the world. Almost everyone can afford to fly and that affordability is due almost entirely to the liberalisation of the market which took place in the mid-1980s. The benefits of aviation deregulation to consumers have been immense and the same can be said of the telecommunications sector where, instead of a State monopoly, there are several companies vying with each other to offer new products and services to consumers at keenly competitive rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The lessons of liberalisation must be learned. Whether with regard to taxis, public transport or energy provision, this economy has much to gain from greater deregulation and liberalisation of the market. The consensus which has emerged through this programme is the proper model in terms of providing stability and a framework within which society can develop and prosper and continue to experience the sustained growth of recent years.</P>
    <P>I share Senator O'Toole's view that the growth projection of 5.6% which the Minister gave this morning is conservative and that it could be higher, notwithstanding inflationary pressures. I referred to that earlier and I do not believe inflation must necessarily rise above its current level. I hope it will be lower.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised an important issue about which I am concerned &ndash; the degree to which our democratically elected Parliament is bypassed, whereby the social partners sit with the Executive to devise a programme. It is a good programme and I do not take issue with what has emerged from it. However, there has to be a mechanism whereby Parliament can be more directly involved in the process. I take Senator O'Toole's point that it cannot be so cumbersome as to lead to what in Europe is called sclerosis, which means that everything stops. Nevertheless, there should be a role for Parliament. We are fulfilling that role today in terms of reviewing the programme, but perhaps some thought could be given to the input Parliament might make to the process, through the committee system or otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt comprehensively with the issue of public service pay. I welcome the benchmarking initiative and the efforts to overcome difficulties caused by pay relativity within the public sector which creates a vicious circle whereby one claim leads to more and more knock-on claims so that by the time we get to the end of the line we are back to square one and the whole process begins again.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the introduction of the national minimum wage, in relation to which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, played a key role. One can argue about the level of the minimum wage. However, the concept is entirely reasonable, and giving people at the lower end of the scale a living wage will not affect our competitiveness. I note that under the programme the minimum is to be increased from £4.70 an hour to £5 an hour by 1 October 2002. It is important also to take pay and tax together and to look at the increase in net take home pay of workers. It is through that conjunction that we have achieved a very significant increase.</P>
    <P>The issue of social inclusion is critical and I am glad to see it given strong emphasis in the programme. The aims of the programme as enunciated in the introduction are to keep our economy competitive in a rapidly changing world, provide <Col N="396" /> a strong basis for further economic prosperity, improve quality of life and living standards for all and bring about a fairer and more inclusive Ireland. They are worthy and laudable aims. What is in the programme affords us every opportunity to achieve them. I hope it will be implemented for the benefit of all citizens and that the prosperity we have enjoyed will continue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see an explicit commitment in the programme with regard to the starting of 22,000 local authority houses from 2000-03. Such initiatives need to be progressed with a certain urgency so that people who have been left out of the net, including child carers and other categories specified in the programme, can share in the prosperity which many have enjoyed but which some have enjoyed to a much lesser extent.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new agreement which, after a rocky passage, has reached its destination with the conclusion of the negotiations between the social partners last Monday. There are still difficult tasks ahead, particularly for the unions who have to sell the package to their members, but I am extremely heartened by the positive, constructive and responsible approach of Senator O'Toole and the manner in which, as a leading and very able trade union leader, he defined his vision of what partnership is about in terms of the economy and international affairs. I want to pay as high a compliment as I can to him for the manner in which he set out his stall here today. He could, for vested or selfish interests, have taken a different approach, but he took a very responsible approach. It is now over to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the other partners to sell the programme to their members. I understand that it will be some weeks before it is finalised. We in the Houses of the Oireachtas wish them well in their endeavours.</P>
      <P>The package provides a 15% pay rise for private sector workers and 18% for many public servants over 33 months. It has been broadly welcomed and will be voted on over the next few weeks. While the pay rises are the largest ever agreed under the five pay deals, they are felt to reflect market trends and the expected growth in pay rates. The accord also offers tax cuts of at least 10% by 2002. The pay rises and the tax package have to be taken in aggregation to appreciate the full extent of what is on offer. Allied to that is the very significant element of investment in social inclusion which is reflected across the board. In education it is reflected from pre-school through to adult education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Moffatt, to the House. The contribution of his Department will be quite substantial in that area. I also welcome the substantial contribution that has been made in education, pre-school, primary, second level and adult education. I look forward to the forthcoming publication of the first ever White Paper on adult education which, if the Green Paper is <Col N="397" /> anything to go by, will give a definitive and focused approach to second chance education. The target for the next six years is to reserve a substantial number of places at third level for second chance applicants. That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this agreement, which is balanced, reasonable, responsible and fair. What has been agreed by the Government, the social partners and the voluntary groups after three to four months of negotiation is a new programme for prosperity and fairness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers as well as their negotiating teams and the social partners must be commended for remaining focused and assiduously sticking to their task of bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion and finalising the partnership agreement, despite distractions such as the Northern Ireland peace process. Previous speakers, including an experienced senior trade union leader, spoke about the vital role of partnership. Social partnership on pay and other issues has served this country well since 1987. It has created increases in income and it has led to our having one of the best records of job creation in Europe.</P>
      <P>The level of trust engendered among the partners through successive agreements has brought this economy from the brink of bankruptcy in 1987 to the boom we are experiencing today. That transformation was unimaginable in the mid-1980s when I served in the other House. At that time foreign debt doubled, unemployment rose rapidly, inflation was in double figures and there was widespread industrial unrest which resulted in huge losses of man hours at work through strikes and work-to-rule campaigns. Against this background, growth was stagnant and poverty was widespread. The success of the trust engendered manifested itself in a new era of industrial peace which has steered our economy out of the morass of the mid-1980s to a completely new era of growth, prosperity and progress.</P>
      <P>In these booming times, with increased immigration and skills shortages in many industrial sectors, it is easy to forget the scale of emigration which blighted this country for so long. Over 200,000 people left Ireland in the 1980s to find work abroad. In 1988, before the fruits of partnership came into effect, almost as many people emigrated from Ireland as were born here. Ireland was unique among other nations in this regard. Most people went to work in Britain where there are still at least three quarters of a million Irish born people living and working. Britain siphoned off our surplus labour for decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration became the safety valve which prevented social unrest at home but it also helped the five partnerships to create the conditions which have led to our current economic growth. <Col N="398" /> I am sure most economic commentators would agree that only for these partnerships we would have become a banana republic long before the arrival of the new millennium. Instead, our success story has become the envy of Europe. One disadvantage is that our begging bowl days at the EU table are over. Every pound we receive from Europe in the future will be hard earned.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the management of recent agreements by the Government and the other partners, particularly the unions. From the outset of the talks in August or September last year, the Taoiseach was at pains to emphasise that significant groups should not substitute strikes and industrial conflict for the partnership approach through agreed procedures which are at the heart of social partnership. He also emphasised the Government's corresponding concern that the terms of Partnership 2000 should be fully honoured by all sides. The Government honoured in full the terms of that agreement and previous agreements and it accepted the outcome of adjudication through agreed procedures in the context of cost saving changes of the type envisaged in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.</P>
    <P>The Government has also promoted an ethos of public service modernisation based on partnership. This was commented on in great detail by Senator O'Toole this morning and I was delighted and heartened to hear what he said. There is no doubt this approach has been a phenomenal success. Support has also been forthcoming for the development of new forms of partnership in enterprise, previously not envisaged, through tax policies and the work of the national centre for partnership.</P>
    <P>Another vitally important ingredient in the Government's approach to this new agreement was its stated intention from the start to take a new approach and to be innovative in meeting the aspirations of public service employees while, at the same time, respecting prudent limits on public expenditure. Any responsible Government must balance the two in the long-term interest of the country and its people. The Taoiseach emphasised that both he and the Government fully recognised the key role the trade union movement, through ICTU, is playing in developing our social partnership model to the benefit of everyone. It is constantly being improved so that greater trust is built up. He further emphasised the Government's commitment to the further development of that model in the period ahead. However, he pointed out that this would only be achieved if the terms agreed through partnership were applied.</P>
    <P>Nobody could argue with the view that social partnership has delivered a dramatic increase in employment and living standards. It has brought about improvements in public services and finances and has provided a climate of certainty and confidence. Everyone knows where the goalposts are and they know they will not move once the agreed procedures are in place. Once trust <Col N="399" /> was established, the partners knew they would not be hoodwinked. Naturally, there have been exceptions where certain groups have not been able to meet their targets, which is regrettable. In general, this approach benefited both inward investment and employment growth because investors knew where they stood with this country's workforce. They regarded Ireland as an increasingly reliable and attractive base in which to invest in industry and technology.</P>
    <P>Emigration among our graduates, for example, has dropped to a record low from a decade ago, when one in five left Ireland. Record numbers of young people graduate from third level colleges and the buoyant economy is providing jobs for more and more of them. The number of graduates with jobs is at an all-time high. Last year, for example, a total of 34,288 people received awards ranging from certificates to post-graduate degrees. The percentage directly entering employment rose by 2.4% to 56.3% while the percentage undertaking further studies or training dropped from 38.8% to 35%.</P>
    <P>The percentage emigrating to work has dropped to 8% from a high of 20% a decade ago. The percentage in the seeking employment category last year was at 2.4%, a tiny increase on the previous year. The latest survey from the Higher Education Authority late last year provides a snapshot of where the 1998 recipients were placed at the end of April 1999. At six to nine months after completing their course of studies, the report shows improvements in the number finding jobs in all areas. Overall, the report shows that of those in employment, over 86% were employed in Ireland. Nearly 14% were employed overseas, the lowest proportion since 1983. The Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, Dr. Don Thornhill, said the proportion of graduates securing work overseas is the lowest since these surveys began almost 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Another interesting and beneficial aspect of partnership is that it has recognised and managed the links between different sectors or aspects of the economy. On analysis, one understands that the living standards of workers are determined, not by how fast nominal wages rise, but rather by the security and volume of jobs, the levels of taxation, the rate of inflation and the quality and volume of public services. This was commented on in detail by previous speakers and by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    <P>I refer again to facing change and challenge together through trust. Social partnership has so positively promoted trust among the partners that this has enabled the Government to face social challenges and structural changes in our society, working together with all the other partners. Those challenges and changes could not have been faced by a Government on its own. Let us be honest about it &ndash; without partnership, they simply could not have been taken on and achieved in this beneficial and successful manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> The agreement is a product of all of these benefits of the partnership. The agreement now concluded, subject to ratification by congress, whom we wish well and hope will ratify it, and the trade union movement, is a product of all of these benefits. It represents a new and far greater maturity in industrial relations, as the programme, if adopted, will be underpinned by industrial harmony. I am delighted that what seemed initially to be an almost impossible resolution has finally been arrived at in a manner that provides huge and substantial resources, targeted at promoting social inclusion. These resources have been targeted at education through all sectors, which Senator O'Toole very fairly acknowledged. They have been targeted at social welfare, expenditure on infrastructure, and used to recognise and respond to the needs of those who are in isolated rural communities. They have also been targeted at the health services.</P>
    <P>The results of the negotiations are to be highly commended and will not, as some prophets of doom forecast, increase inflation to great heights. It is a very balanced, integrated response to the needs of all sectors in our community. It is inflation-proofed and while there might be minor variations in the inflation rate, by and large the package is a great launch for the Irish economy in the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I listened to some of his contributions on the new national agreement, which I welcome. I do not have any criticism of this agreement because I welcome it. It is of vital national importance. We owe a debt of gratitude to all who assisted in its negotiation, all of the various so-called pillars, not least our distinguished colleague and Member of this House, Senator Joe O'Toole, whose contribution I also enjoyed. We must now hope the fruits of their combined labours pay off. They worked long and hard over three months of tough negotiations in framing this Partnership for Prosperity and Fairness. Hopefully, over the 33 months, once it is accepted and voted through by all the members of the unions involved, it will find overwhelming acceptance and will bear fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> This agreement is the fifth since 1987 and, as said by the other speakers, it has contributed significantly to our economic and social development. The Irish economy has managed to grow at twice the EU rate since the introduction of agreements in 1987. It has delivered six times the EU rate of employment growth. There is no doubt about the vast improvement in our living standards over that period. That is borne out by the measurement of personal consumption<i> per capita</i> which grew twice as fast during that period as the EU average. That is impressive and acknowledged by us all.</P>
    <P>I salute the objectives of this programme, which relate both to economic and social progress and are wide and all-encompassing. It sets out a comprehensive series of integrated economic and social objectives and the necessary operational frameworks to achieve them. We are deeply indebted to the social partners for the three months of hard work they put into this agreement. Detailed and lengthy discussions were required to produce such a document.</P>
    <P>For too long we suffered from high unemployment rates and the social exclusion of the weak, old and infirm. For the first time this programme sets out measures to tackle these social scourges of the recent past. The Minister told us this morning that no one owes us a living. That is true. For that reason we must continue along a careful path. Failure to meet the challenges which lie ahead will damage our future.</P>
    <P>The work which has been put into this plan is in the national interest. Partnership has been of tremendous assistance to economic growth and we must nurture it to ensure it continues. I welcome the commitments on taxation, child care and social welfare and the improvements for the low paid. We did not do enough in the past to tackle the plight of the unemployed. I welcome the measures which will assist in removing the young and those starting work from the tax net.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the publication of the Finance Bill to see what detailed measures are provided in it. Perhaps we will be more critical, although in a constructive way, of the Finance Bill than we are of the new national wage agreement. Maintaining the positive aspects of our growth and distributing the fruits of that growth in a fair manner are important national goals. Ireland has a unique approach to forging consensus through the social partnership approach. The management of social partnership by successive Governments since 1987 has been a real success story. I agree with Fr. Seán Healy of CORI when he says that the development of social partnership supports the democratic process. This agreement endorses the rights based approach outlined in the NESC strategy document, Opportunies, Challenges and Capacities for Choice. It recognises social, economic and cultural rights. It is broadly based, hugely comprehensive and points the way to a fairer society. A fair distribution of the available resources is addressed in this agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> The agreement deals with sustainable development, development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The programme states that there is a need to ensure that the achievement of improvements in living standards in the shorter term is consistent with the long-term sustainability of economic and social progress, including protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the agreement offers cumulative pay rises of up to 20.5% for the low paid and 15.75% for others, and tax cuts of at least 10% by 2002. It is the best attempt yet at ensuring everyone shares in the prosperity we have gained. All of us have heard complaints from those who feel they have not been touched by our economic success. Hopefully this agreement will change that. Tax cuts worth £1.5 billion over three years are provided while the same sum is provided for measures to tackle social exclusion. People earning less than £200 a week will be exempt from PRSI. The introduction of a benchmarking review body is another important innovation.</P>
    <P>It is laudable that 80% of taxpayers will not be subject to the higher rate of income tax. I welcome the idea of enhanced consultation when examining major tax policy initiatives. Perhaps we have reached a time when we could move to a system similar to that in the United States, where a committee of Congress assists with the formulation of the budget. We should strive for a uniquely Irish version of such a system, as we did with social partnership.</P>
    <P>The commitment that budget tax packages will be poverty proofed is also welcome, as is the aim to remove over a period of time all those earning below the minimum wage from the tax net. Many commentators have already described the agreement as the best deal for workers and people on low incomes. Senator O'Toole and Mr. Peter Cassells have both said as much. That is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>We are faced with a difficulty in that we are debating a document which has not been distributed yet. When the social partners reached agreement in the past it was fruitful for the economy and most people clearly benefited by it. I welcome much contained in the speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It augurs well for the future that the main players in the economy are consenting to this and that more people will be better off at the end of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about equality, child care and family friendly policies. I see a trend developing about which I am concerned. One of the problems with the economy is there is a shortage of unskilled and lower skilled labour at certain entry levels. If one goes around Dublin one will see notices seeking workers in every second window, and such workers are not available. The agreement will obviously encourage more people to go out to work. One of the categories of people <Col N="403" /> who are returning to the workforce or entering it for the first time are young people between the ages of 18 and 26. Many of these people would have been unemployed for a long time, did not get a good start in life, and a significant number of them are single parents or mothers.</P>
    <P>In my area, County Louth, on returning to work such people who had a medical card are under active review. There is nothing wrong with the health board reviewing medical card guidelines, but why is that sector being targeted specifically? I am endeavouring to find the answer to that question. I am to receive a telephone call in about five minutes to explain the reason but, as I understand it, medical card reviews do not take into account the child care costs a young mother incurs if she goes out to work with the result that hundreds of people are losing their medical cards on re-entering the workforce. That is significant because while the economy needs them, people who want to get out to work are finding it increasingly difficult to do so if they lose their medical card rights. This is happening in County Louth and I am trying to determine if it is a policy all over the country; I do not know the answer to that yet. It is a significant problem for a group in the community who could clearly be identified with the Minister's headline, equality, child care and family friendly policies. This is not a family friendly policy and it does not encourage people to re-enter the workforce. I do not have the details of the national wage agreement and I do not know to what degree there has been an input into that area, but we as a community must insist that this would change and that there must be sympathetic and positive recognition of mothers' entitlement to medical cards and other benefits on re-entering the workforce. This will have an important impact.</P>
    <P>A mother complained to me about her daughter. She is a chronic asthmatic who suffers from eczema and cannot bring her two hands together due to the pus and discharges. She has a part-time job &ndash; she works five days a week for less than five hours &ndash; and she has lost her medical card. That is disgraceful and that is replicated all over my county. I want something done about it. I do not want this just to be an empty comment; it is something which I intend to pursue and on which I intend to campaign. I would hope that the people who were involved in this plan would look clearly at this issue because this will apply everywhere. The medical card guidelines apply to each and every health board area. The Government must encourage these people. The economy needs them. The people want to work but if by going out to work they are faced with bills which they cannot pay, that is putting them at a serious disadvantage. I want that addressed.</P>
    <P>This is a significant group in society and they deserve to be mentioned also in the context of housing. Never was there such a need for local authority housing. Never were so few local authority houses being built. If the Government wants <Col N="404" /> people to work in the economy, it must provide them with decent health care and housing. Society is becoming far too selfish. It is being driven by forces outside of family interests in some respects. The Government is failing miserably to provide adequate health care and housing for people at whom this welcome document is aimed who are so badly needed in the workforce. I would urge a rethink of Government policy at the top. To have a happy workforce, it must be healthy and well housed. That is patently and obviously not happening. There needs to be a serious redirection of Government policy in this area. There is a need to redress the clear imbalance in society now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, to the House on this positive occasion. I compliment all the social partners to the national agreement, Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, and hope it will be accepted by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>As previous speakers stated, earlier national agreements have served the economy well. It is important to mention people like Mr. Des Geraghty, Senator O'Toole, members of IBEC, officials, the Government, other social partners and the farmers who have participated in the negotiations on this agreement and came up with a worthwhile document. It is generous in the sense of treating all its people in a fair way and it deals with the problems and the needs of a growing economy. The agreement contains a tremendous challenge for all the partners to ensure that every aspect of it works. It is an integrated plan and it covers all areas. If any aspect of it comes undone, it will have an effect on the overall outcome in all the sectors.</P>
      <P>In the past there were substantial national strikes in different sectors. The great challenge now is that the trades unions, the workers, employers, the people and the Government can focus on the working of the agreement. They can drive their energies in specific ways which will attain the targets set in the agreement. That, in itself, is a great focus and it is important to the success of the plan and to the future success of the people.</P>
      <P>I listened to Fr. Seán Healy of CORI speak about this plan on the radio. I welcome the social inclusion provisions in the plan and the interest which is being taken in the changes in the economy. New needs arise in a changing economy and they are addressed in the agreement. It is important that the people see they are part of the planning process of economic growth, they will be treated fairly in this plan and their interests and aspirations can be dealt with in a fair way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last three months of work by the social partners have been worthwhile. The plan sets out the social and economic vision for the future of Ireland for the next two years and nine months. The Government has set out a system of economic and social objectives. Prior to this, there was <Col N="405" /> a feeling that because of the country's economic progress, it would not be possible to conclude a new agreement. While those feelings were widely publicised, they have proved to be unjustified. I compliment the negotiators of the agreement on their commitment to the long-term wellbeing of our people.</P>
    <P>In entering into these talks the Government recognised the need for certainty about the development of the national pay bill over the period of any such agreement. One objective of the agreement was to have stability and peace within the industrial sector, while another objective was to advance the process of public service modernisation. I compliment the public service unions on taking on this aspect which examined the purpose and type of public service that is provided within the parameters of the strategic management initiative. It is very far seeing of the unions concerned to incorporate such elements in the agreement and it can only improve the way in which we serve our citizens.</P>
    <P>This programme has targeted key areas. It offers substantial tax reductions to low-income earners and it was obvious that we needed to deal with this aspect of the economy. It has now been dealt with both within the terms of the budget and within this plan. The programme introduced a new national minimum wage of £4.40 per hour, which will be increased to £5 by 2002. While this is a very positive and to some extent adventurous move, it establishes the benchmark for a minimum hourly wage rate and is part of the overall plan we are focusing on.</P>
    <P>The new national agreement sets out a 5.5% pay increase for 2000, 5.5% for October 2001, and 4% for October 2002. Those figures are achievable and demonstrate a good understanding of the growth of the economy and of our ability to deliver the targets we have set. Given the industrial peace that reigns in the economy and the overall focus and structure of the agreement, Irish industry will be well served.</P>
    <P>The new agreement includes measures to support on-farm investment, including a financial commitment to farm waste management, dairy hygiene, animal welfare, installation aid, the farm retirement scheme and REPS. Within this context there is also a commitment to support young farmers. The Government has made a cohesive commitment through the national development plan to support the agricultural industry. Farm leaders, who have been part of the negotiations on the new agreement, have secured a good future within the plan, along with the benefits already stemming from Agenda 2000. The agricultural sector has an important significance for the economy and the new plan demonstrates the Government's commitment to maintaining as many people as possible on the land.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress has been made under the heading of social welfare. The target of £100 per week for the lowest social welfare payment is very positive and, thanks to this plan, the target will be achieved within a short period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> The plan is also welcome in the context of sustainable development. It takes balanced regional development into account, which is an important factor, and I am delighted it has been addressed within the ambit of the plan. The Government will implement an infrastructural investment programme to deliver regionally balanced and economically and environmentally sustainable development. This will be based on a broad definition of infrastructure, encompassing both the economic and social dimensions, as well as prioritising the potential for enhanced infrastructural links with Northern Ireland. The plan sets out in a proper manner the idea of balanced sustainable development &ndash; something that we have all aspired to in the past. When one looks at the development of the country it can appear to be imbalanced, but the new plan will rectify that.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out firm commitments that at least 50% of jobs created on greenfield sites by the Industrial Development Authority will be in the Border, midlands and west. The Government is firmly committed to this principle and I am glad the social partners have also agreed to it. It means that the development of the State can be cohesively achieved through proper planning.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures within the plan dealing with equality, child care and the family. As has been mentioned by a previous speaker, we have new problems arising from our status as a developing economy. Pressures arise in different areas and, for example, more child care facilities are needed for working mothers. In addition, personal assistants are required to care for the elderly and the handicapped. Rather than building institutional centres, we should be encouraging the provision of hands-on family support, and this sort of thinking needs to be developed within the health boards. The concept contained in the new plan is the correct approach to the matter. We need to provide more services of that kind, particularly for single working mothers in order to enable them to care properly both for themselves and for their children. Investment in that area would not only benefit the economy as a whole but also the well-being of young people and families in general.</P>
    <P>The agreement contains a commitment to the elderly. For many years there has been insufficient investment to provide for this growing section of our population, but the programme plans specific capital investment for the development of suitable residential places for the elderly. This commitment is to be welcomed. While we have made progress in this area in the last few years, we need to continue investment there in future.</P>
    <P>There is a new approach to educational needs. The idea of setting out and planning our future, setting achievement levels and looking at our weakness and setting realistic objectives within our educational structure is very necessary. It is attainable and we can measure progress by it. The VEC sector can now set out its own management structures and human resource levels. I welcome <Col N="407" /> the changed thinking of unions regarding the concept of adaptability within such services, as envisaged by the plan. The utilisation of human resources in a proper manner will enable us to move forward and grow in a fast changing economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the genuine commitment of the Government and the partners in the plan to ensuring our new found prosperity will be shared with all the people on this island. That is the great challenge of this plan. I am very proud this document has been put together in such a careful, concise and fair way for all the people of the State. There is a great challenge in it for the Government and the workers of the State.</P>
    <P>I believe we can achieve the targets set out in the programme and that it will lead to greater growth and economic satisfaction throughout the State. We can, through the investment under this plan, alleviate some of our current problems, such as the imbalance in development in our cities and the lack of infrastructural investment. This investment programme will go a long way towards substantially improving the economic life of this State in a fair and balanced way. When we look back on this plan in two years' time, we will see the positive changes it will have brought to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be an ideal time to speak on this programme, in that many of us have not seen the full document. Senator Coghlan had an opportunity to see it but Senator O'Dowd expressed his difficulties in doing so. However, we have had a good opportunity to debate it today because the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, took the House through it this morning.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. I was delighted to hear the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, this morning and I listened very carefully to what he said. He said that no one owes us a living, which is an important element of this partnership. I looked for certain pointers in the agreement. I looked first for the pointers in regard to social exclusion and the have-nots, those who have been left behind by the Celtic tiger. I was glad to see steps were being taken but I have some questions.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile to remember one particular aspect of the minimum wage. It is very hard to criticise an increase in the minimum wage. However, we must remember the economics of the statement that no one owes us a living. Some jobs do not exist once they become too expensive.</P>
      <P>An article in today's <i>Financial Times</i> paid huge compliments to the success story of the Irish economy. It said that more jobs were created in the past three years in Ireland than in the three decades before, which is a great success story. However, it went on to describe the owners of a factory opening in west Dublin deciding to put in equipment rather than people to do the job. I mention that because many businesses cannot survive once wages reach a certain level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> Last year I pulled into a filling station where I regularly get petrol, but on that occasion there was no one to serve me as it had gone self-service. I am a great believer in self-service but in this case I was a bit lazy and I would have preferred to have someone serve me. I talked to the owner who said &ndash; it had nothing to do with the national pay agreement &ndash; he could not get people to work at the rate he needed to pay them if he was to succeed, and if he paid them the higher rate he would go out of business. Therefore, he had switched to self-service, which meant those jobs no longer existed.</P>
    <P>The reason I have gone to some pains to talk about this is that I think those are the economic facts of life. The Minister spoke about social inclusion. We must remember that if we do not take those facts into account, some of the jobs for the socially excluded will not exist. We must find a way to encourage people to take jobs and to ensure those jobs will continue to exist. The important aspect is take home pay.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed by the Minister's statement that, &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective of the Government and the social partners that, over time, all those earning below the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net&rdquo;. We are talking here about a minimum wage probably in the region of £5 per hour within two years. The phrase, &ldquo;It is an agreed policy objective. . . . that over time. . . . &rdquo; is very wishy washy. I would have preferred to see the efforts put into ensuring we got there much earlier, by bringing those who are socially excluded into the net through creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I am impressed by the change from the last agreement, which talked about profit sharing, to the references in this one to &ldquo;gain sharing&rdquo;. I like that term. This agreement also refers to profit sharing, of course. However, I fear that concentrating solely on profit sharing can sometimes encourage businesses to take a short-term outlook. Those involved in those businesses sometimes benefit from the short-term outlook of making a profit this year, although it might not be the right thing to do in the long term. I much prefer the term &ldquo;gain sharing&rdquo;, which I had not heard before and I congratulate those who came up with it. The other pointer I looked for was inflation, which I will discuss later.</P>
    <P>I am enthusiastic about the success of the agreements we have had over the past 13 years. I have just returned from the United States and it was interesting to see the envy of the world focused on Ireland, with people asking how we managed to get this success. That has all sorts of other benefits. An interesting benefit is that, as the Minister of State may have noticed, until a couple of years ago, if someone on British television wanted to tell a joke about somebody stupid it was about Paddy the Irishman. I have not heard a story about Paddy the Irishman being a thick for the past couple of years. Suddenly the world has changed. We have also succeeded in many other areas, such as culture, art, dance, <Col N="409" /> music and literature, although we are not quite so successful in sport, certainly not in rugby if last week's performance is taken into account.</P>
    <P>The big change, which was touched on by Senator Coghlan, is from a national pay agreement to social partnership. The difference between the two is that the new social partnership involves a whole range of players. It is not just a deal between employers &ndash; who include Government &ndash; and unions but brings in far more of the stakeholders in society, such as the farmers, to whom Senator Chambers referred; it brings in Government, not just as an employer but because it raises our taxes and directs the overall economy. That is good. However, it also brings in the excluded &ndash; and here we think of the words of Fr. Seán Healy of CORI &ndash; such as the have-nots, the old, the young and the poor.</P>
    <P>The first efforts at social partnership were not very successful because they left those people out. The haves, who were generally the employers and the unions, divided up the cake between them and the have-nots were left outside, looking in to see if they could get a share. We have moved on somewhat from those days, particularly this time.</P>
    <P>It was interesting last Monday to hear the Taoiseach speak about social justice, when he referred to the £1.5 billion we are putting aside and the aim of ensuring anyone on social welfare will receive a minimum of £100 per week. These are steps in the right direction towards trying to help those who have been left behind, but I have some questions about them.</P>
    <P>Most of the have-nots are now inside the tent and their voices can be heard. However, I am not sure if their voices have been listened to enough. It is, at least, arguable that this new agreement should have directed much more of the cake towards remedying that area of social disadvantage. That would have made sense socially and economically because it would not have added to the fear I have of overheating and stoking inflation, which is occurring. Instead, it would work at reducing problems which, if we are not very careful, could totally destroy our prosperity further in the future. That is why I would prefer to see it move in that direction. I welcome what the agreement will do to address disadvantage but I wish that pillar had taken more resources from the other measures which I believe are undesirable for the future of our economy.</P>
    <P>Let us move on to the second key element which makes social partnership different from the traditional national wage agreement. It throws more into the pot than wages. Social partnership is about coming to a deal on everything which affects the total outcome, including wages, taxes, investment, social spending and profits. Even more important is that at the heart of it is trading off one against the other those elements of the bargaining process. The clearest example is the trading off of wages and tax. A wage agreement focuses only on the gross amount of pay and matters of tax are left to another day. However, social <Col N="410" /> partnership quite rightly says that it is not gross pay but take home pay that matters. There is no point increasing gross pay if take home pay does not go up also. By realising that we have in recent years learned to trade off wage increases and tax cuts by focusing on what people had in their pockets to spend.</P>
    <P>We went further and realised that there was no point putting more in people's pockets if the real value of that money was eroded by inflation. We learned to trade off wage moderation against inflation so that the pound in a person's pocket continued to be worth a pound. That is what we have been doing over the past few agreements and it is working well.</P>
    <P>My point is simple &ndash; at the heart of the success of social partnership is trading off wages, taxes and inflation. By juggling them at the same time, we can increase purchasing power much more than if we simply push at the single goal of raising wages as much as we can. That is the problem and where my criticism, concern and worry about this lies.</P>
    <P>The problem with the agreement before us is that this central concept of trade-offs appears to have been abandoned. We have forgotten the lessons we learned about social partnership over the years. Instead of setting wage increases against tax reductions, we have massive handouts in both directions. There is no trade-off &ndash; we have done both at the same time. There has been no trade-off particularly with the third element, inflation. One brings inflation into the picture by behaving in a manner whereby inflation is discouraged and not encouraged. We have not done that. By going, as we have done, hell for leather on wages and tax cuts at the same time, we will give inflation the best chance it has had for the past 15 years to take off and get out of hand. Not even social partnership will enable us to have our cake and eat it. That is what we are in danger of doing here.</P>
    <P>In comparison with previous programmes, we have much less room for manoeuvre now. We are now in &ldquo;euroland&rdquo; and do not have control over our interest rates, and there is nothing we can do about that. Here we are, of our own free will, throwing away the only club left in our bag, that is, the ability to rein in the economy through fiscal controls. We have lost the ability to rein it in through interest rates but could do so with fiscal controls. However, we have thrown the two of them away and we now have a problem. Meanwhile, the spectre of inflation &ndash; we talked about this a couple of weeks ago &ndash; is already thundering at our door and is clearly in danger of knocking it down. Overall, it is not a recipe for continued success. We need to keep a close watch on it as we have thrown away some of the weapons we had.</P>
    <P>I have two final points &ndash; one possibly good, while the other is possibly bad. Previous agreements suffered from two vices in particular which undermined their very effectiveness. One is the public sector, private sector divide where the <Col N="411" /> public sector has effectively done its own thing in the face of whatever agreement was there. This time we have the new idea of benchmarking and the idea is that it will prevent this. If it works, fine but the track record is not very good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Governments have been inept in fighting their own corner. The smart money now must surely be on the public sector unions finding a way to drive a coach and four through it. I hope not, but it is a concern.</P>
      <P>The other vice from which this process suffers is that at the stage we are at now we lock the employers into the agreement but the agreement of the unions and their members is still open. Inevitably, that will produce more demands in the near future because dissenters have nothing to lose. Their dissent is not even likely to collapse the agreement as a whole. Picture what will happen. Some unions will hold out for more and we will have more weeks of this sham tension which annoys people so much.</P>
      <P>We are not looking at the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness because we only have a draft. I do not mean a draft in as much as we have not seen the final programme, but the final programme will not have the numbers written on it for a couple of weeks. I hope it will only be a couple of weeks because it has to be agreed by both sides and only one side has agreed. Let us not do any sums yet because the final figures are not in. For those of us who believe the existing figures do not add up to a sensible programme, the prospect of even worse figures is hardly something to which we will look forward. I am a fan of the programmes and believe it is the right way to go but there are words of caution, concern and warning. Let us make sure we get it right this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I compliment the Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach for the part they have played in ensuring we have a new agreement. We are all agreed that it is most important. When negotiations began in November last, many cast doubt on the ability to conclude a new agreement to succeed Partnership 2000. Negotiating an agreement, particularly against the background of our rapid economic growth, posed different challenges to the process. This viewpoint, however, failed to take account of the strength of the commitment to social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 12 years, since the first national agreement was put in place in 1987, the people have seen the substantial benefits of social partnership. There can be little doubt that a crucial ingredient of today's economic success has been the social consensus which began with the first of the new comprehensive national programmes. <Col N="412" /> The social partnership approach has produced the much needed recovery from the disastrous early and mid-1980s and has underpinned a sustained period of growth since then. The record of social partnership is impressive. It is a record of achievement and it has brought about positive change and, most importantly, it has the potential to provide a renewed framework for further prosperity, fairness and full employment.</P>
    <P>There were many key challenges facing the social partnership process. The first was to ensure everybody can feel the benefit of social partnership recognising that for many people poverty and social exclusion are still a stark reality. That is a point we have tended to forget in recent years. The second was to bring about real and tangible improvements in living standards, not only in terms of income, but across the issues affecting the quality of people's lives such as housing and transport. We are all very aware of the problems with housing and transport. The third was to master the challenges posed by the information revolution, globalisation and EU enlargement, which dominate our changing world. I am confident this agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, will address these challenges and provide a basis for solid progress, moving forward economically and socially.</P>
    <P>The programme is most comprehensive and it is ambitious. It addresses a number of simple but powerful truths. First, we must constantly reposition ourselves if we are to move steadily forward into the winds of economic and technological change. Standing still is not an option &ndash; if we try to stand still, we will be blown back to the bad old days of the 1980s when our country was as near to bankruptcy as made no difference. Second, the agreement recognises that people have an entitlement to share in the fruits of our new found prosperity for which we have all worked so hard since the partnership process was launched in 1987. Third, it recognises that our economy and society can continue to prosper only if everybody has the opportunity to play their part and realise their full potential.</P>
    <P>The programme is founded on key macroeconomic goals of stabilisation, growth and social justice. These are important goals to underpin economic growth and maintain domestic and external confidence. They provide for increased living standards and reduce social exclusion in a manner that will be sustainable over the long term.</P>
    <P>Along with this programme we have the national plan, which was unveiled recently by the Government. It provides for the investment of £40 billion over the next six years. That is of major importance and it stands favourably beside this agreement. Recently there was also a review of An Action Programme for the Millennium, which provides the political basis for Government action over the rest of its term.</P>
    <P>Taken together, all these measures would support the achievement of the objectives which the National Economic and Social Council put forward recently as a vision for a new Ireland. The <Col N="413" /> Programme for Prosperity and Fairness is fundamental to ensuring that we reach our goal of channeling the benefits of prosperity to people while furthering economic growth. It sets out key responses to the challenges of competitiveness and change. It sets out a clear blueprint for adapting to the information society. It addresses the problems that accompany our rapid economic growth, with which we are all familiar, traffic congestion, difficulty in purchasing land for housing and in buying houses due to price increases and the shortage of supply, the shortage of quality child care places and the shortage of certain skilled personnel.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are members of local authorities are very aware of the shortage of skilled people, such as engineers. Engineers are in the fortunate position that, for the first time in many years, they can leave what at one time was a sound and secure job in a county council to take up jobs in the private sector that offer better pay and conditions. Who can blame them? It is a worrying trend in terms of whether we will be able to sustain the level of skilled labour required at a time when we have so much money to invest.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness does not shy away from these issues. It sets out a process and measures to tackle them effectively. It will enhance our economic prospects, improve living standards for all and tackle social exclusion urgently and effectively. Many political commentators and political parties have spoken about social inclusion during the past 12 to 18 months. It became a buzz word. It was very important but I compliment all concerned, particularly the Taoiseach and the Government, for addressing the issue head on and extending to those who were marginalised the benefits of our Celtic tiger economy.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a few of the more important measures in the programme. Competitiveness is a core theme. The programme identifies some key competitiveness challenges for Ireland. To meet these challenges we must secure a leading position in the emerging information society, promote lifelong learning as a national priority, move up the value chain of economic activity by investing in research and development, innovation and upskilling, continue to reform our regulatory and competition systems and modernise the public service to ensure the provision of quality services lies at the heart of all public service organisations.</P>
    <P>The programme also contains a package of measures to develop key sectors of the economy, including indigenous and foreign owned industry, small business and services, tourism, construction, energy, the food industry, forestry and the marine sector. The policies in place are designed to maximise the potential in these sectors over the period of the programme. As regards agriculture and rural development, it is great that the agricultural sector will also be rewarded and took part in the negotiations. The negotiations involved many <Col N="414" /> more sectors than the trade unions, employers and Government, and that is very positive.</P>
    <P>The new programme also reflects the shared commitment by the Government and the farming pillar to the continued development of a competitive high quality, high value agricultural sector, which will ensure an increase in living standards for farm families in line with increasing standards in other sectors of the economy. We would all agree that the living standards of farm families have not been in line with those of other sectors for a number of years and it is welcome that they will be brought into line. We welcome the measures in the agreement for farm families. The package for this sector involves continued investment in agriculture, policies for individual product areas, a deepening of the standards of services provided to farmers, a renewed effort to eradicate animal diseases and a taxation system that underpins the long-term viability of the sector. The provisions in the programme on rural development, the food sector, the marine sector and forestry together with measures to combat rural poverty will help ensure that a thriving rural economy underpins a vibrant rural society.</P>
    <P>The programme contains a major package of measures to address the needs of people on low incomes, including a national minimum wage, increases in basic pay, reduced taxation, social welfare increases, training and pensions. These measures are important and much more than pay is involved.</P>
    <P>The agreement associated with the programme provides for progressive increases in the national minimum wage and significant minimum increases in the basic pay in each phase. The personal tax package will produce substantial increases in real take home pay at all income levels. Making a difference in what people bring home in their weekly wage is what it is all about and what people want.</P>
    <P>The rates of social welfare will be increased in real terms and substantial progress will be made towards targets for the low rates and for child benefit. I welcome the increases and the inclusion of social welfare recipients. They are becoming fewer and fewer as we are quickly reaching full employment but a certain number of people are totally dependent on social welfare. It is incumbent on us to ensure those people can enjoy a decent standard of living and that they are well treated.</P>
    <P>The pay terms associated with the programme are reasonably balanced between necessarily divergent objectives. Over a period of two years and nine months increases totalling 15% have been agreed. The terms are particularly appropriate in the context of a multi-annual agreement. I welcome, in particular, the clear commitment to developing partnership in the workplace and to the continued partnership approach to the modernisaton of the public service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Housing is an important issue. The infrastructure bottleneck affects the housing market. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness addresses the growing need for social and affordable housing and the need to improve the physical condition of existing social housing stock. The measures include the establishment of a housing forum comprising representatives of social partners and relevant Departments, the expansion of local authority schemes to build 22,000 local authority homes in the next four years, enacting the Planning and Development Bill, 1999, to remove obstacles and delays to housing developments, increasing voluntary housing output to 5,400 units over the period 2000-3, continued investment in improvements to local authority houses and inner city flat complexes, a targeted initiative for homeless people, estate management programmes involving increased tenant participation in partnership with local authorities and their staff and an initiative to address issues of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>With regard to child care, the programme recognises that policies to support child care and family friendly life are a cornerstone of future social and economic progress. It includes, among other measures, a commitment to a substantial increase in child benefit over the period of the agreement with a priority focus on progress towards £100 per month for the third and subsequent children. Before the end of the year the Government will take decisions on an equitable framework to support parents with child care needs. Its commitment to do that is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will involve a concerted effort to overcome one of the major quality of life issues confronting us, the transport and infrastructure bottleneck. This includes the largest ever investment programme in our national public transport system, a new and faster approach to building national roads and motorways and the establishment of a new public transport partnership forum.</P>
    <P>Quality health care is of national importance. The programme sets out an ambitious package of measures to improve the nation's health status. It is aimed at keeping people healthy and providing adequately for their needs if they are sick or disabled. The programmes includes a series of measures for targeted health promotion and preventive strategies. Major capital investment is also planned under the national development plan through the upgrading of facilities in the community health sector. Initiatives are set out to address specific needs in the areas of the disabled, women's health, children and travellers. Measures are being put in place to address skill needs within the health sector and the welfare of health service workers. Taken together, the implementation of the programme's health package will make a significant impact on the quality <Col N="416" /> of life of all of our citizens, particularly disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>This programme is about people. It is about ensuring that everyone gets a fair share of the prosperity that we have gained to date. The phrase &ldquo;Celtic tiger&rdquo; has become very common but I have met a lot of people in the past couple of years who have not benefited. That is sad because while some people benefited from its spin-offs, other people did not. This agreement is a huge effort to ensure that all our people can benefit, make a contribution and be helped to realise their potential. It is about making sure that we can prosper and grow in the future. It is about giving people the confidence based on education and training to embrace the opportunities offered by technological change. It is also about ensuring that everyone has a chance to play a full part in the economy and society and to live their lives to the full. It is about people living and working here, whatever their circumstances, religion, colour or sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>Industrial peace was mentioned by some of my colleagues. It is marvellous to know we can look forward to the next couple of years with a guarantee that there will be industrial peace. We all have seen strikes in our time. Recently we had the nurses' dispute which dragged on for a while. There are no winners after a strike when workers take account of what they lose in their wages and compare it to what they have gained by way of an increase in pay or other terms. Much acrimony is created. Disputes are bad for the worker, their job, the economy and the country. Farmers also had a dispute recently. Disputes take from the day-to-day working of the country. We should be doing positive things rather than using up our time to settle industrial disputes. With this agreement I can say we will have relative industrial peace.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promotion of North-South partnership, the social partners will seek to work with all relevant interests to realise the vision of the Good Friday Agreement and the structures arising from it. They will do that by supporting full implementation of the Agreement and by promoting dialogue between the North-South Ministerial Council, the implementation bodies and the social partners in the pursuit of common action where mutual benefit is perceived. We have seen many cases of mutual benefit in the past few months. The interested parties, Northern Ireland Ministers and our Ministers have worked closely together and that has resulted in benefits. Long may it continue.</P>
    <P>We are actively examining the ways by which the views and expertise of social partners may best be utilised in building co-operation between the North and South and between Ireland and Britain. The Comment Chapter of the NDP refers to developing opportunities for co-operation, making maximum use of EU funding under INTERREG initiatives and the peace pro<Col N="417" /> gramme and promoting human rights. It is important that we can refer to the North in this context and that what will happen will be good for it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all the social partners, officials, the Cabinet and the Taoiseach on the fantastic job they have done in a short timespan in bringing forward this agreement. Many people doubted that this could happen. It has happened, it is good for everyone and I welcome it. I trust it will be ratified by all the various organisations. It has been accepted already by some of them. Other groups have not ratified it yet but I am sure they will.</P>
    <P>It is great for Members to have the opportunity to debate this agreement. On the Order of Business we were reminded that the agreement was finalised early on Monday morning. That caused its own difficulties with regard to distributing copies to Members but that problem has been overcome. I am glad to have had the opportunity to debate this today and not in 12 months' time. It is good to have the Minister present to listen to our views. I am sure Members will listen to his views with interest. I hope everyone concerned will reap the benefits of a worthwhile agreement.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire go dtí an Teach seo agus cuirim fáilte roimh an comhaontú pá freisin.</P>
      <P>I compliment the various participants in the national agreement. A number of Members, including Senator Quinn, said it was anticipated that it would be more difficult in the current climate to conclude an agreement that would satisfy all the social partners in comparison with the background when national pay agreements were first initiated. At that time we had excessive Government spending, significant national debt, high unemployment and high inflation. The climate has now been reversed and that is in no small measure due to the contribution made by successive agreements to our current economic boom.</P>
      <P>The negotiations were difficult for many of the participants. Members alluded to the fact that businesses were anxious, even though they are doing well, to ensure that nothing would be included in the agreement which would undermine the foundations upon which economic growth and the success of the business community had been predicated. Unions were also anxious to ensure that their members, who had made a significant contribution through their hard work to Ireland's present status, would enjoy the benefits that accrue from that.</P>
      <P>Senator John Cregan mentioned the agricultural community. In the past few years they have had extreme difficulty in getting value for their products. As a consequence their incomes have fallen. That trend is expected to be reversed this year and they should see a return to better days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one puts all those issues together the <Col N="418" /> commencement of the talks did not give rise to undue optimism regarding a successful outcome. The agreement is an indication of the maturity that has been reached in all sectors of society as to the best way to secure the interests of all sectors. Over the past 13 years people have worked together in a co-operative fashion and they now realise that that is the recipe for the success we enjoy today.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in this debate to remind ourselves of the architects who had the vision to embark on a unique arrangement when it was introduced in 1987. I compliment the former Taoiseach, C. J. Haughey, even though it may not be fashionable or politically correct to do so. He made a major contribution. His leadership skills were evident when he led the Government that engineered the first national agreement, in which he was ably assisted by Ray MacSharry, then Minister for Finance. He made a pivotal contribution.  </P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I acknowledge that because it is true. The then Minister for Finance did a lot to correct the profligacy of the Administration that preceded him but Charles Haughey saw where the best interests of this country lay. He played his part. The current Taoiseach, as Minister for Labour, was also highly instrumental in bringing together the various strands of the first national agreement.</P>
      <P>As the Acting Chairman stated, great credit is due to Deputy Dukes who must have been uncomfortable with what took place under the leadership of Garrett Fitzgerald from 1982 to 1987 when the national debt doubled. Deputy Dukes played his part in reversing the damage that was done during that era by supporting the minority Fianna Fáil Government in taking the necessary decisions which have undoubtedly laid the foundations for our current economic success. It is a pity his party, in its subsequent dealings with him, did not show a higher appreciation of the contribution he made.</P>
      <P>The headline aspect of any agreement of this nature is the terms of the wage element attached to it. Senator Quinn and others alluded to the level of wage increases which are undoubtedly high at 5.5% for the first 12 months, 5.5% for the second 12 months and 4% for the final nine months of a 33-month agreement. It must be stated that wage increases since 1987 have been quite modest and this has contributed enormously to the competitiveness of Irish industry. It was, therefore, reasonable to expect that, given current level of economic growth and business performance, workers would expect higher incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sectors of society must enjoy our current success and we must ensure that the wealth is dis<Col N="419" /> tributed fairly. Some people say it must be distributed equally but that is not correct. The distribution of wealth should be in accordance with and in relation to people's contribution to the development of the economy. Obviously, the level of such contributions is unequal. Having said that, as a fair republican society we must ensure that all elements and strands of the community are catered for under any national agreement. That is certainly the case with this programme.</P>
    <P>While the level of wage increases may fuel inflation, there are methods other than wage controls which could be used to reduce the level of inflation. Of all the economic indicators at our disposal, the one which seems to be flashing amber is our inflation level. We are top of the European league in that regard and it is imperative that we endeavour to reduce inflation so that it comes into line with the European average as soon as possible. Interest rates and other such fiscal mechanisms are no longer available to aid us in this and it is important that we work assiduously to achieve our goal by some other means.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that a number of economists, rather than criticising the level of wage increases as being inflationary, have commented that they may have the effect of slowing the economy. There are those who argue that this needs to be done in a gradual way, rather than allowing the economy to overheat. The most serious difficulty with which we might then be confronted could be a complete shortage of labour.</P>
    <P>The direction in which we are proceeding is correct. We have also applied the practice which has been part of each agreement, but which has been a significant part of this agreement and its predecessor, namely, coupling the reform of the taxation system to reduce the burden with reasonable wage increases in order to improve people's living standards. It is significant that, over the 33 months of this agreement, take home pay may increase by up to 25% &ndash; the figure may be higher for certain workers &ndash; when the benefits of actual wage increases are coupled with changes in taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has indicated that he intends to remove 80% of people from the top rate of tax. As a result, 20% or less will pay tax at the top rate. That is an important and desirable objective which brings into focus the fact that the process of individualisation &ndash; the social partners have agreed to this &ndash; should continue in the future. Individualisation is a necessary step with definite benefits. It was obviously inequitable and unacceptable that single people on the average industrial wage were obliged to pay tax at the higher rate. The only way to tackle that problem was to increase the bands on an individualised basis. However, while it can be argued that a married couple, both of whom are working, incur costs greater than those incurred by a single <Col N="420" /> income household, it can equally be stated that the costs incurred by the latter exceed those of a single person. When individualisation is being considered, we must ensure that single income families pay tax at a rate somewhere between those of double income families and single people. If single income earners and single income households are linked under our tax regime, we will do an injustice to the family. I hope that does not happen.</P>
    <P>I note the emphasis on competitiveness in the programme. Over a number of agreements, wage increases have been used as a floor from which other special increases were obtained in the public sector. This has given rise to significant and rampant increases throughout the public service. The issue of cross-sector pay relativities and the attachment thereto will be tackled by modernising the approach taken in the public sector. That is a welcome development. There are many skilled people working in the public service who make a tremendous contribution while, as with any workforce, there are others who do not do so. We must ensure that a meritocracy, similar to that which obtains in the private sector, is established in the public sector.</P>
    <P>In the private sector during the past two years, because of the shortage of skilled labour, companies are making special deals in order to retain key categories of employees. If we do not remedy that shortage, it could undermine the competitiveness of Irish industry. This agreement, to some extent, will help avoid the special increases to which I refer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the agreement which deal with low income earners. I applaud the inclusion of minimum payments of £12, £11 and £9, respectively, over the three phases of the agreement for those on low incomes. The introduction of the national minimum wage is overdue and I compliment the Government on the courage it has shown in putting this initiative in place. The fact that the minimum wage will rise to £5 by the year 2002 is a welcome development. Low income earners will also benefit from reduced taxation. Reform of the social welfare system &ndash; child benefit payments, old age pensions, etc. &ndash; will be tackled as part of the overall programme. That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Senator John Cregan alluded to the country's transport and infrastructural needs. The House debated that matter on previous occasions, particularly in relation to the national development plan which contains a significant commitment to address Ireland's infrastructural deficit. That deficit must be tackled on an all-island basis.</P>
    <P>Escalating house prices are of concern to the Government and the social partners and I note with interest that there is a section in the agreement which specifically deals with this issue and calls for 22,000 local authority houses to be built in each of the next four years. This represents a significant increase on the present position. The <Col N="421" /> Planning and Development Bill, 1999, was welcomed by all sides of the House and contains the courageous provision to allow builders and local authorities to come to an arrangement to provide affordable housing for those in need. Such a comprehensive and energised approach will allow us to deal with the housing problems. It is interesting that the issue of estate management is also included in the agreement. Estate management has been an important component of social housing with voluntary groups and we are now ensuring that local authorities will be to the fore in this area.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care has been topical over the past 12 months and in the run up to the budget, and has been identified in the agreement. An effort will be made to reconcile work and family life and to ensure that adequate child care facilities are put in place in the private and community sectors. We are moving in the direction of what has been happening in the rest of the western world. I referred to our skills and labour shortages and it is important that we have the facilities which enable both partners in a marriage to pursue a career, to make their contribution to the economy and to benefit accordingly. Child care is a very important element in this objective. This country has historically placed great emphasis on the family but the social fabric and the ways in which the family will function will change in the future. As this occurs it is important that the value system instilled in us is not lost in any rearranged system and resources are essential to guard against such an outcome.</P>
    <P>Any self-respecting republic must have regard for the quality of the health services it provides to ensure it caters for the well being of society and that those on low incomes have services available to them on an equal basis. I would hate to think that we would move towards the American system where those who do not have financial resources are disadvantaged in terms of access to health services. Our ethos would not welcome or allow such a transition.</P>
    <P>The PPF also includes a health promotion strategy and it is important that we inculcate a commitment to healthy living in all sectors of society. It is well known that many health promotion strategies are not put into practice to the same extent in low income brackets as in higher income brackets. There is a need for a programme of education to address this problem. The adage that prevention is better than cure is as valid today as when first enunciated 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>The agreement also includes welcome provisions on equality to eliminate discrimination in employment and services. There is the additional challenge of continuing change and the promotion of lifelong learning. Life is not a dress rehearsal; it is the real thing. In order to achieve fulfilment people should have access to these services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> The IFA recently successfully campaigned for an equitable price for its members' produce. Incomes are falling in the farming sector and it is essential to ensure that this sector, which was the cornerstone of the economy over the past 100 years and has been our most important industry since independence, does not continue to lag behind the rest of society.</P>
    <P>I compliment the various parties to the agreement. I have no doubt that it was more difficult to reach agreement on this occasion than before. I hope that the agreement will be endorsed by trade unions and employers so that we can move forward and build on our recent success, particularly that achieved in the past four or five years, so that the next generation enjoys a lifestyle our forefathers could only dream of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is desirable that we have continued the initiative taken in 1987 to try to bring as many areas of social, economic, business, farming and community life together with Government to agree a deal for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>I have always been disappointed that it has not been possible to include Members of the Oireachtas, as distinct from members of the Government, in the partnership. The partnership has expanded since 1987 when it only comprised Government, farmers, trade unions and IBEC. A range of other groups are now involved including the community pillar with 23 participant organisations such as CORI, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Protestant Aid, the Small Firms Association, Irish exporters, the tourism industry, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and so on.</P>
      <P>The partnership has expanded considerably from the initial four pillars and I do not know why we cannot find a formula to allow Opposition parties to be involved. These parties are elected representatives of the people. The Government is elected and is represented, but it is not representative of all strands of opinion on economic, social, cultural and other issues. I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter for the future. It should be possible to have a representative of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, and, perhaps, the smaller groups and Independents present at the talks as they have an input to make. All parties are committed to the national programme as a way forward and their presence at the talks would be beneficial and not counter-productive, as the Government seems to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement is a massive document and the programmes seem to be getting larger. This programme contains 150 pages, which we received courtesy of Senator O'Toole. Unfortunately, it was not published in time to see it prior to this debate. It should have been available to us at the same time as it was available to the media, but it was not. This document has become larger, and <Col N="423" /> it has been my experience that the larger a document becomes the longer it is on generalities and rhetoric and the shorter it is on specifics. This is the case here. It is long on pay but short on specifics in all the other areas. Between the new partnership and the extended number of organisations and bodies represented, the range of matters covered is enormous. Nothing is forgotten, but the result is that we have ended up with aims, objectives, targets and aspirations, and no specifics relating to very critical areas such as child care, health, housing, transport and infrastructure. What we have is a document that looks factual, but it is little more than thinly disguised fiction.</P>
    <P>The background to this document is a budget which was very much skewed against families in terms of individualising the tax system. It was skewed also against the people on low incomes. Those on high incomes benefited disproportionately, given that 2% was lopped off the higher level of tax and that taxation starts on incomes of £107, which is nearly £70 below the minimum wage of £4.40 an hour for a 40-hour week. It was an incredible budget.</P>
    <P>We are currently experiencing galloping inflation. On 15 December, the Minister estimated it at 1.6% for 1999. Now we find that it is 3.9%, more than double the European average, and rising rapidly. We do not know how that will play into the system, particularly as so much more money has been skewed in the direction of higher income earners who will spend it on luxury goods. That 50% of our trade is with non-European countries, including the United States and Asian countries such as Japan, or with the United Kingdom, means that we will be importing inflation. It would be okay if most of our trade was with other European countries, but it is not. We are on the edge of Europe. Britain has not joined in economic and monetary union. Therefore, importing luxury goods from Britain will be highly inflationary.</P>
    <P>Against the whole plan we have to look at an expanding economy. The figure in the plan is 5.6% per annum. I have no doubt that we will exceed that very comprehensively. The indications are there. Exchequer returns exceeded expenditure by £698 million in January compared with this time last year when the figure was £72 million. That is an almost tenfold increase. Clearly the economy is on a roll, and the momentum is even greater than anybody had anticipated.</P>
    <P>Against that background nobody can argue against the wage increases that have been given in this agreement. The agreement is about wage increases and there is really nothing further to it. Looking at its language, everything else is aspiration, what we may, could or should do, what our targets and aims should be, and so on. The wage increase of 15% over 33 months, approximately three years, is modest enough. It certainly will not <Col N="424" /> break the bank. It is quite a significant increase compared with those given under previous agreements when PAYE workers were very moderate in their demands. This is in no sense pay-back time for the workers who produced our prosperity. This will be seen as quite a modest increase. Nevertheless, I am pleased that flat minimum increases of £12, £11 and £9 have been built into the agreement as distinct from the simple percentage increase which was prevalent in previous agreements.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that the national minimum wage will still be at £4.40 on 1 April. We could have done better. It is a bit much to have to wait until the end of the agreement in 2002 before a minimum of £5 is reached, and to have a gradual increase from £4.40 to £4.70 only in year two. It would have been better to give a real boost to those at the lower end of the scale. That should have been done in the budget anyway. What we are seeing is what is termed rebalancing, which is a euphemism for rewriting the budget in relation to the low paid. That has been done to the extent of ensuring that 80% of PAYE workers will be outside the higher rate of tax by the end of the term of the national agreement, which is very worthwhile. It has also been done in terms of shifting certain reductions in tax for the low paid to the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and imposing it on that Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who did not expect to be the fall guy because the Minister for Finance did not deal with the issue of low pay in the budget and the unions insisted it be dealt with. That is where this wonderful word &ldquo;rebalancing&rdquo; comes in. PRSI for workers earning below £226 per week is to be abolished. Those workers will be exempt from having to pay 4.5%, and that will mean a significant increase in their take-home pay. That should have been included in the budget.</P>
    <P>In respect of the 2% health levy, the threshold is to be increased to £280, which is £54 more than was intended. That also is being shifted into the social welfare area to be imposed on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The social inclusion measures are part of the rebalancing that the trade unions imposed on the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, to the House to respond to this Adjournment matter which seeks to ensure that the Western Health Board's dental service con<Col N="425" /> tinues to be available at Ballydangan in south Roscommon.</P>
      <P>There is grave concern in the south Roscommon area about the provision of dental services. This problem is not confined to Ballydangan but applies to other health centres in south Roscommon, such as Ballyforan, Monksland and Brideswell. Strong representations were made to me about the position in Ballydangan by the parish priest, Bishop Cassidy, teachers and 300 parents.</P>
      <P>Dental services were provided in Ballyforan and Ballydangan in the south Roscommon area when I was a child and the country was not as well off as it is today. It seems extraordinary that we do not have that level of service now. The Western Health Board could use the civic and commercial centre which was built in response to a significant increase in population in the Monksland area to provide health services, including dental services. There are 10,000 people living in this area. It is unacceptable that these services are only available in Roscommon town and other centres 40 miles away.</P>
      <P>I am told there are difficulties recruiting dentists. However, that is not an adequate response to the people of south Roscommon. A pilot scheme was recently announced for this area. While that is a welcome development, it does not address the lack of dental services there. I was told this pilot scheme may be used by the health board to rationalise the dental services in south Roscommon so that they are only provided in one area, such as Monksland.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because I want to bring the matter, which is being debated in the south Roscommon area, into the public domain. As a long standing public representative for that area, both at county council and national level, I am duty bound to raise it in the House. I ask the Minister to ensure that a comprehensive dental service is provided in the south Roscommon area. While I welcome the pilot scheme, it is not the answer for that area. If the dental rooms in the health centres in Ballyforan, Monksland and Brideswell are left idle, an entire section of a county will be left without dental services. We cannot neglect small rural communities at a time of great economic development.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the involvement of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the new Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who has a great interest in the elderly. I compliment them for providing substantially increased resources for our health services. However, we must not neglect our dental services. It is important that the Minister of State, as the political head of the Department of Health and Children, indicates to the Western Health Board that the situation in the south Roscommon area is not acceptable. While the people welcome the pilot scheme, it is not a comprehensive service on which they can depend in the medium term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The concerns of the people in south Roscommon must be addressed by the Western Health Board. If that means striking deals with private dental consultants, then that is what we must do. We should not confine ourselves to an antiquated system where qualified people are not prepared to work because of poor financial reward. Dentists want to make a living like those in other professions but they do not find health board positions financially attractive. Many of them are in remote areas away from population bases which offer opportunities to make money and the prospect of a better lifestyle. There is no point telling the public we cannot get people to work in these areas. We must make it attractive for them to do so. We must come to new arrangements with the dental profession and ensure that opportunities are provided by the Western Health Board. I do not know the facts but I presume similar difficulties would apply in other health board areas. The terms and conditions must be an inducement to people to work in this area. We should not allow ourselves to be tied into old agreements and understandings set down years ago by the Department of Health and Children. We are now in the 21st century and it may mean new agreements and forgetting old ways regarding the provision of vital services. We have a duty and responsibility to provide dental services in rural and urban areas.</P>
    <P>I refer to a particular area, with a population of 10,000 people, the fastest growing area in south Roscommon. I have a responsibility to expose the lack of comprehensive dental services for the people of that area, including the children and the elderly. While I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to give me a definite answer or decision now or say that he can provide a dental service there, I ask him to bring this matter to the attention of the people who have the responsibility for providing it, namely the Western Health Board. If the Western Health Board in return is making or seeking new arrangements with his Department, I ask that his Department will consider the case I am making on behalf of those people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for allowing me this opportunity to discuss the dental services in the Western Health Board area and in particular at Ballydangan in south Roscommon. The provision of dental treatment in County Roscommon is the statutory responsibility of the Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dental treatment services for children are being developed by health boards in accordance with the dental health action plan. In past years, health boards have adopted a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and have phased out a demand-led service. This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of <Col N="427" /> dental treatment. The school-based approach places an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available in all national schools.</P>
    <P>Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth classes, are targeted for preventive measures under the school-based approach. The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified via this programme and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc. are provided as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some health boards can have difficulty in filling dental posts in geographically remote areas and in fully implementing the school-based approach. In the case of the Western Health Board region, the board has experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining appropriately qualified dentists to provide services in some areas such as south Roscommon. Unfortunately this has resulted in an inability on the board's part, despite their best efforts, to provide an adequate level of service to the school children in the Ballydangan area.</P>
    <P>The board has held interviews on a number of occasions over the years in an effort to fill vacancies as they arise and staff from other countries, including Britain and Germany, have been employed at various times. It is open to any qualified dentist to respond to an advertisement placed by the board. The board is also in continual contact with the dental training schools in an effort to recruit temporary staff.</P>
    <P>Some developments are currently taking place which should help the Western Health Board with its persistent difficulties in recruiting and retaining dentists. Following the successful conclusion of negotiations carried out under the auspices of the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Minister for Health and Children has asked the health boards to implement revised structures for dentists employed within the health board dental services. Under these revised structures, additional duties will be assigned to existing staff and additional promotional outlets will be created. The revised structures are designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the dental services. It should also help to increase the attractiveness of employment within the health board dental services making the public dental services an attractive career option to new graduates as well as appealing to dentists returning to this country after working abroad. The restructuring of services will ease recruitment difficulties being experienced by many boards.</P>
    <P>In view of the exceptional difficulties encountered by the Western Health Board, and following their approaches, my Department has given approval for a pilot project to be carried out to <Col N="428" /> further address the problems being encountered relating to recruitment and retention of dentists in the health board dental services. Under this pilot project health board dentists working after hours in certain specified areas may provide services to children who have left national school on a fee per item of service. This pilot project encompasses the area of Ballydangan in south Roscommon. The arrangement is to operate strictly on a pilot basis for six months and will be closely monitored by both the Western Health Board and the Department of Health and Children. I am hopeful that the measures outlined will considerably improve the dental service in the Western Health Board region, including the Ballydangan area, and that all eligible children will receive an adequate service while in national school and thereafter up to their 14th birthday.</P>
    <P>I note the Senator's concern about a pilot project which is only a temporary process. I will bring the Senator's dissatisfaction with a temporary arrangement to the attention of the Department. The Senator wants to see something done in the long term. The Department is well aware of the problems regarding the dental services in general in the country, especially the orthodontic services. As the Senator said, it is time a better service was provided.</P>

      <P>It is a pity the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, could not be here for this matter, which is of considerable importance and which is in the courts through the actions taken by both the hackney drivers and the taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>Once again, the Government has made a dog's dinner of the issuing of taxi plates. Initially the matter was referred to the local authorities who were given the authority to examine the need for and the distribution of the plates and the criteria to be established. The local authorities in Dublin set up the Dublin taxi and hackney forum to co-ordinate the entire operation of the service within the 50-mile limit that covers Dublin city and the metropolitan area. No sooner had they done so than the Taoiseach set up his own forum. When the powers were statutorily transferred to the local authorities, the Taoiseach began to interfere in the matter. There were two forums operating side by side which caused an enormous amount of confusion. Now Deputy Molloy revokes the authority given to the local authorities to determine the number of plates and decide the criteria for the distribution, and gives authority to his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has done a U-turn on this issue, creating further confusion on the matter. The number of taxi plates has doubled and the Minister has decreed that it should be one on one, with everyone who has an existing taxi licence getting a further one. A total of 500 licences for <Col N="429" /> wheelchair accessible taxis will go to the cosies, but only 19 people applied because they are so expensive and no assistance is given by the Government towards the cost of the vehicle, VRT and so on. Nobody is interested in them, although there are 500 licences available. The manner in which they are given out means there is no take-up of them.</P>
    <P>The other 2,700 licences are being given out to those who already have licences. This is a totally inexplicable situation where those who already have a valuable licence will receive another. Most of those who already have licences have issued them to cosies who work for them. Some people in the Minister of State's party own a number of those licences. I see no logic in granting new licences to those who already have them. It will cause real difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State intruded in the existing system where certain criteria had been long established. Those criteria allowed the cosies who own PSV licences and work for licence holders on contract and hackney drivers to accumulate points to bring them in out of the cold, so to speak, when new licences became available. They are now excluded. The cosies and the hackney drivers have no access to the new licences under the new ministerial dispensation. That is a breach of the long standing criteria which have operated in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has discriminated against those who have been operating a service at present but the drivers cannot get a new taxi licence because the existing points system has been ended. Why is this happening? Will it be permanent? Will the Minister of State, having removed this authority from the local authorities, make that removal permanent? Will it only cover the Dublin area? Will it be lifted to allow the hackneys and the cosies in out of the cold or will they have to find redress through the courts? It is a mess. We recognise that we must increase access to taxis for the community but the way it has been done was not a step forward. A process was being worked out but the Minister of State charged in like a bull in a china shop and stymied it. It will now be difficult to make any progress.</P>

      <P>The revised document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, published in November 1999, made an explicit commitment to improve the Dublin taxi service through the introduction of measures to increase the number of taxi licences in Dublin to ensure a proper balance between supply and demand in the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 30 November 1999 the Government decided to provide for an early grant of a substantial number of new taxi licences in the Dublin taximeter area to be apportioned as follows. One new taxi licence is to be offered to each individual who held a taxi licence in Dublin at the end of 1999, 500 of these new licences are to be for wheelchair accessible taxis and 500 additional licences are to be granted to applicants under the current points scheme. The Government initiat<Col N="430" /> ive was in response to the greatly increased demand for taxi services in the Dublin area driven by strong economic growth.</P>
    <P>Regulations were made on 13 January 2000 to trigger the process whereby all existing licence holders in the Dublin area, known as qualified persons, may apply for the grant of either a taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence from Dublin Corporation. A qualified person for the purpose of regulations is a person who on 31 December 1999 held a taxi or wheelchair accessible taxi licence granted by Dublin Corporation or was entitled to renew a taxi or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence granted by the corporation or was in receipt of an offer for the grant of a wheelchair accessible taxi licence under the 1995 regulations in respect of which the process for the grant of the licence had not been completed.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the regulations, Dublin Corporation has issued a notice to each licence holder inviting them to apply for either an ordinary taxi licence or a wheelchair accessible taxi licence, applications to be received by the corporation no later than 18 February 2000. Applicants who express a preference for the grant of a wheelchair accessible taxi licence and who comply with the regulation requirements may be made an offer of the grant of such a licence.</P>
    <P>Other taxi licences for existing licence holders, as well as those to be allocated under the current points assessment scheme, are to be allocated in accordance with a scheme to be established by the Minister. It will be open to any individual to make application for the grant of one of the 500 licences under the assessment system in due course and such applications will be subject to the normal application process to be administered by Dublin Corporation. All licences to be granted will be transferable without restriction and restrictions on the transfer of certain existing taxi licences in Dublin will also cease from 18 February 2000. The fees for the grant of licences will be £2,500 for an ordinary taxi licence and £250 for a wheelchair accessible taxi licence.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, it is open to any individual, including hackney drivers, to make an application for the grant of one of the licences to be granted under the existing points assessment system which is set out in the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999.</P>
    <P>The use of points system criteria for the assessment of applications for the grant of taxi licences was introduced in 1991 and has been the subject of a number of amendments, most recently in February 1999, following consultation with authorities and other interested parties. The criteria give priority to taxi drivers &ndash; cosies &ndash; who have never held taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi or hackney licences in the allocation of new licences. The amendment to the criteria of February 1999 relaxes earlier provisions which excluded all previous hackney licence holders from the fullest application of points. A more limited restriction now applies only to persons who have held a <Col N="431" /> hackney licence within the previous relevant two years. The point of reference for this period is the date of publication of the notice by the licensing authority of the relevant determination to grant new taxi licences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the use of quality bus corridors, full access to bus lanes is at present permitted only to buses and large public service vehicles. Pedal cycles and taxis may use &ldquo;with flow&rdquo; bus lanes. Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, have not been permitted to use bus lanes in view of their more limited service role, which does not involve <Col N="432" /> publicly standing or plying for hire. The Dublin Taxi Forum, while recommending some form of external identification for hackneys to facilitate the enforcement of regulations by the Garda Síochána, nonetheless recommended against the merging of the separate service roles of taxis and hackneys, against roof signage for hackneys and against permitting access to bus lanes for hackneys. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has no proposals to extend the use of bus lanes to hackneys at this time.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 February 2000.</P>
