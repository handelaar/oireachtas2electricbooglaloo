    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8: No. 1, motion re the referral of the Trade Marks Act, 1996 (Community Trade Mark) Regulations, 2000, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, will be taken without debate; No. 2, motion re the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Constitution without debate will be taken without debate; No. 3, motion re the referral of the Standards in Public Office Bill, 2000, to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the Committee on Members' Interests of Seanad Éireann will be taken without debate; No. 4, Education Welfare Bill, 1999 &ndash; Report and Final Stages will be taken today; No. 5, motion re the Employment Equality Act, 1998 (section 12) (Church of Ireland College of Education) Order, 2000, will be taken for 30 minutes following the conclusion of No. 4, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed seven minutes; No. 6, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 2000 &ndash; Report and Final Stages will be taken today; No. 7 motion for earlier signature motion will be taken at the conclusion of No. 6; No. 8, the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 2000 &ndash; all Stages will be taken today but not before 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Going from one to eight is indicative of the work rate of the House and I hope that will be recognised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader be able to find time, an hour or so, for the motions on Tibet? There might be a corner somewhere tomorrow or it could be done over lunch time. That is what we did with East Timor with a very similar motion. The motion regarding ethics in public office is to be taken without debate. Can we have a debate at some point on the interface between business and politics in light of the very worrying remarks of Mr. Kavanagh which indicate that he felt that it was possible to more or less buy an election or at least to influence it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1738" /> Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to reassure the House that buses are subject to the NCT test, particularly with regard to emissions? They do not seem to be, especially the 25 year old tour buses that are floating around Dublin city, which make life very difficult for cyclists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of business on the Order Paper today, which is typical of this time of year when we rush to have items finished. Like Senator Norris, I seek clarification on No. 3 with regard to the establishment of the joint committee and its implications. Perhaps, the Leader will circulate documentation on that matter.</P>
      <P>Is it possible before the session ends to have a full-scale debate on Government policies and a debate on a motion of no confidence, similar to the Dáil? It would be an opportunity for the Government to put on record what is thinks it has achieved and for the Opposition to put on record where it feels it has been found wanting. At the end of the session, following which there will be a three month gap, will the Leader find time for a state of the nation discussion where both sides of the House could discuss matters of considerable importance? There is one item that I would like to be discussed&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Costello, you can reserve that item for the debate for which you ask if it is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to put the new National Economic and Social Forum report on housing on the Order Paper. We did not have a debate on the Bacon report and new proposals have been made, with which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has stated he is not happy. These are issues which would be worth discussing together with the broader issue of what is happening in many other areas, which are causing considerable concern. Will the Leader schedule a full-scale discussion for one day on the important issues that concern the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris's proposition that we might find some time, even during a sos, to take brief statements on the situation in Tibet. No. 3, the referral of the presentation on a Standards in Public Office Act to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, is consistent with the committee's discussions earlier in the year with regard to standards in public office. It will only deal with the general subject matter of the Bill and not with the detail, and it will be up to the Houses to amend it, if that is required. A sub-committee considered some of these matters earlier in the year. Senator O'Toole and I are members of the sub-committee and, therefore, the Seanad will have an input into the discussion on the matters relating to No. 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the next session begins, I ask the Leader to schedule an immediate debate on the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. I did not get any joy during Private Members' Business last night when I raised it. Parents have gone to the High Court seeking basic integrated services in education and health and four other cases are listed for next week. It is absolutely appalling that parents will have to go the High Court to seek services. I have raised this issue many times over the last three years. The Leader must bring this to the attention of the Ministers for Health and Children and Education and Science.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate in the next session on the importance of our bogs to the heritage of Ireland? The recent finds in County Offaly underline how rich a repository the bogs are &ndash; many of our most famous artefacts were found in the bogs. Unfortunately many of these finds were accidental and we need a professional examination and excavation of the bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disturbed by the suggestion that No. 3 should be taken without debate. We are talking about ethics in public office. This side of the House has been seeking a debate on this subject for months. Now we are told that it will be referred for consideration to yet another committee, when committees and sub-committees dealt with it last year. It is wrong to take this without debate. This is an ideal opportunity to debate the matter and it is wrong to kick it into touch once again. The Government is avoiding an issue it should have grasped and dealt with. I disagree with this and, on principle, we should not accept it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of young Elian Gonzalez and his return to Cuba. None of us could understand why he was not returned before this. The decision of the United States to open some trading links with Cuba should also be welcomed. It may only be for food and medicine but it is the first step in an area which has been a cause of concern for many over the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House raise the issue of inter-country adoption with the Minister for Health and Children, particularly the protracted delays being experienced, not least in the eastern region, with prospective parents facing delays in the initial assessment process of up to two years? Senators will know there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of people choosing inter-country adoption. Between 1991 and 1995, 300 people in the State applied for such adoptions. In the period between 1995 and 1999, there was a 300% increase in the number of people anxious to participate in this process. Will the Leader allow time in the new session for a debate on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader impress on the Minister for Education and Science the need to redress the wrongs being done in the higher education grants system? Once again nurses in the final year of their degrees are not being allowed maintenance grants. This is a snub by the Government to the profession. Nursing is a noble profession and nurses do wonderful work. At their most vulnerable time &ndash; when they are in college &ndash; we are refusing to help them further their education. It would be a great thing if the Leader could see to it that the Minister for Education and Science would redress the wrong being done to the nursing profession by allowing final year students maintenance grants like other students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow for a full debate on No. 3. We have waited for the publication of the Standards in Public Office Bill for some time. The Taoiseach has spoken about it on several occasions in relation to the Government's response to the mountain of sleaze before it and the difficulties in political life as a result. It is not sufficient or satisfactory that such important legislation is referred to a committee without debate when this could be the second last day of the last session of this Seanad. It is a mark of the denial so evident on the Government benches at present, denial of the huge problems not only in the body politic but in housing, the economy, inflation and transport.</P>

      <P>Following the outstanding commitment given by the Minister for Education and Science to special schools in terms of additional teachers and care workers, will the Leader ask the Minister to consider making available the necessary capital funding to meet the accommodation needs brought about by that generous commitment?</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Coogan for his tolerance. In response to Senator Norris, I will do all I can to allow time for statements on Tibet. In response to Senators Henry and O'Meara and all other Senators who expressed concern about No. 3, it is only being deferred. It was agreed by the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the <Col N="1741" /> Independent Senators, in the absence of the leader of the Labour Party, that we will have a long debate on all these matters when we come back in October. The matter is being referred to a committee on which Senator Dardis and Senator O'Toole, the leader of the Independents&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and not once in that period has a Bill been guillotined or has anyone been muzzled. It is most unfair of Senators in the busiest session in the history of the Seanad to say that everyone has not been given an opportunity. All calls made on the Order of Business have been facilitated to the fullest extent. I have done my utmost to facilitate requests made by Senators. That is my duty.</P>
      <P>In relation to the call by Senator Jackman, last night's debate was extended to allow everyone to make their contribution. I will see what I can do early in the next session to facilitate her request.</P>
      <P>I will pass on Senator Norris's comments on the old buses in Dublin to the Minister for Public Enterprise. I fully agree with what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello will recall that there were statements on inflation last week, while two weeks before that we had statements on financial matters. Following the request of the Senator, I am pleased to inform the House that I recom<Col N="1742" /> mend 30 minutes for each spokesperson on the Finance (No. 2) Bill and 20 minutes for all other Senators so we can record our appreciation of the Government's hard work and success during its three years in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Hard work and success is hardly the appropriate phrase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>We can then discuss the programme it has laid out for the next six years, particularly the next two years over which this Government will preside.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú requested statements or a debate on the importance of bogs to the national heritage, and I will certainly arrange for such a discussion. The request is a timely one and it will be included in the next session.</P>
      <P>I will pass on to the relevant Minister the concerns of Senator Ó Fearghail about the delays of up to two years in completing inter-country adoption procedures. If a debate on this issue is required in the next session, I will allow time.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh called for a debate on higher education grants, and there would appear to be much merit in what he is requesting. I will certainly pass on his views to the Minister for Education and Science, and we can have a debate on this matter in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Kett recorded his appreciation of the allocations that have been made and he has asked the Seanad to acknowledge them. I will pass on his views to the relevant Minister.</P>

In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments. Members may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an important and central measure of the Government's ongoing strategy to reduce disadvantage in society. Education has long been recognised as a powerful positive force to reduce disadvantage. Equally, lack of education or poor education is known to be a crucial factor in causing disadvantage to emerge in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Senators will know that the nation has a proud record in terms of how we as a people have approach education. The people have consistently had, and continue to have, a high regard for the value of education. As individuals we appreciate its means for self-advancement; as a society we understand its power to enhance our quality of life.</P>
      <P>Equally, in economic terms, we have appreciated the role of education in assuring our success. In 1964, the release of a ground breaking report, Investment in Education, prepared by my Department with the OECD, kick started a revolution in our understanding of the link between investing in education and reaping the returns in subsequent years. Subsequently, we moved to free second level education in 1967 and later we saw, and continue to see, rapid growth in the number of students at third level.</P>
      <P>The Bill offers a complementary approach to that strategy because we are moving beyond simple statements of the importance of education to consider, in a detailed manner, the importance of participation in education. For too many children today, educational participation at first and second level is a patchy affair, punctuated by periods of non-attendance and ending in early school leaving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1745" /> Our schools have worked hard to retain these students in school, to bring home to them the importance of education and the long lasting effect it will have on their future careers. Yet schools themselves cannot deal with this problem. Non-attendance is a complex issue and too often we see only the symptoms and not the problems that lead to it.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Act, 1926, attempted to put in place a structure for school attendance and it has had some success. Today, school attendance officers work in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Dún Laoghaire, seeking to address the problems of school attendance in these areas. Yet that Act has serious flaws. The limited geographical remit of the school attendance service established under the Act meant it could not hope to treat effectively with a nationwide issue. More importantly, that Act, prepared as it was in a different context, failed to recognise the complexity of the problem of non-attendance. It is interesting to note that in introducing that Act in December 1925, the Minister concerned, Patrick McGilligan, listed what he saw as two key virtues of the Bill. The first was that it would make it easier to bring cases of non-attendance to court for punishment and the second was that it would provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>While these points may have been virtues in 1925, it is clear that this approach is no longer relevant to our society. In recent years school attendance officers have been among the many to raise their voices to point out the failings of this Act and to call for reform. It is my intention that this Bill, based upon support rather than punishment and prevention rather than penalisation, will meet this need for reform. Through the creation of a national educational welfare board and the deployment of educational welfare officers nationwide, we are delivering the support services to make genuine educational participation a reality in all our schools and classrooms.</P>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Bill returns to this House today having undergone a number of changes in the other House. Some of these changes have been significant while others have been relatively minor. All the changes have improved the goal of the Bill, namely, to replace the current approach which is focused on sanctions for truancy with the targeting of the underlying causes of non-attendance at school. With the Senators' permission, I would like to explain to the House the changes that have been effected by Members of the other House and why it is important that they have been incorporated into the Bill.</P>
    <P>The structure of the national educational welfare board has changed significantly since the Bill was passed by this House. It is my view that the board can gain substantially from the experience and expertise of the education partners and other relevant groups in the voluntary sector. I have, therefore, provided for an amendment to provide that the board should include representation for <Col N="1746" /> parents, teachers, school managers, educational welfare officers and the community and voluntary sector. I have provided that the Minister will consult with each of these categories to appoint a representative to serve on the board.</P>
    <P>It is my view that this formula will enable us to set up a board, with a guaranteed expertise in this area, of a size able to act rapidly and decisively to tackle the serious issues that lie in the remit of the board, which will draw on the accumulated knowledge and expertise of the practitioners of our education system in addressing these problems. This is an important amendment which will add to the value of the board. Following this amendment, I have made a number of consequential amendments to the Schedule reflecting these changes.</P>
    <P>I have also taken the opportunity to clarify and expand the functions of the board. It is my intention that the board will be proactive in encouraging students' participation in schools and preventing non-attendance or early school leaving from occurring. I have based my amendments on this premise. Therefore, for example, amendment No. 9 has widened the role of the board to foster and promote an appreciation of the benefits to be derived from education to include the cultural development of children. Similarly, the board's functions now also extend to actively supporting strategies and programmes aimed at preventing non-attendance at school rather than passively monitoring them, that is amendment No. 14, supporting children as well as their parents in dealing with school attendance problems, that is amendment No. 12, and promoting not just children's attendance but also their behaviour in school, that is amendment No. 13.</P>
    <P>I have also made a number of other technical amendments to provide that the board rather than the Minister will undertake certain technical duties in this area, for example, to determine the requirements for an annual report on school attendance by the school board of management to the local educational welfare officer, that is amendment No. 50. It is in my view right and proper that the board, as the expert in this area with its experience of dealing with school attendance issues at a local level, should be empowered to take on this role.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of amendments to enhance communications between the board and parents and schools, that is amendments Nos. 64 and 66. All research in this area shows us that school attendance is a complex problem requiring an integrated response. It is of paramount importance that there be clear and effective communication between all parties, board, parents and schools if we are to treat this problem. These amendments will help to secure this communication.</P>
    <P>I have provided in amendment No. 69 for a direct right for any parent, whose child is not attending school regularly to the satisfaction of the parent, to seek the aid of the board. Parents are ideally placed to see the first signs of non-<Col N="1747" /> attendance or educational difficulties in a child. We must be able to support these parents and children immediately these warning signs become apparent. This amendment will allow the parent to benefit directly from support and assistance from the national educational welfare board, in whatever approach is appropriate, through the intervention of an educational welfare officer or securing psychological assessment, to name but two. I see this role as an early warning system taking effect before the triggers in section 20, such as 20 days absence from school or six days suspension, would occur.</P>
    <P>During the Bill's passage through the other House a number of amendments were made which arose out of a Supreme Court decision given in July 1999 in a school attendance case. The Supreme Court judgment in that case has established that a minimum education is not necessarily a fixed and immobile standard but may differ per child. This decision has allowed for the redrafting of this element of the Bill to provide for a more flexible and effective approach to deal with this issue. On foot of this result, I have deleted section 14 of the Bill as originally drafted. This section provided that the Minister, after consultation with the NCCA, could prescribe a minimum education for children being educated outside the recognised school system. The section was driven by the constitutional requirement that each child is entitled to a minimum education.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of the Supreme Court judgment to hand, I have been able to restructure the Bill to take advantage of this new insight. The Bill now requires the Minister, following consultation with the NCCA, to prepare guidelines for a certain minimum education rather a prescriptive single standard. It is my view that this is a more appropriate means to treat with this serious issue. Establishing a single minimum education would have raised serious questions. How could such a standard embrace the diversity of students in the education system? Can a single standard be appropriate for all students? The Supreme Court judgment has shown us that it is not necessarily the case that a minimum education will differ from child to child. The Bill now provides for this concept.</P>
    <P>This change is in the overall thrust of the Bill. Education for each student is a precious right which must be tailored to meet the circumstances of students to allow them to develop as fully and as holistically as they can. Simple all embracing standards, although they may have the advantage of administrative convenience, are no longer sufficient in a world which places an ever higher value on an individual's education. This change has led to number of consequential changes, in particular the replacement of &ldquo;prescribed minimum education&rdquo; with &ldquo;certain minimum education&rdquo; throughout the Bill and provision for the Minister to draw up guidelines for a certain minimum education, that is, amendment No. 38.</P>
    <P>I have also moved to alter the system for the <Col N="1748" /> assessment of children receiving education outside the recognised school system, that is amendment No. 28. This amendment provides for a two-tier assessment system. Subsection (5) will allow for a less intensive scrutiny of the methods of education to be used in educating the child in question by consulting with parents engaged in educating their child and considering the materials being used, or to be used, in educating a child, the time being spent, or to be spent, on the education, and the education that is to be provided or is being provided. The authorised person may be able to satisfy himself or herself that a minimum education is being provided without the need for a more detailed and intrusive assessment. Should the authorised person not be able so to satisfy himself or herself, the more intensive process will be used. This addition, however, provides for a more flexible and balanced process in determining the educational achievement of a child who is being educated outside the recognised school system.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of changes in regard to the structures proposed at school level for reducing non-attendance and encouraging student participation. Initially I have made a number of technical changes to allow for a streamlined and more effective means of registering students starting or transferring school &ndash; amendments Nos. 43, 44 and 45 refer. The register is a vital tool in identifying problems of non-attendance. These amendments will help to ensure that registers are operated and maintained in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>In response to a number of representations made to me, I have increased the reporting requirement for number of days' absence from 15 to 20. This is given effect by amendment No. 47. This amendment strikes a better balance and will ensure that the welfare board is not inundated with reports of children missing school, while at the same time allowing it to be aware of, and intervene in, appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was passed by this House it provided that, shortly after the end of each school year, the board of management would be required to submit a report on school attendance in the school to the educational welfare officer working with the school. Amendment No. 49 provides that this report must be made available to the local parents' association. This formal report will provide another mechanism to signal individual problems to the educational welfare officer as well as providing a comprehensive overview of school attendance in the particular school. I have also, in amendment No. 56, provided that the statement of strategy be included in the school plan, as an important part of the overall drive to improve and enhance school effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that many schools are already taking actions to try to reduce non-attendance. For example, at the present time 17 specific projects are being run under the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, and 57 schools are participating in the stay in school initiative. My Department has already committed over £4 <Col N="1749" /> million to these projects since their commencement. These projects and others are showing us that schools can, with proper support and assistance, take action to reduce non-attendance and early school leaving. In the light of this evidence, I have made a number of changes designed to ensure that the Bill gives sufficient flexibility and discretion to schools to continue to take such actions in this area.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 41 provides that the school, rather than legislation, will decide how and when parents should inform the school of their child's absence. I am aware that most schools already have effective systems in place in this area, and I would not want to cause them to have to create new systems simply to satisfy the needs of this legislation. Where a school does not have such systems, it will not be left in a vacuum. Instead, the board will support such schools to develop appropriate measures.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 51 broadens school activity beyond the mere academic to embrace the extra-curricular activities such as sports, debates and other extra-curricular areas which form part of the broad education spectrum.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of changes to the statement of strategy, again to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are both appropriate and meaningful in a school context. Amendment No. 54 clarifies the focus of the school statement of strategy. While the original intent has not changed, the wording provides a clearer reflection of our aims in this area. The statement is designed to assist students who experience difficulties in school arising from the operation of the school or the provision of the curriculum, as opposed to the curriculum itself. This amendment will clarify that the school should consider removing these aspects where it is both possible and practical. The amendment gives the strategy a broader focus to allow schools to give consideration to encourage more regular school attendance on the part of students.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 52 and 55 are designed to give schools discretion in preparing their statements of strategy, to allow them to co-operate with such other schools or community groups, as they think appropriate. The national educational welfare board will assist schools in this whole process of planning, but schools are well-positioned to consider the needs of their students and the support they might be able to enjoy from the local community to meet those needs.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 62 provides for the expulsion of a student from a school. This is a very serious step for the school, but even more so for the student. Expulsion must be a solution of last resort and where adopted the school should not shirk responsibility completely for the student but should join in efforts to provide for his or her continuing education. This amendment inserts an extra support to schools and students at the point of expulsion. The amendment provides that where a school intends to expel a student, the educational welfare officer shall be informed. The <Col N="1750" /> principal duty of the educational welfare officer shall be to find a way in which the continuing education of the student in question can be provided for. To achieve this, the educational welfare officer will rely on the co-operation of the school, the student and his or her parents. By bringing the parties together, as proposed, a further opportunity is provided to them to consider this situation and to search for mutually agreeable solutions. To allow sufficient time for this meeting, subsection (4) of the amendment provides that no student can be expelled for at least 20 days after the notification of the intent to expel to the educational welfare officer.</P>
    <P>Although the expulsion of a student must be a solution of last resort for a school, there are situations where it is in the interests of other students in the school, or indeed the student it is proposed to expel, that he or she be removed from the school pending a resolution of the case. Subsection (5) clarifies that a school can take such measures as to ensure good order in the school and to protect the safety of the staff and students of the school.</P>
    <P>On the role of educational welfare officers, during the course of consultations with the partners on this Bill, concerns have been expressed that the educational welfare officers should act in co-operation with a school and should carry out their functions in a reasonable manner. The educational welfare officers have an important role under the Bill. To fulfil this role properly, it is imperative that they maintain an independent and impartial role in relation to the schools to which they are assigned. However, there is also a duty on the educational welfare officers to carry out their duties in a fair and reasonable manner. In particular, each educational welfare officer must recognise the importance of working closely and co-operating with the schools to which he or she is assigned. This amendment will create the appropriate context for the work of the educational welfare officers with schools to which they are assigned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48 places an onus on an educational welfare officer, when he or she receives a notification from the principal of a school that a child is not attending regularly, to liaise with the child, his or her parents, the principal and anybody else deemed appropriate by the officer. The officer must also try to ensure that provision is made for the child's continued education.</P>
    <P>Any situation where a child is experiencing difficulties deserves our attention and it is our duty as legislators to support such children in every way we can. I consider the educational welfare officer to be a key person in treating these children. That officer will consider individual cases where students are experiencing difficulties and will work with schools to find solutions to these difficulties. The officer will be able to pursue these cases outside the school, to consider the home environment and to provide support and assistance directly to families. The officer will be able to act as a focal point for other State services <Col N="1751" /> to allow for an integrated approach by health professionals, social workers or gardaí, as appropriate, to treat such cases. That officer will advise schools on their statements of strategy and will not only be able to give them the benefit of his or her experience and expertise in preparing such statements but will also be able to help them to make those statements a reality.</P>
    <P>Section 25 originally provided for the employment of children. Its purpose was to restrict further the capacity of children of compulsory school-going age to engage in employment. This issue is already covered generally in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. Representations were made to me that the Act provides sufficient protection for children. It precludes the employment of children except on licence on a case-by-case basis from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Such licences are to be issued in respect of cultural, artistic, sporting and advertising activities and cannot be issued where the activity would interfere with the child's attendance at school. Alternatively, employers may employ children over the age of 14 on programmes of work experience of educational programmes approved by me as Minister for Education and Science, provided that those programmes do not exceed eight hours in one day, or 40 hours in one week. This section would have prevented the issuing of such licences and, on balance, this goes further than is necessary and could result in denying children some education enhancing experiences.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of section 30, as originally drafted, was to ensure, as far as is practicable, that young people aged 16 and 17 remain within the education and training system. In particular, the provisions are aimed at ensuring that young people are not lured from education and training by the prospect of employment. Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 arise out of discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That Department was concerned that the interface between this Bill and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, would create administrative difficulties. The amendments will remove the explicit link between the Education (Welfare) Bill and the 1996 Act. It will mean that in future the Bill will regulate those young people with poor educational qualifications who seek to enter employment, while the 1996 Act will regulate the employment of young persons generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to the commencement of the Act, in terms of substantive change to the Bill, I draw the attention of Members to two further changes. As Members will be aware, the Bill will not come into force immediately after its passing by the Oireachtas, rather its provisions will become law on the making of commencement orders. The effect of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 is to ensure that the latest stage at which all provisions of the Bill become effective will be two years from its date of enactment. Amendment No. 7 places an <Col N="1752" /> obligation on the Minister to prepare a report to the Oireachtas on the operation of the Bill in the first and second years following its enactment. These provisions reflect an identical approach adopted in the Education Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to the meaning of the word &ldquo;child&rdquo;, when the Bill passed this House, section 3 provided that its provisions could be extended to cover all people up to the age of 18. Certain concerns were raised that legally this provision risked appropriating too much power to the Minister of the day &ndash; power that rightfully belongs with the Oireachtas. I have also had advice from the Attorney General's office that the use of this section in the future could carry some risk of constitutional challenge. Rather than allow this uncertainty to continue, I decided to delete the provision. The result is that any further change to the school-leaving age will be made by primary legislation as opposed to delegated legislation. This ensures that future changes to the school-leaving age will be subject to direct parliamentary supervision of this important issue. Amendment No. 4 reflects this change.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of technical amendments throughout the Bill. The use of language in any Bill is crucial. The necessity to use clear terms is vital if the courts are to be in a position to give effect to what the Oireachtas intended. In a Bill such as this where the rights under discussion are fundamental and sometimes competing, its efficient and proper use are even more important. I accepted that the term &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; used when the Bill was initiated was a negative and somewhat dated term. The effect of amendments Nos. 10, 11, 15, 16 and 88 is to substitute the word &ldquo;non-attendance&rdquo; which is a more appropriate term. Section 10 provided that the board could arrange, with the consent of the parent or, in the absence of this, a court order, for a child to undergo a psychological examination. The point was made to me that &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; would be a more appropriate word and I accept this. Amendments Nos. 18, 19, 20, 22 and 23 made this change. Amendments Nos. 53 and 57 have changed the original reference to a school's code of discipline to a code of behaviour, which comprehends a much wider concept.</P>
    <P>I hope I have set out where this Bill has changed since it left this House and the reasons for those changes. It is my view that those changes, in all aspects, have added to the Bill. I am satisfied that the revision of the membership of the board will significantly enhance the work and actions of the board to tackle non-attendance and promote educational participation. In revising the procedures for education outside recognised schools, based in large measure on the judgment of the Supreme Court, we have provided for a fairer, more appropriate and more effective means to vindicate the rights of children to education.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend that this Bill is an end in itself; it is merely a beginning. There is a substantial body of work awaiting the national educational <Col N="1753" /> welfare board. We have drawn upon existing research, reports and recommendations, together with the views of practitioners of the education system and Members of both Houses, to put in place the structures to ensure the national educational welfare board undertakes its work in a targeted, effective and pro-active manner. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for thoroughly outlining what has happened to this Bill since it left this House. I am sure we all would agree this is an important Bill. As such, it has been the subject of a great deal of debate in this House and in the other House. It is welcome that the Minister has accepted a number of amendments. We need to ensure our children participate in the education system in so far as that is possible and receive the most appropriate education to ensure we do not have a society that is divided by the type of education people received. It is important to ensure that those children who are at risk do not fall between the cracks, as happened in the past.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new system of educational welfare officers to replace the old system of school attendance officers, which was rather punitive. It is important there should be a co-operative base to this new system.</P>
      <P>While some of the technical amendments the Minister cited may be relatively minor, they are important in terms of the way we view education. The Minister said that the use of language is any Bill is crucial. I welcome the use of the word &ldquo;non-attendance&rdquo;. The use of that word instead of the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; was supported by Members on all sides of the House. That is an extremely important point. Similarly, in section 10, the use of the word &ldquo;assessment&rdquo; rather than the words &ldquo;psychological examination&rdquo; is more appropriate. Anyone who is involved in education would accept that point. If one says to a child that he or she must undergo a psychological examination, the child, as well as his or her parents, will think there is something desperately wrong with him or her, but if one refers instead to the child undergoing assessment, people will have a better understanding of what means. The use of the words &ldquo;code of behaviour&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;code of discipline&rdquo; is more positive and appropriate language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the changes to the Bill since it left the Seanad. I welcome the degree of openness to accepting a number of amendments. The Minister has provided that the National Educational Welfare Board will consult with parents, teachers, school managers, educational welfare officers and the community and voluntary sector. That is an extremely important point. I made the point over a year ago that there was a need for partnership in education. That important amendment provides for recognition of that partnership. It is a wide partnership and the position of educational welfare officers is a critical part of it. I am pleased the board will be more proactive and <Col N="1754" /> will actively, rather than passively, monitor the strategies and support children and their parents in dealing with school attendance problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister jumped from amendment to amendment. It may be more helpful if I keep to his script rather than go through the long list of amendments, many of which are technical. It would have been helpful if we had been given the amendments a couple of days in advance. I received them just before the debate commenced.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 69 provides for a direct right for any parent to seek the aid of the board. Parents are ideally placed to see the first signs of non-attendance or educational difficulties in a child. I accept and it is right that parents should be able to gain assistance from the National Educational Welfare Board. The Minister sees this as an early warning system. I am concerned about this issue even though it is too late to do anything about it now. The support for parents, as provided for in the amendment, is critical.</P>
    <P>The provision for education other than in recognised schools was a thorny problem. As the Minister said, there was a Supreme Court judgment. We were caught between ensuring a minimum educational standard is attained by all children and the rights of parents to ensure they could provide education for their children. I do not know whether everybody is happy with this but at least the Minister has had the benefit of that judgment to restructure this part of the Bill and deletion of section 14 provides for that. There is a need for strong links with the home education body and this is provided for in the Bill. I hope the amendment will allow for a degree of flexibility.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 28 the Minister has moved to alter the system for the assessment of children receiving education outside the recognised school system. There is a need for a much longer debate on this matter but this is not the place for it. I said on Second Stage that I had grave misgivings about the standards that will be attained. This needs to be thoroughly examined to ensure that any child who is educated outside the recognised school system attains certain standards. There is a very delicate balance to be achieved and I hope we have got it right in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a number of changes in regard to tackling non-attendance at school level. He has increased the reporting requirement for number of days' absence from 15 to 20. That allows for a greater degree of flexibility and I have no problem with it.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 provides that the report on school attendance be submitted to the educational welfare officer working with the school. This formal report will provide a mechanism to signal individual problems to the educational welfare officer. Amendment No. 56 provides that the statement of strategy be included in the school plan, as an important part of the overall drive to improve and enhance school effectiveness. Having heard from people involved in education and in compiling a school plan there is a difficulty in <Col N="1755" /> regard to time and resources. It is important that the necessary resources are provided. Sometimes I wonder whether the school plan is compiled subsequent to the action. I am concerned that there would be resources to enable schools to incorporate the school plan. I accept schools have to take action to try to reduce non-attendance. I hope the Bill allows them some flexibility.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 41 provides that the school will decide how and when parents should inform the school of their child's absence. I agree with this. We must have trust in the school system. If a system is not in place one should ask why. The Minister said that where a school does not have such a system it will not be left in a vacuum. I would question any school that did not have the ability to monitor the attendance of children. The Minister said the board will support such schools to develop appropriate measures. The board should ensure that measures are developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a number of changes to the statement of strategy to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are appropriate and meaningful in a school context. That is fine. Given that much of the onus is put on the school it will need to have the resources to do it. The school statement of strategy provides a clearer reflection of the aims in that area. It is still reasonably loose and it is down to the schools and the amount of resources available to them.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 52 and 55 are designed to give schools discretion in preparing their statements of strategy, to allow them to co-operate with such other schools or community groups as they think appropriate. It all boils down to resources. Will sufficient training be provided for management and teachers to embark on this work?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 62 provides for the expulsion of a student from a school. Much discussion arose on this provision. On the one hand, the youth federation said the Minister's amendment would erode the Bill's impact and let schools abdicate their responsibility towards pupils, while teachers said the direct opposite. Obviously, expulsion is a last resort and the measures in the Bill are a compromise. I hope they will work.</P>
    <P>The role of the educational welfare officer is essential. It is their duty to find a way to provide for the continuing education of the student in co-operation with the school, student and parents. This puts a huge onus on and illustrates the importance of the educational welfare officer. If it works well, it will be a good system. However, the jury is out until it is up and running. That will take a couple of years so the situation in schools in the short term will remain the same. Expulsion is the last resort and no school wants to expel a pupil unless it is absolutely necessary. I hope the role of the educational welfare officer will be successful.</P>
    <P>Co-operation between the educational welfare officer and the school is paramount. The Minister said it is imperative that the educational welfare <Col N="1756" /> officer maintains an independent and impartial role. However, the primary responsibility of that officer is the welfare of the pupil. He or she will co-operate with the school but I believe their first priority is the welfare of the child and I can foresee occasional tensions in that regard. Amendment No. 48 places an onus on an educational welfare officer to liaise with the child, parents and so forth. It is amazing that it was necessary to put down such an amendment.</P>
    <P>If there are insufficient resources for the educational welfare officers as well as the schools, this system will not work. These people are essential to the new system and their role must be given the backing it deserves. As I said on Second Stage, one of the first jobs I took after college was as a school attendance officer. I was impressed by the people in that service who saw themselves as welfare officers. That is only happening officially now, however, which is remarkable given that I was there over 20 years ago. This project has been a long time in gestation and I am anxious to see if it works.</P>
    <P>Section 25 deals with the employment of children and young persons. The original purpose of the section was to restrict the capacity of children of compulsory schoolgoing age to engage in employment. I referred to this on Second Stage. Having been a teacher, I feel strongly about this issue. There were also newspaper headlines about it recently. Children come to school and simply fall asleep during lessons. This is not something new but it is important given our current full employment. Young children are being offered employment in bars and in the general services sector but many employers will not comply with the provisions of employment legislation. They will pretend not even to know about the legislation. There will be people, therefore, who will exploit youngsters.</P>
    <P>Any youngster will want to make money for holidays or to buy clothes, CDs and so forth. That is far more appealing than having to listen to the teacher in the classroom. I am extremely concerned that this section should work. I accept the points made by the Minister about his discussions with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Hopefully, the two Acts, particularly 1996 Act which regulates the employment of young persons, will be effective in ensuring that young people are protected, not exploited.</P>
    <P>It is always difficult to deal with a Seanad Bill when it is returned from the Lower House. All one can do is say whether the amendments are good, bad or indifferent. Overall, this is a good Bill. There was openness to accepting amendments, although perhaps not enough. However, as the Minister said, it is a start, not the final answer. I wish him well with the Bill. A huge amount of work awaits the National Educational Welfare Board and I hope it will be well resourced and able to do that work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak again on this important legislation. I dealt with many non-<Col N="1757" /> attending children and examined their backgrounds when I was a career guidance counsellor. I was well aware, therefore, of how patchy the approach was over past decades and of the importance of participation in education.</P>
      <P>Non-attendance at school has been, and will continue to be, part of the education system. There will always be some children who, for whatever reason, cannot be contained in a school situation or maintained in a classroom. Simply expelling them is not the answer. The thrust of the Bill is to offer support rather than punishment. They are the terms in which people in the education sector should think, how best to encourage young people to stay at school and find out why some of them do not attend school.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the membership of the National Educational Welfare Board has been extended. It now reflects a wide range of interested groups. That is an important development. The functions of the board include supporting strategies and programmes aimed at preventing non-attendance at school rather than passively monitoring it. I welcome the fact that the functions demand a more active involvement. The provision in the Bill as drafted was quite loose.</P>
      <P>Parents are the key people in dealing with this issue. They are the first to see signs of non-attendance and it is important that the board and the school maintain close links with parents. The Minister has tidied up this provision with amendment No. 69.</P>
      <P>There are also changes with regard to the use of words such as &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;. For me, the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; always had connotations of psychological weaknesses whereas there can be many reasons for non-attendance at school. I welcome that change. I never liked the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo;. It was old fashioned and had wider connotations. Many parents dread the words &ldquo;psychological examination&rdquo;. I welcome the fact that it is being made easier to have an assessment which should be carried out quickly. When the school attendance officer reports the non-attendance of a student and talks to the parents, very often there is a delay between the assessment and the discovery that the child has not been attending school. There need to be closer links with the psychological department so that children who have not attended school for some time will be assessed quickly. There is a delay at that point; there should be co-operation and the psychological services should be available, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the role of the educational welfare officer who up to now has not been readily available, even though he or she was allocated a certain number of schools. Regular attendance in schools is important when things are going well and when they are going badly. The educational welfare officer should be available to work with the principal, the local gardaí, the home/school liaison officer and the parents. He or she is the best person to ascertain why a student is not <Col N="1758" /> attending school. The support systems must be in place and, as the Minister said, the thrust of the legislation is not punishment but to ascertain the reasons a student is not attending school and stress the importance of education. There is a great co-ordinated plan and the teachers, principal, home/school liaison officer and the educational welfare officer have a huge role to play in working together, not when a student is not attending school but when everything is going well. This is how one keeps matters right in the school structure. I welcome the tidying up of the role of the educational welfare officer which heretofore was patchy.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation is a good day's work. As the Minister said, it will be more effective in vindicating the rights of children to education. Of course, there will be weaknesses in the system but the fact that we now have a national education welfare board will help to make school more attractive to students and find out why a particular student is not attending. I congratulate the Minister on this worthwhile legislation which, I hope, will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to be the odd one out by introducing a certain dissention in the <i>bonhomie</i> and congratulations to the Minister in relation to the legislation. I welcome the Minister and trust he will have a long and successful period as Minister for Education and Science within the term of the present Administration.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate, I spoke strongly against the entire tone, structure and method in which we were seeking to deal with the core provisions encompassed in the Bill, that is, to deal with the problem of non-school attendance by children. An enormous number of children are dropping out and not receiving the benefits of the system. A number of OECD reports have indicated that Ireland is at the bottom of the league in relation to early childhood education, that our system of education is on automatic pilot in relation to 80% of children but that 20% are not receiving the benefits of the system. This is reflected in the fact that there are inordinately high adult illiteracy and innumeracy rates. Some 675,000 was the last figure produced by the OECD which works out at 23% of the population. Therefore, much work remains to be done in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, there are not sufficient resources or structures to ensure young people are receiving the best benefits of the education system at an early stage. These students are receiving an incomplete education. I believe this is due to a number of factors which are not addressed in the legislation. For example, there is no national pre-school system of education. This means many young children from the most disadvantaged areas of the cities and throughout the country are not receiving the benefit of an education process between the ages of two and four or five. They are getting a bad start. The Bill does not address <Col N="1759" /> this problem and we are still awaiting the White Paper on early childhood education.</P>
    <P>This is the hidden problem in the education system which the Bill seeks to address. During an earlier debate on the Bill, I indicated to the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, that the intention is good but it is unlikely the delivery will be very effective. Up to now there have been initiatives to try to deal with the problem of non-attendance at school. Breaking the Cycle has been the most successful initiative which was introduced by the previous Administration. This was carried out on a pilot basis in 25 schools in urban areas and 25 schools in rural areas. Unfortunately, while that proved to be an enormous success and was welcomed by teachers and parents, it was not extended. Perhaps the Minister might look at this as a desirable complement to the various measures being introduced.</P>
    <P>The stay at school initiative, which was introduced by the Minister's predecessor, is worthwhile but patchy. A certain amount of money is made available to schools in some disadvantaged areas and it is up to them to decide how to spend it. This is not a co-ordinated, integrated or widespread scheme. The early school leaver initiative has been a worthwhile attempt to catch people falling out of the system. The Minister might have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to ensure the money for books, shoes and uniforms is paid on time. Last year many parents did not receive the money for up to a month after the schools opened because of a bureaucratic mix-up. This system must be improved because it is a deterrent for children going to school if money is not available to purchase books, shoes and uniforms.</P>
    <P>I do not intend opposing any of the amendments, many of which are worthwhile. However, my problem is that the amendments seek to enhance a structure which I do not believe will be effective. Essentially, the Minister is proposing to set up a new board which will have the function of dealing with educational welfare. It will ensure that young people go to school, do not drop out and that a system is in place which is based on educational welfare officers. That will be the core of the system.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the educational welfare officers. This section will make or break this new system. If we examine the section we can see how bureaucratic this legislation is and why it will not work.</P>
    <P>How is the educational welfare officer presented? Section 11(1) states: &ldquo;. . .  the Board will appoint such persons or classes of persons as it considered appropriate. . . &rdquo;. Section 11(2) states: &ldquo;A person appointed . . . . . shall, on his or her appointment, be furnished by the Board with a warrant of his or her appointment. . . &rdquo;. This means that they can use their warrant like a policeman or an inspector. They can show it around to identify themselves as educational wel<Col N="1760" /> fare officers and ask for access to deal with the problem. Section 11(2) continues: &ldquo;. . .  shall, if requested by any person . . .  produce such warrant . . .  for inspection&rdquo;. This is terrible language to describe the operations of the educational welfare officer. His badge is out there, he must deal with this problem and let the schools, teachers and principals know it.</P>
    <P>Section 11(4) states: &ldquo;The board of management, principal, teachers and other members of staff of a recognised school shall give all such assistance as may reasonably be required by an educational welfare officer. . . &rdquo;. In other words, the educational welfare officer can enter a school and demand assistance from teachers, the principal and staff. This is very like an outside intruder entering a school and saying, &ldquo;Here is my badge. I want you to co-operate with me. There is something going wrong here and I am going to sort it out.&rdquo;  Those are the terms under which an educational welfare officer will be established.</P>
    <P>There is one amendment to section 11. Amendment No. 24 states: &ldquo;An educational welfare officer shall, where appropriate, act in co-operation with the persons referred to in <i>subsection (4).</i>&rdquo; Surely the educational welfare officer will act in all instances with the appropriate people. The words &ldquo;where appropriate&rdquo; are used. Surely it is always appropriate for the educational welfare officer to act in co-operation with principals, staff, parents and everyone concerned. This legislation will fall or stand on how the educational welfare officer can carry out his or her duties.</P>
    <P>Too much responsibility is given to a board in this Bill. The board must appoint someone and give them responsibilities. Then the educational welfare officer can go to a school and act in the fashion I described. If that happens there is not a hope in hell of the situation improving. We already have school attendance officers who have similar functions and in certain areas the Garda also have these functions. Unfortunately, these measures are not working. We may have a policing system but it is not an educational system.</P>
    <P>There is a proposal to extend the powers of the board in other sectors. All of the board's powers are very desirable. Amendments have been introduced to extend the board membership to include educational partners. This is very desirable. No one could disagree with this move. Amendments Nos. 9 and 12 to 14, inclusive, extend the functions of the board. This is all very desirable, but is the board the proper body to instruct educational welfare officers to deal with problems? I do not believe that this provision will work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responded with amendments that he thinks are appropriate. He wants to set up another board whose purpose is to establish its own functions. This board will be separate from the educational system operating on the ground. Will these measures be welcomed? Will the educational welfare officer be viewed as a friend or foe if he is established under the terms outlined? He must go to schools with his warrant <Col N="1761" /> and demand co-operation. Amendment No. 24 then asks for everyone to co-operate.</P>
    <P>The Bill has missed the point in terms of what is needed, an integrated structure. Schools operate on the ground. The person or persons responsible must have the confidence and trust of schools. We are not just talking about one school that is experiencing difficulties in a deprived area which has a plethora of complex problems. We are talking about a cluster of schools, primary and secondary schools, perhaps even a vocational school. We should be talking about third level institutions. The Minister also mentioned the PLC sector in terms of how the problem will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The complexity of the educational system has not been referred to at all in this legislation. How can an educational welfare officer, who has been appointed by a board, work with and gain the trust, loyalty and support of the personnel working in the educational sector? They can only do that if the structure if different. They will not get co-operation if they come from outside the sector.</P>
    <P>I have always believed that we do not need a national educational welfare board. We need a series of local structures that would include primary, second level and third level schools. These structures should also include the adult and outreach services being provided in an area. These organisations should be brought together in an integrated structure. Educational welfare officers could then service this structure. It is this type of structure rather than an external board that should be put in place. This structure would be localised. We could call it a local board, not a national board. The solution provided will not respond adequately to the problem.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 is a large amendment. It outlines the type of education that will be provided and how the board will do that. Reference was made to a certain minimum education. The education that is being provided, the materials that are being used and the time spent will be assessed by the board. What is the linkage to the school? A huge paraphernalia of activities will be concentrated on each child. There will be an investigation carried out in relation to each child. The education system does not operate like that. We are not going before the courts. While it sounds wonderful that all of this paraphernalia will be put in place and children will be assessed on an individual basis, the education system does not operate on that basis. It operates on a pupil/teacher ratio and uses whatever resources are available, depending on where schools are located, and family background. We must have a structure that corresponds with this. We do not need a national bureaucracy where an examination will take place and where one person appointed by the board will carry out that work.</P>
    <P>I could go through the amendments but Senator Keogh has gone through many of them and I do not see any benefit in doing so because they are additions to and, in many ways, enhance what is there. They improve communications <Col N="1762" /> between the board, parents and schools, which is very necessary in dealing with this complex issue. Parents can now seek assistance from the board as well as the other way around, which is very desirable because this is a two way process. The board of management will now be responsible for determining the annual report rather than the Minister and this is very desirable.</P>
    <P>Although these are worthwhile recommendations, they do not advance us one iota from the core problem that 20% of our children are not receiving a complete education. They are falling by the wayside between pre-school, which does not exist on a national basis, primary school and second level. We need a different, structured response to deal with them. It is not good enough to appoint a board, an educational welfare officer or a liaison officer to deal with them. The home-school liaison officers operate already but that approach not solved the problem. There are also school attendance officers. The problem is structural and we do not have a structural response to it. The only meaningful structural response would be to bring together the local cluster of schools and have them operate an educational welfare system among themselves.</P>
    <P>This legislation is well-intentioned and necessary. It has identified the real problem in Irish education, the hidden educational problem to which nobody referred when talking about the great young Irish as the best educated in Europe. The young Irish are the best educated if they belong to the 80% who have good motivation in the home, from a good background and have access to resources in their schools, which can privately support them. However, the other 20% have been neglected since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to address that problem but within existing structures rather than trying to maximise locally based structures that could deliver a service. This will be intrusive and will not respond to the needs. It will not command the respect of the principal, the board of management, the staff or the parents. Where will these models of educational complexity, propriety and understanding of the problem be found if not locally? What criteria will the board adopt for its appointments, apart from academic criteria? I would be very interested to know how the appointments will be made. Will they be drawn from people operating in those areas?</P>
    <P>We already know that the staff who teach in virtually all the disadvantaged schools do not live in the local area. They live in different areas and have a different background. Will educational officers be selected in the same fashion? Will they be academics first, with the necessary qualifications, or will they know the community, the children, the parents, the structures and the strengths and the weaknesses as well as the importance of education? These are the people for whom we are looking. I cannot see this Bill delivering on this aspect. This is another bureaucratic measure that civil servants have devised as <Col N="1763" /> a way of dealing with a problem they do not understand. They do not understand the problems. The money that has been thrown at education so far, in terms of the perceived educational disadvantage, has not been effective because effective structures have not been put in place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intention of the Bill and the fact that the Department of Education and Science has been trying to come up with initiatives to deal with the cycle of low educational attainment in areas where it has been the norm in the past. However, I still am very suspicious and sceptical, although I am not cynical at all. The Department is trying hard but it still does not understand the problem. The Minister's predecessor did not understand the problem. The Minister understands the problem much more because he has had long experience as Minister for Social Welfare. He understands the problems at the cutting edge of disadvantaged and deprived areas. I wish him well with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill or any of the amendments, which are all very desirable. However, I hate to have to predict that this legislation will not fulfil the function for which it is intended. I hope that we will have a review of the effectiveness of this legislation at an early stage. I wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their support for the Bill and for the questions they raised on the issues which they consider important. I assure them that I will take these into account in any consideration I have of the development of the implementation of the Bill, once it is enacted.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Keogh in her new capacity. She welcomed the change on the matter of non-attendance. She put her finger on it when she said it is a major change in thinking. Senator Costello was concerned about the fact it is difficult to change the thinking in this regard. Nonetheless, a change to a more supportive, humane approach is built into this Bill. We must ensure that it happens subsequently. I accept what Senator Costello says in that regard. It is particularly important to follow through on this. We must ensure, when the board is established, that this approach is taken, which the Senators want, which is covered in the Bill and about which Senator Costello is sceptical. Nevertheless, it is our task to make sure that happens.</P>
      <P>One of the first actions the new chief executive, whenever he or she is appointed, will have to take is to read what the Deputies and Senators said on this matter and their intentions. I will meet with the people concerned to put those points across. I appreciate the concerns of Senator Costello in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question about partnership, there is an attempt to bring about partnership which is written into the legislation purposely. One could say that this is how we work now and this is the way <Col N="1764" /> it should happen. To make sure it goes further than that, it is actually written into the Bill. After that, one cannot make certain the partnership take place. Senator Costello was concerned that some of the people might not want to co-operate with it, that there have been difficulties and it is only successful when one gets the proper co-operation, with which I agree.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde raised this point too, the need for the parents, community and the school to work with and support the child. One will then achieve the best possible results. If that does not happen, the child is at risk in different respects and the full potential of the child is much less likely to be realised. I am very conscious of that. Senator Keogh also recognised the need for the partnership approach.</P>
    <P>On the circulation of the amendments, raised by Senator Keogh, they were with the Bills Office and I understand they were circulated last week. Minimum education is a question of not being prescriptive in regard to home education. It is difficult for any of us to deal with because the Department wants children to receive the education that is most appropriate and best at present. However, the position is made clear in the Supreme Court judgment that the only requirement is a minimum education and to a certain extent my Department must stand back but it has the power to ensure that a minimum education is received. That is a delicate and difficult task which requires sensitivity and balance and we will have to see how it works in practice. Senator Keogh was concerned about standards in that case. If the examinations are taken, that sets a standard in terms of certification but beyond that the onus on the Department will be to ensure that a minimum education is received.</P>
    <P>The question of the report on school attendance and the caution about providing the resources for the school plan was raised. The board has a specific duty to assist schools in proposing their statements of strategy and that is provided for in the legislation. Funds are being provided in that regard but will be specifically allotted to cases of disadvantage, especially in the early stages. Everybody will be happy with that.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh also raised the question of expulsion and referred to the measures being compromised. She also mentioned the fact that the implementation of the legislation will take place over two years. It will be implemented immediately in areas of disadvantage. The initial drive and resources will go into that area but there is a requirement to implement it completely within the two year timeframe. It will roll on from that overall. Senator Keogh welcomed it as a good legislation, wished it well and I thank her for her good wishes.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde has direct involvement and experience in this area, particularly in regard to counselling. She was anxious that parents would be involved and she welcomed the partnership approach. She was also happy that the word &ldquo;truancy&rdquo; had been removed from the legislation and <Col N="1765" /> she welcomed the assessment approach. She stressed the fact that the educational welfare officers must work with principals, parents, home-school liaison officers and teachers. In so far as that can be provided under the legislation we have indicated that how a person works is a matter for the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello welcomed me as Minister and I thank him. He was less enthusiastic about the Bill in its final stages but he is over concerned about that. He spoke against the Bill when it was introduced in the House. He was concerned about the extent of drop outs and problems of literacy and non-attendance. I appreciate those problems but this Bill will be a major help in tackling them. I will try to ensure that happens.</P>
    <P>The Senator was particularly concerned that it might become too bureaucratic, but all legislation is bureaucratic. Most of our bureaucracy emanates from legislation, rules or guidelines. There is always a danger that legislation will become bureaucratic in application but we want to avoid that. This legislation is designed to be supportive and if there is a good board, chief executive and staff it could be a super Bill and could do a great deal. Senator Costello will see that in practice. He wanted an integrated structure serviced by educational welfare officers and a local board. There is power to set up committees at local level and it is important that there are links to the school and the children. The Senator repeated several times that he does not want national bureaucracy and I agree with him.</P>
    <P>However, what does a Member do at present? Senator Costello referred to the fact that I have experience in this area on a day to day basis. As a Member, following the enactment of this legislation, I will have the support of a board and an educational welfare officer. A requirement for consultation with him or her is provided for and he or she has resources and will be available. There will be officers throughout the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas, especially in the early stages. That is where we will concentrate.</P>
    <P>I recall addressing the problems of people with difficulties with debt. They have approached me and I ended up ringing the bank. I am amused by the tribunals because I often rang banks about people who had debt problems or problems with mortgages and so on. I almost always found them helpful in sorting out these people's problems. Usually, women approached me because they carried most of the responsibility and they were trying to get a package that would work. A package involved consultation with many people. I would ring the community welfare officer, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the credit union or the bank and the Department of Social Welfare office. In some cases the credit unions and the banks were helpful but they are also limited by legislation and rules regarding what they can do. One also dealt with the rent offices of Dublin Corporation regarding the same problem and one could end up consulting eight different sets of <Col N="1766" /> people about one problem. People worry about Members having a telephone allowance for their work and say it should all happen anyway but it does not. I probably did more to make the social welfare system simpler and workable than anybody in the history of the State, yet there are so many inter-relationships that somebody must pull everything together.</P>
    <P>Research was carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency for the Department on the prevalence of loan sharks, etc., and that led us to set up the money advice system &ndash; MABS. All it comprised was having somebody available to link all these bodies, together with public representatives. That is what the legislation does. It provides somebody who has that responsibility and can follow the problem through with families, many of which are anxious and willing to help. However, somebody must visit families to tell them it is complex, sensitive and that they must be careful about certain issues but it could be helpful. I visited a school in Mayo last week and it was wonderful to see how the community helps and supports the school. There are many examples of that throughout the country but it is wonderful when ones sees it in practice because some children who are in difficulty are being helped by everybody, including other children. It is more difficult to identify the village within the city but it can be done, although it requires more help. These measures give us an opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>There are problems for children who drop out. One of the simple measures which has been very effective is the breakfast scheme but such schemes depend on the support of the community. There is no point saying that the Department is providing breakfasts. That is not what is needed. The community must work together and the parents must get involved. That creates a different atmosphere and it is very important.</P>
    <P>There were a number of difficult cases whom the people involved in the scheme in my area were trying to help. There were 1,400 children in the three schools in the area but those running the scheme could not isolate the 100 difficult children and invite them for breakfast. They then offered the breakfast generally and 900 children turned up. Subsequently, we realised things which would not have been evident otherwise. The children would eat their yoghurt and fruit and think it was great but they really wanted a chance to talk about the football. It gives a chance for the lads and girls to have a chat before class. It is a warmer way of approaching the day. Attendance shot up as a result. We have a lot to learn but I look to the educational welfare board to help.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their comments on this Bill today and for the detailed consideration that they gave the Bill when passing through the Seanad last year. Their analysis and recommendations have been very useful to me, as always, and have contributed much to the final shape of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Tackling educational disadvantage is a key priority of this Government. Economic success <Col N="1767" /> has not relieved our obligation as legislators to the most disadvantaged in society &ndash; it has, in fact, emphasised it. As we continually progress to become more prosperous as a nation, one of our greatest challenges is to make sure that all our citizens can participate in this progress, both to contribute and to benefit.</P>
    <P>Education is a key means to tackle disadvantage. The Government has invested heavily in recent years in education &ndash; in the last three years alone resources dedicated to the education system have increased by 45%. This year the allocation for education topped £3 billion for the first time.</P>
    <P>It is always important, however, that we focus and target our spending towards those most in need. The Education (Welfare) Bill is such a measure. For years research has shown us that irregular attendance leads to early school leaving and that early school leaving leads to disadvantage. Over time this can lead to inter-generational cycles of disadvantage. Schools have taken the lead in many instances in fighting these cycles of disadvantage, and the increased provision of funding for schools designated as disadvantaged has helped in this process.</P>
    <P>It is clear that schools cannot handle this responsibility by themselves. They need supports, dedicated support that understands the problems that can lead to non-attendance and support that can tackle these problems, not just in school but outside school as well. They need focal points that can bring together the other State services, such as health professionals or social workers, to lend their weight to support the needs of students who are not attending school regularly. I was involved in setting up community development groups which had the same thinking. If there is someone there with the administrative and practical experience, other support can be drawn down.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide such a support. The creation of a national structure through the national educational welfare board and the deployment of local educational welfare officers is specifically designed to assist students to gain the maximum value from their education, both in personal and economic terms. I consider this to be a vital aspect of our overall strategy to combat disadvantage, in my Department and for the Government as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the early implementation of this legislation. My Department is already giving urgent consideration to the establishment of the board, and the roll-out of its functions. I have said on many occasions and I continue to believe that this roll-out should in the first instance treat with areas of particular disadvantage where needs are the most urgent. We need to support them now to break the cycles of disadvantage that have afflicted too many areas of our country in recent years. Following that priority, I want to see the further establishment of the educational welfare officer service nationwide, to support and assist all of our schools. The Government has already <Col N="1768" /> committed over £4 million over the next three years to resourcing this board in its start up phase, although money is not the entire solution. If the work is good, the money will be there to support it. The ongoing resourcing of the board and its operations will be a matter of the highest priority for this Government, to ensure it can carry out its tasks in a effective and meaningful manner.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators once again for their views on this Bill. Senators will continue to have an opportunity to revisit the progress of the Bill with the annual reporting mechanism that is built into the Bill. It is my hope that we will have made enormous progress in implementing the provisions of this Bill, before the first such report is made to this House in a year's time.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to establish this board in July so that it will be up and running in September. For that reason I am grateful to both Houses for the support they have given and the urgency they have attached to it.</P>
    <P>Bill reported without amendment and received for final consideration.</P>

      <P>I also congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they have done on the Bill. As other Senators have pointed out, it makes a valuable contribution to social support for school pupils and those who have problems in attending school. Unfortunately, the need for such legislation is becoming greater. It is up to the Minister to recognise that fact and to put in place appropriate structures, such as those envisaged in the Bill. The Minister cited examples from his former brief in social welfare, which demonstrate how successful an interventionist role can be in putting together support structures. <Col N="1769" /> It is an investment that will pay off, both at an early stage and by saving considerable expenditure in the longer term. In that regard, the Bill is to be commended.</P>

      <P>Employment Equality Act, 1998 (section 12) (Church of Ireland College of Education) Order, 2000,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft form before Seanad Éireann on 27 June, 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this order is to reserve 32 places in the first year of the bachelor of education course in the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines, for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or who belong to the broad Protestant tradition. The making of the order and its laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas arises from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, and the need to ensure that the rights and interests of the college, schools with a Protestant ethos and the students in those schools, are provided for.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, prohibits discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including religion. While the Act deals primarily with discrimination in employment, it also extends to discrimination in vocational training. Vocational training is defined as any system of instruction which enables a person to acquire the knowledge for the carrying on of an occupational activity. Teacher training falls within this definition.</P>
      <P>For many years, and probably since its foundation, the Church of Ireland College of Education has provided training in primary school teaching only for students who come from the Church of Ireland and the broader Protestant tradition. The purpose of this practice is to ensure that there is available to schools under Protestant ownership a sufficient number of teachers who themselves come from a Protestant background and are trained in an institution with a Protestant ethos. Most primary schools in the State are privately owned, publicly funded denominational schools. This system of denominational education is underpinned by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Collateral to the right of the religious denominations to conduct schools with a particular ethos is their right to ensure that they have available to <Col N="1770" /> them a corps of staff belonging to and trained in the particular religious denomination of the school. If such staff were not available then the constitutional rights to free profession of religion and the conduct of denominational schools would be seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>To avoid imposing what would, in effect, be unconstitutional restrictions on the rights of the denominations in this regard, section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination in vocational training, makes two exceptions. It provides that for the purpose of ensuring the availability of nurses to hospitals and teachers to primary schools which are denominational in character, and in order to maintain the religious ethos of the hospitals and the schools, the prohibition of discrimination does not apply in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary schools, the section provides that an educational or training body may apply to the Minister for Education and Science for an order permitting the body to reserve places in the vocational training course. The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, may then make an order allowing the body to reserve such number of places to meet the needs for teachers in primary schools as is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland College of Education has made an application on behalf of the college for the reservation of 32 places in the college for the academic years 2000/1, 2001/2 and 2002/3, for students who are members of recognised churches in the Protestant tradition &ndash; essentially, in this instance, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist Church and the Presbyterian Church. The college made the case that the reservation of 32 places, which is at present the full complement of first year places in the college, should be made to provide sufficient teachers to Protestant schools over the next few years.</P>
    <P>The grounds for the request, as put by the college, are as follows: recent initiatives of the Minister for Education and Science, including the allocation of an additional teacher to one-teacher schools, the lowering of the pupil/teacher ratio and the development of remedial education, have placed additional staffing requirements on the schools; anticipated demand in the schools indicates that it outstrips supply from the college; some of those who enter the college will not complete their studies and, of those who qualify, some will not take up posts in schools with a Protestant ethos, or may not teach at all; the career break and early retirement schemes reduce the number of teachers available to schools; in addition, there is some evidence of a greater number of teachers resigning from teaching in recent years than in the past and in the last school year, a survey of schools indicated that 43 posts would become available during or at the end of that school year and, in 1998, 55% of all schools reported that they had encountered &ldquo;considerable difficulty&rdquo; in securing qualified teachers to undertake substitute teaching.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1771" /> In the circumstances set out by the college, the reservation of 32 places in the college for students from the Protestant tradition appears reasonable in order to ensure that Protestant schools have available to them a sufficient number of teachers who share their value system and religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the order now to be made will continue in force for the next three academic years. I am satisfied it is unlikely that within that period circumstances will materially change, either for the college or the schools which it serves. In the third year of the order, I would propose that the situation be reviewed again and the House will be given a further opportunity to consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from the constitutional requirements from which this order flows, the order is a necessary support to the maintenance of diversity of values, beliefs and culture in our education system and in Irish society. Given the fact that schools with a Protestant ethos represent only a small minority of primary schools in the State, there is clearly a risk that that ethos could be greatly diluted unless specific protections are provided. This order puts in place a protection which the Oireachtas considered appropriate and which will guarantee to Protestant schools that they can continue to provide education for their students in accordance with their particular values and beliefs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in supporting the order. Section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, allows for such a provision. Section 12(2) states:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;vocational training&rdquo; means any system of instruction which enables a person being instructed to acquire, maintain, bring up to date or perfect the knowledge or technical capacity required for the carrying on of an occupational activity and which may be considered as exclusively concerned with training for such an activity.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, in order to protect minorities, there is a provision that the prohibition on discrimination does not apply in respect of a number of bodies. It is important to protect minorities and their rights are vindicated in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Many Senators will know about the particular college to which the Minister referred. The Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines has a very fine reputation. Nobody would have any great difficulty with the motion. I am glad it is before the House and that Members have an opportunity to say that they agree to it. It is the type of issue that is acceptable to all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Minister's point in relation to the numbers. I hope there will not be a decline in numbers in a minority group because minorities that are supported add to the cultural diversity and openness of society. It is right and fair that people who decide to avail of a specific type of <Col N="1772" /> education have backing. They should be able to employ teachers who enjoy the same ethos. I support the motion and I commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the motion and I am delighted to contribute to the debate. The motion will reserve 32 places over the next three years in the bachelor of education degree course in the Church of Ireland College of Education. This is welcome because its religious ethos and rights must be reflected now more than ever. It is important to reinforce the point that there is peace in the North of Ireland and a united front in relation to minorities. Their views should be reflected.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the job scene has changed in all walks of life and particularly for those with educational training. Measures have been introduced to reduce pupil-teacher ratios and to provide extra teachers in what were one teacher schools. Other types of work are now offered to teachers and they are moving out of the educational system to other areas. This has become a huge issue over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>It is important to ensure continuity. It is also important that the Church of Ireland has trained teachers who reflect its views and ethos. That is welcome. It is a golden opportunity to reinforce our respect for other people's points of view and minorities. I endorse the motion and support the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State, Governments have always been supportive of the constitutional right to denominational education. It is good that is continuing because it is most important to some people, particularly small Protestant communities. The motion will ensure that teachers will be available for those who want to send their children to what was described as a Church of Ireland school. However, many of these schools are not the school of choice only for Protestant children. A 50:50 ratio with Roman Catholic children is common and the ratio is much higher in secondary schools. However, it is good that the promises made under the Employment Equality Act are being introduced now.</P>
      <P>Everybody is pleased that members of the Church of Ireland have taken a more active role in the affairs of State in recent years. I give Pope John XXIII a great deal of credit for this and the changes which came into place after Vatican II. He did an enormous amount for the Protestant community in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interdenominational schools are extremely important and I am a great supporter of them; I am a patron of the Dalkey School Project. Bishop Michael Smith spoke at a confirmation service recently in County Meath about the importance of denominational education from a Roman Catholic point of view. He was talking about what to do about members of his church who were not practising and if they had a right to send children to their schools. Members of all churches feel that <Col N="1773" /> denominational education is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I knew people in the College of Education when it was Coláiste Mobhi in Glasnevin. It moved to Kildare Street and from there to Rathmines. Its association with Trinity College is a long one and I am slightly worried about one aspect. I have two drafts of the order that will be made. I got one from the Library and I was handed the other. In the second copy, the dreaded words &ldquo;the University of Dublin&rdquo; are not mentioned. I hope this will not be another measure that leaves out the University of Dublin because the bachelor of education degree will come from that university. Will the Minister indicate which order will come into effect? I hope it is the one which mentions the vocational education courses in the Church of Ireland College of Education, leading to a degree of bachelor of education of the University of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion under section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which will reserve existing places in the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines. Section 12 is most important because it prohibits discrimination in vocational training on the grounds of religion. It is an acutely sensitive order because it goes to the heart of the constitutional imperative. The enactment of the provision will give full expression to that imperative.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his predecessor have been to the fore in fulfilling many of the pledges and obligations given under the programme for Government in relation to education. I compliment him in that regard. In many instances, he has gone beyond the requirements, particularly in the context of technology training. The allocation of additional teachers to small, one teacher schools, coupled with the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio and the great developments in remedial education, have put an additional squeeze on the teaching resource that is required. It is, therefore, all the more pertinent to accede to the request from the Church of Ireland College of Education to reserve 32 places for students who are members of recognised churches within the Protestant tradition.</P>
      <P>The measure may appear discriminatory in that it discriminates against students from other religions who wish to apply. It may appear opposite to the spirit of consensual inclusivity, which is the hallmark of the Good Friday Agreement, but the advice of the Attorney General is that the order is <i>intra vires</i> and that is good enough for me. We must be extremely conscious of the narrow base from which Protestant schools take their teachers. In that respect alone, serious consideration should be given to facilitating this request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important issue that underlines the request is the anticipated demand to which the <Col N="1774" /> Minister referred. A survey showed that 43 places would become available this year in addition to the fact that 55% of surveyed schools suggested that there was a shortfall in the number of teachers available. Those facts are sufficient evidence of the need for the motion.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need for the agreement of both Houses to the motion before the recess because of the legal implications for the college prior to the start of the new college year. I fully support the order and I wish the college and the students well in their good work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators on this side of the House, I have no difficulty with the order the Minister is making under the Employment Equality Act, 1998, to reserve places in the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines for students who are members of the Church of Ireland or of the broad Protestant tradition. As Senator Kett said, we, as legislators, do not have any difficulty in ensuring that the Protestant tradition is supported because of the principle to nurture and support diversity. That was not always the case, but a great deal has changed. In our efforts to ensure peace on this island, we have come to realise the need to recognise and cultivate diversity. Although many challenges remain, I predict they will change.</P>
      <P>If a similar request is made to the Minister or his successor in the future by another religious denomination or community, such as the Muslim community, could it be accommodated under the legislation? If the principle applies to one denomination, it should apply to other groups in our community. Given the amount of change and diversity we can expect in our multi-ethnic society in the future, will the Minister clarify if the growing Muslim community, for example, can be included under the legislation? I support the principle behind the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not like this aspect of the Bill when it was going through the House and I spoke against it, although I am a practising member of the Church of Ireland. I still have difficulties with it. I will not rock the boat or call a vote but I am concerned about it.</P>
      <P>I do not like sectarian education. I do not like it in the North of Ireland where it has been one of the things which has vitiated the scene. The Church of Ireland is exactly the same as the Roman Catholic Church in the North of Ireland but the Roman Catholic Church gets all the stick for looking for denominational education. Survey after survey and eminent academic after eminent academic have said this is one of the problems which has complicated the situation in the North of Ireland. Young people at the start of their education are segregated; they do not mix together. That is a great pity. In a republic we should try to ensure that all citizens are treated equally. Let us openly acknowledge this is a variation on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the responsibility of parents, with the assistance of the church, to inculcate the religious <Col N="1775" /> ethos of the group to which they belong. It is not the business of the State to do that. I say that without any ill will towards the Church of Ireland training college with which I have had a long and happy association. I had the pleasure of teaching some of these students when they did courses in Trinity College and they were delightful. I was happy to teach them. As part of my tradition, I welcome them and wish them as well as any other person in the House.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the principle. I note that the 32 places represent the full complement. The Church of Ireland, the Methodists and the Presbyterians are keeping this to themselves. I wonder why that is the case. I know the smaller denominations are, perhaps, even more vulnerable. However, from a theological point of view, it is my view as an Anglican and a member of the Church of Ireland that we are considerably closer to the Roman Catholic Church in interpretations of matters such as the Eucharist than we are to the Presbyterians or the Methodists. This is a gentlemanly type of numbers game.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to do anything which would inhibit the development of the teaching resources of the Church of Ireland, but I am worried and it is appropriate to put that on the record. Will the Minister explain to the House if other people who are sufficiently qualified and of no religion or doubters, agnostics, atheists, Roman Catholics, Muslims or Jews have applied, if they wish to take up these resources and if they have been denied that advantage? That is the difficult side of the equation. If citizens of this country want to pursue a course in vocational education, why should they be denied because their rights as citizens are being impeded? </P>
    <P>It is better to have religious instruction at primary level given by someone who believes in it because any teacher will be better communicating something in which they believe. Will we impose a test on people by asking them if they believe in the Trinity or in the real presence and if they know the difference between transubstantiation and consubstantiation? </P>

      <P>I thank you for that practical advice. Has anyone wanted to enter this course and been disbarred? That would be a great pity. I want further resources to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be enriching for people to have a variety of other beliefs. Despite the catastrophic decline in Mass attendance and vocations, the rest <Col N="1776" /> of society in the Republic is overwhelmingly, at least nominally, still Roman Catholic. To have at least one or two Roman Catholics in the class when it is discussing and exploring issues might result in them asking the type of questions children will ask in class and it would help to prepare the teachers.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the motion but I cannot say I wholeheartedly approve of it. I do so because I dislike all forms of discrimination and I have always have, even if they are, as in this case, to the benefit of the group to which I belong.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their comments. I appreciate that the measure has been welcomed by all sides. I recognise the concerns expressed by Senators Henry and Norris. The draft Senator Henry has is the wrong one; it is an earlier draft from a week ago. The final draft was placed yesterday in the Oireachtas Library. It refers to the degree of bachelor of education of the University of Dublin. The Attorney General has finally advised on this issue. The draft Senator Henry had deals with the courses of the college, while the other draft deals with the accreditation of those courses. They are different issues but, in effect, they are both covered in the one we are proceeding with on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get copies as soon as I have concluded because this is the only one I have and I need to refer to it. I am sure the Library has copies from yesterday.</P>
      <P>The main issue raised concerned society and the way it is developing. Many practical measures are taken in a developing society and our society is developing and changing. We are becoming a more multi-cultural society and, in a way, this motion is a reflection of that. Senator Norris raised the question of the Muslim school, and I believe it was raised earlier also. We now have a Muslim school but we do not have a school for training Muslim teachers, so that is something that may come soon enough. Under section 12 of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, any group can come forward to seek training in that way. That answers the question raised by Senators Norris and O'Meara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the numbers, that is an option. It is an enabling provision. If the college finds that it only has 24 students it can bring in others but it will have a total of 32 for the next three years. That is why I said that at the end of the three years it will come back for review. In fact, they may have more students than that in total but at least it can work on the 32 figure for the present. It is a practical measure and, as Senators Ormonde and Keogh said, it is a recognition of the ethos and an assurance that ethos can continue in training and that the trained <Col N="1777" /> people can filter out into society. As I said earlier, they filter out into various directions after that anyway. I thank Senators for their support.</P>

      <P>Section 3(3) of the 1927 Act provides for exceptions to the restrictions imposed with regard to non-licensed business carried out by premises engaged in licensed and non-licensed business, so-called &ldquo;mixed trading&rdquo;. The exceptions were provided for business carried out in hotels, restaurants, theatres, etc. These exceptions are now no longer necessary because the restrictions generally in respect of mixed trading are being removed under section 4 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 provides for a further extension to the extension provided for in the Bill in relation to the hours during which premises engaged in mixed trading will be allowed to sell their licensed products. Businesses engaged in mixed trading, typically supermarkets, will by virtue of the amendment be permitted to open for the sale of licensed products off the premises from 7.30 a.m., rather than from 8 a.m. as was originally proposed on all weekdays and on a Sunday which falls on 23 or 24 December.

They amended sections 6, 7 and 12 of the Bill and relax the times during which it will be lawful for premises that are hotels, restaurants or registered clubs to provide alcohol with a meal on Christmas Day. Instead of the present situation where premises may open for three hours in the afternoon &ndash; between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. &ndash; and a further three hours in the evening &ndash; between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. &ndash; they will now be permitted to open from 12 midday right through to 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>The purpose behind the exemption is to permit persons to enjoy a drink with a meal on a day that is, for the purposes of the licensing laws, a closed day. This amendment gives ample opportunity to people who wish to enjoy a drink with a meal outside their own homes on Christmas Day to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> The next amendment occurs at section 13. Amendment No. 8 is consequential on section 16 of the Bill and is merely technical. It involves the deletion of certain words in the heading to Part III of the Bill. The heading as it stood might have indicated that Part III deals only with the amendment of provisions relating to under-age persons. Part III no longer simply amends the 1988 Act and the heading makes that clear.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 is a purely technical amendment to correct a misprint in the Bill. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 to section 13 of the Bill, relating to the temporary closure of premises where the licence holder is convicted of an under-age offence, ensured that where a licensee is convicted of several offences of selling liquor to under-age persons on the same occasion, say, where four or five persons were detected by the gardaí on a premises at the same time, the court cannot impose a temporary closure order in respect of each conviction.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 15. The amendment introduced a new section to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, and is designed to strengthen the law further in relation to under age drinking. The amendment consolidates the current law on the requirement to display notices under Part IV of the Act of 1988 relating to under age offences. There are already provisions in the 1988 Act relating to the display of notices in relation to children in section 34(4), where exemption orders are in force banning under 18s in section 35(3) and banning under 18s from off-licences in section 36(3). However, there was no requirement in existing law for notices to the effect that it is an offence to sell or supply liquor to under age persons or that it is an offence for under age persons to demand liquor. These are obvious omissions and the amendment rectifies them.</P>
    <P>The form of the notice would be prescribed by order allowing a certain flexibility, in that subsequent changes to the notice, if they were required, would not need to be provided for in primary legislation. The notice will be in a form that would apply to all outlets and will set out the law and the offences in clear language.</P>
    <P>The next amendment also occurs at section 15. The amendment extends to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts important provisions of the 1988 Act relating to under age drinking. The purpose of the amendment was to bring registered clubs within the same regime in relation to offences for under age drinking as apply to licensed premises. Under existing law, a registered club must contain in its rules the following: &ldquo;That no excisable liquors shall be sold or supplied in the club premises to any person under the age of eighteen years&rdquo;&ndash; that is provided for in section 42 of the 1988 Act. However, unlike licensed premises, there is no range of provisions that apply to clubs to cater for under age offences. Notwithstanding the fact that a registered club is not a licensed premises, it was con<Col N="1780" /> sidered appropriate that where a club is in breach of its own rules, there should be appropriate sanctions that could take effect immediately. Many club premises are frequented by young people and it is desirable that young people and adults alike are left in no doubt as to the law.</P>
    <P>The next amendment also occurs at section 15. This amendment introduced a new section into Part 3 of the Act. The object was to ensure that licence-holders engaged in off-sales of liquor will identify the premises concerned on the container in which the alcohol is sold.</P>
    <P>This is intended as a further provision in the law to assist in the curbing of under age drinking. It is a useful initiative that will not offer a panacea. It will, however, assist in the overall campaign to track down those irresponsible licence-holders who engage in the criminally responsible act of supply intoxicating liquor to young people. I realise that people will have practical and logistical difficulties in implementing this provision immediately. Therefore, it will not be implemented immediately and traders will be given time to ensure such containers display the necessary labels. This provision will be brought into law at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>The next amendment also occurs at section 15. This amendment was made for the purposes of clarity. It makes it clear that where an applicant has already begun the procedure for the issue of a licence under existing legislation, that is, under sections 3 or 4 of the 1902 Act or section 13 of the 1960 Act which are repealed by this Bill, the applicant may proceed with that application.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 16. Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 were technical in that they ensured that licensees who are leaseholders with short leases and who are trading with restricted licences will also be eligible to avail of the scheme offered by section 16 to convert restricted licences to full licences.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 17. The purpose of amendment No. 18 was to introduce clarity in circumstances where some premises started out as hotels and received a licence under the 1902 Act. A scheme, modelled on the scheme that allows six-day and other restricted licence-holders under section 16 of the Bill to convert their licences, was introduced by the amendment. The amendment applies to premises that were first licensed as hotels on or before 4 July 1960. This date is an important starting point because it was from then that premises that were hotels were permitted to install public bars on their premises.</P>
    <P>The amendment in subsection (2) addressed the position of the relatively small number of premises that did not avail of the provision in section 19 of the 1960 Act to install a public bar and which now, because of their location mainly in isolated rural areas, would not be in a position economically to come within the terms of section 19. Under the subsection, those premises will continue to operate as hotels, but are permitted to operate a public bar as part of the licence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" /> The next amendment occurs at section 17. Amendment No. 19 was purely technical and corrected a misnaming of the relevant Act.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 19. Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 provided clarity in relation to the operation of authorised events at race tracks or racecourses by placing a limit of seven consecutive days on the duration of any authorised event and by making it clear that where an authorised event extends beyond one day, the sale of intoxicating liquor will cease 30 minutes after the end of the event on each day of that event.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 22. Amendment No. 22 was a technical amendment to correct a misprint in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 24. Amendment No. 23 was consequential on sections 31 and 32 and provided for further amendments to the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986. Section 31 removes restrictions on the grant of a wine retailer's off-licence. In consequence, it was important that the Bill would permit persons to object to the renewal of such licences. Section 4 of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, provides for an objection to the renewal of a wine on-licence. Amendment No. 23 ensured that the right to object will also apply in the case of renewal of a wine off-licence.</P>
    <P>Section 32 removes the occupancy requirement in relation to the grant of a beer retailer's licence, therefore, it was necessary to further amend the 1986 Act in that regard. The opportunity was also taken to remove the requirement to prove rateable valuation as a condition of renewal of the beer retailer's licence. This was in line with section 15, which did not require proof of rateable valuation for the grant of a new licence.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 25. Amendment No. 24 provided that a registered club, in addition to hosting functions for charitable or benevolent purposes, could hold a function, the proceeds of which would go to some community purpose. Amendment No. 25 was for the purpose of clarity. It ensured that a club member is not prohibited from using the club premises for the purpose of organising a function for his or her family members.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 27. Amendment No. 26 to paragraph (<i>b</i>) of section 27 relaxed further the ban on advertising of functions held by registered clubs. It provided that, in addition to functions at which no alcoholic liquor is being supplied, other functions, permitted under section 27(2) of a community, charitable or benevolent nature, could be advertised. This should adequately meet the needs of registered clubs without doing damage to the underlying principles by which a club is permitted to supply intoxicating liquor &ndash; that it is a private institution for the benefit of its members and not a licensed premises.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at section 31. Amendment No. 27 removed an anomaly in the law as between section 37 of the Licensing Act <Col N="1782" /> (Ireland), 1874, that required an application for an intoxicating liquor licence to be lodged within the first six months of the licensing year, that is, by 31 March and section 4(2) of the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1986, that requires an application for an automatic renewal of a licence to be lodged during the course of a complete licensing year, that is, by 30 September of the following licensing year. The 1874 legislation, which applies a six month deadline, was contradictory to the more recent legislation.</P>
    <P>The next amendment occurs at the Schedule. Amendment No. 28 ensured that certain administrative procedures relating to the grant of a licence would be tightened up. It provided that where there is an application for a new licence or a licence granted by virtue of an <i>ad interim</i> transfer, the appropriate certificate of application must be presented to the Revenue Commissioners within a specified time, that is, 12 months. The concern of the Revenue Commissioners was that as no time limit exists in current law, persons are submitting certificates that are a number of years old. This practice is not conducive to good administration of the licensing system and the amendment will strengthen the law in this area.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Quinn, I remind Senators that they may speak only once and only on the amendments made in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time I have spoken during this debate. I stood up to speak before but we realised there was an alternative way to proceed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am impressed by the competent and capable manner in which he and his team of civil servants have dealt with this legislation. It is evident that they listened to all stages of the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will not go through all the amendments, rather I will deal only with those on which I wish to concentrate. The first few amendments that deal with changing the time from 8 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. make sense, in that if shops are allowed to open at 7.30 a.m., there is no reason they should not be allowed to sell beer or wine at that time, although from my experience very little trade takes place at that early hour. Similarly, the provisions regarding Christmas Day make a great deal of sense. They are logical and understandable and they reflect that the Minister listened to the case we made.</P>
      <P>During the debate on this Bill in this House and in the other House, on which I sat in, I was impressed by the Minister's strength of feeling and clear commitment regarding under age drinking, and the steps he is taking will enforce that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister explained the position well in the Dáil yesterday regarding the small number of licences that related to and reflected the provisions of the 1960 Act in terms of hotel hatches. I grew up in a business to which a hotel licence attached and we had a hatch. I do not know <Col N="1783" /> whether the use of the hatch gave way to counter trade as I did not pay any attention to that after 1972, so it may have changed.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on the amendment he tabled regarding the advertising of functions in community halls or clubs that are licensed premises. The existing law created a problem. The Minister listened to the arguments put forward and acted on foot of them.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 14, the Minister has put my mind at rest. I intended to ask him not to implement the provisions of that amendment immediately and I am pleased he said it will not be implemented immediately but at the appropriate time. I was not arguing against its implementation but to ensure it would be implemented. This is the amendment that refers to the container. Its wording is understandable. It states, &ldquo;The name of the owner, and the address, of premises to which an on-licence or an off-licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises.&rdquo; It is well worded and is clearly understood. If a person wishes to take it away from an on-licence or an off-licence and drink it elsewhere the Minister would like to see the name of the licensee of the premises on it. I have a number of queries on this but there will be time to consider them.</P>
    <P>I was not sure what exactly is a container. I can understand that a case of wine is a container. Beer is often sold in packs of four, where each of the cans is identified and touchable and easily reached. The pack has a flimsy top. Is that a container, or is each of the four a separate container? A six pack is made in a different way in that there is cardboard around it. Is a two dozen pack in a shrink wrap a container? In supermarkets people open the container and take one out. What is the position if the name of the licensee is on the outer pack and a person breaks it and takes the inner one? These are technical queries but there will be time to look at the question of shrink wraps. If the label is removable then almost every 15 or 16 year old who lays a hand on it, even if they do not buy it, will remove it.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with requiring a label which has the address of the licensee on it. I do not know the solution to it but at airports great big labels are put on. It would be outrageously difficult to do that and it would have to be done in store. The security label put on at an airport breaks into little pieces if one tries to remove it. It is not possible to do this centrally in the case of a company with half a dozen different outlets because a label bearing a different address would have to be put on for each outlet. If I understand it correctly, it should have the address of the licensee where it is sold and there is a different licence for each premises. It needs some teasing out to see how best it can be done.</P>
    <P>If a young person is found in possession of a container which contains alcohol which has the <Col N="1784" /> address of the licensee on it, is that capable of being used as evidence of proof of purchase? Given that it is not in the Bill, it is not intended to be used as evidence of proof of purchase. Since somebody else may have purchased it and the licence holder was not guilty there could be a difficulty if the label was still on it. As I have not seen anything in the Bill about using this as evidence in court, I gather that is not the intention and clearly it would not work. A stick-on label may be put on a beer can, but if put into a fridge many stick-on labels will come off.</P>
    <P>I mention these points to ensure these considerations are given attention. We do not want a law that is unenforceable or bad law but law that is capable of being enforced. A judge would quickly dismiss a case if the defence was that the label was removed. I am not sure that the law will be implemented exactly as it should be. There may be some tweak before the Bill comes into operation. Given all the effort the Minister has put into it, I would not like to find that the Bill which he intends to implement is not operational because somebody claimed the label came off or was removed. Each individual shop, and there are many thousands, will have to put on its own label or stamp. It is not possible to do this centrally as in the case of a bar code which is more capably handled. It presents a problem in regard to how it will be done.</P>
    <P>If this is not used in court as evidence, is it the correct solution? It seems we are going to a lot of trouble in insisting that every single container &ndash; every bottle, jar, and can &ndash; has the name of the licensee on it. So far as I can see, it is not intended that this should be enforceable in law. From the point of view of evidence of under age drinking, is this the right way to go? A case may well be made that chemists put the name and address of the pharmacy on any prescription but only on prescriptions, to the best of my knowledge. If one buys any other product the name and address of the pharmacy is not on it. This is costly.</P>
    <P>While I do not like to touch on cost when talking about under age drinking, because clearly one cannot count the cost to the nation of the damage caused by under age drinking, I question whether this is the ideal way to go in the long term or whether it should be tweaked. Chemists have had a cost increase in the past year which has added to inflation, but it is nothing compared to that caused by the increase in alcohol prices. The Minister referred to this in the Dáil yesterday. When speaking about the 5.2% inflation he said, &ldquo;However, we do have control over the price of alcoholic drink, the contribution of which to the rate of inflation was 1.2%, a relatively significant percentage. For this and other reasons which have been mentioned I will be asking the commission to seriously examine the matter.&rdquo;  The Minister recognises that the cost of alcohol is highly inflationary. It seems to me that putting a label or stamp on every single unit at the point of <Col N="1785" /> purchase will be highly inflationary and I question whether it is the best solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes a licensing commission to investigate other questions and to report in three months. Will he also ask this panel to advise him on the implementation of this one? In that case the Minister said yesterday, &ldquo;I will ask the licensing commission to immediately examine this concept with a view to bringing a report to Government within a very short period.&rdquo;  It might be interesting to have that commission look at this to see if there is an easier way or if that is the ideal way to do it.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise one other aspect which seems to be the only flaw in the Bill. Will this apply only to drink purchased in the State and not to drink brought in across the Border? If a young person buys alcohol in an off-licence in Dundalk, that off-licence will have the cost of ensuring the name and address of the licensee is on it, but across the Border in Newry where this legislation is not in force there will be no such cost. The Minister may then decide to check at the Border and ensure that everything coming in has the source on it. I am sure that would be against EU law. Either it will be unconstitutional in Irish terms or it will be against EU regulations.</P>
    <P>The aim is to have good law. Amendment No. 14 will not be enforceable unless what is proposed is capable of being done and unless there is sufficient time. I appreciate what the Minister has said in regard to that. I am pleased the Minister is listening to the concerns and, to use his words, &ldquo;that they will come in at an appropriate time&rdquo;. That relieves my mind. This is a much better Bill because the Minister is listening and because of the work he has put into it. On the understanding that he will not implement this aspect of the Bill until we have had appropriate time to tweak it to see whether this is the best way to do it, the law will not only be enforceable but will be good law and will stand up in the long term.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and urge him to delay implementation, as he has agreed, until it can be implemented in an enforceable way.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss the Bill. Having discussed it earlier there are very few areas where I have a concern. I am concerned about three aspects of the Bill and I will refer to them shortly. First, however, I warmly congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill. It will shortly be law and will result in a licensing and opening hours regime which is in tune with the needs of our people. It is to the Minister's great credit that he has succeeded in bringing this legislation forward. He has struck the right balance and, in doing so, has displayed superb political skill and judgment in bringing all interests with him in this complex and difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is one of the most important brought before the House. It is important in many respects but no more so than in setting down the broad parameters for the future development of <Col N="1786" /> an industry which has made a significant contribution to the success of the Irish economy. I applaud the Minister for his excellent work in this respect.</P>
    <P>As I said, however, I have concerns. The first is the Sunday night closing time. I understand the Minister's motives in this regard but as he will be aware, being from a rural constituency, Sunday night remains the principal social night for many people. This is a tradition that predates this House and has its roots in social behaviour of a different era. It is a great pity this is not recognised in the new opening hours regime by the extension of Sunday night closing time by an additional half hour. I ask the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    <P>My second concern relates to the mandatory closing of premises arising from under age drink offences. I agree with the Minister's attempt to stamp out under age drinking. The vast majority of publicans have no truck with this practice and those who deliberately sell alcohol to minors deserve a swift and severe response. There can be no argument about that. However, circumstances can and probably will arise where, through no fault of the publican or licence holder, a second offence is committed. It is not too difficult to envisage such circumstances, for example, a dissatisfied staff member or a falling out with the local garda or sergeant. A publican, through no fault of his own, could find his premises closed for a period. That will be the effect of the draconian provision in the Bill. I regret the Minister left it untouched.</P>
    <P>My third concern relates to the amendment requiring the labelling of alcoholic products to identify the seller. I can understand the Minister's objective in this regard. However, I believe this is the wrong approach. It will put a major administrative burden on everybody involved in the display and sale of alcoholic products. It is already difficult to comply with the multiplicity of regulations in the trade. This provision will add significantly to those difficulties and I urge the Minister to look at it again.</P>
    <P>It does not appear that these measures can contribute to the suppression of under age drinking. They might even have the opposite effect while at the same time incriminating the publican or off-licensee. An adult buyer might buy a product in an off-licence or pub and give or sell it to minors but the product will be traced back to the innocent retailer. The measures will impose considerable costs on the industry to no advantage. There might be a considerable time lapse between the time the product is sold and the prosecution taking place. The retailer might have no recollection of making the sale and will then be unable to make a connection to any individual.</P>
    <P>Who will put on the label? Will it be the brewer, the publican, the off-licensee or the supermarket owner? How is the label to be put on aluminium cans? The Bill will be subject to a commencement order and this will give publicans <Col N="1787" /> and other operators in the trade time to deal with this requirement.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take my views on board. My concerns are genuine and while I do not wish them to detract from what is otherwise a good Bill, I appeal to his good nature. I thank the Minister's advisers who have been extremely helpful to me and the people I represent in attempting to meet our concerns and problems in drafting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this legislation. There has been no reform of the licensing laws since 1960. We have regularly heard how archaic our licensing laws are and I compliment the Minister and his officials on their hard work on the Bill. As has been said previously, the issue is balance in the licensing laws. The Minister consulted widely and well with the various interests but I am not sure he got the balance 100% right. However, it is hard to blame him, given all he has been through in that regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of the distinction between summer and winter time opening hours, something we have been accustomed to all our lives. However, I do not know how the different opening times will work. One regime applies on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, another applies on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and there is a separate rule for Sunday when closing time is 11 p.m. Like Senator Bohan, I appeal to the Minister to re-examine this with a view to further regularisation. Half an hour is not a huge amount of time and for the sake of the expansion of the tourism industry, closing time on Sunday should be the same as Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, at 11.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>There should be only two closing times. Otherwise, it will be difficult to enforce the law. What will people do about the half hour? To be honest, I imagine that the Garda Síochána in most parts of the country will take a practical view. That is not good law, however. Human nature being what it is and everybody having suffered the effects of original sin, there will be police officers who will take their own counsel on the matter and I doubt that anybody will be inclined to say boo to them. That is not good law and I repeat Senator Bohan's appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Everybody will have relatives home at different times of the year from America and other countries. If they are on holiday, Sundays will not mean to them what it might to others in regard to obtaining a drink in the local pub with their relatives or friends. It will not be good for tourism. I understand the Minister's concerns about absenteeism and so forth. I am strongly of the view, however, that Sunday closing time should be the same as Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the changes permitting off-licences to sell alcohol from 8 a.m. rather than 10.30 a.m. I also welcome the elimination of the distinction <Col N="1788" /> between city and country with regard to licences for extinguishment and transfer. A single licence is the right option. I welcome the extension of closing times for clubs and public houses. I also welcome the provisions in relation to clubs registered under the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904 to 2000. These intervening measures relate to pub regulations being extended to clubs as provided for in sections 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36A under section 16 as amended in the other House. The updating of the Registration of Clubs Acts, 1904, is long overdue because this is the only Act which pertains to clubs' regulations. All the other measures relate only to drinking. I would like to hear the Minister say more about the remit of the new commission which will report in three months. What exactly does he expect from it?</P>
    <P>On the labelling of containers, I understand the Minister's good intentions in this regard. However, I agree with Senators Quinn and Bohan that this is not a solution to the problem. People can still purchase and pass on drink and the retailer will not be able to check every sale he or she makes. Very often the retailer may be innocent in this regard. On the face of it, this is not very good law and I do not know how it will be operated properly, as I am sure the Minister intends. Therefore, I appeal to him to look at this again. I believe there was mention of a commencement order being introduced by way or regulation. Perhaps time will be made available for further consultation on the issue. I am sure the Minister will find a way of improving the provision. This will be very difficult to police.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the six day licences and the provision in section 18 for short leases and conversion to full licences. Given that this is a small country, I do not see the need for all these different licences. I would like a total abolition of in-pocket licences because there should be just one regular seven day licence. I welcome the provision relating to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Small shopkeepers in towns and villages throughout rural Ireland made a great case to be able to sell beer. I am aware the Minister mentioned this issue yesterday and that he did not accept the amendment tabled in this regard. I again plead with him in this regard because I believe he has a sense of fair play. Given that increasing numbers of visitors are now travelling to remoter areas of the country, they should be able to obtain six-packs in shops without interfering with business in the local pub.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>As other speakers have pointed out, as we approach the final Stages of this Bill, the Minister has listened to the issues which have arisen and has not been slow to act. As a result, a substantial number of amendments are before us today. We are in a difficult position in that a number of these substantial amendments should be teased out carefully in a much more comprehensive fashion than is possible by way of one contribution by each Member. As I am not sure we are giving the Bill the examination we would <Col N="1789" /> like, I will confine my remarks to a number of the amendments.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about under age drinking. I recognise that by tabling a specific amendment to the legislation in an attempt to curb under age drinking the Minister is responding to the great concern in the wider community about this issue. We are all aware of the increase in under age drinking. Young people of 12, 13, 14 and 15 years of age are drinking and being allowed into functions. As a mother of a 16 year old, I am aware of how difficult it is when young people talk about heading off on a Saturday night to functions where drink is being served. If teenagers look any bit older than they actually are, one can assume that little or no effort will be made to either prevent them from entering the premises or limiting their drinking on the premises. From time to time, there is a complaint to the gardaí who will raid the premises and place restrictions on it. A certain number of young people, particularly the smaller ones, who are then prevented from entering the function go home and simply come back the next night.</P>
      <P>Clearly, we need more than is in the legislation. However, I welcome the shifting of the onus of proof onto the person who sells the drink, whether in an off-licence, pub or at a function. This is absolutely essential because there must be a greater onus on the person selling the drink not to sell to under age customers. There should be a clear deterrent to anyone selling alcohol to under age drinkers. This is important not just from the point of view of the person selling the drink but from the point of the view of the perception of young people. One of the biggest problems is the perception of teenagers &ndash; this is not something the Minister can necessarily address in legislation of this kind &ndash; that everyone is drinking, therefore, why should they not do so. This is partly driven by the ease with which teenagers are served drink. Anyone can go into pubs in their local towns and see under age drinking taking place. The legislation which is passed must send out a strong signal in this regard, which has not been the case to date. It is only when the legislation is passed and we see it in operation and the sanctions working and being reported in the media that we will be able to judge for ourselves whether it is successful.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation will be successful. I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to this issue nor do I doubt the commitment of any Member of this House or the other House. Nevertheless, are we going far enough? Only time will tell. We should come back in a year's time and consider the legislation again. This has been a long time in gestation. Over two years ago Senator Bohan and I sat on a sub-committee which dealt with this area and this legislation is the end of the road. The drinks industry is one of the most regulated sectors here and, unfortunately, it needs to be heavily regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an imbalance in the number of pubs to be found in urban and rural areas. We need to <Col N="1790" /> address this matter. This Bill probably does address it but only time will tell.</P>
    <P>I have made clear my remarks about under age drinking. Whether we like it or not the pub is where most people gather for social functions and meetings. It should not be as difficult as it has been in the past for pubs, especially small pubs, to enhance community life in a controlled fashion. I look forward to seeing this provision work in practice. Only time will tell whether it will be a success. My former colleague, Dr. Pat Upton, had very strong views about this issue and he was correct to hold them. I hope these provisions will meet the concerns he and others addressed.</P>
    <P>We have extended opening hours. Off-licences now open at 8 a.m. rather than 10 a.m. and pubs remain open for much longer. Clearly these measures are in response to demands enunciated, very often and loudly, by vintners. Pubs will stay open for longer and this sends a signal to people, young and old, to drink more. When we switch on the news every Monday morning we are told that five people, mostly young people, have died on our roads through a combination of speed and alcohol. Let us ask ourselves whether it is right to extend opening hours.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to alcohol cannot be addressed in this Bill, it probably cannot be addressed in legislation. We need to address this problem through campaigns, advertising, public relation exercises, going into schools and by adopting a proactive approach. We should emphasise how much damage alcohol can do. As a parent and a legislator I have major concerns about under age drinking. Not so long ago I was a teenager but there seems to have been a sea change in attitudes to alcohol since that time. There were not so many young people drinking when I was growing up. Every young person seems to drink nowadays. It is difficult for a young person to decide not to drink because of peer pressure. I am a parent of a 16 year old and I always worry about the combination of drinking and driving. This Bill does not go far enough to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I can see so many ways around the marking of cans. It is a good idea in theory but I want to see how it works in practice.</P>
    <P>This is substantial legislation. It is a pity that so many new amendments have been tabled because we do not have a chance to tease them out on Report Stage. We normally debate them on Report Stage. Let us see how the Bill works in practice. I hope we will have an opportunity, at a relatively early stage, to review it. I also hope that our review will not take as long as the review that led to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this Bill. Over the past months he has spent a lot of time putting it together. I welcome the Bill and I compliment his input. I welcome the upgrading of the six day licence to a seven day one. All licences should be the same for easy operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the provisions in the Bill are quite good but I cannot agree with a number of areas. <Col N="1791" /> The Minister has made the situation worse in some cases. I do not fully agree with the opening hours he included in the Bill. There are three opening times. During the week gardaí and publicans will find it difficult to operate three opening times. Pubs should close at 12.30 a.m. at the weekend and 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. during the week. The Garda and the people who own the premises would find these times much easier to handle.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of Senators have referred to section 14. Over the past number of years there has been a huge increase in the consumption of drink in the home. The sale of alcohol is a large part of the business done by off-licences, supermarkets and filling stations. More drink is being consumed in the home. This section stipulates that cans must bear the name of the premises or off-licences where they were bought. It will be impossible to enforce this provision. This is bad legislation.</P>
    <P>This provision tries to deal with the sale of drink to minors and its consumption by minors. I agree that minors should not drink alcohol and that laws should be introduced to control this problem. I have seen how young people behave in my town. They get a bottle of booze, go to a fast food outlet or whatever, buy a can of coke and lace it with spirits. Then they walk around town drinking it as if it was just coke. The Minister wants to introduce a provision that will insist that the name of off-licences is placed on cans of beer or bottles of vodka or whatever. In many cases young people take drink from the home. Parents can go to off-licences or Senator Quinn's premises and buy booze for use in their homes. As I have said, there has been a huge increase in the sale of spirits and drink in off-licences for consumption in the home.</P>
    <P>We have strict regulations governing drink and driving and this has led to more drink being consumed at home. As a result youngsters will raid a fridge or wherever the booze is stored. They will take out the occasional bottle of beer or spirits and bring it with them. They may be unfortunate enough to be caught with a bottle in their hands which can be traced back to an off-licence. That bottle would have been bought by their parents but they would have stolen it or taken it from their home. The Minister should delete or amend this section because it is unenforceable. This provision is very poor. It deals with minors of 12 to 14 years of age. They will be caught in possession of a bottle of booze which bears the name of a premises where it was bought legally. Many of these bottles are being taken from the home. How will the Minister enforce this provision? The Garda Síochána will write down the name of the person they find in possession of a bottle of booze, interview them and take a statement from them. No minor is going to say that they stole drink from their home. They might say that someone else bought it for them at a premises. The owner of the premises may then be indicted. I, <Col N="1792" /> like the Senators who spoke out strongly against this section, ask the Minister to look at this section again and delete it because this is bad law in a good Bill.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister again on the work he has done on this Bill. There is much praise for it but this section is poor legislation. It requires further thought and he should delete it from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in the Bill dealing with the updating of pub licences and licences as a whole. There have been several meetings with different organisations representing the vintners, hoteliers and the restaurateurs. I welcome the Minister's incorporative provisions put together in this Bill after much exhausting consideration which is at the same time a balanced examination of the tradition of the old licensed trade.</P>
      <P>As someone who was, from my debut in the Seanad, vociferous about rectifying the old six day licences, of which County Mayo has a substantial number, I thank the Minister for including it in the context of this Bill. I thank him for providing a genuine opportunity for those people who have old, traditional businesses to gain some benefit from the fact they had six day licences and that in the long term, it will rectify the licensing arrangements. This is to be commended and welcomed. The structures and conditions that the Minister included in this Bill are fair and equitable and a response to a matter that needed to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's contribution as someone with a knowledge of the business, I maintain the view that this is a balanced measure. Under age drinking is one of our major problems. A recent educational examination of some of the problems caused by drugs carried out by a different Department produced some very strong reports on under age drinking. There is a need for consideration of this problem in this Bill. While the provisions in it may not be foolproof, they are a start. Very few people have the resolution to deal with this problem. It can be improved on and may need adjustment in the future. However, it is a start to know the sources and the places where young people are being given the opportunity to obtain drink.</P>
      <P>I welcome the initiative on this problem and I commend the Minister for this Bill, the balance shown, the fair treatment for the tourism sector and the people involved throughout the licensed trade. I welcome the conditions and the sections of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for a very constructive debate. I, too, wish that we could have more time to tease out the new amendments which were brought forward in the Dáil. Some of them were Opposition amendments which were accepted and were put into parliamentary draftsman's language subsequently <Col N="1793" /> in the Department and the parliamentary draftsman's office and brought forward. Some were not. As Senator O'Meara said, some of them were quite substantive but, unfortunately, the procedures of the Houses do not allow us to go into the detail which she and I would like.</P>
      <P>The Senators have raised some very important points, with which I will try to deal as briefly and as succinctly as I can. Senators Quinn, Bohan and Burke were particularly concerned about the provision dealing with labelling. The Bill states that the name of the owner and the address of the premises to which an on-licence or an off-licence is attached shall be clearly indicated on a label affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises. It goes on to state in subsection (2) that a licensee who sells intoxicating liquor or who permits it to be sold in contravention of subsection (1) is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding in the case of a first offence £250 or in the case of a second or any subsequent offence £500.</P>
      <P>Effectively, this means that fines are provided for in the legislation for a person who does not display his or her name and address on the container if it is being sold for consumption off the premises. That is all. The offence is for selling it without the label on it. Senators have raised points regarding the practicalities of this. What if, for example, somebody tears off the label? That is not the licensee's fault. The licensee can only be summonsed for not having the label on the container.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn raised the question of how it would work in practice, if for example, one could access a bottle easily inside a four-pack and whether the label will be on the bottle or on the container which contains the bottles. The answer is that, under normal circumstances, if one has to access all the bottles by removing the container which contains the bottles or cans, then it would only be on the container. If one has to access them individually, then it would have to be on each of the bottles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to what Senator Quinn, Senator Bohan and others said on this matter, I accept that there may be practical difficulties and in those circumstances I do not wish to introduce legislation which would cause undue difficulty or expense for anybody. Consequently, I have stated that this part of the legislation will not be introduced immediately. Clearly, it will require discussion with those involved in the trade in order to examine how it might best be implemented. I have no wish to bring forward this measure as a points scoring exercise, to cause undue difficulty, hardship or expense. There is no point in bringing that part of the legislation into effect until it can be operated properly and without any major expense, which will be the objective. The practical implications of the measure will be examined and any practical difficulties which need to be overcome will be overcome. Pending that, the section will not be put into operation. It is a mat<Col N="1794" /> ter which will have to be discussed in some detail and a practical discussion will have to take place to see how this can best be implemented.</P>
    <P>The purpose behind the provision remains the tackling of under age drinking, with which I dealt at some length in this legislation during the debate in this and the other House. Unfortunately, there has been a major upsurge in under age drinking which must be tackled. As I have said on numerous occasions, only a minority of people are involved in it. We must introduce measures which will tackle it in a meaningful way. This legislation does precisely that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara that parents are horrified at the prospects of their teenage boys and girls coming home helplessly drunk. This is happening on a rising scale and, as Senator O'Meara said, it is happening because some young people feel that as everybody does it they should do it as well. In those circumstances, it is clear that the legislation should contain measures which are meaningful, by which I mean practical and which can be implemented.</P>
    <P>With regard to off-licences and small supermarkets, the commission on licensing will be charged with examining the off-licence sector and they are expected to report back in a very short time &ndash; three months from the date of the establishment of the commission. It is important to do that. It is true that Sunday night was the major social night in Ireland. I recall growing up in a public house and Sunday night was a major night. In my mind's eye I can still see men coming into the bar from the surrounding countryside to listen to the commentary on a Munster Final or All-Ireland Final on the radio. I still marvel at the patriotism when the national anthem was played. We used to be in many finals, as Senators will be aware.</P>

      <P>I can still see those men standing to attention in front of the radio. It was an extraordinary act of patriotism and I recall them staying on into the night whether we won or lost. However, as the years passed and the ballrooms of romance outlived their age, not their usefulness, Sunday night became less of a social occasion and Saturday nights took over. That is true in rural areas as well as in cities. As I have said to my colleague, Deputy Healy-Rae, on more than one occasion during the passage of this legislation, it is also true in Kilgarvan.</P>
      <P>The removal of the Sunday afternoon provision means a substantial change. Premises will be permitted to open between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. in future. This again is to reflect the situation on the ground. Families go to public houses for Sunday lunch and there has been an increase in the availability of pub grub.</P>

      <P>I recall the late Deputy Pat Upton during a debate on a Bill he introduced on Private Members' Business in the Dáil saying that the reason there was a holy hour in Dublin during the week long ago was to get civil servants back to work after lunch. I recall a senior civil servant in my Department passing me a note on which he wrote that Deputy Upton was wrong. The reason there was a holy hour in Dublin was that the Government Chief Whip wanted to get Members of the Dáil back into the House after Question Time because the Dáil bar was still open.</P>
      <P>I accept this legislation is not perfect but nothing is in life. We have done our best and I pay tribute to Senators who contributed to this legislation because it belongs to all who contributed inside and outside the Houses, not just to the Minister. I am particularly grateful to Senators who contributed in a cogent way to what will be successful legislation. It will not last forever and certainly will not last as long as the 1833 Act, which is still the primary Act governing licensing in Ireland. I understand that Daniel O'Connell, a fellow townsman of mine, made a major contribution to that Bill. I do not make any comparisons but I point that out for the historical record.</P>

The Government is anxious that the main measures should be enacted as quickly as possible so that the licence holders, the courts and consumers will know that the new law is in place and the main elements of the Bill, particularly the provisions for access to new licences and the extended range of opening hours should be introduced into law as quickly as possible in time for the summer season.</P>

    <P>I thank the staff of the House, all Senators who contributed enormously to the legislation and, particularly, the staff in my Department who worked hard over a protracted period to ensure this legislation would be passed.

We hope the legislation is another step to combat under age drinking. The Minister may be called the Liberator following his reference to Daniel O'Connell because he has liberated the drinking laws for the betterment of society and has introduced sufficient controls to make sure our concerns are met.

There are a few areas with which the people I represent are not happy but I doubt if any legislation could be enacted that would satisfy all publicans. The legislation is as good as could be expected. The Minister has bent over backwards to try to help publicans in as many ways as possible. I hope that the legislation will go some way towards controlling under age drinking. As I have stated previously, 95% of publicans do not serve people who are under age but 5% serve children aged as young as 13 or 14 and I am disgusted by that, as are most people. This legislation will bring such publicans into line and if they are closed down, they deserve it. The Minister has done a marvellous job and on my own behalf and on behalf of those I represent I thank him very much.</P>

Only a small number of those in the trade sell drink to children but they are there. When we see the sanctions being used in our communities, we will see the success of the legislation. The <Col N="1797" /> word will then go out that it is unacceptable. The legislation reflects the view of the Oireachtas and the people whom we represent.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which is before Seanad Éireann today contains the taxation aspects of the Government's package of measures on housing which was announced recently by my colleagues the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy. Senators will be aware that the background to the Government's package is the third study carried out by Peter Bacon and Associates, Economic Consultants.</P>
      <P>The overall thrust of the Government's package, which includes this Bill, is to maximise housing output to meet the continuing strong demand for housing curb short-term speculative demand, strengthen the position of first time purchasers in the market, increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet rising housing needs and improve the institutional arrangements to facilitate the delivery of housing related infrastructure and thereby increase overall housing supply.</P>
      <P>The third Bacon report points out that further economic growth in the past two years together with falling interest rates in 1999 and inward migration have added to demand for housing. Demand has increased faster than was forecast two years ago. In the circumstances the report says that the supply of new homes needs to be boosted to 54,500 units per year in the private sector if equilibrium in the market is to be achieved. Last year the construction sector completed 46,500 new homes which was the third year of record output in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased supply must be the solution to the current imbalance in the housing sector, but housing supply just cannot be switched up to significantly higher levels of output, at least in the <Col N="1798" /> short run. To reach the higher level of output requires an integrated package of measures which is what the Government has set out. Taxation measures have a role to play in helping to deliver more houses more quickly where they are required. The Government has indicated that that aspect will be dealt with in future Finance Bills as part of the arrangements for special development zones. In the meantime the measures contained in this Finance Bill should help in applying resources in the home building sector to the construction of homes for people who want to secure a foothold in the market.</P>
    <P>This Bill is mainly concerned with the demand side. The measures are designed to strengthen substantially the position of first time buyers and other owner occupiers in the housing market.</P>
    <P>Senators will agree that it would be unacceptable if the goal of owning their own home were to be beyond the reach of large numbers of our young people. In particular we cannot allow a situation to develop where the current generation of young people cannot aspire to owning their own homes. Home ownership should be a factor for stability and contentment in the community not one that leads to frustration. As well as being of direct assistance to first time buyers and owner occupiers, the taxation measures in the Bill are also designed to curtail speculative or transitory demand which has been helping to drive up prices.</P>
    <P>I will now outline for Senators the specific measures in this Bill. Part 1 deals with the new stamp duty measures for residential property. This will involve a three tiered rate structure for first time buyers, owner occupiers other than first time buyers and investors.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the commencement date of the new stamp duty measures. These measures apply to conveyances dated on or after 15 June 2000. However, the Bill contains transitional arrangements for pipeline cases which are disadvantaged under the new structure. As a result the pre-15 June rates will apply where a contract, as evidenced in writing, was in place before 15 June 2000 to purchase a residential property and the conveyance takes place on or before 31 January 2001.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 specify the new stamp duty rates applying to residential property. This now means that residential property purchased by first time buyers up to £150,000 will be exempt while for other owner-occupiers properties up to £100,000 will also be exempt. First time buyers will benefit from a cut in stamp duty for second hand properties up to £300,000. Owner-occupiers will also gain from lower rates for houses up to £300,000. Significantly increased rates, however, will apply to investors in residential housing. A flat 9% stamp duty charge will apply to all categories of investors buying new or second hand residential property for conveyances executed on or after 15 June 2000.</P>
    <P>Following changes in the Dáil, the Bill allows separated and divorced persons who have left the <Col N="1799" /> marital home to benefit from the first time buyer relief if they purchase a new home. To qualify the person concerned must not retain an ownership interest in the former home which is occupied by the former spouse. In addition the first time buyer relief is being made available for beneficiaries of tax designated trusts established for permanently incapacitated persons. Senators can get further details on these matters in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. I emphasise that the fundamental aims of the changes to the stamp duty regime are to enhance the position of first time buyers in the market and to discourage speculative investment in the lower range of the market.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill deals with the new anti-speculative property tax. This tax will apply to residential property in the State which is acquired on or after 15 June 2000 which is not an individual's principal private residence. This tax is a further measure aimed at discouraging speculative investment in the housing market which is causing difficulties for first time buyers in particular. It is not an anti-investor tax as such. It is essential that we have a vibrant, professionally run private rented sector, but we also need to discourage speculative investment. Exemptions will therefore be available in specific instances.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a definitions section. This section also provides that the tax will not apply in respect of qualifying residential investment properties under section 23 relief, under the following schemes &ndash; the Custom House Docks area scheme, the Temple Bar area scheme, the 1994 urban renewal scheme, the seaside resorts scheme, the islands scheme, the new urban renewal scheme, the rural renewal scheme, the scheme of residential accommodation for certain students, the rented residential accommodation element of the park and ride scheme and the town renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>Senators will observe from the exemptions I have just listed that it is not intended to apply this new tax to properties that are being incentivised elsewhere in the tax code. To do so would be contradictory and illogical. Exemptions will also be provided for certain &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; type residential properties as well as registered and listed holiday homes. Landlords who comply with certain regulations made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provision) Act, 1992, will not have to pay the tax. It is also envisaged that exemptions will be available in future for landlords who comply with the standards and requirements of a new regulatory regime to be put in place following consideration of the forthcoming report by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. It can be seen that the exemption from this tax can act as an incentive towards the improvement of standards in the private rental sector which is a laudable objective.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the charge to the tax. The 2% rate will apply for a period of three years on the market value of all relevant residential property with effect from 6 April 2001.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> Sections 7 to 13 outline further exemptions applying to this tax. Certain situations will not give rise to the anti-speculative property tax, such as the purchase of a residential property which will be an individual's principal private residence. However, where an individual changes principal private residence on or after 15 June, while retaining ownership of his or her previous residence, the latter property will come within the scope of the tax, even if owned before 15 June 2000.</P>
    <P>The tax will not apply to residential properties received through inheritance or, in the case of gifts, if the property was owned by the donor before 15 June 2000. Similarly, residential property held in a discretionary trust prior to 15 June 2000 will not be liable to the tax. Residential property built after 14 June 2000 on land which was owned prior to this date will be exempt. The tax will not apply to residential property held by charities.</P>
    <P>Mirroring the changes made to the stamp duty regime, the tax will not apply to any share in the family home still retained by a party to a marriage in respect of which a divorce decree or a judicial separation has been granted. I have also ensured that the tax will not apply to residential properties which are held by tax designated trusts established for permanently incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>As is the case with the stamp duty changes, there will be transitional provisions for individuals who had entered into contracts evidenced in writing before 15 June to buy a residential investment property. Section 14 provides that the tax will be charged on the market value of the property.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 27 provide for the administrative aspects of the tax. It is a self-assessment tax which will last for three years. Those liable to the tax must make a return and pay the tax to the Revenue Commissioners on or before 1 November of each of the three years up to 2003, when this tax will apply. The tax due will be 2% of the market value of all non-exempt residential property owned by the person on 6 April each year. However, where the property was acquired and fully paid for between 15 June 2000 and 6 April 2001, the price paid is taken as the market value of the property on that date. Each person with an ownership interest is liable for the tax to the extent of his or her proportionate interest in the property.</P>
    <P>Sections 28 and 29 contained in Part 3 of the Bill deal with the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions and relate to the short title of the Bill, respectively.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that if the measures require fine tuning, for either the stamp duty or anti-speculative taxes, we can do this in next year's Finance Bill. These latest taxation measures on housing taken by the Government in this Finance Bill follow on from what we did in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998, and also in the Finance Act, 1999. On both occasions, the actions were on foot <Col N="1801" /> of recommendations made in reports commissioned from the Bacon consultancy. This demonstrates how active this Government has been to ensure that the taxation system, as well as other measures, is used to redress quickly imbalances in the housing market.</P>
    <P>The effects of the previous measures have been positive. The most recent Bacon report concluded that the rates of increase in prices of both new and second hand houses have slowed sharply since the middle of 1998, which is the point when the Government measures to redress market imbalance were implemented.</P>
    <P>Figures now to hand from my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, show that average house prices generally have stabilised and, in some cases, have even been reduced since the last quarter of 1999. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, announced earlier this week that the March quarter figures for Dublin show reductions of 1.1% and 2.7% in the average prices for both new and second hand houses, respectively. This is the third quarter that average house prices have dropped nationally and in Dublin since 1995. Year on year house price increases for the period March 1999 to March 2000 are significantly lower than in previous quarters. Nationally, new and second hand house prices rose by 13% and 14% on the same period last year, the lowest increases since 1996. In Dublin, annual increases of 13% and 17% have been recorded which are also down on 12 month increases in December 1999.</P>
    <P>There are grounds for optimism in these figures. The latest package, including the measures in this Bill, should assist in restoring balance in the market and curbing the price increases we have seen. This price moderation is in the interests of all in the property sector, whether first time buyers, owner-occupiers or investors.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the provisions of the Bill, but sadly it will not achieve what he intends it to do. In recent years, there has been a huge increase in house prices and many people are predicting that this trend will continue. As we know, many young couples are not able to their own homes and therefore, increasingly, they are joining the waiting list for local authority accommodation. This situation follows on the publication of the third Bacon report. On three occasions the Government has retained the services of Dr. Peter Bacon, but the recommendations are not working. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the Government's implementation of Bacon's recommendations is not working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been unable to get to grips with the housing market. It has failed to realise that supply and demand are inextricably linked in that market and that many of the actions taken to reduce demand also reduce supply, as developers adjust to new market conditions. Accordingly, there is not, nor will there <Col N="1802" /> be, equilibrium in the market as a result of these measures.</P>
    <P>Rents have been climbing steadily also, and as a result of these measures they will continue to rise as builders and developers switch from houses and apartments to other more lucrative construction projects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill's provisions for first time buyers, including the abolition of stamp duty on the purchase of accommodation for a principal private residence to the value of £150,000. The imposition of stamp duty at 9% on residential investment property, though, will have the same effect as the abolition of mortgage interest relief on rented accommodation. Some investors have been driven out of the market but the supply of rented accommodation, which is already scarce, will become more scarce and rents will, thereby, continue to increase. The so-called speculator tax, at 2%, will have the same effect. Prices will only stabilise when supply matches demand.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in stamp duty for first time buyers of second hand houses and the reduction in stamp duty on lower value houses for persons trading up. These measures are and will be beneficial and, as the Minister knows, they have been advocated by my party for more than three years. Until now, however, the Minister had decided not to move in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Government must ensure that a sufficient supply of zoned, serviced building land is available throughout the country, but particularly in the greater Dublin area which has borne the brunt of spiralling house prices. Over three years, the Government has failed to do anything about this problem. The Minister must be disappointed that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has not put to better use the money he made available to him for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The Government should now adopt Fine Gael's proposal, contained in the third Bacon report, namely, that strategic planning areas be designated and that delays in planning be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the 2% speculator tax is a curious measure. So many types of residential accommodation are excluded in the Bill that the Government would be wise to reconsider the idea and drop it completely. Apparently, only 10% of houses which are rented are registered with local authorities. It is safe, therefore, to conclude that the other 90% of owners may not be tax compliant. If they are evading tax, it is unlikely that they will subject themselves to a new 2% tax to be administered on a self-assessment basis.</P>
    <P>I welcome the exclusions contained in section 5, which are logical, and in particular the exclusion of residential developments which the Government encouraged through the use of tax breaks. It would be perverse to encourage such developments through tax breaks on the one hand, while penalising them on the other, by way of a speculative tax. The problem is that by the time one comes to the end of the section there is <Col N="1803" /> so little left, it seems that all we have is a tax on holiday homes built by people out of their own resources, which are not speculative in any way. I have much sympathy for the victims of this tax, people who might build holiday homes around our coasts. These are not rented out; the owners stay in them for a month or two during the year, for example, over Christmas or Easter. Such people are known in County Kerry as &ldquo;the Julys&rdquo; because they are only seen in July, although we would like to see them more often.</P>
    <P>The measure is an attack on one of the essential ingredients of the economies of counties which are concerned with tourism. I am particularly concerned about my area and the west coast. Anybody who builds a holiday home after 15 July will have to pay 2% of the market value over the next three years. Aside from welcoming the consideration given to first time purchasers, I find it difficult to be warm about the Bill. I wish it was otherwise because this is the Government's third attempt to deal with the issue based on reports by Dr. Bacon. Sadly, I doubt it will achieve its stated objective, although I look forward to observing events. However, the Bill does not contain sufficient measures to deal with the severe problems that exist at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. It is interesting that it is necessary to introduce legislation to deal with issues arising from our growing economy. Some difficulties and imbalances have been created in the structures that the people and the Government want in terms of the availability of housing for first time buyers.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill was recommended in the third Bacon report. The legislation shows that the Government is actively dealing with some of the serious differences that have arisen in the economy and the consequent difficulties for young people in terms of affordable housing. The Bill sets out a structure to deal with people who already own property and who invest in housing. Figures show that speculators, who already own three or four houses, invested £5 billion in housing. Given the national building programme undertaken by the Irish Housebuilders Association and local authorities, one can recognise the difficulties that exist. The level of growth in the economy and the surge in property prices requires direct intervention. Adjustments must be made to deal with the speculative element in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains 27 sections and deals with increases in the rates of stamp duty and allowances for first time buyers of second hand houses. It also relates to charities, people with disabilities and sectors which qualify under section 23 of the revitalisation schemes introduced by the Government over the years. The Bill caters for discrepancies in those areas and makes allowances for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> The purpose of the Bill is to maximise housing output and thereby create greater opportunities for people to buy houses. It will also distort the market from the point of view of removing some speculative purchasing. This will have an effect for first time buyers, who face major problems, in terms of the provision of housing by local authorities and builders.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bill, certain changes may take place that I do not favour in areas where there is no great need on the part of first time buyers, such as along the coast where houses are being built for people who already have houses. This is a fact of life, particularly along the western seaboard. Local authorities can play their part by working with the Government and contractors. This area could be affected in terms of people buying second residences because of the new 9% tax, stamp duty and the ongoing 2% tax for three years.</P>
    <P>Local authorities could work together with builders in maintaining the construction industry by purchasing reasonably priced property to meet some of the housing demands, which is the overall purpose of the Bill. Innovation and thought are required but the structures contain sufficient flexibility to allow that to happen. This matter is dealt with on a local level and it should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Government has approached the matter in a co-ordinated way. Following the previous Bacon reports, the Government provided extra serviced land and made a huge investment in sewerage and water schemes throughout the country. It provided investment for the development of more serviced sites which are necessary for the continued growth of housing.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the Bill deals strictly with the stamp duty measures for residential property. The measures kicked in on 15 June and they should have a quick effect in creating more opportunities for people to buy houses. Part 2 deals with the new anti-speculative property tax. This tax will apply to residential property in the State which is acquired on or after 15 June and which is not an individual's principal private residence. This is the kernel of the exercise of making more housing available.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to areas which have section 23 relief. It outlines the areas covered under the various headings. I welcome the fact that the new small town renewal scheme will be exempt. Otherwise the revitalisation of up to 160 towns could be damaged. Investment and encouragement are needed in those areas and opportunities exist for contractors and others who wish to invest money in a positive and constructive manner to revitalise many towns.</P>
    <P>The 2% rate introduced under section 6 will be in place for three years. It will be based on the market value of the property on 6 April 2001, 2002 and 2003. This is an important measure because, in conjunction with the 9% rate of stamp duty, it will discourage people from buying second and third residences.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1805" /> I welcome some of the exemptions included in the Bill, such as the residential property owned by charities and disabled people. The legislation covers many of those sectors. I welcome the Bill and the Government's initiative. The Government is committed to the provision of reasonably priced housing. The huge demand for housing and investment is due to the buoyancy and wealth of our growing economy. I welcome and support the Government's initiative in providing an opportunity for young people and first time buyers to purchase reasonably priced housing. This is an important part of our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bacon report is interesting and well worth reading. I had a problem in my business and I tried to employ a consultant who was recommended to me. When he came to speak to me he told me he had been working for someone for 20 years. I did not employ him because if a consultant is needed for that length of time and does not solve the problem, perhaps it is the wrong consultant. The same is true in this case. A problem arose and the Minister decided to appoint an expert in the hope he could accept his solutions or tweak them in order to accept them. However, this measure is based not on the first or second Bacon report but the third one. We have employed the same consultant who is an academic. I do not know Peter Bacon, although I enjoy what he is doing, but I have a big question mark over someone we employ three times to solve a problem. If I let a customer down in my business when my first solution is not successful, I do not usually get a second chance and, if I do, I am grateful. However, I do not usually get a third chance.</P>
      <P>Senator Chambers was correct when he said the problem is not Peter Bacon but that the economy is booming. Perhaps the solution is not to have a booming economy and then we will not have a housing problem. We debated inflation on a few occasions recently. Are we sure we know what we are doing with our economy if it presents problems as big as this one? We spent 60 years from the 1920s to the 1980s trying to develop an economy which would create jobs. We have done so and we are now the envy of the world. Why are we continuing to look for growth and a booming economy? I suppose the reason is that we are in the habit of doing so and it is the thing to do. It is like scoring goals; if we are scoring goals we just keep scoring them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, is this the world we want? For 50 years we built an economy to create jobs and we now recognise we have achieved a growth rate of 8%, 9% or 10%. However, it is presenting us with other problems with housing, congested roads and poor infrastructure. We are now being told that people from Castlecomer, Gorey, Dundalk, the west and even County Leitrim are travelling to Dublin every day. Is this the nation and the economy we want? We are now being told that to avoid this, we should build more high rises than we have already. The Minister has three or <Col N="1806" /> four months to step back and consider whether we are going in the right direction.</P>
    <P>We have spent the past few years encouraging people to build second homes in Achill, Kerry or the west. Approximately three quarters of Members of the House have encouraged people to buy second homes. However, we are now saying we have changed our minds and that we want to discourage people from doing so. People are naughty for buying second homes because it is against the national interest. We have encouraged people to invest in building houses, yet we are now telling them to slow down and that they have been naughty for building houses to rent them, which is not acceptable anymore.</P>
    <P>I remember visiting a friend in mainland Europe some years ago and talking about his lovely home. I asked him how long he had lived there and he told me he had rented it for 20 years, but he had no intention of buying it. I looked in mystification at him and told him I could not understand why he would rent a home because nobody in Ireland would dream of doing so for 20 years. I will not go into the details of why he did it, but he said it was commonplace in the city in which he lived.</P>
    <P>Rented homes should be part of the overall market. However, if we follow the steps we are taking now, we will make pariahs of those who invest in homes to rent to someone else. We are saying they are not acceptable members of our society and they should be ashamed of themselves. I am worried about that. If we want to control the steaming housing market, we must question the assumption that investing in homes to rent to someone else is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Strategic development zones are the solution. They are part of the Bacon report and the Minister's proposals. However, they are not the only solution. Fergal McCabe, an established planner, mentioned the new fast track procedure designed to overcome all problems. He referred to Stepaside as a classic example of how approval was granted in March 1999 but nothing had yet happened. We must ensure that whatever we do works. Strategic development zones for homes, as we have for industrial parks, are the way forward.</P>
    <P>We also have other problems. Out of 350 planning positions, 107 are vacant. Even if we put all our efforts and enthusiasm into the Bill, it will not solve this problem. We must find solutions to the planning problems. The fact I am criticising some of these suggestions does not mean I criticise them all. It is logical, sensible and rational to move in this direction. Can the building industry build 50,000 homes a year? I doubt if it can without facing up to other challenges.</P>
    <P>Is growth the solution to everything? Must we continue to look for growth and to change the nation we know if the nation we create is not the one we wanted at the beginning? The only reason we are doing it is that it is the right thing to do. Perhaps it is, but I would like a debate on it, although we do not have the time to do so as we need to find a solution now.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The answer is to provide serviced land. I know the strategic development zones are a step in that direction. However, unless we have land with water, sewerage and other facilities we will not be able to take those steps. I read in the newspaper the other day that there is not enough serviced land in Swords which means building cannot start until December 2001. It will be another 18 months before a start can be made even if everything is provided.</P>
    <P>Some of the answers are in the Bacon report and some of them are in this Bill. However, we should not fool ourselves into thinking this is the be all and end all of the matter. It is the start of a long race. I welcome the Bill in as much as it is a step but we should not say it is the end of the road, that we have done our bit and we can relax. We must regard it as the start of the race, not the end of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOFearghaillFF" hpid="Mr. Ó Fearghail Mr. Ó Fearghail">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ó Fearghail</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to support the provisions of the Bill which deal with stamp duty and speculative tax on housing measures. These measures are part of a necessary response to the ongoing difficulties in the housing market, particularly those experienced by first time buyers. The measures we are discussing must be viewed in the context of the Government's overall housing programme which has been heavily influenced, as other Senators have said, by the three reports from Mr. Peter Bacon.</P>
      <P>The problems facing first time buyers, which is the main focus of this Bill, have been well documented in this House and beyond and do not need to be elaborated upon by me but suffice to say that despite the success of the Government's actions to date in moderating house price increases, the quality of life for many young families has been adversely affected by the difficulty in purchasing homes and in meeting high rent demands. The actions proposed in the Bill are obviously necessary in order to prevent difficulties arising for the wider economy flowing from housing related wage demands.</P>
      <P>The extent to which speculative investors have outnumbered first time house buyers in the marketplace in recent times lends urgency to the case. The measure of applying a 9% stamp duty across the board to non-owner-occupiers, coupled with a 2% per annum anti-speculative tax, while at the same time exempting first time buyers up to the £150,000 limit, is unquestionably the best way to proceed. I am confident that the measures proposed in this House today by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and which will be further outlined to us by the Minister of State, will strengthen the position of first time buyers and owner-occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The package being debated today needs to be viewed in the overall context of the Government's response to the housing challenge. It is an indisputable fact that the surge in house prices we have witnessed is a by-product of the economic boom we are otherwise happy to experience and <Col N="1808" /> which has been brought about in large measure as a result of the policies implemented by the Government. Just as this Government has successfully progressed the peace process and achieved previously unimagined levels of economic growth, it can be relied upon to successfully tackle the housing challenge that lies before us.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Government's wider housing programme and in particular to the Government action to increase the supply of social and affordable units. The national development plan figure of 41,500 units up to the year 2006 is a highly ambitious but nonetheless achievable objective. Senators will have noticed recent news reports highlighting concerns on the part of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, at the slow pace of some local authorities in implementing their housing construction programme. I share the concern expressed by the Minister. I see the need for positive Government intervention, working with local representatives and local authority officials to inject a far greater sense of urgency into the delivery of individual council's housing programmes.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities have depleted land banks and they have proved far from successful in competing for land acquisition on the open market. My own local authority has succeeded in acquiring land largely through the community gain aspect of the county development plan process. In addition, the use of external design consultants has helped to some extent to speed up the planning stage of local authority developments.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of us in this House are committed to ensuring social integration but that objective in itself has a delaying impact on the provision of social housing. I will give an example of what I mean. Kildare County Council has been authorised, on a current year basis, to commence 380 houses; that is a record number of starts for Kildare County Council. Such a programme, were it being carried on by the commercial sector, could be delivered by way of one or perhaps just a few contracts at selected centres of population but the need to deliver small, integrated schemes will result in these houses being delivered through anything up to 20 contracts at various locations throughout the county. Indeed, it is interesting to note that the average housing scheme size nationally is now just 13 units.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the area of voluntary housing provision and acknowledge the Government's growing commitment in this area. The establishment of a voluntary housing unit within the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with responsibility for developing this sector, will be of great assistance and is just one of a number of Government initiatives being taken in this area that are of positive assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will be aware that in his home county of Kildare, a number of locally based voluntary housing associations have developed and are making a substantial and <Col N="1809" /> meaningful contribution to the social housing demand in that area. These associations have had real and active support from local government and from the Department of the Environment and Local Government, but the biggest impediment to their future development is not the lack of support either locally or nationally but the lack of either a current tenant purchase scheme or a maximum rent scheme for their tenants. The introduction of such a measure is something I urge the Minister to consider as it would establish a level of parity between local authority and voluntary housing association tenants and would result in a greater incentive to increase the number of such units being built throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to the capacity of the construction sector which has been referred to by other Senators. The task of delivering in excess of 500,000 houses in the State over the next ten years will depend on our ability to extend the capacity of the sector. In this regard I welcome the efforts of the Forum for the Construction Industry, which is expected to report by the end of July and which has been briefed with addressing the manpower and training requirements of the industry. It is helpful to note also in this regard the participation by the Construction Industry Federation in international recruitment fairs held in conjunction with FÁS. It is interesting to further note the number of people working in the construction industry who are travelling from the North, and the substantial numbers who are crossing the Irish Sea, most notably Welsh people coming to work in the construction sector here. In doing that and travelling back home at the weekend, they are reversing the travel to work trends of several generations.</P>
    <P>I refer to the planning process in so far as it impacts on housing provision. I note with interest and welcome the proposal to engage private consultancies to work in the development control area. We are all aware of the shortages of planning and technical staff, which has been alluded to by Senator Quinn, and we are aware also of the Government's initiatives to try to address this particular problem but, notwithstanding that, there is a need to conduct an efficiency audit of local authority planning systems. It takes six months, in my experience, to get planning permission for a once-off house in a rural area in County Kildare, and we should not underestimate the contribution that the once-off housing provision is making to the national housing situation. Few, if any, applications in my county are dealt with without first going through a further information or extension of time process. I ask the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to see how these particular delays can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on the comprehensive range of housing initiatives the Government has brought forward <Col N="1810" /> to tackle the housing challenge facing us. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I also congratulate the new Senator on his maiden speech.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, to the House but that is as positive as I intend to be in relation to this item. It is short sighted, lacking in vision and it tinkers with a problem which is so large now that it threatens, along with other problems the Government has allowed to get out of control, to undermine our economic success.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the housing crisis has been allowed to develop is nothing short of a disgrace and a scandal. It has been mismanaged, even under-managed, because the Government is afraid to make the radical interventions required to deal with the major crisis we now have on our hands. To hear Government Senators talk about the price of housing and so on is an insult to the thousands of people who despair of ever being able to afford to buy a house. My heart goes out to someone like Senator Ó Fearghail who is from County Kildare. That county is in danger of being gobbled up by urban sprawl because of the inevitability of the spread from the Dublin area as more and more housing estates are being built. I consider myself lucky to live in a town such as Nenagh where we can still retain an element of control over planning how that town will develop in the future. What is absent from Government policy on this area is a clear picture of planning for the future. Planning policy is a reactive process and the Government reponse to this area is reactive. This is the third Bacon report and the third response by the Government to address the needs in this area.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, demand has increased faster than was forecast two years ago. The Government does not know where it is going on this issue. It is following a blind man down an alley, so to speak, crossing its fingers behind its back and hoping for the best. The Minister's approach to this area is like that of a boy with his finger in the dyke, closing his eyes and hoping for the best and hoping that another outburst will not take place. That approach is pathetic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will note the point I am about to make and bring it to the attention of the appropriate forum. I went to the Library before this debate to get a copy of what I thought was the published National Economic and Social Forum's report on social housing, as I heard the chairperson of that forum speaking about its recommendations on social housing two mornings ago. When I went to the Library I found that the report was not published and, on inquiry, that it has not even gone to Cabinet. It is a disgrace that the chairperson of that forum should speak about the conclusions of that forum before they have even gone to Cabinet. I have no difficulty with <Col N="1811" /> information being made available in the public arena. I am a strong and proud supporter of the concept of freedom of information and, as a former journalist, I have no difficulty with matters circulating in the media, but I have a major difficulty with an important policy matter such as this that is being finalised by the National Economic and Social Forum being aired in the media as an effective decision and that information not being made available to elected members of the Oireachtas. The Minister of State is taking a note of this. I will write to Dr. Gaffney to express my criticism and concern about this and I hope the Minister of State will take my comments to the correct forum.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have had an opportunity only to consider last year's publication by the Combat Poverty Agency on social housing in Ireland. I particularly wanted to concentrate on the issue of social housing and the need for Government intervention in the market to generate increased housing provision to meet demand. We are simply tinkering at the edges of the private sector and not acting on the area of social housing where the answer to our problem lies. Government interventions across a wide range of possible areas would generate the provision of housing, particularly at the affordable end of the market for first time buyers to meet their housing needs.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ó Fearghail pointed out, joint venture houses, such as the community gain initiative in Kildare, is a successful possiblity. I hope a similar initiative will be introduced in north Tipperary. Under such an initiative, a local authority can gain a certain amount of land or parcels of land from developers. A local authority can engage in joint venture housing where it can effectively control the price of housing and ensure such houses are sold only to first time buyers. Joint venture housing is successful and it should be put on a much broader footing, particularly in the context of the 10% or 20% provision in the planning Bill regarding the amount of land local authorities can obtain from developers. I urge the Government to ensure that such parcels of land obtained by local authorities are used not only for local authority housing but also for voluntary housing, social housing and joint venture housing. There are many measures the Government can introduce.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the report to which I referred, Social Housing in Ireland &ndash; A Study of Success, Failure and Lessons Learned, edited by Tony Fahey for the Combat Poverty Agency &ndash; states that the level of social housing has decreased over the past number of years. Mr. Fahey states it has shrunk in significance, reflecting an emphasis on home ownership as the normal housing tenure. Mr. Fahey concludes:</P>
    <P>. . .  policy considerations about how to respond to the housing shortage that has emerged since the mid-1990s have given little attention to the social housing option. The recent Bacon <Col N="1812" /> reports commissioned by Government to address the problem of housing shortage, for example, focused on house prices and market solutions, and made almost no reference to social housing [although that report does not refer to the last Bacon report]. . . . </P>
    <P>The emphasis on social housing has declined in favour of the so-called norm of private housing and home ownership.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulties in the private rented sector. Those difficulties could be easily taken on by the Government, but they have not been. As Senator Quinn pointed out, the private rented option is very unpopular. That is because the tenant largely has little or no standing or rights. From the point of view of the property owner, they want that to continue to be the position but, if we want to deal with the current housing crisis, we will fail unless we tackle the inherent difficulties in the private rented sector.</P>
    <P>The number of registrations with local authorities of property owners who are landlords is very low. I explored this matter in the context of my local authority area. Local authorities do not have the necessary resources to seek out private rented houses, register them and ensure all the necessary work is carried out to bring them up to the required standard. The necessary statutory framework to address the difficulties in that sector is in place but it is not operating in practice. The quality of accommodation in the private rented sector is extremely bad in some cases. We know from representations made to us that some people on the local authority housing list are living in appalling conditions. That is not good enough. If the private rented sector was a far more attractive and secure option, which can be done only by way of Government stricture, we would not have the same reliance on and perhaps the same demand for home ownership, although our cultural experience is such that people want to own their own homes. However, it is not fair to those who are currently reliant on the private rented sector to be left so exposed, particularly when the necessary statutory framework is in place but the necessary resources have not been allocated to local authorities to address the difficulties in this area. That is another area that needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Planning Bill, many Senators, including Senator Ó Fearghail, mentioned the delay in granting planning permissions for the building of one off houses. The delay in the awarding of such planning permissions in the north Tipperary local authority area is not as long as it is in the Kildare local authority area. We should not underestimate the need for the speedy award of such permissions to enable applicants to provide their housing needs. The building of one off houses in the countryside has not merely increased but exploded as people have the money, which is good, to build or to buy their own house, which they did not have previously, although many people are not able to do so <Col N="1813" /> because of the Government's attitude to development in that area.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be any improvement in this area. This Bill only tinkers around the edges of the problem as there is a lack of will by the Government to intervene in the housing market. I will be a &ldquo;pinko&rdquo; liberal on this matter. It is imperative that the Government should come up with a radical interventionist solution to this issue. The Minister probably believes these proposals are interventionist, but they are not. They represent only a finger in the dyke that has possibly yet to burst. Things are not getting any better. Despite the figures the Minister quoted, one only has to open the property supplement of any of the national newspapers or the expanding property pages of local newspapers to realise the extent to which people, particularly first time buyers, are being screwed by the rising housing prices which they are forced to endure. In many cases they rely on parents and other sources of income to get themselves into debt with its short-term and long-term implications.</P>
    <P>One expert after another has pointed to the housing crisis being such a difficulty for us in relation to the continued expansion of the economy. Senator Quinn has made a relevant point &ndash; should we continue to gallop down this road of growth? We can see the downside of it in the housing crisis and in inflation. The Taoiseach has admitted inflation may go over 6%. This is causing major problems for those on modest incomes who work hard to meet the every day demands of life in this booming economy. Instead of solving problems in many cases it has created them. This Bill goes no way towards solving the fundamental problem of housing.</P>

      <P>I congratulate also Senator Ó Fearghail on his maiden speech and wish him well and many long years in the House and possibly in the other House. I wish him every success in his career in national politics.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as part of the Government's overall plan to tackle the housing crisis. I have some small reservations about certain aspects of the Bill in that it globalises the country as a whole. While the same difficulties do not prevail in rural Ireland as in the cities, I appreciate that financial legislation has to apply equally to everybody. Rural areas will have a difficulty with some of the items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill legislates for two of the measures in the Bacon report. The Government has announced also a range of initiatives in addition to those contained in the Bill to address the housing needs and requirements on a broad front. Other measures will be provided in the budget 2001. Previous Government actions have helped <Col N="1814" /> to moderate house price increases. However, many young couples and families still have great difficulty in purchasing their own homes. There is also a knock-on difficulty where investors buy rental property given that the increase in rents is affecting the quality of life for a significant proportion of the population. House prices and high rents cause a further difficulty in that unsustainable wage increases are being sought. This is making it difficult for the labour market to function effectively.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Bill and the overall action plan is to maximise the housing output to meet the continuing strong demand for housing. The two items in front of us today aim to curb the short-term speculative demand, to strengthen the purchasing power of first time house buyers and to increase the supply of social and affordable housing to meet housing needs. The objectives set down in the Government's plan will be met by a number of issues &ndash; two of which are in front of us today &ndash; including the exemption from stamp duty particularly for second hand houses for first time house buyers up to the value of £150,000. There are changes in the rates of stamp duty for two other categories &ndash; owner occupied, where it is not the first house purchase, and others, such as investors. Also a 2% per annum anti-speculative property tax is being introduced for three years on non-occupied houses purchased after 15 June 2000. Certain exemptions will apply to rental accommodation and certain schemes which the Government has introduced over the years to encourage investment in parts of the country and, even in parts of the city, where there are difficulties with run down and derelict buildings.</P>
    <P>The Government plans to encourage the early development of large-scale residential developments within the strategic development zones by introducing, later on in the budget, a land holding tax on land owners who do not develop sites within a specified time limit. I understand the penalty will be of the order of £3,000 per site. It also plans to introduce measures to increase the capacity of the construction industry by addressing the shortage of professional and skilled workers. The shortage is causing a major difficulty. In rural areas it is difficult to get anybody to do even a minor job because all the workers are in the cities because of all the work taking place in and around the cities. It relates also to local authority housing where there has been a huge increase in housing starts. There is a difficulty getting contractors particularly for small houses, where the standard has improved immensely. There are reasonable contract prices available to builders but the reality is that there is a shortage of workers and builders. The Government intends to provide 1,000 local authority housing units per annum from 2000 to 2006 in addition to those already announced in the national development plan. This will increase the number of starts from 35,500 to 41,500.</P>
    <P>The Government has plans to speed up the planning process. Senators Ó Fearghail and <Col N="1815" /> O'Meara referred to the difficulties in the planning process. Donegal County Council had about 5,500 planning applications in 1999 compared with 1,700 four years ago. There are difficulties getting planning officers. The planning officers in Donegal are subject to much criticism. They work hard in difficult and trying times to keep the system in operation. They have an 80% success rate in having applications processed within the eight week period. There are also administrative hold-ups in local authority housing from the time an applicant applies and gets on the housing list. I would like to see the Minister tackling this area because it is soul destroying for those who are on the housing list for three or four years. While they know they will get a house there are delays ranging from planning difficulties to other matters.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities, including Donegal County Council, have made great strides to turn to other innovative initiatives such as turn-key development where we let the developers develop and the council buys back. There is also a substantial amount of voluntary housing about to commence. Between the council and three urban areas in the county, 300 starts for the next four years have been allocated from the Department and we could possibly get up to another 70 or 80 from voluntary housing. Over a three year period that may eliminate the existing housing list but the reality is that more people will come on to the housing list. Major improvements are taking place in this area. Let us hope we can overcome the shortage of builders and workers who might be available.</P>
    <P>The Government has also made improvements to shared ownership and affordable housing schemes provided for in the plan. The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have committed additional resources for housing related infrastructural development above the provision in the national development plan and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The Government has responded to the major issues arising in the housing market and to the growing need for housing in its programme, Action on Housing, which was issued in June 2000 and in its earlier programmes.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the National Economic and Social Forum report which was launched this week. It calls for the establishment of a housing authority. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is not keen on this but I believe there is merit in establishing such an authority. Its purpose would be to provide strategic policy and advice to Government Departments, local authorities and other housing providers. The authority would advise the Government on policy and set targets. It would also undertake to research and monitor the situation and to evaluate what is needed.</P>
    <P>After many years of budget deficits, there have been three years of unprecedented growth and surpluses since this Minister took office. The resources are now available to make the concept <Col N="1816" /> of social housing a high quality, desirable option for people. Spiraling house prices could be controlled by increasing resources to tackle delays in the planning system and in identifying and addressing barriers to the supply of building land. Much work is needed in this area. There was an increase of 43% in local authority housing waiting lists in the three years from 1996 to 1999. There are now approximately 50,000 people on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The NESF report addresses many issues. The housing authority it recommends could get to grips with many of the problems. It would not necessarily interfere with local authorities but would give them a focus. I do not believe it will dilute the local authority role. With a projected increase of 20% in house prices over the next four years a new generation will grow up that is unable to buy their own homes. As a result, there will be more pressure on the local authorities to provide additional housing. Ireland is the leading country in the world in terms of the desire of its people to own their own homes and, according to the report, the national housing authority would be the driving force in seeking to make that vision a reality. Social housing is an important option in that regard.</P>
    <P>Good quality, secure, affordable housing should be a social right and be given statutory backing. Housing waiting lists should be eliminated with particular attention being given to people on low incomes with specific housing needs. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, speaking at the launch of the report said that the provision of suitable accommodation for all is the primary objective of the Government and he expressed the hope that this would be achieved.</P>
    <P>According to the report, Ireland has one of the smallest housing stocks in Europe relative to its population. I was surprised at some of the statistics, particularly given people's preference for owning their homes rather than renting them and their preference for houses rather than apartments. However, the report states that only 33% of our population own their homes compared to 43% in the UK and the European average of 44%.</P>
    <P>The Government has promised to spend almost £1 million per year for the next six years on meeting the huge demand for social and affordable housing. The NESF report also refers to local authority housing and the fact that the maintenance systems need to be radically reformed and modernised. That is one of the great difficulties I encounter as a local councillor. There are huge old council estates which were built when money was not as readily available. As a result the housing is of poor quality. Many of those houses now need to be reroofed and to have central heating installed. The local authorities are short of money and do not yet have the wherewithal to do that work. I hope the Ministers concerned, Deputy McCreevy, Deputy Dempsey and Deputy Molloy, will, over the next two years and perhaps the following five years, be able to provide additional <Col N="1817" /> funding for maintenance of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>There is also huge difficulty with repair grants, particularly the essential repair grant. I am baffled when I receive letters discussing whether something is economically reparable and non-economically reparable. The reality is that many people need to repair their houses but do not have the finances to do so. They need assistance. I urge the Government to examine the possibility of re-introducing a house repair grant. It need not be as extreme or excessive as it was in the past. I would have no difficulty with the introduction of a means tested scheme which would give the finance to those who need it most to repair their homes. Many old houses could be repaired and that would assist the housing situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a strong impact on two classes of stamp duty. I have no difficulty with the abolition of stamp duty for first time buyers of secondhand homes and the rates that apply to owner occupiers. They are basically the same as existing rates. However, I have difficulty with the 9% rate for investors and I have written to the Minister a few times in the last week about specific cases. This Bill applies throughout the country but why should the west of Donegal have to suffer for the sins of the larger towns? Even with 5,500 applications per annum, there is still plenty of land available for housing. The prices have not gone through the roof. They have increased, but in rural areas not to the extent of the increases in the larger towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Donegal will suffer as a result of this measure. Many of the new developments in rural areas are by people from Northern Ireland. The planning process is there to restrict poor development. Many of the people involved in these developments are Irish citizens and this will discriminate against them. It will seriously affect the rural parts of Donegal which rely on these people not only in July but from Easter through to October and again at Christmas. Rural communities are glad of the finance their spending power brings to their areas. I have difficulty with this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I also have difficulty with the 2% anti-speculation tax. The Government document refers to increased speculative demand, particularly for short-term capital gains. In my constituency there are few short-term capital gains. Most of these houses are being bought by people who can afford to have a second home. They choose Donegal to get away from trouble and for a measure of peace. That is not speculation. Even in the case of apartments in Dublin, families might have three or four children at university and have bought apartments for them. At this stage, they cannot afford them because the prices have risen so much. However, many people are investing in this area. The initiative taken by the Minister through the individualisation of the tax bands has created extra wealth for families in that situation. They will be affected by this measure although that was not the intention.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> Those are my two main concerns. One way around the 9% stamp duty is to buy a site and build the house. However, there is no way of avoiding the 2% tax levy. Many of the houses being built to which I referred are owner-occupied. Perhaps they are not owner-occupied every day of the year because these people travel to their place of work during the week. These people will suffer as a result of this measure.</P>
    <P>The imposition of this measure will mean no tax yield because there will be no homes to qualify for the 2% tax levy. Given that many of the homes in my constituency are being purchased by non-residents from Northern Ireland, how do the Revenue Commissioners intend to collect the tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written to the Minister in relation to houses which are almost completed, contracts for which have not yet been signed. People who began these developments with good intentions will suffer as a result of this measure. I ask the Minister to look at this issue, even though a provision relating to contracts is included.</P>
      <P>I understand the 2% tax levy will apply to properties purchased between 15 June 2000 and 6 April 2001. I presume this will be extended in the Finance Bill to 2002 or 2003. We could avoid paying the 2% levy if we were granted rural renewal relief. I raised this issue with the Minister on another occasion and I was encouraged by his remarks. I recall him saying yesterday that he will wait until 2002, but we cannot afford to wait until then. I ask him to reconsider. I sent him a detailed letter recently on the difficulties in west Donegal, particularly in the Glencolmcille area. While I accept fully the main thrust of the Bill, nevertheless it contains some problems. I represent the people of Donegal, particularly Donegal South-West, where I am aware of the difficulties on the ground. Many issues which cause problems elsewhere do not apply in my area, yet we are caught under the financial legislation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the Minister's capabilities and that he is well briefed by his officials. Will these measures affect the problem of abnormal and speculative profits of builders? We are all aware of the cost of sites throughout the country and building costs per square foot. If the Minister were to introduce some type of turnover tax at a certain level in the future, perhaps speculators would not be so keen to obtain such huge profits. I mentioned previously that gazumping is taking place in Donegal. This is a terrible exploitation of young people and needs to be tackled.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in relation to the success of the economy, despite what others may think. However, I would like him to browse over some of the points I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" />
    </P>
    <P>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy): I thank Senators for their contributions. Senator Coghlan referred to the linkage between supply and demand and the fact that these measures will not restore equilibrium in the market. This Bill is part of a very significant package of measures on the supply side, under which very substantial resources are being made available to increase house building and infrastructure. The supply side measures will transform the situation, especially the development zones initiative which will make more sites available quickly. This carrot will be supplemented by a special tax stick. The Bacon report proposes a levy of £3,000 per annum per site if sites are not made available or built on within a reasonable period. These SDZ areas will be provided for under Department of the Environment and Local Government legislation which will be introduced in the near future. Senator Coghlan doubts if the Bill will achieve its stated objective of curbing house prices. Perhaps he will take comfort from my speech in relation to the increase in house prices in the first quarter of this year compared to other years.  </P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is only part of the package. When I introduced the Finance (No. 2) Bill, 1998, on foot of the first Bacon report, I pointed out in this House and in the Dáil that the tax measures in the first Bacon report were an attempt to distort demand temporarily. Luckily I repeated that fact on a number of occasions. I also pointed out that if supply did not come on stream, investors would get back into the market, even though mortgage interest relief would not be available. When the yield increases, people step back into the market. That is the law of economics.</P>
    <P>The measures I am proposing here are also an attempt to distort the market. It is no secret that I am a believer in the free market. One cannot predict exactly what the effects will be if one decides to interfere with the free market in relation to supply and demand of land. I believe one should only interfere with the free market if one is trying to secure a specific objective in relation to social policy or whatever. The anti-speculative tax levy proposed in the Bill is limited to a three year period. If in that three year period supply does not reach demand, then the markets will reach an equilibrium and people will not be affected by either the 9% stamp duty or the 2% anti-speculative tax levy. Therefore, the trick is to increase supply.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ó Fearghail, I come from a county where the overflow from Dublin has affected building and the demand for housing in counties Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and further south. The Senator is a member of a local authority in County Kildare and can attest to the demand for more and more housing in the county while at the same time groups of local political activists are objecting to more houses being built in parts of the county. There is no point preaching in Dáil or Seanad Éireann about the price of houses while at the same time preventing houses from being built in one's area. There must be a <Col N="1820" /> reasonable balance and Senator Dardis will also attest to this fact. If there is no increase in the supply of houses we will continue to have a problem.</P>
    <P>These are the types of problems which arise as a result of economic success, not economic failure. Over the years, successive Ministers for Finance have had to deal with the problems of economic failure. I am long enough in this House to know that all kinds of initiatives were introduced to encourage people to build houses. That is why the first time buyer's grant of £3,000 was introduced. This was partly an attempt to alleviate the needs of first time buyers but the real motive behind the measure was to give some kind of jump start to building and create activity. Some people are now advocating that we should slow down activity. Dr. Bacon has stated in his reports that we should increase supply.</P>
    <P>I have acceded to every request made by my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Dempsey and Molloy, in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and provided more money for infrastructural development. I have provided more than they required on certain occasions and more than the Department of Finance recommended. I did that because we could not build houses without serviced land that has water and sewerage facilities and good roads. This money will have an effect in time.</P>
    <P>No one predicted how many houses we would need. Six years ago people would have laughed at you if you said that 45,000 new houses per annum would not meet the demand. Now experts say we need 55,000 units per year over X number of years. No one predicted the success of the Irish economy. People have more money now and they want to buy property. One evening on my way home I listened to a programme about ordinary Irish people buying properties in Spain. These are not the wealthy people living in counties Tipperary, Cork or Kildare. Ordinary people can do this because they have more disposable income and there are more people are at work. At present there are 1.17 million people employed in Ireland but there was only 1 million people two years ago. Unemployment is less than 5%. People have more disposable income and they want to spend it. Some people are spending it abroad and I wish them good luck. Did we ever think we would see this happening?</P>
    <P>For many years I talked in this House about people leaving Ireland. In the mid-1980s between 40,000 and 60,000 people left every year. Now, for the first time in our history, thousands of people are returning home. This is all good news.</P>
    <P>We could solve the housing crisis by doubling unemployment and increasing it to 10%. This would also stabilise inflation because people could not continue to increase their prices. But will any sane person say that this is the way to go?</P>
    <P>It is nonsensical to look at one segment of the Irish economy and say we have a big inflation problem. The fact is that we do not. We are <Col N="1821" /> experiencing a temporary blip in inflation. It would be unimaginable for the Irish economy, which has grown by 8% per annum on average in the past five years, not to have some inflationary tendencies in the economy. A basic economic textbook that is used in first year in secondary schools could tell you that. Low inflation is the remarkable achievement of the Irish economy in recent years. For many years I have alluded to the reasons behind this. Larger and more closed economies respond to the type of analysis found in textbooks on economics but the Irish economy did not respond in the same way. The tremendous growth and success of the Irish economy has caused difficulties in the housing market.</P>
    <P>The Bacon reports, as far as tax measures go, unashamedly attempt to concentrate on first time buyers. They are not aimed at people who, for all kinds of good and genuine reasons, want to buy a second home. They are aimed at giving Joe and Mary Browne, who never had a foot on the housing ladder, a chance to get their foot on that ladder. The Finance (No. 2) Bills in 1998 and 2000 tried to do the same.  </P>
    <P>We are all entitled to our views on how we should go about that. Dr. Bacon and his company have got the job of analysing this problem for a period. That is why the Department of the Environment and Local Government has stuck with Peter Bacon. He carried out the first assessment of the problem, re-examined it in 1999 and now he has given us his final report. He examined this problem in the round.</P>
    <P>The overall solution is to increase supply. Some people find this idea unpalatable because more houses will have to be built in certain areas where people do not want them. An increase in supply will mean that builders, whom many people seem to dislike, will make more profits. If we do not encourage them to continue building they will just stop working. Whether people like it or not these are the unpalatable facts of the free enterprise market. Senator Coghlan agrees with me even though he is in Opposition. Builders must be able to make a profit, they will not build for love and we must accept this fact.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers made some interesting points. He correctly pointed out that the housing crisis is due to our successful economy. Growth in the economy is forecast to continue and I welcome it. Did we ever think we would see the day that we would have to worry about labour shortages in Ireland? Like me, Senators Cassidy and Tom Fitzgerald have spent a long time in this House. We spent most of that time worrying how Ireland would survive. No one, even the most optimistic people, thought we would live to see such economic success. As I said in both Houses, we could lessen the demand for housing by increasing unemployment but who in their right mind would suggest such a course of action?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Chambers that local authorities could assist by aligning their actions at local level with priorities agreed at national level. This is an area where public representatives, <Col N="1822" /> particularly national representatives in the Dáil and Seanad, have a role and a duty to reconcile local views with the greater national priority. If this was done we would have a sufficient housing supply. I made this point on a number of occasions, not alone during the debate of this Bill, but on previous occasions in Dáil Éireann. Many people in politics want to have it both ways but this failing is not confined to one political party. A balance must be struck and all politicians should adopt national priorities.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Minister and the Minister of State, have set down new regulations and encouraged an increase in densities, but these measures seem to take a long time to reach planning assistants and advisers. They seem to continue working in the same way. If all of the ducks could be lined up to face the same direction it would be a tremendous achievement. It takes a considerable length of time for some local authorities to implement national policy. Our national policy is, unashamedly, to build more houses but that is not to say we will build houses on every sidewalk or green space available in a county. People must be given a reasonable amount of time to lodge objections and develop plans. I would like to emphasise that there should be a reasonable amount of time and reasonable objections. The balance cannot all go one way. I appeal to national politicians in both Houses to take this on board when they go home to their constituencies.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn wondered why we keep employing the same consultant when a solution is still very elusive. The Senator answered his own question when he said that it was our booming economy that created the housing crisis. I listened to his contribution. He made the point that we are trying to drive people out of the rental market and that this was not acceptable any more. As people will be aware, I have a lot of time for him but I do not think he has read the details of the Bill. If he had he would know that we are not trying to drive people out of the rented residential sector. A person does not have to pay the 2% anti-speculative tax if they sign up to the rented accommodation rules, either the existing ones or the ones that will come on-stream as a result of the commission on the private rental sector.</P>
    <P>I humbly submit that the aim of the 2% anti-speculative tax is to achieve a nil return for the Exchequer. I said this today in the other House and at my party's meeting yesterday. We will know we have been successful when we get no money from this tax. Its aim is to discourage speculative activities. The economic theory behind Bacon is to concentrate on the first time buyer to the exclusion of everybody else. The ultimate success of the 2% tax will be if we receive no returns from it at all. I want to emphasise that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn seemed to be under the impression that people should not be entering the rental sector anymore. That is not the purpose of <Col N="1823" /> this tax. People who comply with the rental rules and the new rules brought into play as a result of the commission on the rental sector, will not have to pay this tax at all. The Senator is correct in that Ireland is unique because the developed rented residential business has never taken off here, although people who come to live in any part of Dublin as students or otherwise use rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In other countries it is done in a far more professional way. As Senator Quinn pointed out, people rent for 20 or 25 years and never think of buying their own home. It is uniquely Irish to think that one must own one's own property and it goes back to the years when Ireland was colonised. Irish people want their own patch of ground. We are all like that. One does not have to come from the country to feel like that. Senator Quinn said he could not get over the fact that the person to whom he referred has been renting for 20 years and that he would never think of doing that, with the waste of money involved.</P>
    <P>Continental Europeans do not think like that, neither do people in the United States. It is part of a business. We lack that type of developed rented sector. The commission will try to examine that. The Senator may not have read that section of the Bill or perhaps he took it up incorrectly. It is not intended to discourage people in the rental sector. We want to encourage more people into the rental sector but under the new rules of tenure, etc., which are to be brought into effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail made his maiden speech today. He had the misfortune in a past existence to run in three general elections with me in County Kildare in 1987, 1989 and 1992. County Kildare was divided in 1997 and he stood in Kildare South. I take this opportunity to wish him a long and successful career in national politics.</P>

      <P>My friend and his colleague, Senator Dardis, will attest that he is an excellent county councillor and public representative. I have said that many times behind his back rather than to his face. He certainly will have a long career.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Fearghail referred to the growth in voluntary housing associations and the need to encourage this growth or to remove certain impediments. He lobbied me on this matter even before he became a Senator. We have examined what he is trying to achieve and I know of his record in County Kildare in getting this idea off the ground where it has been very successful. The County Kildare experience has been more successful than that in most other counties and he has been involved in it. He has pointed out to me some of the impediments he has noticed and we will try to address them. We discussed this some time ago with the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We will see what we can do in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1824" /> He also referred to the shortages of expertise in the planning system and the delays arising. The Government programme, Action on Housing, a document which Senator Bonner had, tries to address these issues in so far as we can. There are proposals to increase the number of planning assistants to bring more planning expertise from abroad. In the past year, I have acceded to requests from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, for more planning staff for local authorities. Some authorities went about acquiring them. As Senator Ó Fearghail would know, I gave him the go ahead to take on these people and by the time they did so, the staff there had already gone to private industry as well.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the economy is too strong. I have nearly come to the conclusion that we need a small recession for a short period but nobody is advocating that either. In the planning sector countrywide, planning experts are leaving to go to the private sector, more applications are being received and not enough experts are there to deal with them when they come in. That presents a problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail mentioned various matters relating to social housing. The terms of reference for the recent Bacon report did not require examination of social housing. However, the Government carried out a review of social housing measures and improvements to the social housing programme detailed in the Government's document, Action on Housing. They include, for example, improvements in increases in eligibility limits for the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes and the doubling of the mortgage allowance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Fearghail also referred to an efficiency audit in local authority areas. The planning Bill will address a number of issues which will improve the planning process. Delays arise in the planning process, as all Senators know who are members of local authorities. Anybody who has represented Kildare for any number of years could give tutorials to everyone else in the country on planning matters, such as when one looks for additional information, etc., and all these matters in which we are experts.</P>
    <P>I referred to the Commission on the Private Rented Sector which is addressing these various issues and we expect to receive the report quite soon. A number of Senators referred to the danger of the anti-speculative tax leading to increases in rent. I tried to explain the purpose of the anti-speculative tax earlier. The emphasis is on trying to give a person a chance to reach the first rung of the property ladder. Regarding the appointment of Peter Bacon and Associates, Dr. Bacon was reappointed to carry out the study on the basis of his extensive knowledge and expertise which he built up in this area and his perceptive analyses of the situation. The quality of his reports testify to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> Senator O'Meara likened the Government to a blind person when it comes to housing policy and compared me to a little boy with his finger in the dyke. I have been compared to many things in my past 20 odd years in politics, including in the recent past, but that is a new one. Perhaps she meant an arrogant little boy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave that subject for the moment. What we have done for the Bacon reports every time is not stop-go. We have incorporated what Dr. Bacon has said. We have done all he has recommended and more. Very little of it has related to the tax side. We had two Finance Bills as a result of Dr. Bacon's report in 1998 and now, but most of it has been on the supply side because he has rightly pointed out that the supply side is the important part of it, which I have always said. I would like to think it is part of a thought out policy.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner has reminded me on a number of occasions of the problems of south-west Donegal. He referred to the problems in rural areas being different from those in urban areas, and so they are. I have to confess it is hard to see that what is happening in west Donegal relates much to what is happening in the building industry in Dublin. However, the economic analysis of Bacon draws a connection, to which other economists would attest, between building in different parts of the country. If Dublin is the only place booming it will draw all the building labourers. The blockies and chippies gravitate there because that is where is the boom is and where they will make their money. The purpose of Bacon is to try to address this in a global way.</P>
      <P>I have exempted many items in the Bill from the 2% anti-speculative tax. Senator Bonner is very interested in the rural renewal scheme which I brought in three years ago for the Shannon basin. I am delighted to report what I hear from my political friends and opponents alike. My political opponents of that area were a little concerned that anything might happen to me in the recent past because even they have come out to praise me as being the greatest thing that ever happened in their region. However, as I said to Senator Bonner, I took the initiative against all type of advice given to me and my predecessors never to have a scheme like that. I said we would let it run for a period and then we would consider it for other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I do not think I have anything further to say. I may have missed some of the points made by the Senators but I thank them for their contributions.</P>

      <P>When the Minister last introduced a second Finance Bill in 1998 he succeeded through some measures to curtail price increases <Col N="1827" /> in housing. However, due to the economic growth, for which he is almost totally responsible, and other matters, such as the reduction in interest rates and the increase in population, particularly due to people taking up residence in the State, there are more demands on the housing sector. I hope this legislation will fulfil the Minister's intention because it is aimed at young people and our own families. We shudder to think what might happen in the future if speculation in the housing market continues. Everybody wants their own home but they may be priced out of the market. Therefore, I hope the Minister succeeds.</P>

I also thank the staff of the Department for Finance and the Revenue Com<Col N="1828" /> missioners for bringing the Bill before the House. The second Finance Bills of 1998 and 2000 were prepared in the shortest time and that involved people working between 16 and 20 hours per day. I am aware of two Revenue officials who delayed their holidays to produce this Bill. We do not point out often enough how the nation should be grateful for such public service. We take it for granted and I thank officials in my Department, particularly those in Revenue, for their work. I am sure the families of those who delayed their holidays are delighted the Government is introducing this Bill but they had to suffer.</P>
