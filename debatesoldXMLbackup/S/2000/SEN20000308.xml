      <P>The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service has completed its consideration of the proposal to approve draft regulations entitled Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations, 2000.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has completed its consideration of the terms of the memorandum of understanding for a framework of co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the State of Israel in the field of industrial, scientific and technological development, copies of which were laid before Seanad Éireann on 28 January 2000.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator John Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to favourably consider County Limerick, in particular Newcastle West and Kilmallock, in the proposed decentralisation of Departments.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Health and Children if he is aware of the difficulties, particularly in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, which the new regulations in relation to crèche and pre-school facilities, some of which are leading to closures, are causing the owners of such businesses and parents of children attending these facilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify if the Office of Public Works intends to vacate its depot at the Military Barracks, Sum<Col N="838" /> merhill, Nenagh, and if so, to outline the reasons and when it will take place.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quill of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to address the issue of the future preservation and protection by the State of the 700 acre Mount Congreve Estate, Waterford, which has one of the world's larger and more important collection of rare trees and shrubs.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Caffrey of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to prepare and submit to the EU a case for a public service obligation subvention for the Knock-Dublin route, in view of the importance of Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Taylor-Quinn of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to arrange to have a section of a Department decentralised to Kilrush, County Clare.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Cregan and Cosgrave and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 20, motion 10. No. 2, motion re Freedom of Information Act, 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations, 2000, shall be taken without debate. On No. 3, National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill, 1999 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>], Report and Final Stages shall be taken today. No. 4, resumed statements on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht, shall be taken at the conclusion of No. 3. No. 20, motion 10 shall be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable. Regarding No. 2, the Freedom of Information Act, I raised this issue before and the Leader inadvertently did not come back to me on it. I made the point that the freedom of information legislation needs to be reviewed and that, while it operates beneficially in many ways, it also creates practical problems for a great number of people and has generated a new industry. While approving the principle, we should have a detailed review of how it has operated.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate the legislation he proposes to introduce between now and the end of this session on 20 April, and especially if any new Bills will be initiated in the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will he invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to discuss two serious issues with Members? One is the plans for digi<Col N="839" /> talisation and the future of RTÉ in that. There is confusion surrounding the matter and we would like to have that dispelled. The other is the future of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the circumstances surrounding the resignation of the chairman of CIE and the controversy which has ensued. We take this matter so seriously we are prepared to have the debate at any time today, including before or after but not during bath time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take the Freedom of Information Act draft regulations today without discussion. I wish I had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Leader because part of it deals with complaints, particularly in relation to equality. I do not approve of the draft regulations.</P>
      <P>I asked the Leader three weeks ago for a debate on transport. I indicated then that I had raised the matter with the Minister for Public Enterprise and that she was content to come into the House to explain the industrial relations issues and the other issues which have now come to a head. I am sorry that debate did not take place in time, although the Leader gave an undertaking that he would facilitate it. I support Senator Manning's view that it is important for this debate to take place now.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's position on the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999? We could all rest easy if it amended it or took it off the Order Paper. We are entitled to know what is happening.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to indicate when the National Minimum Wage Bill will be taken in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members have spoken about the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill, 1999, which is important given the speed at which the telecommunications industry is moving. We must ensure that a proper infrastructure is provided so that Ireland is at the cutting edge of this new industry. Perhaps the Leader will indicate when that legislation will be taken in the House.</P>
      <P>As regards the Freedom of Information Act draft regulations, we had discussed the possibility of information being given to us prior to the draft regulations being taken in the House without debate so that we would have some knowledge of their content. As other Senators have said, a review is required in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. It would be good if an explanatory memorandum was circulated to all Senators in advance.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole about the resignation of the chairman of CIE. We are owed an explanation by the Minister for Public Enterprise. She should come into the House for a wide-ranging debate and not just on this issue. Three chairmen have left in a number of months. That is careless if that is all that is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been ample discussion on the issue in the other House but there has been no discussion here. The Minister should come into the House to discuss the direction she is taking in the semi-State sector.</P>
      <P>Will the amendment to the Health Act, which the Minister for Health and Children spoke about yesterday, be taken in the House? Members on all sides of the House have called for a debate on the tobacco industry. As today is Ash Wednesday, I ask the Leader to arrange for such a debate, particularly in light of the allegations in the report the Minister published yesterday that the tobacco industry is targeting children. Will the proposal made in the report that the health budget be dealt with in the context of the tobacco industry making a contribution be taken up?</P>

      <P>Last week I asked the Deputy Leader if he would arrange for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come before the House to discuss the issue of litter pollution. I pointed out that this is the most visible of the various forms of pollution. The media has focused closely on litter in the intervening week and there is ample evidence to suggest that instead of getting better the situation is getting worse. A country like Ireland which is so dependent on the tourism and food industries for its economic survival can ill afford to take such a cavalier approach to litter. I request that the Minister come before the House to demonstrate that he and the Government are serious &ndash; if indeed they are &ndash; about tackling this problem and indicate what new initiatives will be put in place to enable this matter to dealt with successfully.</P>

      <P>Today is International Women's Day and we are celebrating the considerable advances made by women. We will be debating this matter further at Private Members' time on the motion tabled by Senator Norris. I take this opportunity to request that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss constructive ways of dealing with the increasing level of violence against women. That aspect is the dark side of the issues which affect women.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quill that a debate is needed on innovative ways to eliminate litter pollution. It is extraordinary, for example, that Limerick County Council employs only two litter wardens to deal with the entire county. Funding and resources are needed to aid the battle against this ongoing problem.</P>

      <P>Given that this is the European year of the tree and that the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, successfully negotiated an improvement in grants with the European Union last week, will the Leader arrange for a debate on tree planting in Ireland? Will he invite the Minister to come before the House to discuss the matter, particularly in view of the fact that tree planting is seen as an alternative form of activity on farms and as being beneficial for the economy and the environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request for a debate on the resignation of the chairman of CIE because I would welcome the opportunity to strongly support the Minister. If we do have such a debate I hope that it will be conducted in a dignified manner and that we will be spared the kind of remarks made by Deputy Yates about people dropping towels, etc. That does not add to the dignity of politics, a discussion about transport or the resignation of a chairman.</P>

      <P>With regard to this evening's Private Members' time, I take this opportunity to ask the Leader to see if it would be possible to encourage the Government to withdraw its amendment. It is appropriate to raise this point on the Order of Business because it is International Women's Day. All the motion does is urge the Government to take certain action. I am prepared to amend it to say that &ldquo;Seanad Éireann urges the Government to consider the establishment of a national paid holiday&rdquo;. The Government's amendment is so bland that it is utterly limp and useless. It notes the fact that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Members who requested a debate on the problem of litter. Every time one goes into a newsagent's shop or supermarket the staff try to force plastic bags on <Col N="842" /> one. If one buys a newspaper they try to put it in a bag.</P>

      <P>We should discuss this matter. The only way to eliminate this problem is to substantially increase the fines.</P>
      <P>The journalist John Pilger presented a programme on Channel 4 on the situation in Iraq where 4,000 children are dying every month because of a lack of medicines resulting from a UN embargo. The UN's agencies, such as UNICEF, the WHO and others have accused the US and Britain of directly preventing the delivery of food and medicines resulting in the deaths of 4,000 children per month. It is very important that we debate this issue at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>It is time we took note of this situation where 4,000 children are dying per month because of the actions of two members of the UN Security Council.

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the fact that the State is paying in excess of £3,000 a week for what are now called &ldquo;out of control children&rdquo;? As a member of a health board I can inform the House that this problem was signalled at least five years ago. We are exporting our problems once again because the Department of Health and Children has not taken on board the need for an intensive service to deal with this section of the community.</P>

      <P>On International Women's Day will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to give special attention to the plight of female home help workers who are employed by health boards on very low hourly rates of pay? <Col N="843" /> We should not wait until the minimum wage legislation comes into force to deal with this issue but we should take action this year as a major gesture to this group of women and carers.</P>
      <P>When will the House take Committee Stage of the Shannon River Council Bill? I support Senator Lanigan's call for a debate on the disgraceful situation in Iraq. Senator Lanigan should raise this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and we as a nation should distance ourselves from British and US actions in this matter.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I am not going to debate the matter but this is a very serious issue. Many serious issues have been raised by Senators on the Order of Business but children in Iraq are dying as we speak mainly because of the interests of big powers, particularly those of the US and the UK. The UN Security Council made this decision and Ireland is seeking membership of the council. Countries across the world have supported Ireland&mdash;</P>

I do not wish to monopolise time and I am grateful to you for the latitude you have shown. However, I am very angry about this situation. John Pilger is a journalist of international repute. He was the first person to highlight the situation in East Timor, before it was on any other agenda. He has now highlighted the situation in Iraq and the world should wake up. I ask the Leader of the House to request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs come into the House at the earliest possible time following St. Patrick's Day so we can find out Ireland's current position.</P>

      <P>Before Christmas the Mental Health Bill was published. It was very welcome because it has been sought for 20 years. It is not, however, making much progress in the Dáil. Changes to procedures for involuntary admission <Col N="844" /> to mental hospitals are an important aspect of the Bill. Recently there have been some tragic episodes involving fatalities which might not have occurred had the procedures for involuntary admissions been different. Would it be possible for the new Minister for Health and Children to introduce this Bill in the Seanad first? This House has more time to debate such matters and it could then be passed as rapidly as possible. The legislation is badly needed.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader find time for a broadly based debate on education? A target was set for 90 per cent of students to remain in second level education until the leaving certificate. I was not happy with that figure at the time but, according to the figures published last week, only 80 per cent are reaching that standard. Furthermore, the recent White Paper on adult education shows that when people have been failed by the education system, they should be given a second chance. There is an urgent need for a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must come to the House so we can encourage him to put the de Buitléar report <Col N="845" /> on third level education into the nearest bin. It contains a narrow, defeatist attitude that I thought we had put behind us. I would hate to think that it might gain credence by not being debated.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry's remarks on the Mental Health Bill and involuntary admissions. Those of us who work in the area know the importance of provision for such admissions. I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on drug abuse. The actions of the Minister for Health and Children in relation to smoking cigarettes are worthy of note. It is important to have this debate, having gone through with other Members of this House the preparation of a paper on cigarette smoking and recognising that tobacco companies will deny that tobacco smoking is addictive and will say that all the way to hell and back.</P>
      <P>A debate on the resignation of the chairman of CIE would be another opportunity for the Minister to demonstrate how much she has done in this area and it will also be an opportunity to point out the policy of abandonment of the rail service by the Opposition parties in the mid-80s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning to have a debate on the recent resignation of the chairman of CIE and I ask that the issue of safety generally be a part of that debate, in particular the recent report of the IRMS on rail safety. I ask in that context that the Health and Safety Authority be appointed as an independent safety regulator for all transport in this country &ndash; land, sea and air.</P>
      <P>I support the call to have the Mental Health Bill debated in view of the fact that there is a totally inadequate number of consultants in the service. There should be many more consultants in the mental health services. In the criticism of the mental hospitals by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, the Louth-Meath service was singled out for attention, as was the need for more consultant involvement in decision making, an increased number of social workers and psychologists to deal with the mental health problems of the community, and the fact that our mental health services have the Cinderella role among all expenditure areas and are disgracefully underfunded.</P>

      <P>The best way of celebrating International Women's Day would be to combine the wishes of the Government and the Opposition and ask the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to come in and be applauded.

      <P>I deplore the suggestion that we should have a debate on the resignation of the head of CIE because that would be further inter<Col N="846" /> ference by the Opposition in the affairs of CIE. One cannot have it both ways in CIE. CIE has its problems because it is a &ldquo;State enterprise&rdquo;, if that is not a contradiction. If it is in the State sector the Minister will always intervene, whether one likes it or not, because she is the single shareholder. If it is floated off into the private sector, that will be a very different matter but to blame the Minister for the resignation of Mr. Brian Joyce is patently absurd. He is acting in a public capacity.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Senator Ross's position on the issue. It is a very serious matter. A very serious report has been published which deserves a debate in this House. Senator Manning has called for that debate and I fully support him. Senator O'Dowd clearly stated 15 months ago the essence of this report and the interference at that time. There is a need to air the full details of that report in this House. I appeal to the Leader to provide time as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning's and Senator O'Toole's call for a debate and a detailed review of the Freedom of Information Act is a very good idea, for which there will be time. Bills coming before the House during the two weeks after the St. Patrick's Day recess are the Finance Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and the Minimum Wage Bill, all of which must be passed by the House and enacted by 1 April.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning called for a debate with the Minister present on the future of the Arts Council, which is a very good idea. I will endeavour to have this debate. Senators Manning, Norris, Costello, Ridge, Glynn, O'Dowd, Ross and Taylor-Quinn expressed their views on the Minister for Public Enterprise coming to the House for a debate on CIE and rail safety. The Minister will be able to come into the House with great pride for such a debate. Deputy O'Rourke is one of the most efficient Ministers in the Cabinet; indeed she is one of the most efficient Ministers we have had for many years. I will endeavour to organise this debate which will also cover the issue of transport, as requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> Senators Costello and O'Toole expressed their concerns about the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill. The Minister for Public Enterprise has ensured that Ireland is a world leader in e-commerce and other aspects of telecommunications. I will inquire again what the Government's policy is in regard to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello called for a debate on the tobacco industry and I will leave time for this. Senators Jackman, Lanigan and Quill called for a debate on litter pollution and I will also leave time for such a debate. Senator Jackman expressed her views on International Women's Day and I will pass those on to the Minister. Senator Callanan called for a debate on tree planting and I will allow time for this.</P>
    <P>Senators Norris and Cox expressed their views about the Private Members' debate this evening and I will discuss this issue and the proposed amendment with Senator Norris following the Order of Business. Senators Lanigan and Mooney called for an urgent debate on Iraq and the serious problems being experienced there and I will arrange for this debate to take place in the first ten days when the House reconvenes after the St. Patrick's Day break.</P>
    <P>I will pass Senator Ridge's views on children who are out of control to the Minister. Senator O'Meara called for an urgent debate on home helps &ndash; legislation in this regard will come before the Seanad the week after the St. Patrick's Day break and that will provide the earliest possible opportunity to discuss this issue.</P>
    <P>I note that one particular Opposition party has hijacked the Shannon River Council Bill, an all-party Bill which was agreed on Second Stage in the House, through placing advertisements in local newspapers. That is not the spirit in which we, on this side of the House, agreed to the Bill. I will consider the position in regard to this Bill and intend to discuss it with the leader of the party in question. A person's word is his or her bond&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following the amendment to the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;, the definition of &ldquo;herd identifier&rdquo; was no longer necessary and it was deleted by amendment No. 3. Under the definition of a &ldquo;mart&rdquo;, there was an incorrect reference to &ldquo;Article&rdquo; in the citing of the Livestock Marts Regulations, 1968. Amendment No. 4 inserted the proper term, &ldquo;Regulation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the making of regulations setting out the time and form of the notification of animal movements and the use of the CMMS database to trace and identify animals. Animals for export had been inadvertently omitted from the scope of the regulations to be made under subsection (4)(<i>b</i>). Amendment No. 5 corrected this omission. Second, amendment No. 6 amended the text of this subsection to ensure that the use of the CMMS database could be enforced prior to the slaughter or export of the animal or animals. The amendments under section 21 were necessary to ensure that <Col N="853" /> important guarantees being provided to buyers of Irish beef can be enforced.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that where a licence or approval is refused or revoked under the list of agricultural and food legislation referred to therein, an approval granted under this Bill is also deemed to be revoked. The right of appeal under this Bill may be waived only in cases where there is already a right of appeal in the legislation referred to. The Government put forward amendment No. 7 to include references to &ldquo;registration&rdquo; and &ldquo;withdraw&rdquo; in subsection (1) in order to reflect the different procedures in operation under the various legislative provisions cited. In addition, amendments Nos. 8 to 11 were made to correct some incomplete references in relation to the legislative provisions listed in this section.</P>
    <P>The legislative provisions cited under subsection (1) are the main instruments for approving the operation and supervision of slaughtering plants, including domestic abattoirs, meat processing plants, livestock plants and feedstuff plants. The purpose of this section is that if an approval is refused or revoked under any of these provisions, it automatically follows that any approval granted under this Bill should also be revoked. The aim is to avoid the need to institute duplicate proceedings to revoke approval under this Bill. However, the right of appeal under the Bill can be waived only where such legislation contains a right of appeal to the courts. This provision is necessary to ensure that the rights of all participants are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 to section 35 was a textual amendment. In the text of the amendment to the Diseases of Animals Act, 1967, there was a reference to &ldquo;his or her&rdquo; which did not reflect the language in use at that time. This was corrected.</P>
    <P>Following the insertion of the collection citation for the Livestock Marts Act, 1967, under section 1, the reference to same which was included initially under section 36 of the Bill was deleted by amendment No. 13. In addition, a small consequential amendment was made to the preceding paragraph of this section.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule lists the rules and regulations applicable to the various classes of persons, listed under the First Schedule, to whom the Act applies. The Government made a series of amendments to the Second Schedule to take account of: (a) legislation which was cited incorrectly or inadvertently omitted in the published Bill; (b) recently enacted legislation; and (c) updated and consolidated legislation. The Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Orders, 1989 and 1996, were cited incorrectly in the published Bill. This was corrected by amendments Nos. 14 and 20.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 21 refers to the Brucellosis in Cattle (General Provisions) Orders, 1991 and 1996. They were cited incorrectly in the published Bill but this was corrected.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 16, 22, 32, 33 and 36, the European Communities (Supply of Information on the Origin, Identification and <Col N="854" /> Destination of Bovine Animals) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 258 of 1999), were included under the relevant parts of the Second Schedule. These regulations oblige keepers of bovine animals to provide the authorities with information on the origin, identification and destination of bovine animals. They provide a statutory basis for the making of notifications to CMMS. They also provide the necessary powers of enforcement and prescribe penalties for offences.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, and 24 to 29, inclusive, relate to the body of legislation applicable in the feedingstuffs sector which was recently updated and consolidated and the new provisions were included in the relevant parts of the Second Schedule.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 34 refer to the European Communities (Trade in Bovine Animals and Swine) (Amendment) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No. 5 of 2000) which were included under the relevant parts of the Second Schedule. These regulations implement the requirement in Council Directive 97/12/EC of 17 March 1997 in so far as it relates to an identity check for bovine animals for export. They further ensure the operation of CMMS in relation to live exports.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 30 refers to the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Abattoirs) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 328 of 1999) which were included in the relevant part of the Second Schedule. These regulations update the definitions of ear-tag and identity card to take account of changes in legislation since 1988. They also provide that all animals accepted for slaughter must have an ear-tag and identity card.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 31 and 35 refer to the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Veterinary Exam ination) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 327 of 1999) which were included in the relevant parts of the Second Schedule. These regulations update the provisions relating to the ante mortem and post mortem veterinary examination of bovine animals to provide that the examination cannot be completed until the identification and current status of the animals has been verified. The regulations also include contamination with salmonella enteriditis or typhimurium among the grounds for condemning meat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House went along with the general discussion on the beef assurance scheme. There was an acceptance that it was needed. However, this matter boils down to specific issues. I raised one issue with the Cathaoirleach and I will now raise it with the Minister of State, that is, the amendment made in the other House last night. The Minister of State said in response to amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government fully realises that rural Ireland is of vital importance to the success of the economy. There are 145,000 registered farmers and in spite of what has been said by the planners and others about what will happen in the years ahead, I would like each and every one of them to remain on the land. I do not <Col N="855" /> want to see any of them being put out of business by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sympathetic to the amendment which has been discussed widely. As it is not my policy or that of the Department to impose hardship on the farming community I support the view that the ideal time to carry out inspections is at the time of the annual TB and brucellosis tests, but this should have the agreement of the farmer concerned. . . . . . .  In the interests of rural Ireland, I am also prepared to concede on the issue of cost.</P>
    <P>Did he say that in the other House last night? Am I reading a fact? Is that what he said? If so, why is that amendment not on the Order Paper? Is he in favour of that measure? Was that not what he said? I wholeheartedly agree with his concept. I agree with the amendment and am very concerned about what happened to it. Will the Minister of State indicate his position?</P>

      <P>Knowing the Minister of State as I do, I expect he will stick to his guns. He is not the kind of man to back down from something he has said, regardless of the views of his officials. I do not know who is interested in not allowing this amendment, but its inclusion is vitally important for the future success of the beef assurance scheme. It was supported by all Members of the other House. I am, therefore, relying on the Minster of State's willingness to stand by the decision made last night and I hope he will accept my concerns.</P>
      <P>Beef can be imported from New Zealand or any other part of the world in the absence of traceability, and that is cause for concern. The beef industry has gone through a difficult period and a beef assurance scheme must be welcomed. I hope it will be good for the industry because many people will benefit from it. I await the Minister of State's response to my concerns and I hope we will be able to agree with his decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment. This legislation is very important for the beef industry. From an image point of view it is important to have a traceability programme from animal to consumer. The outbreak of BSE resulted in the banning of Irish beef in some countries. This dented what had been a successful industry. Thank God BSE is declining and Irish beef is recovering in terms of assurance and consumer confidence. There will always be a few bad apples in every orchard and some farmers behaved disgracefully in introducing BSE to their herds to get easy money. Thank God they have been detected and brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to have a proper traceability programme. It is a new concept for farmers. They <Col N="856" /> will have to tag their cattle from the time they are born and keep proper written records of their sales and purchases. While this will entail more work, it is necessary as part of a programme that will maintain confidence in the beef trade.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes referred to amendments tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil last night which would have made things easier for farmers. I agree that inspections should be held on the same day as TB inspections because everything is important to farmers at that stage. The relevant amendment has not been included, but I would support it.</P>
    <P>Farmers will incur extra costs in implementing the legislation, which will have to be minimised. For example, tags will need to be purchased and vets will, for the first time, have to be paid for routine bovine disease inspections. This is a mistake because tests may not be carried out as frequently, which may lead to increases in bovine TB and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>The amendments tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil are important and clarification is required on whether they have been accepted. The Bill is important for the future of our beef industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the return of the Bill to the House. The desirability of implementing the regulations should not be obstructed by the potential onerous costs they may place on farmers. The Bill was introduced in this House before the summer recess last year and was welcomed by all parties. We are aware of the importance of having a beef assurance system in place in view of the difficulties with BSE and other related matters.</P>
      <P>Given the measures put in place by this and previous Governments to deal with the ban on imported feed and so on, it is very disappointing that the BSE figures are not falling to the desired extent. The measures are not working or are not being fully implemented, or some operators are breaking the law. If reports of court cases are a guide &ndash; I am thinking especially of a recent one &ndash; people are operating at what the IFA has rightly described as a level of sabotage against the agriculture industry. Their actions are bringing the reputation of the food industry into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's responsibility to enact legislation to re-establish the credibility of the beef industry, especially in the minds of consumers. Every bad BSE story is one more nail in the coffin of the industry unless it is countered. This legislation is very important in that regard. I welcomed its introduction and look forward to its implementation. The legislation sets out a detailed and onerous structured system, from certification to approval, involving on the producers side farmers, herd owners and the wider industry. <Col N="857" /> I hope when it is implemented it will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>The importance of the point raised by Senator Tom Hayes is illustrated by the support he has received from Senator Rory Kiely on the other side of the House. What will be the cost to farmers of having to deal with the system of regulation introduced under the Bill and who will pay for it? The Minister's words in the Dáil last night reflect his sentiments that the individual producer will not have to bear the brunt of the cost. There are many small producers throughout the country who, given the state of the beef industry, would not be able to afford the onerous cost of maintaining a certificate of approval. That issue must be clarified before the Bill leaves the House and is placed on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes is correct to point out that it is extremely important not to generate a situation where the regulations of the Bill are undermined, reduced or weakened by the necessity for individual producers to bear an onerous cost. What is the main point at issue? As I stated on Second and Committee Stages, the primary objective of the legislation must be to protect the beef industry and producers and re-establish the credibility of the industry, especially abroad and among consumers. We should not undermine that objective and damage the beef producing sector further. We should operate with support and not with penalties. If we want to see this system operate to its fullest extent, sufficient support must be given and farmers must be reassured that they do not face an onerous cost to obtain and maintain certificates of approval certifying them as excellent producers who operate to the highest standards. Therefore, I am disappointed the Minister of State did not use the opportunity today to table an amendment in this regard.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what he has to say. I appeal to him to respond to the points made on all sides of the House and to listen to the expressed wishes of Members that the legislation would not be undermined or weakened and that individual producers would not be penalised for raising their standards. Will he clarify matters in that regard and assure us that having to comply with this otherwise excellent legislation will not be detrimental to producers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. He, more than anyone, has the capacity, talent and knowledge to steer the Bill through the House. Certain people in sections of the media have portrayed the legislation as another prohibition or liability on farming and another difficult hurdle for farmers to climb. It is the opposite; it is an aid to farmers which guarantees and assures consumers that they have a good quality product. It is part of the traceability system. I compliment the Minister of State and the officials in his Department for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few people engaged in the cattle industry and one or two in the beef industry undermine <Col N="858" /> the good work of the majority of farmers. Some 140,000 farmers are involved in the beef industry, of whom about 80,000 are serious beef farmers who take their work seriously. To suggest that the scheme is an inhibition or difficulty for them is wrong and off the wall. The Bill is designed to ensure that what is produced is maintained as a high quality product to the point where it is delivered to the processor. The Health and Safety Authority under Dr. Patrick Wall is responsible for monitoring standards from there until the product is purchased by consumers. Combining this legislation with that in the health and safety area means we can guarantee that the product we produce under the independent supervision as set out will be of good quality.</P>
    <P>We export 80 per cent to 85 per cent of our beef. The success of the beef industry lies in having its products displayed on supermarket shelves in Europe because it is there they will obtain the best prices. If it is to regain the markets in Europe rather than in the Middle East or Far East or other third countries, it needs to improve breeding and management and to guarantee traceability and high quality to European consumers. To do that, this legislation is essential. Farmers, by and large, welcome the Bill and only a few people are hysterical about it. We export 550,000 tonnes of beef and that should go to Europe because the prices it fetches will ensure a thriving beef industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding the independent appeals board, perhaps the Minister of State might inform us if that is to be decentralised to the regions. I do not know if that can be done on a county level or if it is practicable. However, it is impracticable to locate the appeals board in Dublin. It should be located in areas where cattle populations exist.</P>
    <P>There has been much media hype, all of it wrong, about cattle losing their ear tags. Perhaps we should examine a more sophisticated and expensive system of electronic tagging. We could go that route to avoid difficulties because such tags cannot be interfered with. The ear tags used at present are regularly lost. While the Minister of State might say that a farmer to whom that happens is not seen as a criminal or someone guilty of a criminal act and while the legislation deals with rogue people, I would nonetheless like the Minister of State to spell that out.</P>
    <P>There should not be a cost associated with this scheme. There should be a way of streamlining it. When a vet calls to a farm to carry out TB or brucellosis testing, there is no reason the certification cannot be done at that stage. It would not involve any additional costs. That said, it is not as simple as that. We need to assure consumers that it is the vet who knows the herd who issues the certificate. It is he or she who should do it and it should not involve any additional cost. I know the Minister of State will ensure that because he is a practical man.</P>
    <P>There is no point proclaiming that we produce the best beef in the world, having overcome the BSE scare and the other problems we faced, <Col N="859" /> although there is still market resistance in some places, unless we have a market. The EU Commissioner, Mr. David Byrne, was in Dublin Castle recently where he spoke about product liability directives. Will this legislation and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland dovetail with the product liability directives which the Commissioner is introducing? The Minister said during the debate on this Bill, before David Byrne was appointed, that an Irish Commissioner might be appointed in the near future who would deal with this issue. However, we did not take him up on it. Mr. David Byrne has an extremely important job to assure consumers about the quality of food.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on what he is doing. The task is in capable hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support fully Senator Tom Hayes's comments on the Bill. We accept the need for and the importance of this measure. I am sure the Minister of State will forgive me if I am not <i>au fait</i> with what was said in the other House last night.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about traceability. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the great strides made in County Kerry in this regard and of the &ldquo;Taste of Kerry&rdquo; brand which guarantees traceability. The IFA mentioned the importance of traceability and other matters when it stressed the need to provide assurances and guarantees to consumers about the safety of Irish cattle and beef. It is vital to reassure consumers about the safety and quality of the meat they are eating.</P>
      <P>This Bill should underpin consumer confidence and it should not impose additional bureaucracy, red tape or unnecessary costs on primary producers. However, how can we achieve that when it ignores imported beef products? I was disturbed recently to hear that some unscrupulous people are selling imported beef products from the back of vans to institutions which purchase them in good faith. I am not saying the products are bad but no checks are carried out on them so people, including patients, do not know what they are eating or the risks to which they are being exposed. I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton tabled an amendment in the other House which stated, &ldquo;Any such inspection or checking in respect of farms shall be carried out at the same time as the annual TB and Brucellosis tests and at no extra cost to the herdowner.&rdquo;  That is important in view of the Minister of State's remarks and Senator Tom Hayes's comments on section 10 which deals with the granting of the certificate of approval to the farmer. I agree with the thrust of the Minister of State's remarks about enhancing the position of Irish agriculture and saving farmers. If we want to save farmers, we cannot impose additional costs on them willy-nilly. However, there is a way of doing it which will not cause any difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little bird told me the Minister of State <Col N="860" /> accepted some amendments last night. Did he accept amendments at the behest of my good friend and constituency colleague, the redoubtable Deputy Healy-Rae? Perhaps the Minister of State could outline what he has done. Did he listen to representations from his own party as well as from this side of the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill must be welcomed as a further example of the Government's commitment to assure consumers at home and abroad of the quality of Irish food produce. The consumer decides the price the farmer or producer receives for their product. If the housewife is confident that a product is of top quality, she will buy it.</P>
      <P>The beef industry has suffered great difficulties in recent years. Following the BSE scare, prices dropped sharply which resulted in massive loss for many farmers. With production accounting for almost 3 per cent of GNP and 130,000 farmers involved in beef production, we must maintain a strong and vibrant industry. We can only do so by ensuring the consumer that our beef is of top quality and safe to eat.</P>
      <P>The details of this scheme have been agreed by all involved in its introduction, including farmers, abattoirs, meat plants, marts and the animal feedstuffs trade. I compliment the Minister of State for ensuring this support. In the past schemes were introduced without discussion and agreement and were often unworkable.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill are basic and include common standards for the trade, production and processing of Irish cattle and beef for human consumption, the trade and manufacture of feedstuffs, the application of these standards through a system of registration, inspection and approval and the enhancement of an animal identification and traceability system for Irish cattle. The introduction of this scheme will mean that everyone involved will incur additional expenses. I hope that the Minister and the Department will foot the bill for these extra costs and I urge the inspectors involved to operate a common sense approach in all cases. The tracing of animals is a major task but it is progressing well and I hope it will progress in the simplest possible form. The last thing farmers or small producers want is to spend extra time doing paperwork.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his endeavours. In my opinion this is one of the most important items of legislation to go through the House for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to efforts to resolve the confusion which appears to have arisen in respect of an amendment to the Bill which was tabled in the other House yesterday evening. For the benefit of the House, I wish to cite the proceedings of the Dáil in respect of the following amendment which was tabled in the name of Deputy Connaughton:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 10, line 40, after &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo;  to insert &ldquo;Any such inspection or checking in <Col N="861" /> respect of farms shall be carried out at the same time as the annual TB and Brucellosis tests and at no extra cost to the herdowner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The intention of the amendment is clear. It seeks, in order to ensure that a farmer can proceed to farm for at least a further year, that the inspection be carried out at a time when the veterinarian has access to all of the farmer's animals in one place. The law provides that all animals must be presented for annual testing and each herdowner is legally bound to present all his or her animals, as far as is possible, in one location. At that stage, the vet will have sight of the farmer's cattle holding facilities, etc. That is the very clear intention of this reasonable amendment which was tabled in the other House yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>A good debate, to which several Deputies contributed, took place in respect of the amendment to which I refer. Deputy Upton supported the amendment on behalf of the Labour Party. Deputy Johnny Brady also clearly supported it&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as did Deputy Ring. Deputy Collins was quite confused when speaking on the amendment but Deputy Naughten fully supported it. Senator Tom Hayes has already quoted the Minister of State's reply to the amendment but, for the benefit of the House and for the benefit of clarity, it is important to read the final contributions of the relevant Members. The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, said:</P>
      <P>The Government fully realises that rural Ireland is of vital importance to the success of the economy. There are 145,000 registered farmers and in spite of what has been said by the planners and others about what will happen in the years ahead, I would like each and every one of them to remain on the land. [Fine sentiments indeed]. I do not want to see any of them being put out of business by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the amendment which has been discussed widely. As it is not my policy or that of the Department to impose hardship on the farming community I support the view that the ideal time to carry out inspections is at the time of the annual TB and brucellosis tests, but this should have the agreement of the farmer concerned. There should be flexibility if possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton then inquired about the cost and the Minister of State replied, &ldquo;In the interests of rural Ireland, I am also prepared to concede on the issue of cost.&rdquo;  At that point Deputy Connaughton thanked the Minister of State and, assuming that his suggestion would be accommodated, the amendment was withdrawn by leave of the House.</P>

      <P>I am as familiar as Senator Connor with <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i> I ask him to return to the debate on the official list of amendments. Both he and Senator Hayes have adequately rehearsed the debate which took place on Deputy Connaughton's amendment in the Lower House. Like the Cathaoirleach earlier, I have explained the position and I ask the Senator to abide by the Chair's rulings. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the concerns of Senators Connor and Hayes and he may reply to them in his concluding remarks.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 2 of the Bill and amendment No. 2 thereto, the Minister of State indicated that the definition of farmer was amended to distinguish more clearly between farmers and dealers for the purposes of the Bill. Will he explain how this distinction is drawn? Will he read into the record the text of the new section 2 and also the full explanatory memorandum given to him by his officials in that regard?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that, on section 3, following the amendment to the definition of &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;, the definition of &ldquo;herd identifier&rdquo; was no longer necessary and it was deleted by amendment No. 3. Will he read into the record the text of the new section 3 and the explanatory memorandum in respect of it?</P>
      <P>Section 32 deals with the revoking of licences and the appeals system. I wish to refer to a crucial comment made by the Minister of State, namely, &ldquo;The right of appeal under this Bill may be waived only in cases where there is already a right of appeal in the legislation referred to.&rdquo;  Will the Minister of State fully explain that statement? I do not doubt that he will have a copious note on it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill. As a beef producer I have to state that we need to reassure consumers about the quality of Irish beef. However, it is a pity that beef imported into Ireland does not carry the same assurances for consumers as Irish beef. There are no assurances about the method of slaughter or health of animals imported from Argentina, for example, issues which are provided for as regards Irish beef. If we are to have a level playing field for producers and protect consumers it is necessary that a system of assurances should apply to imported beef. Government Senators will agree that we should not allow beef on to the Irish market which does not carry the same level of assurances which this Bill gives as regards domestically produced beef.</P>
      <P>Farmers are enduring an ever-burgeoning level of red tape with respect to the running of their businesses. This is unfair and bewildering to most farmers who are of an age when such procedures were not part of their tradition or experiences. The Minister of State and the Department are doing nothing to ease this problem, and, in fact, are making matters more difficult.</P>

      <P>Some of the documentation concerning the keeping of livestock is difficult and confusing, yet the Minister of State maintains a system of disproportionate penalties against farmers. In some cases a large portion of a farmer's supports can be withdrawn due to simple mistakes made without any intention to infringe regulations, let alone to defraud. Surely this is a disproportionate response by the Department. It may claim that these are EU regulations but that is not so. The regulations were made by the Department.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State examine this problem as thousands of farmers have lost all or part of their income supports, whether beef premia, suckler cow, cattle or sheep headage or whatever, as a result of small technical errors in documentation returned to the Department? I am delighted that the Minister of State is nodding. He is a farmer, he knows about this situation, and has practical experience of hundreds of people coming to him from all over the country. I cannot understand why this problem cannot be tackled as it is doing a grave injustice to many people who, for genuine reasons, find themselves at the wrong end of this administrative malaise, and I use the word &ldquo;malaise&rdquo; advisedly. I appeal to the Minister of State to look at this issue even though it may not be germane to the amendments we are debating.</P>
      <P>I reiterate my comments on the amendment which everyone felt was made in good faith last night in the Dáil and which is germane to this debate. If the Minister of State does not answer any of the other questions I raised I hope he will address the issue of amendment No. 7 made in the Dáil yesterday.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister of State will respond and I am pleading with him to do so positively. No one understands the difficulties faced by farmers more than the Minister of State and his fellow Ministers.</P>
      <P>These amendments are a response to a situation which developed over the past few years whereby the farming community, through little fault of its own but due to a few individuals who undermine the industry, is faced with complications which are outside the control of farmers but which have severely interfered with their livelihoods. This legislation and these amendments seek to ensure that the international view of Irish beef is that it is top class. The legislation will bring a transparency to the beef industry which will ensure traceability from the day a calf is born to the day it appears on a consumer's shopping list. This is an important measure which has not existed to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there have been many statements that we have the finest beef produce. However, this should not just be a matter of opinion but must be transparently obvious through legislation and regulation. In the past year we have introduced legislation which means <Col N="866" /> that we can now stand over Irish beef in Europe and say it is of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is doing an excellent job. This Bill is the final piece in the jigsaw. In the interests of those farmers who want to stay on the land, the beef industry and our reputation abroad, we ask the Minister to consider our remarks in the final legislation. The farming community has always had confidence in the policies put forward by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture over the years. It is fortunate that this House was able to straighten out the matter after what happened in the Dáil last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This legislation is vital for farmers and it will be a major plus in the production and marketing of Irish beef. It is urgent that more of our beef enters the European market. Some progress has been made in regaining market share but more needs to be done. This Bill will help secure further entrance to the EU market and reduce our dependence on volatile third country markets.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department must deal firmly with the media when announcements are made about the quality of Irish beef. Pictures of a BSE infected cow staggering around the yard are shown internationally, but that image is out of date. The Department tackled the problem. Why are green pastures and feed lots full of quality beef cattle not shown?</P>
      <P>I recognise the importance of cattle identification as a key element for traceability. There is, however, a perception among farmers that the loss rate of ear tags is excessive. It can be as high as one in ten. Something must be done to improve the quality of ear tags.</P>
      <P>The certificate of approval should be issued following the annual TB inspection. It may not even be necessary for the inspection to take place on an annual basis &ndash; every three years would be often enough. The certificate could then be issued and random testing of 20 per cent of herds carried out annually. That would ensure that nothing would go wrong. I agree with the Minister about payment for the certificate &ndash; the State should pay for it. Farmers face severe enough financial difficulties without having to pay for their annual herd tests.</P>

      <P>Costs and traceability have been mentioned by many speakers. At the meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, those who spoke were of the opinion that additional costs should not be borne by farmers. I speak for the small farmers of west County Limerick who would be faced with additional costs and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Government takes up those costs. That is of paramount importance to all farmers.</P>
      <P>The farm inspection should take place at the same time as the TB test for logistic reasons. There are many elderly farmers who find it difficult to round up their cattle. I appeal to the Minister to make the changes which were discussed at the meeting of the parliamentary party.</P>

      <P>I compliment all who spoke on the Bill. A total of ten Senators made contributions which is exceptionally high on Report Stage. It is very important legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor referred to the definition of a farmer. It is quite clear that the definition of a farmer was amended to distinguish more clearly between farmers and dealers for the purposes of the Bill. A dealer and a farmer are different because they have different objectives. The other issue raised was on section 32. I have already given a full explanation of the amendment of section 32 and I will read it again in case the Senator has any doubt.</P>
      <P>Section 32 provides that where a licence or approval is refused or revoked under the list of agricultural and food legislation referred to therein, an approval granted under this Bill is also deemed to be revoked. The right of appeal under this Bill may be waived only in cases where there is already a right of appeal in the legislation referred to. I hope that clarifies the position for the Senator.</P>

      <P>Much has been said in both Houses of the Oireachtas. The passing by the Seanad of this Stage of the Bill will bring to an <Col N="868" /> end an extensive period of consultation, drafting and debate on this important legislation. The National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill was introduced against the background of increased consumer awareness of the risks of disease and contamination and the need for high standards of production and processing throughout the food chain. It was also a direct response to the particular problems experienced in the beef sector following the BSE crisis, namely the need to reassure consumers that Irish beef is safe and wholesome to eat. This Bill fulfils a commitment in Partnership 2000 to develop a National Beef Assurance Scheme in consultation with interested parties.</P>
      <P>This Bill, which will place the scheme on a statutory footing, is a landmark piece of legislation and will be the first of its kind to be introduced within the EU. The legislation will provide additional guarantees regarding the safety of Irish beef and cattle and it will be a very important tool in the marketing of our product both within the EU and in third countries. Furthermore, it clearly underlines Ireland's commitment to adopting a responsible attitude to food production and food safety.</P>
      <P>The main elements of the scheme are the enhancement of the animal identification and tracing system and the development of common standards of production and processing. The traceability aspect of the scheme is already being implemented. A comprehensive framework is in place for the collection of data on animal movements through links established at marts, meat plants and export points and the use of a paper notification system at other locations. This information, together with other data already available relating to births, certain disease tests and other events in the animal's life, will provide a comprehensive life history of cattle from birth to slaughter. The emphasis will now be on fine-tuning this system and monitoring the comprehensiveness and reliability of the data being collected. As well as providing assurances regarding safety, it is intended in due course to expand the utilisation of this very valuable databank. Already the information is being used to assist in the establishment of entitlement for the slaughter premium and other applications will be possible in the future.</P>
      <P>Following the enactment of the legislation, the procedures for the inspection and approval of the various participants will be drawn up. These procedures will be effected through negotiation and agreement with the social partners, which is the normal practice in such matters. It is not the intention to impose expensive and bureaucratic arrangements on participants and there will be ample opportunity over the coming months to arrive at sensible yet credible systems of inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many good points have been made by Members on both sides of the House in an exceptional debate of a high standard in terms of the Bill's importance. Senator Tom Hayes referred to <Col N="869" /> a number of issues, to which I will return. Senators Rory Kiely, Kathleen O'Meara and Peter Callanan referred to an appeals procedure on a more regional basis. I accept there will be an appeals procedure put in place, to which a commitment has been given. It will be examined. I sympathise and regret that there is hardship in this area. I am aware of this, which many Members understand, and much has been said about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan mentioned electronic tagging. He is a very modern and mechanically minded Senator but we are a long way from that system yet. Certainly we could have it on the day of the test, which we will discuss.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about the sale of meat from vans. Inspections are taking place which are the responsibility of the various local authorities and health boards under the Food Safety Authority. I would be appalled and shocked if anything irregular was happening because we are very conscious of food safety, whether imported or exported food. Senator Francis O'Brien made a very valuable contribution and Senator Connor made a point about importing beef which was more or less the same as Senator Coghlan's point.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Finneran referred to what happened in the other House and rightly so. Senator Pat Moylan and Senator John Cregan spoke about the cost and the delay. I gave a commitment in Dáil Éireann last night on the certificate and on the payment. I stand over what I said and I would not be a true politician if I did not. It was not my fault if it was not accepted by the Opposition.</P>

      <P>On inspections and costs, I was always in favour of the farm inspection taking place at the time of the animal health test to minimise any additional costs that might arise.

      <P>Only participants meeting the required standards will be allowed to produce cattle and beef. The standards in question are already contained for the most part in existing legislation and the Bill will tighten up their enforcement for the benefit of both consumers and producers. Producers and processors who are complying with the law, and the vast majority are, have nothing to fear and everything to gain from the scheme. I refute strongly the recent articles in the press stating that this legislation will be used to pursue farmers for minor infringements of existing provisions such as the loss of ear-tags. The loss of ear-tags is not an offence under the Bill. The procedures for dealing with such matters are already contained in existing legislation and the Bill does not alter this position. The maximum penalties provided for under the Bill are intended for the very small percentage of persons who commit serious offences such as the alteration or falsification of animal identification and whose actions put the reputation of all Irish beef at risk. All Members will agree that such illegal activities need to be dealt with very firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much concern has been expressed regarding the position of food businesses under the Bill. The position is that these businesses are already comprehensively regulated under existing food hygiene legislation administered by the health boards which, like the Department, are agents of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. However, the Bill contains special provisions which are applicable to food businesses. These provisions will complement and extend the existing codes by <Col N="871" /> regulating the source of supply of Irish product to such businesses. Thus the combination of the Bill and existing regulations will provide the necessary reassurances to consumers across the entire food chain. In addition, the new national scheme will provide the framework for butchers and exporters to promote Irish beef to best advantage.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns raised by Members on imported beef. I do not believe that the National Beef Assurance Scheme Bill is the correct vehicle through which to address these concerns. However, I am prepared to give further thought to ways of improving transparency in relation to imported product.</P>
    <P>The national beef assurance scheme is a very broadly based and comprehensive scheme. It is not the panacea for all the challenges facing the beef sector, many of which were highlighted during the debate on the Bill, including the production of better quality cattle and a graded price system. These challenges are being addressed under other initiatives and in other fora. The Bill addresses the very specific issue of ensuring that beef production is based on the highest standards of food safety and hygiene, a prerequisite for increasing the market share of Irish beef, including the successful penetration of valuable European markets. Together with other initiatives being adopted, the Bill will help to ensure that the sector can develop to its full potential. The ultimate success of the scheme will depend on the goodwill and co-operation of the various players in the sector and I call on all parties to ensure this co-operation will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The early enactment of this Bill has been one of my particular goals. The Bill was first introduced in this House last July and I am pleased that the lengthy process of passing it into law is now nearing completion. I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for their positive and constructive approach during these proceedings. The Bill has been enhanced and strengthened as a result of the amendments made in the course of the debate on the Bill. I thank my officials who have worked very hard on the production of this legislation. I also thank the staff in the parliamentary draftsman's office for their invaluable assistance and unfailing patience throughout this process. Again, I thank Members of both Houses for their contributions and I look forward to the early enactment of this historic legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill received its first reading in the Seanad and is now nearing completion. It will be a very valuable piece of legislation and I want to allay any fears Members may have that it will cause hardship for farmers. The Bill will assist farmers and result in the betterment of the Irish food industry which is of such value to our economy. The food industry is a major growth area and we must ensure we are up-front in terms of safety and hygiene. If we do not produce safe food, we will not find a market for our products.</P>

      <P>Once again it is Seachtain na Gaeilge and this is another of the many debates on this matter to which I have listened &ndash; an annual token offer of esteem for the language. For the rest of the year, the House bothers little with it.</P>
      <P>What we are doing makes people cynical about the Irish language. I am cynical about what we are doing and I am not very different from the majority of people.</P>
      <P>To restore Irish as the spoken language of the majority of the Irish people has been one of the great national aims since the foundation of the State. During the 78 years that have passed, the language has been made compulsory. It was a precondition for many years for getting a job in the public sector and our examination systems were organised in favour of those who took certain subjects in Irish. Millions of pounds have been thrown at it. There is a fully fledged and heavily subsidised gaeilgeoir industry and there have been large injections of cultural elitism. In many ways, we have made a genuflection to Irish as a defining badge of nationality.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote from a Dáil debate 64 years ago. The speaker was fluent in Irish and had a deep knowledge of Irish literature. However, he refused to use Irish in the House because he knew that for many people of that time the speaking of Irish was invested with a certain hypocrisy. He said:</P>
      <P>I believe we ought to revive the language in this country. I sometimes doubt now whether the thing is possible. I think so much damage has been done in the last three or four years that it is possible that the language is done for and that we will never revive it. Still, however, I believe it is worth trying for, and the only way we can hope to revive the language . . . . . is to make people want the language, and unless you can make them want the language the language is dead. You cannot, however, make the people of this country want anything by forcing it down their throats against their will, and the vast majority of parents in this country do not want their infant children bewildered and bemused . . .  by being addressed in a language they do not understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" />
      <Col N="874" /> This was James Dillon speaking in the Dáil on 24 March 1936. He went on to compare the language movement of ten or 15 years previously, before Independence. What had happened since then, he said:</P>
    <P>. . . has turned what was a hopeful struggle, which had every prospect of success, into a detestable imposition which is making those who ought to be fighting for the language grow to hate it. . . . . . If the Irish language is shattered in our time, no succeeding generation will ever be able to revive it as a living language . . . . It sometimes terrifies me when I realise the amount of ignorance, narrowmindedness and futility . . .  which stands between the country and success in this matter. . . . . . If the Irish language is to be made a political issue . . . . . by any other of the narrowminded pests that afflict this country, it will mean its hopeless and irrevocable destruction. There is only one hope for the language, and that is to make it a common platform on which persons of all points of view can co-operate for a common end. That is not done at the present time. There is no hope of it being done as long as the language is used as a kind of weapon in the hands of [different groups].</P>
    <P>Seventy-eight years later we have not progressed much further. Leaving aside the merits of Irish, and there are many great merits, the national policy on the revival of Irish has been an abject failure.</P>
    <P>Once again we are invited today to say the old, tired, polite things about the language. Seachtain na Gaeilge is well meaning but the fact that 78 years later there is a token week is the best evidence yet of the failure of a traditional policy which was pursued by all parties. This week we regularly hear the quotation of Thomas Davis: &ldquo;A people without a language of its own is only half a nation.&rdquo;  Davis's words were written before the Famine took its toll on Irish, when most of Ireland was still a Gaeltacht. It should be noted, however, that like many of today's Seachtain na Gaeilge enthusiasts, he never bothered to learn Irish himself. Sadly, of how many other public figures today can it be said that on the one hand they give public support to the Irish language but on the other hand do not bother to learn and master it? When the public sees hypocrisy, it knows it for what it is.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood, deliberately or otherwise. I would dearly love to see the Irish language spoken on the streets and in our churches, homes and schools. Over 100 years ago the great American writer Walt Whitman wrote about language. It is not, he said, an abstract construction of the learned or of dictionary makers but something arising out of the work, needs, joys, affections and tastes of long generations of humanity and it has its basis broad and close to the ground. Whitman was writing about a vibrant, almost new language, American English. He accurately described the relationship that should <Col N="875" /> exist between people and their language. Sadly, what he held to be true and what remains true today cannot be applied to today's Ireland.</P>
    <P>I salute those who in the past worked tirelessly and for scant rewards to bring our ancestral tongue back to life. The múinteóirí taistil and the bicycle men of the old Gaelic League spring to mind. We should not forget that many of these were treated shamefully after Independence and denied pensions to which they were entitled. In that way, too, did the founders and members of Conradh na Gaeilge work, as do the many enthusiasts around the country today who believe, as Hyde and Pearse did, that Irish could be revived. These people gave, and give, in spirit, time, enthusiasm and commitment but what they hoped, and hope, for has not happened. The pretence that we can still make Irish the national spoken language in everyday use by the majority of the people remains one of the great policy aims of our country, but it is something we have manifestly failed to deliver.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter recently in gloomy terms with a friend, a keen supporter of the language. To my contention that the game is lost, he reminded me of the enthusiasm of the people who have been instrumental in setting up gaelscoileanna and naonraí around the country. That these are excellent schools in terms of academic achievement no unbiased observer can deny. I wish them continued success and even greater funding from the national treasury. I give them the benefit of a lingering doubt that the enthusiasm of the parent for the language always results in an enthusiasm in the child.</P>
    <P>However, the success of the gaelscoileanna, naonraí and the dedicated activists only highlights the deep chasm and apathy that is faced by teachers in the vast majority of schools, an apathy reflected in the dismal standards in Irish achieved in so many of them. People might deny this but will anybody deny that most of the children who are taught French, German or Spanish for four or five years in secondary schools end up with a greater degree of fluency in those new languages than in Irish, which they have studied, if one may use that word, for ten or 11 years?</P>
    <P>A friend who teaches in a Dublin university not long ago gave his first year Irish language tutorial students the 1955 primary certificate paper as a test. To his dismay, he found that 80% of the students failed it. Can anybody deny that this type of experience spells the end of what we are trying to achieve? I have looked at the curriculum in secondary schools. I am told it has been reformed, but it is still the most uninspiring collection of texts imaginable. It is guaranteed to put any imaginative child off Irish for life. It is so dull that in comparison books that many of us struggled through in English, such as <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i> or Newman's ideas on a university, would be regarded as fun and light reading by modern youngsters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> As for the foundation course, nobody can take it seriously. It is designed with one purpose in mind, to give credence to the pretence that all is well with the position of Irish in schools. It does not take much to pass the foundation course with flying colours and, in terms of statistics, it is useful for proving that more children can now boast a qualification in Irish.</P>
    <P>Will we ever come to terms with the reality? For example, will the zealots who send children packing from the Gaeltacht summer schools for inadvertently using a phrase or sentence in English realise the enormity of the damage they are doing? Will the lip service being paid at this time of the year to what has now become a great national humbug, the revival of the language, do the slightest bit of good? Will Seachtain na Gaeilge do anything to stem the tide of apathy? There are people who begin a conversation with &ldquo;a chairde Ghaeil&rdquo; and then immediately revert to English. Will that sort of cant do anything to instil respect for the Irish language? Will it do anything other than add to the public distaste for what many dub the &ldquo;tá sé's&rdquo;, the people who use the language, do not understand it, have not taken the trouble to learn it and yet wear it as a badge?</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to malign those who try hard to stem the tide of national apathy. I salute them. I pity the teachers who have to cope as best they can with national apathy to the language. I salute the scholars who celebrate our beautiful ancestral language in a salutary clinical manner. I salute those young people who have disregarded the national stupor and who have learned Irish well and are proud of having done so. I salute too the novelists, the short story writers, the dramatists who work in Irish and who have added lustre to the ancient tradition.</P>
    <P>Here we have this great dichotomy, with a small group of people striving very hard to do what the founders of the State and all the parties at the beginning of the State hoped would be done for all the people and that in a matter of a generation or two it would be the accepted mean rather than the exception. It is a gloomy assessment. What can we do? I do not have the answer. There are many people who are paid salaries, who are doing research in linguistics, into teaching methods and so on, who are in a better position than I am. We could start with a proper root and branch revival of the curriculum, especially in primary schools. My ten year old son and his friends learn Irish by rote, in a mechanical way. Nothing in their textbooks grabs their attention, as the English, mathematical, history or geography textbooks grab the attention of bright children. The textbooks are out of date. They reflect an Ireland that perhaps never was. There is nothing in them to attract the attention of young people who are starting off on their educational journey.</P>
    <P>Whatever success there will be will come about only if there is a root and branch reform of the teaching of Irish, especially in primary schools. It <Col N="877" /> is not as if there is not enough money being spent on it. It is not as if the resources are not there. For whatever reason, the failure of imagination on the part of those who draft, sanction and provide the texts has been one of the great failures. Unless there is root and branch reform, Irish will continue to be badly taught. Pupils will remain indifferent if not downright hostile. Seachtain na Gaeilge will come and go. It will be an ever more ghostly memorial to a past that perhaps never was, that might have been had the policies succeeded. The policies have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>I admire people in this House, such as the Minister, Senator Ó Murchú and others, who have made the revival of the Irish language as the spoken language of all the people a large part of their life's work. I salute their sincerity and the sincerity of many others like them, but I believe we have lost our way and that the pretence that Irish can be revived as a language which will be even affectionately regarded by a majority of the people, not to mention widely used by all the people, is a fiction. I wish it were otherwise. If we are to stem the tide, let us begin by looking very hard at the way in which Irish is taught in primary schools in particular but also in secondary schools. That the results at the end of seven, eight or ten years of intensive teaching of Irish are so dismal tells its own story.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an tAire Stáit. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl mar cruthaíonn sé i slí go bhfuil an Ghaeilge fos ina beocheist sa tír seo agus go bhfuil tuairimíocht ann agus gur mian le daoine na tuairimí a nochtadh. Is maith an rud é freisin nach n-aontaíonn gach éinne leis na tuairimí céanna mar ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé sin cabhrach agus ní bhéadh sé sláintiúil. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh díospóireacht ar an Ghaeilge, ar cad é an dul chun cinn atá déanta, cad é an slí is feárr le cur chuige, cad iad na botúin a déineadh go dtí seo, cad é an t-ábhar atá ann maidir le forbairt amach anseo. Chomh maith leis sin, ag féachaint siar ar stair na Gaeilge tá sé fíor a rá go raibh daoine ann a bhí idéalach i gcomhnaí maidir leis an Ghaeilge. Thuigeadar go raibh seod luachmhar i gceist sa Ghaeilge. Ní hamháin go raibh foclóir ag baint leis an teanga ach go raibh fealsúnacht ag baint leis chomh maith agus go raibh an fealsúnacht sin le fáil sa Ghaeilge. Is cinnte freisin go bhfuil teanga liteartha againn chomh maith agus ní gá ach féachaint ar na scríobhainní a bhí againn go dtí seo. Tá sé thar a bheith soiléir go bhfuil saibhreas ag baint leo agus na scoláirí go raibh sé de ádh acu mionscrúdú a dhéanamh ar na scríobhainní sin do thuigeadar go raibh an saibhreas céanna ag baint leo siúd is a bhí ag an-chuid de na scríobhainní claiseacha a bhí i dteangacha eile. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh seans ag daoine an seod luachmhar sin a bheith acu, go mbeadh seans acu an saibhreas sin a thuiscint agus go mbeadh siad in ann forbairt a dhéanamh <Col N="878" /> ar a gcaractéirí náisiúnta féin. Mar gheall ar sin tá áthas ormsa go bhfuil an díospóireacht seo ar siúl. Níl aon amhras faoi ach gur déineadh botúin agus bhí an-díospóireacht ann ar feadh na mblianta fada maidir le Gaeilge éiginteach sna scoileanna. Bhí scoláirí ann a chreid gur chuir sé isteach orthu agus gur chuir sé constaic ina dtreo maidir le dul chun cinn, nár éirigh leo, b'fhéidir, creidiúint áirithe a bhaint amach san oideachas agus mar sin de. Bhí daoine ag rá freisin nuair a bhí an-chuid imirce as an tír nach raibh aon mhaitheas sa Ghaeilge do dhaoine a bheadh ag imeacht agus a bheadh ag iarraidh maireachtaint i dtír éigin eile. Chun a bheith féaráilte faoi ní hionann na ceisteanna sin ar fad. Do bheadh imirce ann gan an Ghaeilge agus bheadh imirce gan an Ghaeilge a bheith sa chóras oideachais. Ach ba bhreá liom an méid seo a rá, ó chuamar isteach i gComhphobal na hEorpa tugaim faoi ndeara go bhfuil níos mó meas ag daoine ar an nGaeilge ná mar a bhí roimhe seo agus an cheist atá ann ná cén fáth go bhfuil sin amhlaidh. An tuairim pearsanta atá agam ná nuair a chuaigh daoine ag taisteal ar fud na hEorpa, rud nár dhein mórán daoine roimhe sin, thugadar faoi ndeara go raibh teanga náisiúnta ag gach tír. Ní hamháin go raibh meas ar an teanga sin ach gur dheineadar an-iarracht an teanga a chosaint, ní hamháin ina dtír féin ach leasmuigh go hidirnáisiúnta freisin. I gcás na Fraincise, mar shampla, agus i gcás na Gearmáinise tá sé soiléir go bhfuil na milliúin punt caite ag na tíortha sin le cinntiú go mbeadh gradam ag a dteangacha féin ar fud an domhain. Chomh maith leis sin thug daoine faoi ndeara nuair a bhí siad ag taisteal ar fud na hEorpa gur thug sé bród dóibh a bheith in ann a rá go raibh teanga acu féin mar d'fhéachadar ar an teanga mar chomhartha féiniúlachta náisiúnta. Sé sin le rá go rabhadar in ann a chruthú go raibh cúlra faoi leith acu féin agus ins an cúlra sin go raibh an cultúr agus go raibh oidhreacht ann chomh maith.</P>
      <P>Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an deáthoil sin le mothú fiú amháin i measc na ndaoine óga atá ann an lá inniu. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé fíor a rá nach bhfuil an caighdeán ó thaobh múineadh na Gaeilge chomh hard is a bhí in an-chuid slite ach go bunúsach tá deáthoil don Ghaeilge ann. Níl an feachtas céanna i gcoinne na Gaeilge is a bhí sna seascaidí agus arís tá daoine ag rá go bhfuil díomá orthu nár éirigh leo níos mó Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ar scoil agus nach féidir leo níos mó Gaeilge a úsáid anois. Tá sin á admháil acu. Chomh maith leis sin, má fhéachann tú ar TG4, mar shampla, nuair a thosaigh sé i dtosach, b'fhéidir nach raibh an tús chomh láidir sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag an am céanna do leanadar ar aghaidh agus tá i bhfad níos mó lucht féachana acu anois ná mar a bhí go dtí seo. Tá caighdeán ann agus is gnáth daoine óga oilte na daoine is mó atá chun tosaigh ann, daoine a bhfuil cur-i-láthair an-maith acu. Nílimid ag caint a thuilleadh ar sheanóirí. Tugann sé an-dóchas domsa go bhfuil an scéal mar seo. Má fhéachann tú ar an nGaeltacht, ar a <Col N="879" /> laghad tá sí fós ann. Sin an rud is tábhachtaí agus sa cheantar sin tá daoine ag maireachtaint agus an Ghaeilge mar ghnátha labhartha acu. Is cruthú é sin gur éirigh leis an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht maireachtaint fiú amháin ins an saol nua-aimsire seo agus gach saghas brú á chur isteach orthu. Ach ní hionann é sin agus a rá gur chuir an Ghaeilge isteach ar an gcóras oideachais ins an Ghaeltacht mar tá an-dul chun cinn déanta ag an aos óg. Tá céimeanna bainte amach acu cosúil le gach cuid eile den tír. Tá dul chun cinn eacnamaíochta déanta ann chomh maith ach an príomh rud ná go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ann mar thobar na Gaeilge. Agus tá seans againn freastal ar an nGaeilge agus snas a chur ar ár gcuid Gaeilge féin. Caithfimid a bheith féaráilte dóibh siúd mar sin an teanga laethúil atá acu. Caithfimid a cinntiú go bhfuil siad in ann na seirbhísí atá in ann dóibh a bheith acu.</P>
    <P>Tá áthas orm a chlos go mbeidh Bille Teanga ann mar ceapaim go bhfuil an-tábhacht le Bille Teanga, ní chun conspóid a chothú, ní chun constaicí a chothú ach chun a bheith oscailte agus macánta ar cad iad na riachtanaisí atá ag teastáil ó thaobh na Gaeilge sa lá atá inniu ann nuair atá dul chun cinn á dhéanamh leis na meáin chumarsáide agus mar sin de. Guím gach rath ar ndóigh, ar Sheachtain na Gaeilge agus tuigim an rud a bhí á rá go béasach ag an Seanadóir Manning ach ag an am céanna tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh taispeántas ann ó am go chéile. Go bhfuilimid in ann a rá le daoine, &ldquo;Féach, seo í an Ghaeilge, is libhse an Ghaeilge agus tá súil againn go dtiocfaidh sibh isteach ar an Ghaeilge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have often heard people ask why we spend so much money on national monuments which are generally old ruins. Many people see them as nothing more than a heap of stones while other people see much more. Some people view Newgrange as nothing more than a hole in the ground yet it has come to a stage where the Office of Public Works must limit the number of people who visit it each year. Someone might look at the Book of Kells and say it is not a great work of art and that modern printing methods could do just as good. But we all know the answers to those questions. It is not the specific object itself but from whence it came and what it represents that is important. It represents our ancestry and past achievements in particular times.</P>
    <P>Surely the Irish language must fall into the same category but even more so because it is a living treasure which shows the philosophy of our people and it kept their intellect intact. It shows a cumas cainte. It also shows a proficiency of language.</P>
    <P>I have heard people criticise <i>Péig</i> yet they never thought to reason why it was important. That book was important because its author was an ordinary woman who had little or no formal education, yet she was still capable of writing in an almost classic language form. That is what was important about <i>Péig. </i>How could a person with<Col N="880" /> out formal education achieve that? It is important when we look back on our poetry and literature to realise that not only had we as a race of people that particular proficiency but that our language and its structure was capable of bringing that genius with it. That is what is important about the Irish language. I am not criticising the English language or any other language.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago most people would have regarded Irish music as something from the past which they would have associated with the fireside. There is nothing wrong with that, but they would never have thought of it as a music that would attract the attention of scholars. It is due to the patience of people and their endeavours to rescue that music and pass it on intact and enhanced that it has an audience throughout the world today. There are people studying for doctorates and masters degrees writing about our music. They are finding excellence in that music which we might easily have missed only for people who were prepared to stand up for it and work for it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to Irish dancing. We would have talked about the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and the one, two three and the rising step. Now it is all over the world. All the big theatres are booked. For the next three years some of these shows are completely booked out. No musical in the world is able to match its success. We would not have kept that type of Irish dancing intact were it not for people wanting to teach it and we would not have had &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; or &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the Irish language. It is important for us to have a language to give ourselves an enhanced self-pride. The Irish language must do that. That it is Irish does not make it any different in its potency to achieve that. I can think of people with whom I came in contact in Conradh na Gaeilge and other organisations. Sometimes they were over zealous and over idealistic but that is a biproduct of enthusiasm. The same could be said about politics. Members have often been enthusiastic about their own parties in this House but that does not mean that party politics is wrong. It is important that what was done in the past was done sincerely.</P>
    <P>With regard to those who established aims and objectives, the Young Irelanders knew the terrible base of depression from whence they came because after the Famine we had sunk into a pit of depression. The first thing they had to do was lift the spirit of the people. It was not to talk about food, the economy or political structures. They lifted people's spirits by pointing to the things which moulded them and their outlook and the Irish language was part of that. Thomas Davis did the same thing when he pointed to our language, songs and culture. It is evident that in 1916 Padraig MacPiarsaigh and his comrades followed the same line. No one having read the 1916 Proclamation, which is a short charter of independence, would suggest that it was not well thought <Col N="881" /> out or pluralist in many ways. Some of the statements contained in it, for example &ldquo;to cherish all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;, are as relevant today as they were in 1916. Underlining all of that was our national identity and part of it was our language.  </P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments about a common platform. I have always believed in it. The Irish language should not be seen as the property of a political party or religious group. The language belongs to us all. We can underpin the goodwill that exists by adopting a pragmatic approach and learning from the past. We can pace ourselves on the road to achievement. We must ask ourselves how a young person can spend 14 years in school yet leave it with a knowledge of the language but not the confidence to put a number of sentences together or even not having the language at all. There is a question to be answered.</P>
    <P>A common platform is what is important. Given the small gathering in the Seanad today and the fact that a debate of this kind has occurred so often in the past, we may wonder if we are speaking to deaf ears or if it is superfluous. However, would it not be great if, out of today, among all the political interests, we could work together, forget the mistakes of the past and say that the language is important, worth promoting and worth saving and that it gives us a specific enhancement, and not only within our own country?</P>
    <P>When TG4 first started people said it was out of place in the world of today and that it would cost a lot of money. However, at least it is there as a statement. Its viewership is growing and the standard of programming is quite high, fronted in the main by young, articulate, intelligent and very often good looking people who represent the young population of today. They have inherited the language and they will have their own focus and approach to the future.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am delighted that An tAire Stáit is present. He has already addressed the House in this debate when he proposed some very good ideas. It is important to have new ideas. We should not always feel we are in a straitjacket, that we must work to stereotypes, or that there must be a negative aspect all the time. We must approach this with new ideas.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh dea-thoil as an díospóireacht seo agus go mbeimid go léir ag díriú ar an dea-thoil sin.</P>

      <P>Ag éisteacht leis an méid a bhí le rá ag an Seanadóir, tá sé de nós ag na polaiteoirí athleasú a dhéanamh ar stair na tíre agus rinne an Seanadóir Ó Murchú an-leasú ar fad. There is always space for a revisionist approach, but i ndáiríre ní raibh aon rófháilte roimis forógra na Poblachta i 1916 and it is a progressive and <Col N="882" /> pluralist document and has rarely been surpassed this century. Every young person should read it, as should anybody who holds views on pluralism, but there was not any great welcome for Irishmen and Irishwomen. It is worth noting in this day of Lá na mBan that the document was probably the first in Irish history to treat men and women equally. That was in 1916 agus is maith an rud é sin a chur ar thaifead an Tí ag an bpointe seo.</P>
      <P>Ag féachaint ar rudaí mar Riverdance n'fheadar an raibh aon rófháilte roimh Riverdance ach oiread ó chaomhnóirí ár gcultúr &ndash; the culture police &ndash; is cuimhin liomsa nuair a bhí mé ag fás suas that moving the hands and jumping around was not Irish dancing. Is maith liom a chlos ón Seanadóir inniu cé chomh tábhachtach is atá Riverdance.</P>

      <P>Chaith mé gach samhradh dem óige i gConamara agus bhí an scéal céanna ann. Chomh maith leis sin, an tríú cuid den seit, an hopaí mar a thugtaí air sa seit ó iarthar na tíre i nGaillimh agus i gCiarraí go mór mór, ní raibh cléir na tíre ró-thógtha leis agus is cuimhin linn an méid sin. I am a bit too wise now.</P>
      <P>Tá an díospóireacht seo an-tábhachtach agus tá gá le ceann anois agus arís sa Teach ionas go mbeidh tuiscint againn ar a bhfuil ar siúl agus ar cén dul chun cinn is féidir linn a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Ó thaobh pholasaí ghinearálta an Stáit de, ó bunaíodh é, i dtaobh na Gaoluinne, an rud is measa ná nach raibh sé riamh dírithe ar an Gaeltachtaí. The policy has always been to see how many on the east coast can be persuaded to speak Irish while there was never enough support for muintir na Gaeltachtaí. Chuaigh mé ar scoil leo, chonaic mé a gcuid tithe agus na leaids ag teacht ar scoil gach maidin nach raibh aon lón acu ná aon rud ag an baile acu.</P>
      <P>Fiú i láthair na huaire tá an scéal amhlaidh. Táimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur á labhairt ar bhonn níos leithne agus ag díriú i gcónaí ar cúrsaí oideachais. Is maith sin mar is fíor go bhfuil caighdeán na Gaeilge i measc lucht fágtha na scoile níos measa inniu ná mar a bhí riamh. I will return to that. Táimid sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt do scoileanna Gaeilge sa Ghalltacht nach bhfuilimid sásta a thabhairt do scoileanna na Gaeltachta. That is total madness. Is féidir liom isteach i scoil ar bith sa Spidéal, i Leitir Mór nó fiú i nDún Chaoin, agus gach seans go mbeidh tuismitheoirí deich faoin gcéad de na leanaí tagtha ar ais ó thíortha thar lear agus gan focal Gaeilge ag na páistí ag teacht isteach ar scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An crowd a rugadh agus a tógadh timpeall na háite ní bheidh Gaoluinn ag leath díobh ón gcliabhán. That is what the teachers in the Gaeltacht schools are putting up with. Surely they are entitled to that level of support. Surely we can all agree on that. It is a small matter and we made <Col N="883" /> a move towards it recently. Caithfear an tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Bille Oideachais sa Teach seo ceithre bliana ó shin ag an Rialtas deiridh luadh the regionalisation of education agus chuireamar síos leasú chun go mbeadh réigiún amháin Gaeltachta comhtheoranta le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, chun go mbeadh siad ag féachaint ar chúrsaí téacsleabhair &ndash;  níl siad ar fáil as Gaoluinn in a lán de na scoileanna. D'fhoghlaim mé féin mo chuid Laidine trí Ghaoluinn as téacsleabhar Béarla. That is still going on. There needs to be an investment in that kind of thing. In the Education Act, tá píosa ann faoi general national resource centre for the teaching of Irish, where ábhar múinte would be put together.</P>
    <P>An rud ba chóir a bheith ann ó thaobh mhúinteadh na Gaoluinne sa Ghaeltacht &ndash; I should be able to say to the teachers in iar-Chonnacht mar shampla, to put a group together chun téacsleabhair a chur le chéile ó thús deireadh, put it all together and that would become téacsleabhar na háite. There must be that will. Níl aon slí eile ann.</P>
    <P>Is fíor go bhfuil muintir na Gaeltachta ag maireachtaint trí Ghaoluinn but muintir na Gaeltachta do not think of themselves as living through the Irish language, they think of themselves as living. Ach go bhfuil sé ar siúl acu trí Ghaoluinn. I wish the rest of the world also understood that, and understood gurb iad na Gaeltachtaí foinse na teanga, and that they deserve special treatment. It is not the kind of east coast culture police, the people who use Irish to stop others talking to them. One of the great differences between east and west in Ireland is, if a person visits a company in the Gaeltacht agus muna bhfuil Gaeilge acu, people will speak English because it is their natural courtesy. In Dublin, the reverse is likely to happen and the language is more likely to be used in an exclusive rather than an inclusive fashion to make a person feel they cannot participate. That would be the view of Gaeltacht people in Dublin who often get embarrassed when speaking Irish with a person who has not been born and reared in the Gaeltacht and who does not revert to English if a third person, who does not speak Irish, joins the group. I cite that as an example of how the language is used in the wrong way. That said, we as people from the west always had the belief that in Dublin it was the third person who always killed the language for that reason. We believed it was wrong to continue ag caint as Gaeilge if another person who did not speak the language was present. That would be the same in any other country.</P>
    <P>An rud atá ag teastáil sna Gaeltachtaí ná infrastruchtúr agus níl sé ann. Tá rudaí ar nós bóithre ag teastáil. Both Senator Ryan and I have raised a number of times on the Order of Business, including today, the Telecommunications (Infrastructure) Bill. That legislation <Col N="884" /> could give freedom do na Gaeltachtaí nach raibh riamh acu cheana. Everything could be done there. I will not go into detail on it but ní deacair a shamhlú an sórt saoirse a thabharfadh sé do dhul chun cinn sna Gaeltachtaí da mba rud é go raibh telecommunications ar fáil acu.</P>
    <P>Is é Gaeilge teanga muintir na Gaeltachta lá i ndiaidh lae. An rud ba chomhair dúinn a dhéanamh ná to forget that fact and give them what they require to live their lives in a manner similar to the lives of people in any other part of Ireland. That means investing more money in the Gaeltachtaí and positive discrimination in favour of the Gaeltachts. That is the only way it can be done, it should be done as a matter of policy and it should be our focus. We should develop an teanga as na Gaeltachtaí instead of from the Galltachtaí. That is my general view of what is wrong with an polasaí. That is not to say that developments outside of that, such as Gaelscoileanna, are wrong. They should receive all the support they need. I would not wish to be misunderstood on that point. However, muintir na Gaeltachta do not receive a fair chance. It is only when a person is born and reared, fully educated and lives and works in the Gaeltachtaí that the language is living. Ní bheidh deacracht ar bith le cumas na teanga to cope with changes in life. Tiocfaidh an foclóir do mhuintir na Gaeltactha. Tuigeann gach duine againn dá mba rud é go raibh fostaíocht, ollscoilíocht, tithíocht, bóithre agus gach rud eile sna Gaeltachtaí, bí cinnte that muintir na Gaeltachtaí would not be stuck for a word to describe a new invention or development. Ní raibh riamh an deacracht sin acu. Ba mhaith liom go mbéadh sé sin ann dóibh.</P>
    <P>An sórt rud a chuireann isteach ar rudaí Gaelacha ná the attitudinal aspect. Chonaic mé aréir ar an dteilifís a programme on different types of Irish music. It concerned the showband era, and Bob Geldof from the Boomtown Rats was interviewed. There was a passing reference to bainisteoir an ghrúpa sin, a man called Fachtna Ó Ceallaigh. His grandfather was a member of one of the early Governments, a Minister for Education and ba scríobhneoir é faoin ainm &ldquo;Sceilg&rdquo;. His grandson turned out to be the manager of an in-your-face rock band with Bob Geldof as a member. However, ba Ghaeilgeoir Fachtna i gcónaí. Gaeilge a labhair sé liom i gcónaí, even when he was at the height of his fame in London or wherever. Is cuimhin liom oíche amháin a raibh sé ar an Late Late Show. Chuir Gay Byrne ceist air cad ba mhaith leis a dhéanamh. He answered that he would like to go and live for a few years in the Gaeltacht. The audience laughed because they could not see this Dubliner with long hair who was into rock music having any reference to the Gaeltacht. That was where his love was, his commitment was always to that and it never changed.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is, an bhfuil tuiscint ann ar céard is traidisiún? Níl ann ach an teannas idir nua agus sean. An deacracht ná go mbíonn daoine ag <Col N="885" /> iarraidh é a choimeád mar unchanging gan tuiscint go bhfuil sé i gcónaí ag dul ar aghaidh, ag forbairt agus ag aistriú agus gur rud beo é an traidisiún. It is not just Irish music and dancing. It is not traditional Irish music or the Chieftains. It is not even Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. It is also Sinéad O'Connor and U2. Until we can cope with that trí Ghaeilge, we will be in difficulty. It is noticeable from ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir. Aontaíom le gach focal a dúirt sé mar gheall ar TG4, cé chomh maith is atá sé and that it is delightful that it has been such a success. Tá sé tar éis saibhreas nua a thabhairt dúinn. However, when did we last hear rock music on Radio na Gaeltachta? People decided that Gaeltacht people should not listen to rock music. I would like to know the person who made that decision because he said to the young people of the Gaeltacht that if they had been born in Brittany or elsewhere, d'fhéadfadh siad bheith ag éisteacht le cheol na Briotáine agus roc cheol á chur i láthair i dteanga na háite&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is fíor sin. Tá sé sin tar éis tarlú, ach bhí an argóint le é sin a chur ar fáil ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh deich mbliain nó cúig bhliain déag. Bhí cruinniú agam féin leo. It is the attitude. One of the focal points of Seachtain na Gaeilge is a monster céilí. That might have enormous relevance for a certain group of people, but we should know that it is not attractive to the majority of young people if our aim is to spread the message wider. Effectively, we are doing something atá cur i bhfeidhm aige do roinnt áirithe de dhaonra na tíre but that is not available to the rest.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith an rud é dá gcuirfimis níos mó achmhainní agus infheistíocht i muintir na Gaeltachta agus sna Gaeltachtaí féin chun go mbéadh seans acu maireachtáil ó thús go deireadh trí Ghaeilge. Ba chomhair go mbéadh sin mar pholasaí an Stáit i gcónaí. Is ceann de na rudaí is tábhachtaí dúinn é. Ba cheart chomh maith go mbéadh seans ag daoine lasmuigh de na Gaeltachtaí a gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus a úsáid. Aontaíom go mór leis an bpointe sin. Tá sé sin ag tarlú.</P>
      <P>Mar dhuine óg sa Daingean, is beag Gaeilge a chloisfeá an uair sin i mbaile an Daingean. Tá i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á úsáid i mbaile an Daingean inniu ná mar a bhí 40 bliain ó shin. That is success. D'fhéadfadh duine dul isteach in aon pub nó siopa sa Daingean agus Gaeilge a úsáid. Ní tharlódh sin 40 bliain ó shin.</P>

      <P>Má tá aon locht ar an díospóireacht seo, sin gur trua nach dtarlaíonn sí níos minicí. Mar is léir óna bhfuil cloiste go dtí seo go bhfuil an-chuid daoine sa Teach seo le líofacht Ghaeilge agus cumas cainte ar féidir leo smaointe an-doimhne a chur in iúil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Pé rud atá ráite ag an Seanadóir Manning ag tosach na díospóireachta, is fiú go mór an díospóireacht seo a bheith ann inniu.</P>
      <P>Uaireanta braithim go bhfuil an-dul chun cinn á dhéanamh agam nuair a chuirim san áireamh líon na ndaoine óga atá ag freastal ar scoileanna lánGhaeilge agus ar an nGaeltacht agus atá ag plé le ceol agus rince Gaelach. Tugann sé sin an-misneach dom. Is maith liom an cruth atá ar TG4 &ndash; tá proifisiúnachas, neart agus bríomhaireacht ag baint leis an gcainéal a thugann an-misneach dom. Agus is amhlaidh i gcás Raidió na Gaeltachta. Ní fíor a rá go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar gcúl.</P>
      <P>Ach bím buartha faoi ghnéithe eile den gceist seo agus ag deireadh na haoise seo caite, nuair a bhí measúnú á dhéanamh againn ar an méid a bhí bainte amach agus ar a raibh fós le déanamh, chuir roinnt daoine an cheist, an mbeidh an Ghaeilge beo ag an gcéad míleaois eile. Ba cheart an cheist sin a phlé go domhain agus má féidir leis an nglúin seo aon rud a dhéanamh nár deineadh cheana, tá sé de dhualgas orainn é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Chuir sé lagmhisneach orm nuair a foilsíodh cnuasach filíochta ag deireadh na bliana agus nuair a iarradh ar roinnt filí dánta móra na haoise a bhailiú agus an dán ab fhearr a scriobhadh sa tír seo a roghnú astu siúd. Foilsíodh an cnuasach sin in aon leabhar amháin. Bhí 99 dán Béarla ann agus dán amháin i nGaeilge, le Cathal Ó Searcaigh. Chuir sé sin alltacht orm. Nuair a smaoinítear ar an liriciúlacht a bhaineann le filíocht Mháire Mhac an tSaoi, is ábhar iontais é nár deineadh tagairt dó. Nuair a chuirtear san áireamh an liriciúlacht agus an idirnáisiúnachas atá le sonrú ar fhilíocht Sheáin Uí Ríordáin &ndash; na domhainsmaointe agus an existentialism &ndash; is ait nár deineadh oiread is tagairt amháin dó. Gan trácht ar dhaoine mar Mháirtín Ó Direáin agus Seán Ó Tuama agus daoine atá níos nua-aimseartha fós.</P>
      <P>Ní fiú an teanga muna mbíonn an litríocht ann. Ní fiú a bheith ag treabhadh leis muna bhfuil sé ann mar eochair do dhaoine óga chun teacht ar shaothair na bhfilí móra. Chuireadh sé as go mór domsa mura mbeadh i mo chumas féin filíocht Sheáin Uí Ríordáin, nó Mháire Mhac an tSaoi, Aogán Ó Rathaille nó Eoghan Ó Súilleabháin a léamh dom féin chun sonas agus sásamh a thabhairt dom féin. Sin an rud a thugann sásamh dom go bhfuil roinnt éigin den teanga agam, ionas go bhfuil sé i mo chumas saothair na bhfilí sin a léamh agus machnamh a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>N'fheadar cá mbeidh an fhilíocht sin i gceann caoga bliain eile? Táimid ag iarraidh ar an Aire feachtas foilsitheoireachta a chur ar bun i dtreo is gur féidir filíocht Sheáin Uí Ríordáin &ndash; Eireaball <Col N="887" /> Spideoige, Brosna agus na leabhair sin &ndash; a fhoilsiú mar níl siad á fhoilsiú faoi láthair. Tá sé de chúram ar na hollscoileanna meastachán nua-aimseartha ar shaothair na bhfilí móra sin. Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire an nudge a thabhairt dóibh, nó pé spreagadh atá ag teastáil chun é sin a dhéanamh sar i bhfad.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin linn go léir na píosaí áille próis a bhíodh san <i>Irish Times </i>&ndash; píosa amháin in aghaidh na seachtaine. Tá an-chuid daoine ann a chreideann go raibh dearadh níos fearr ar an bprós ná mar a bhí ar an fhilíocht fiú amháin &ndash; bhí an caighdeán chomh hard agus na smaointe chomh domhain. Dá bhféadfaimis áiteamh ar an <i>Irish Times</i> chun na píosaí sin go léir a chur ar fáil arís i bhfoirm leabhráin ionas go bhféadfaí iad a léamh arís agus machnamh a dhéanamh orthu.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag cur cúram ar an Aire iarracht níos fearr a dhéanamh chun go mbeidh litríocht mór na linne seo ar fáil do dhaltaí óga na linne seo chugainn. Muna dhéanfar sin, ní bheidh sa teanga ach rud an-tanaí ar fad. Teanga gan litríocht, ní bhíonn aon fréamhacha aici. Muna bhfuil an litríocht ann ní bhíonn na fréamhacha domhain.</P>
    <P>Tá ísliú céime ag teacht ar chaighdeán na Gaeilge sa bhunscoil agus sa mheánscoil agus caithfear tabhairt faoi. Cuireann sé lagmhisneach orm nuair a fheicim páistí ó thithe áirithe a bhfuil saibhreas acu agus teacht acu ar Ghaelscoil agus bíonn an saibhreas oideachais sin acu. Bíonn an dátheangachas acu ón tosach agus tá sé an-éasca dóibh ansin an triú teanga a shealbhú. Tá headstart ag na páistí atá ag freastal ar na scoileanna lánGhaeilge. Ach tá an caighdeán ag dul i léig in aghaidh an lae i gcuid de bhunscoileanna na tíre agus ní mór feachtas éigin a chur ar bun chun an scéal sin a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart cúrsaí inseirbhíse sa Ghaeilge a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí, mar aon le modheolaíochtaí agus téacsleabhair nua-aimseartha. Muna ndéanfar é sin, beidh an-chuid daoine ann nach mbeidh an bunús Gaeilge acu. Ghoillfeadh sé sin go mór orm.</P>
    <P>Níl drochmhisneach orm ag deireadh an lae. Tá toil an phobail trí chéile i leith na Gaeilge níos fearr ná mar a bhí riamh. Ach é sin ráite, tá an-chuid rudaí ann gur chóir a dhéanamh agus ceann amháin díobh sin ná díriú ar an mbunoideachas. Ach ní féidir a bheith ag brath ar mhúinteoirí agus ar scoileanna na tíre chun an Ghaeilge a chothú agus a chur chun cinn. Ní ceart é sin. Má bhímid ag brath ar an gcóras oideachais leis féin, teipfidh orainn. Ní leor an dúshlán a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí amháin.</P>

      <P>This is a very happy day because, in a spirit of lateral thinking and reconciliation I have had negotiations with the Leader of the House and the amendment the Government had intended to table has been withdrawn. As a result I shall make a slight adjustment to the motion. The amended motion is as follows:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to consider the establishment of a National Paid Holiday to value women's work on 1 February (St. Brigid's Day) annually, commencing 2001; and to devise and implement the necessary statistical means to measure unpaid household, caring and community work.</P>
      <P>We have substituted the phrase &ldquo;calls on&rdquo; for the term &ldquo;urges&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;establish&rdquo; has been replaced with the term &ldquo;to consider the establishment of&rdquo;. As far as I am concerned, that covers the ground we originally wished to cover. This means that the House can be united on International Women's Day in urging the Government to take a series of steps which I believe it is already gearing up to take on foot of certain international undertakings it has given and on which it would be embarrassing to renege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good wind behind us on this matter because, when we were negotiating a date on which to debate it, the Government had originally agreed to make time available last week. Had that happened, the debate would not have taken place on International Women's Day. We were also informed that a Minister could not be found to take the debate. However, it emerged that my Private Members' time would fall on International Women's Day. What serendipitous coincidence could be more favourable to this motion? I do not doubt that St. Brigid, who was one of the first lateral thinkers, was smiling upon us. Is it not true that when she requested land from a local king it was agreed that she could have as much land as her cloak would cover. <Col N="889" /> When she placed it on the ground it spread out to cover the entire county of Kildare. This is an interesting paradigm of the way I hope this idea will spread.</P>
    <P>Some people are concerned about the establishment of a national paid holiday on 1 February because of the financial costs involved. What is money? It is not really a physical reality at all. We are misled into thinking that because we have £20 notes and £1 coins in our pockets. However, money is nothing more than the symbolic representation of energy, the symbolic representation of a reward for work. Women who, on a global basis, do 75% of the work for less than 5% of the yields and own 1% of the property surely have a right to have this recognised.</P>
    <P>What we intend to do this evening is to place this matter on the public agenda. It does not matter to me if there is a dispute about it. In fact, the more disputes there are the merrier. We already heard voices raised in opposition on today's Order of Business when an &ldquo;I'm all right Jill&rdquo; syndrome came into play. Some female Members stated that we do not really need this national paid holiday. In a way that is a mark of the success of the women's movement and of how far we have come in the past 40 to 50 years. During that period women have gained the right to sit on juries, access to contraception, independent passports, etc. On radio this morning Nell McCafferty said that child care allowances used to be paid exclusively to men. Nowadays that seems a barbarous and stupid practice. However, we have, fortunately, moved onward.</P>
    <P>People have said that the establishment of a national paid holiday on St. Brigid's Day is irrelevant and that we should be concentrating on the provision of child care facilities. I reject this argument because it is not an &ldquo;either or&rdquo; question. Why should we set two good ideas in competition with each other? Why can we not say that we want and are entitled to both?</P>
    <P>International Women's Day has its origins in the activism of women who worked in the clothing sweatshops of New York in the early years of this century. In 1907, women working in these appalling conditions, who often worked long hours in dangerous conditions, held a hunger march in New York calling for a ten hour working day and better wages. Shamefully this march was attacked by the police. On 8 March the following year, a landmark march was held in New York to commemorate these women's struggle and this became the kernel of International Women's Day.</P>
    <P>Early in the 20th century, similar impoverished women workers in Ireland struggled for their rights. In 1945, there was a laundry workers strike seeking the right to two weeks' paid holidays, the issue we are dealing with today. There was opposition to this demand but the workers won and everyone benefited &ndash; men and women. The most marginalised workers benefited from the efforts of these equally marginalised women workers. <Col N="890" /> We should be proud of them in the same way that we should be proud of the 11 Dunnes Stores workers who stood up for a matter of principle in the 1980s and paid for it with their jobs. We should ensure that this never happens again.</P>
    <P>Diverse events have been held in Ireland over the years at national and community level to celebrate women's lives, to highlight issues specific to them and to campaign for equality. Today, for example, the Letterkenny Women's Centre did something close to my heart when it celebrated the opening of its new library and the launching of a book entitled <i>Building Peace &ndash; A Guide for Women's Groups.</i> An interdenominational memorial service will be held in Galway this evening to commemorate women who lost their lives as a result of domestic violence, and we must all commit ourselves to dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>At 11 o'clock this morning the National Women's Council of Ireland held a wonderful celebration with tea, cakes and laughter. The only embarrassing thing was that I was interviewed quite often so I said to every person who approached me that they should make sure that they first spoke to an ungodly scatter of women, as I did not wish to appear as carpet-bagging on this important issue. The only reason I am here is that I was captured by Margaretta D'Arcy outside the gates of this august building, symbolically imprisoned and released on a promise of good behaviour and a commitment to fight for this holiday. I am simply operating the terms of my parole by raising this issue, but that does not mean I do not believe in it.</P>
    <P>I was remiss in not welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and I am particularly glad that this Minister of State is in attendance. Deputy Treacy and I fought for a new section to be inserted in the Children Bill. Although this was politically difficult, the Minister of State took this issue to Cabinet and a child's life was recently saved by the new section of the Children Act. That would not have happened without this Minister of State. Our negotiations have slightly wrong-footed him and he will have to rework part of his speech. However, thank God he is in attendance as he is able to take this kind of politically difficult and delicate situation on the hoof. In his heart he will be glad that we have reached this compromise as that is where his emotions and instincts lie.</P>
    <P>We are seeking a paid bank holiday. There is nothing bizarre in this demand as the schedule of holidays highlights the fact that Ireland is joint second last with The Netherlands in having only nine holidays. Other European countries have 13 holidays so we are four behind the leaders. The only country which is worse than Ireland, inevitably, is the UK, but do we wish to emulate it? It is more or less inevitable that this bank holiday will come and we are issuing a pre-emptive strike and placing ourselves first in the queue for the granting of this holiday on St. Brigid's Day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The facts present a stark picture. Women's unwaged work amounts to the largest industry in the State. The Ark Life survey estimated its value at £14 billion per year. This survey represents something very disturbing and interesting. It was conducted by an insurance company to help its campaign to encourage husbands to insure themselves against the death of their wives and the company wanted to quantify the loss caused by women's deaths. If there was a mass annihilation of all women it would cost the Exchequer £14 billion. Is it not interesting that the only time we officially valued women was when we considered what would happen if their work was taken away from us privileged men? This fact tells its own story.</P>
    <P>As the main carers of children and other dependants, women save the State a fortune while often living on very limited means and without full entitlements to social insurance credits in their own right. Women are the most active volunteers in the community and many initiatives are dependent on their contributions of time, experience and expertise. More women than ever are doing a double job for one wage. They are working outside the home until 6 p.m., then coming home and doing housework. Many reports substantiate this fact.</P>
    <P>A publication called <i>Emerging Voices: Women in Contemporary Irish Society</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Women working full-time in the home include those who were excluded from paid employment prior to 1973 by the marriage bar and who are now unable to re-enter the labour force; those who see housewifery and child rearing as more emotionally rewarding than the paid employment currently available to them; those who, in the face of spousal opposition, lack of satisfactory child care arrangements, appropriate job opportunities, or because of the nature of taxation or welfare systems, have concluded that it simply does not pay them to undertake paid employment; as well as those who married in the expectation of having a male breadwinner, but do not now have one and are unable or unwilling to undertake this role themselves.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that this is an international issue. A global strike was organised as this issue affects women all over the world. It may seem bizarre but one of the most moving events was a collection organised by prostitutes. These people felt so marginalised and sent a fax stating that they wanted to be a part of this as they had decided to sell their sexuality to provide for their families. They wished to be included so that it would not be a case of good women on one side and bad women on the other. They are all women at a fundamental level.</P>
    <P>The Government gave commitments at the UN social summit in Copenhagen and the UN conference on women in Beijing. On both occasions <Col N="892" /> it signed up to commitments to measure and value unwaged work, including conducting regular surveys and setting up national accounts to reflect the value of unremunerated work. However, five years on, these commitments are unfulfilled.</P>
    <P>In June 2000, an Irish delegation will travel to New York to take part in an international review of progress on commitments made in Beijing as part of a programme for action. It will be embarrassing if we have not done something and we are providing the Government with an instrument. It can go to New York and state that in Seanad Éireann on International Women's Day this measure was passed. I serve a warning that we will monitor this issue to ensure that this is acted upon.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the traditional and existing situation regarding domestic work. The publication I referred to earlier also noted that, &ldquo;In Ireland, among men who did take responsibility for at least one domestic task, the proportion who were willing to cook, clean, shop, or dress children was lower than in any other EC country&rdquo;. It also noted that, &ldquo;84 per cent of the Irish men interviewed said that they did no domestic work whatever, as compared with a European average of 62 per cent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The report also highlighted that, &ldquo;Where only one partner had &lsquo;an afternoon or evening out in the last fortnight, for your entertainment, something that cost money', it was most likely to be the husband&rdquo;. This puts in context our request that St. Brigid's Day, which celebrates a national Irish saint, and is nicely spaced from other national holidays, should be a holiday which recognises the massive and heretofore unrecognised contribution women make to the economy. The Government should commit itself to carrying out a survey which will quantify in minute detail the contribution of women to the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should bear in mind that if we were asking for a paid holiday for men it would cost a great deal more. The unhappy situation exists that women in paid employment still earn the same percentage of men's pay as they earned when equal pay legislation was first introduced in the early 1970s. That is profoundly depressing. Despite the passage of almost 30 years, women in the industrial sector are paid 74% of the average male industrial wage, while women in the service sector only receive 66% of the pay of men. Money is power and this disparity means that women have far less power in their dealings in the economy than men. For that reason the Government should see this as a reasonable offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We constantly boast about the economic achievements of the past ten years and the huge expansion in the workforce, but that expansion is due to the involvement of women. In 1971 there were 212,000 women in paid employment. By 1996 the figure had increased to 488,000. The <Col N="893" /> number of women in the workforce has more than doubled within 25 years. It is incredible to think that the marriage bar in the Civil Service existed until 1972. Is it any wonder that the economy was held back to such an extent?</P>
    <P>An incredible 46% of women are now in the workforce, while among younger women the figure is 60%. Of those women with one or two dependent children, 43% are in the workforce. We should remember how much more difficult it is for mothers to enter the workforce. When we bear that in mind we realise just how huge their contribution to economic success has been.</P>
    <P>The equal pay legislation of the early 1970s was splendid and came long before some of our European partners introduced similar regulations. It is unfortunate, however, it has not become more of a reality for women. There are difficulties in its application because it must be shown that work is of equal value. It is extraordinarily difficult for those in an all female workplace to show the value of their work. That was a major factor in the dispute over nurses' pay and led eventually to the strike. There were few men in general nursing until recently &ndash; most worked in the psychiatric service. That service was one of the most militant until the situation became so serious that nurses decided to strike for the first time in the history of the State. I work with nurses and I know what a difficult decision that was for them to take.</P>
    <P>We pay little attention to the value of the work of these women. It is not just the money involved, there are constant complaints about difficulties with part-time work, flexi-hours and family friendly work, which is the most important because it also affects the father. I heard a report of a priest in Portlaoise who had found some teenagers very drunk in a public park and it took him over a day to find their parents. That was appalling, but I hope it is not considered that only their mothers should have known where they were; their fathers should also have known. A male caller to the radio show which broadcast the story said that he felt it was important for parents to know where their children were. He did not say once that it was important for only the mother to know where the children are. It is vital that fathers play a proper role within the family. It was the industrial revolution which changed the role of fathers. Until then they spent a great deal of time teaching their children their trades.</P>
    <P>Women still have trouble gaining promotion, not just in factories but also in the service industries, where there are always more males in the higher grades. In spite of the fact that 60% of Civil Service staff is female, only 10% in the top grades are women. The medical profession is no better. I serve on Comhairle na Ospidéil and every year we carry out a consultant staffing audit. A few years ago I suggested that those in temporary posts should be included in the breakdown by gender. I met resistance from the then chairman who asked how someone could tell if a doctor with a first name such as Hillary was a <Col N="894" /> male or female. I would like to know how many doctors there are called Hillary. One of the secretaries on the committee did the work in a very short time and the results were of great interest. In the permanent posts, only 16% of consultants were women, while over 50% of those in temporary posts were women. If they were qualified enough to hold temporary posts, why were they not well qualified enough to hold permanent posts? Surely the patients deserve those in temporary posts to be as well qualified as those in permanent posts. Academia is even worse. The female academics of UCD have taken a class action before the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>I would like to see far more value placed on the work women do in the home. The monetary value has been recognised to an extent but the social value is inestimable. Carers appear before committees of the Oireachtas and sometimes they have been trying to deal with elderly parents for so long that they are in need of care themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned the cross-community contacts made by women in the North, many of whom did not work outside the home. Those women held civil society together. How can a monetary value be placed on that? How can a monetary value be placed on the work done by those in cross-Border groups which encouraged contacts between women from the North and the South? Women are not just double jobbing, they are triple and quadruple jobbing.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that the Italians have 17 bank holidays. Since we have only a miserable nine bank holidays, it would be worthwhile considering a holiday for women on St. Brigid's Day.</P>

      <P>On 8 March 1908, a group of working women took to the streets of New York in an effort to promote women's rights in the workplace. These women were working mainly in the notorious &ldquo;sweatshops&rdquo;, referred to by Senator Norris, and were among the first women to highlight the appalling conditions in which they worked and also the poor pay they received. Since then 8 March has come to symbolise the new voice of women in their struggle for equality. In 1977, the United Nations General Assembly decided to highlight this growing voice for <Col N="895" /> equality by formalising 8 March each year as International Women's Day.</P>
      <P>Since those early years, International Women's Day has assumed a new global dimension for women in developed and developing countries alike. The growing international women's movement has helped make the commemoration a rallying point for co-ordinated efforts to demand women's rights and participation in the political and economic process. International Women's Day is a time to reflect on the progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of women's rights. I congratulate Senator Norris and Senator Henry on putting down this motion because it gives us all an opportunity to reflect on the immense contribution made by women, not alone in this country but worldwide. It is important we reflect on that because everybody can be taken for granted. The continuous and constantly evolving role of women and their contribution in our lives is sometimes neglected by us all. I think Senator Norris took some pleasure in being incarcerated by Margaretta D'Arcy and his colleagues, symbolic though it was.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a credit to him that he listened to Margaretta D'Arcy, as most people do when she demands something be done, and I compliment him on putting down this motion.</P>
      <P>There has been a marked increase in female labour force participation rates in recent years, from a rather sluggish period of growth in the 1970s and 1980s. By the beginning of the 1990s, the female labour force participation rate remained at no more than 35%.</P>
      <P>Since then it has increased dramatically to 47.1%, based on the most recently published Quarterly National Household Survey for the fourth quarter of 1999. These survey results were released by the CSO yesterday. This means that the female labour force has increased by one-third in under a ten year period &ndash; a phenomenal performance by any yardstick. I listened with interest to Senator Henry who has a huge knowledge of the medical field in particular. The participation of women in a permanent capacity at consultancy level and other levels within the medical system will change dramatically in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, women's employment growth has been exceptionally strong. For example, during the period from 1993 to date, the number of women at work has increased by more than half &ndash; from 434,000 to 670,000. Over the six year period to the fourth quarter of 1999, the increase of 236,000 in the number of women at work exceeded the growth in male employment of 228,000 over the same period. Clearly there has been a marked change in the gender balance of <Col N="896" /> employment with women's share of total employment increasing from 36% in 1993 to just under 47.1% by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The European Employment Strategy has included a substantial number of objectives designed to encourage a gender mainstreaming dimension in the development of employment and labour market policies across member states of the European Union. Gender mainstreaming is a state of consciousness which recognises that there is both a societal and economic imbalance in the role accorded to men and women to the detriment of the latter and which seeks to redress that imbalance by building in a gender equity dimension to all aspects of policy.</P>
    <P>In the context of our response to the European strategy, we can point to the substantial legislative framework which will significantly contribute to a gender mainstreaming approach. Key institutional elements include the establishment of the Equality Authority, which underpins the anti-discrimination provisions of both employment equality and equal status legislation.</P>
    <P>At the operational level, we are pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at facilitating women's integration into the labour market. We are tackling barriers with which women are faced, through the interaction of the tax and welfare system with recent budget initiatives in tax reform and child care provision. It is a credit to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that he has moved towards equalising the treatment of each individual, taking into account the importance of the individual contribution to the development of our country, economy and society.</P>

      <P>Removing obstacles which prevent women participating in and benefiting from access to labour market programmes represents another area where progress is being made, with an extensive review by the social partners in the context of a detailed set of recommendations developed by the P2000 working group on women's access to labour market opportunities.</P>
      <P>Key challenges are being identified and met. Senators will be aware of a commitment given in the recent Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to publish a Bill to implement the EU Directive on Part-time Work by June of this year. My Government colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, will bring this Bill before the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this new part-time work legislation will be to prevent part-time workers from being treated less favourably than full-time workers and to improve the quality of part-time work. A growing number of people, particularly women, are employed in some alternative to the traditional full-time job. Therefore, action in this area is very timely given the increase in new types <Col N="897" /> of flexible working patterns, especially part-time work.</P>
    <P>My departmental colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, also intends to introduce later this year a carer's leave Bill which will allow all employees to leave their employment temporarily for a period of up to 15 months to provide full-time care for older people or people with disabilities in need of full-time care and attention. Such employees will have their employment rights protected during this leave.</P>
    <P>The society in which we currently live has to face demographic changes and the aging of its population, with as a consequence increasing numbers of employees &ndash; estimated at up to 5% in Europe &ndash; having to take time off work to provide care for parents, relations or friends, especially the elderly. Again these employees are generally women. In Ireland traditionally people in need of such care have been cared for within the family. However, the decline in family size, the increased numbers of people living alone and the increasing participation of women in the labour force have all impacted on the numbers and willingness of family members to provide such care.</P>
    <P>The provision of carer's leave, together with the introduction of the new carer's benefit scheme announced in the recent budget and included in the Social Welfare Bill, 2000, by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will help to facilitate and support those employees who wish to leave the workforce temporarily to care for a parent or relative.</P>
    <P>My departmental colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, as Minister in a previous Administration with special responsibilities for women's affairs, pressed successfully for submissions to Government to be gender proofed, that is to contain details of the likely impact on women of the proposals concerned.</P>
    <P>I recognise and value the great contribution rendered by women to the national economy and quality of life in Ireland and I welcome this opportunity to celebrate and draw attention to that great contribution. I would also welcome the designation of St. Brigid's day on 1 February as a day on which to celebrate that contribution. However, even though there are no plans at present to mark St Brigid's day or indeed any other days in the foreseeable future as extra public holidays, I will recommend to the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has responsibility for labour affairs, to consider with the relevant unit in our Department the possibility of the creation of a national women's day on 1 February &ndash; the feast of that wonderful woman, St. Brigid. None of us would be here without women &ndash; our mothers, our wives, our sisters, our daughters and our wonderful staff. We could not survive without <Col N="898" /> them and why should we not celebrate with them?</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I applaud the interest Senators Norris and Costello have shown in women's issues through tabling this motion which was seconded by Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the main thrust of the motion although I consider it to be very aspirational. I have some qualms with a paid holiday being offered as a reward to women and in this regard I welcome the amendment. The idea of a paid holiday is a good one but how can one specify a type of payment and spread it across the range of work women perform? Had I lived 100 years ago, my property, had I had any, would automatically have become my husband's on marriage.</P>
      <P>The Irish mammy was a wonderful person and the ruler of the home. The only problem was that the hand which rocked the cradle was also the one which held the baby. I acknowledge that a man's role was to go out to work at that time. It was not unusual for some women to have 16 children; I understand that the Duchess of Leinster who lived in this House had 20 children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the bulk of the Minister's speech. It is time we acknowledged the dreadful discrepancies which were so apparent in Ireland for a long time. When I was very young, I wanted to buy a bicycle and had to get my father's signature on the loan. In the early days of my marriage, I had to get my husband's signature on a loan to testify that I was fit to repay it. Now that I am a wealthy elected representative, I do not have to worry about such matters.</P>
      <P>I do not generally like the words &ldquo;consciousness raising&rdquo; but women's groups have done wonders on a voluntary basis in urban areas in particular. Men were loath to follow their example but they are more shy about articulating their needs. That is where women came to the fore in the past 20 years. I applaud the ladies who took to the streets of New York at the turn of the century. It took us a long time to catch up with them because of the social constricts under which we lived.</P>

      <Col N="899" /> Not alone did the Irish mammy rule her household with a rod of iron, she also provided leadership and encouragement to the members of her family. Single women often left lives of dreadful hardship on farms and joined the convent where they became highly gifted educators.</P>
    <P>I do not like to exclude men from this equation as we are interdependent. I would have a difficulty if the proposed holiday were to be specific to women. We should celebrate all that is good in people, men and women alike. The provision of something tangible for women such as better child care facilities or support for carers would be a real cause for celebration. I do not know any woman who would want to have a holiday on 1 February when the weather is usually cold and damp. Perhaps this issue could be re-examined with a view to the provision of a tangible and meaningful reward for women. I am not quite sure what that reward should be.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the motion which I hope will be debated at a future stage in this House in a more concise form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and welcome the fact that we have reached a position of unanimity across the House in our aspirations. I hope this motion will mark the beginning of a process and that the Government will take the motion on board and actively consider its merits. I hope the Minister will return to us in the near future with a concrete proposal for a public holiday on St. Brigid's Day, 1 February, to mark the contribution Irish women have made to society.</P>
      <P>The Minister was quoted today in the national media as saying that women's workforce participation rates currently stand at 47.1%, which represents a massive one third increase in the past ten years. That statistic clearly shows that women's increased participation in the workforce, particularly in the service industry and others, underpins the success of our tiger economy. When the history of this era is written, that factor will stand out. The proposed public holiday, which should be extended to everyone, would be a public and symbolic recognition of women's contribution to the economic success which is benefiting everyone. That is in no way to take from the contribution made by women in the home.</P>
      <P>There is one outstanding issue in this entire debate. Women's participation rates in the Irish workforce are coming into line with those of our European neighbours but we are not on a par with them in the area of child care. The lack of availability and access to quality, affordable child care represents the biggest barrier to women's participation in the workforce. On the one hand, we are asking women to participate in the workforce while, on the other, we are failing to supply adequate, accessible and affordable child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had numerous debates in this House, <Col N="900" /> a number of which I initiated, on child care. We cannot separate the issues of workforce participation rates and the availability of child care. We are missing out on a great opportunity to put in place a quality, affordable, accessible child care system. I have seen no indication of a solid commitment from the Government that we should rely on other than private sector child care provision. That is not adequate. We need only look across the Border to Northern Ireland where the Executive, during its short existence, put in place a large number of free child care places. There is no reason we should not do the same here to benefit families and communities.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ridge for sharing her time and I commend those responsible for this motion. The motion marks the beginning of a campaign which I will be happy to support and which I will ensure stays on the agenda until we succeed in obtaining a public holiday on 1 February in recognition of the contribution made to society by Irish women.</P>

      <P>I join in the comments made by other Senators in support of this motion tabled on International Women's Day. I heard a vox pop on Radio Kilkenny this morning on which various women were interviewed. The level of understanding of International Women's Day was abysmal. Two out of 12 women knew it was International Women's Day. One woman felt that women were not getting their fair share. Younger women said huge progress has been made in recent years and that opportunities and the prospect of promotion in well paid employment were increasing.</P>
      <P>Mary Coughlan, the singer, was interviewed in Galway and she asked that at 11 o'clock women should take ten minutes to themselves to reflect. She said that the role of women in Irish society and the fight for equality of the sexes had undergone many changes in the past 20 years. She also said that 20 years ago she was involved in a women's organisation in Galway &ndash; I did not catch the name but it may have involved contraception. She was attending a meeting of the organisation and women outside were protesting against her participation in such activism. She said that a number of feminists who fought for women's rights dropped out of the fight when they began to reap the benefits of the change in society. This is likely to happen in any sector of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion of a national paid holiday on St. Brigid's Day to recognise women is worthy of consideration. However, there was a day of celebration for women in Ireland long before St. Brigid. It is known as Little Christmas or Nollaig na mBan and it is still celebrated in rural areas. How do we progress women's rights? The difference between the sexes needs to be acknowledged and because of this there will always be conflict. However, we are talking about equal rights for women and men. If there are equal rights in a society, it is well balanced. It is not <Col N="901" /> possible to have equality between men and women. It is similar to the former socialist countries which tried to make everyone equal. There will always be differences. However, we should be attempting to remove differences in the workforce, society, the family and so on. Only in this way can we achieve equality which will result in a better society for everybody.</P>
    <P>As Mary Coughlan said, once people benefit from changes in society, they drop out of the fight. Women and men will have to look at this. While we have become more vociferous about women's rights and human rights, women and men in the West will have to fight for women's rights in the Third World, otherwise society there will break down. We are not helping by our refusal to share the benefits of western medicine with African women. Recent statistics stated that in South Africa, two million more women than men have HIV-AIDS. Another stark statistic is that it is predicted that less than 50% of the population of South Africa will reach pensionable age. These statistics are relevant to this debate. Western society has an obligation to the women of South Africa, whose statistics are better than those of Lesotho, Tanzania and other African countries. Some 63% of the population in Lesotho are HIV positive. This may be more because TB is stated as the cause of death for many people who are HIV positive and whose immune systems have failed.</P>
    <P>If the West is to give equality to women, we must look at society worldwide to ensure we are not only fighting for women's rights in a society which has improved dramatically for women and men. Rather than giving women a paid day off, perhaps we should have a day where we focus on the human rights of women globally. This is an important debate and I support the motion. As Senator Ridge said, the proposal is probably aspirational. However, if it is examined we may come up with some form which may work. A national paid holiday to recognise the value of women's work is only aspirational. However, there needs to be a special day to focus on many other related issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see why this proposal should be aspirational. Women are often fobbed off as being idealistic and aspirational. This is a practical suggestion. There may be different views on whether we should have a paid day off but I support the motion tabled by Senator Norris. Otherwise, we will be discussing this idea for years to come rather than taking action. The part of the motion which proposes that we devise and implement the necessary statistical means to measure unpaid household, caring and community work is extremely important. Women's work is undervalued not only in the first world but also in the Third World. It is important that we acknowledge unpaid household, caring and community work. The National Women's Council of Ireland rep<Col N="902" /> resents 300,000 women, throughout 144 organisations. The chairperson and secretary of the Women in Business Network, which is affiliated to the council and represents 15 groups from around the country, met with Deputies and Senators today to acknowledge International Women's Day. They are anxious to advance their aim of sharing their experience with us and<i> vice versa</i> to help achieve a better appreciation of women. The National Women's Council states that the holiday proposed by Senator Norris would be official recognition by Government of the enormous contribution women have made to the wealth and health of the nation through their unwaged work in the home and on the land. Sometimes we forget what rural women have done on the land in the First World. In the Third World 80% of work on the land is done by women. We also forget what women have done in the arts, business, the voluntary and community sector, for civil liberties and human rights and in general caring work. We forget the low waged work they have done in the past and are still doing.</P>
      <P>I wish to criticise the pressure on women to enter the workforce. As I pointed out when we debated the national development plan and the budget, this is not an effort to secure equality. It is due to the fact that the workforce needs women. It is a pragmatic attitude saying, in effect, &ldquo;We need you, come along&rdquo;. However, if the bubble burst in the economy tomorrow morning, women would be the first people who would have to leave the workforce. One cannot, therefore, view this as a great milestone in the road to equality. It is purely to utilise women, particularly in part-time low paid jobs, to suit the requirements of industry.</P>
      <P>We celebrate International Women's Day as a tribute to the courage of women. There are many hallmark dates. They formed the first trade union movement in North America in the early 1900s. It arose from the sweatshops in the clothing industry. The sweatshops still exist today in Singapore and south east Asia. It is incumbent on us to raise the issue of the abuse of women working in the traumatic conditions of the sweatshops. The goods that flood Irish shops come from Third World countries. Designer footwear used in sport, for example, are made in these countries. We know they are hand stitched by women. A pair can cost up to £90 but what do the poor women who stitch them get? It is difficult work but they do not get even a percentage of the price. The same can be said of designer garments, jeans and so on. Increasingly, they are made in Third World countries. We accept them as fashionable but do we think of the efforts or the sweat that goes into the manufacture of such goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women held a hunger march in New York. It was not just a symbolic march but one that took its toll on the women. We can be sure their health was not as good as ours even if the health of Irish <Col N="903" /> women is of a low standard in the EU context. We have one of the poorest, if not the poorest, standards of health in the EU. The marchers were protesting against dangerous conditions, low wages and for the right to organise. Their protest was attacked by the city police, which is why I refer to courage.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the Russian Congress of Socialist Women joined the protest in 1910. The date was chosen by the Russian women so there was solidarity, even if there was a different ideological background. In Petrograd in 1917 the women textile workers &ndash; there is still tremendous exploitation in that industrial sector today &ndash; went on strike. This action led to the general strike which precipitated the October Revolution. We do not see the dates in the history books acclaiming what women have done to advance equality.</P>
    <P>It is not women alone who work in low paid jobs in Third World countries but they predominate. In 1971, 5,000 women demonstrated in London, demanding equal pay, equal opportunities, free child care &ndash; this is the year 2000 and child care is still on the agenda &ndash; and free contraception. Ireland first publicly celebrated International Women's Day in 1976 and in 1977 the United Nations General Assembly gave formal recognition to 8 March as International Women's Day. It has blossomed and I am glad that we have taken the initiative by making the point that it should be acclaimed as a national holiday.</P>
    <P>One third of the world's population depends for fuel on firewood collected by women and children. Earlier, I mentioned the 80% of women and girls in Africa who grow the food. Women and children spend up to five hours per day collecting firewood in Latin America and in the Caribbean up to 90% of native people have no access to safe drinking water. Women sometimes have to trek 30 miles to reach the wells. Often they have to turn back because the wells are polluted. These statistics are extraordinary and shocking. It is important that we mark International Women's Day if only to focus people's minds on what is still happening.</P>
    <P>We do not even have to refer to the Third World with regard to some of the issues we are still debating in this country. I will refer briefly to what remains to be done in this society. Violence against women is increasing. There is a need for more women gardaí, even if I am accused of being sexist. In cases of rape and violence, statistics and research show that women find it easier to talk to women gardaí. Equal pay legislation is not being implemented and there is no recognition of the work women do in the home. We could debate the position of carers for the next hour. The largest percentage of carers, home helps and child minders are women. There are also the issues of family planning and transport for women in rural areas. I could speak about this forever.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> I compliment Senator Norris on raising this issue and I agree with everything he said. I am only sorry we will not have the holiday for 2001. However, we will continue to highlight the need for it. It is not a matter of saying that we should have a men's day. My argument is that the other 364 days celebrate men and their work. Let us have one day to focus on what women have done. We will continue to fight for this on behalf of 51% of the population. It is not too much to ask.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also compliment Senator Norris. This is a useful and timely debate and it is fitting that we should have it on this day.</P>
      <P>At the heart of the motion is an aspiration to value women. The second part of the motion seeks to oblige legislators to devise and implement the necessary statistical means to measure unpaid household, caring and community work. I thoroughly support that. It should be done as a matter of urgency. The last thing the country and its fragmented society need is the creation of divisions between and among women.</P>
      <P>How do we value women? Before suggesting new measures, we might calmly examine how we value them at present. Look at the extent and level of domestic violence in this country and the harrowing and appalling effect it has on so many women, in both vulnerable and not so vulnerable economic circumstances. A society which has such a high level of domestic violence and serious violence against women can hardly, with hand on heart, claim to be a society which values women. It is an issue we must tackle with greater urgency. We need to put greater resources into the prevention of domestic and all violence against women. If I had more time, I could elaborate further on this issue. I consider it a key objective if we are serious about the manner in which society values women.</P>
      <P>Consider the position of women in work. Women constitute almost 47% of the workforce. That is good but how do women fare when they enter the workplace? How do they fare in terms of promotion? A number of women filter through to middle management, but how many are to be found at senior management level, despite their qualifications and ability? Of the 31 local authority managers here, only one is a woman.</P>

      <P>That was a very recent appointment, and it gives us some insight. What is wrong? If women have the qualifications, if they have the appetite and the ability, why are they not making it to the top? That is a question we, <Col N="905" /> as legislators, ought to consider. If we are really serious about valuing women, we ought to seek ways and means of breaking down the barriers and cutting out the attitudes that prevent women from making it to the top and penetrating through the old boys' network and culture. In addition, we must put in place proper, affordable and accessible child care. That is a key requirement and it is within our remit and our capacity to do that.</P>
      <P>I worry when I look at primary schools. About 90% of the staff in primary schools is made up of women and about 10% are principals. What message does that send to young people in their formative years? What role models are there for them? It is that women do the work in the classrooms and men manage the schools and are the figures of authority. That sends deadly messages out to young people, and that is something we should seek to rectify. I am not looking for anything above and beyond what women are capable of attaining. I am looking only for equality. I am not looking for concessions of any kind. We should seek to break down the barriers that come between women and their ability to aspire to the highest positions. Only one thing should keep women from the top jobs and that is if they do not want to do them. Nothing except their own attitude should stand in the way.</P>
      <P>Somebody I know very well in Cork recently published her research, a thesis for a Ph.D. on female managers on the international stage. It found that only 3% of women make it to top management on the international stage. These are challenges facing us that we must seek to address.</P>
      <P>I want to talk now about women's health. The Well Woman Centre carried out a survey recently. It was a well conducted and broadly-based survey which revealed that 52% of smokers in this country who are under 25 are women. That is quite shocking.</P>

      <P>They are very young women. When one considers the mortality rate from heart disease &ndash; more than 6,000 people every year &ndash; it really frightens me that young women are so cavalier about their health, and we have to take it seriously. The Minister for Health and Children recently embarked upon an anti-smoking campaign, and this is a factor that he will have to take into consideration. These are the mothers, the young women, who will be whipped by cancer if they continue to smoke. We must put in place the kind of health programmes that will look after women's health. If we cater for the good health and the well-being of women, we are catering for the good health and well-being of the next generation, of society and of children yet unborn. It is critically important that we address the three <Col N="906" /> areas I indicated here this evening in the spirit of putting equal value on women. When that is done, we can select whatever day we want to celebrate our achievement.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, let me send greetings to women friends all over the world. I send greetings to Irish women working with NGOs in Africa, in Mozambique at this moment, to women I know who have worked for years and are doing great work in the poorest and most deprived parts of the Third World. I salute them. I salute all women today, but I salute those women in particular and I send them greetings from this House.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator Norris on putting this motion before us. It is important to speak about women and the contribution they have made not only to home life but to their local communities and to society in general both socially and economically. It is only right and proper that we should recognise that.</P>
      <P>I fully support the notion of calling on the Minister to establish a holiday to value women's work, but I would have a problem with a paid holiday. I have a greater problem with the second part of the motion which calls on the Government to devise and implement the necessary statistical means to measure unpaid household, caring and community work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple reason is that no amount of money would pay somebody like my mother, who stayed at home and reared five children practically single-handed when her husband was out working up to 20 hours a day. The same is true of thousands of women like her who did such a fine job in difficult times economically.</P>
      <P>This debate is important because it gives us the opportunity to look at how far we have come. Not so long ago women, particularly those in the Civil Service, had to leave their jobs when they got married. That would seem strange to young women today, and we have come a long way.</P>
      <P>Implementing the terms of this motion would be a backward step. We have been talking about and trying to get equality for women for many years. Now we are trying to isolate them once again from their male counterparts by having a day specifically for women. I would fully support a national day for families, for couples or whatever, but I do not believe in segregating women and putting ourselves in the background where we will feel we are different and should be treated differently. That is what we have been trying to get away from. On that ground, I would not support this motion.</P>

      <P>I speak for many young women of my own generation who are in the workforce and who are very proud that they have achieved so much. Women have come a long way. I listened with great interest to Senator Henry who spoke about nurses. I am delighted she recognises that the nurses' strike last year had little to do with pay and much to do with conditions and the factors faced by women when they go out to work.</P>
      <P>We should encourage women to go out to work, but their home life should not be damaged as a result. I fully agree with Senator Henry that there should be greater flexibility in the workplace so that women can balance work and home commitments because they have a major contribution to make. Years ago men took little part in the rearing of their children but things have changed for the better in that fathers now have a greater influence on and are present during the rearing of their children. Despite that, mothers are still the primary carers of children. We can talk about equality all we like but the greatest hindrance to women in the workplace is the fact that they are mothers. Once a woman becomes a mother her children become her primary concern and there is no chance of true equality.</P>
      <P>I support the notion of a day of recognition where we value the contribution of women. I cannot support any decisions where inequality will result. We have come so far that it would be a mistake to go backwards. When women are mothers their children will always be their first priority and we must recognise that. With regard to equality, we must make it easier for women to be mothers and maintain their place in the workplace.</P>

      <P>I would like to think that all of us in the new Ireland are equal. During my lifetime I have been involved in many businesses and most of my senior management are ladies. They are focused and efficient and make a genuine effort to make a success of whatever challenge is before them.</P>
      <P>We must look to the new Ireland because we cannot go back to the world of the old Ireland. I remember speaking to a Mrs. Gammell before she died in 1998 at the age of 99 years. I asked her what was the biggest change in her lifetime and she looked up at the electricity bulb. She said that electrification changed life for everyone, particularly women's lives. We must acknowledge the massive contribution the invention of electricity made to her time and her life, but we must also look to the new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> Education has also played a major role and 1966 was important for men and women. Changes in education gave the poor man's son and daughter an opportunity to be educated and to be on an equal footing with the better off. The women of the past were in the same position as the labouring people of the world who were deprived of opportunity. Men did not get any opportunities if they did not take up a trade or continue their education in school. As someone who was in that position I know how difficult it was for ladies to make a breakthrough. At present, anyone with ability and determination is much sought after, whether they are male or female.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new Ireland, our President is a magnificent lady. Her predecessor, Mary Robinson, a former Senator, is also a great lady.</P>

I also salute Máire Geoghegan-Quinn who was a talented Member of Parliament. Deputy Síle de Valera is a Government Minister. The Minister of State, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, has played a major role in the Northern Ireland talks. Deputy Mary Hanafin has recently been appointed a Minister of State. We have had so many success stories in the Irish Parliament.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the Seanad is Deirdre Lane, an eminent lady who runs this House of the Oireachtas. Her assistant clerk is another lady, Jody Blake. Women make up 80% of the Seanad staff under Ms Lane's stewardship and they too are excellent ladies.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to my mother, who reared three children in very poor times. Her name was Brigid Flynn. My wife has reared four sons. She did not have the opportunity to go out to work because someone had to stay at home to look after our children. The principle reason for the creation of man and woman is to be good parents, give good example and to bring up children in a wholesome family environment. We may have careers but nothing comes before the obligation for which we are responsible, the creation of other individuals. I salute all of those ladies this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women have achieved enormous success in the music world. Examples of this are Dolores O'Riordan of the Cranberries and Dana, Ireland's first winner of the Eurovision Song Contest. We also have great sporting heroines <Col N="909" /> such as Sonia O'Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan, my dear neighbour. The Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis took place last weekend and that fabulous event was organised by our general secretary, a magnificent lady.</P>
    <P>Senator Ann Leonard is part of the younger generation and I treasure her views. We must take account of her point that everyone is on the one level playing pitch in the young, new, energetic and dynamic Ireland. If a person has the ability it will not matter if they are male or female.</P>
    <P>I am a member of Westmeath County Council and I am delighted to say that it is the first county council in Ireland to appoint a female county manager, Mrs. Anne McGuinness.</P>
    <P>At present there are many pluses and a lot of things happening. In the past women were not the only ones without opportunities. Everything was connected to education. I applaud the Government which decided to grant free school transport, giving opportunities to us all. Successive Governments have continued that scheme. A person must have ability and the determination to make their contribution. That is the way I see the new Ireland going and that is the way I see men and women playing their part in the Ireland of the future.</P>

      <P>I would be shot if I did not contribute to this motion tabled by Senator Norris and calling for St. Brigid's day to be the national women's day. My wife's name is Brigid and her birthday is on St. Brigid's day. I want to make sure if she looks at &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight that she will see me and say, &ldquo;There's my boy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy outlined the number of women who have come to the forefront in public and political life. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Wallace, who is present, is another lady who made it through a tough system which men dominate.</P>
      <P>I would hate to think of Ireland as a place where women are abused constantly, as has been suggested by some speakers. They have suggested that there is a hellish system trying to destroy women. That is not the Ireland of today. While it happens, it could easily happen to men as much as to women. A few cases highlighted in the newspapers, which I will not mention, illustrates my point.</P>
      <P>I do not object to a women's day, but where does one stop? Will it mean having a men's day, a grandfather's or a grandmother's day? I agree with Senator Leonard's point that women are different from men.</P>

      <P>Women must bear the children and, therefore, they have a different role in <Col N="910" /> life to men. It will be a long time before Senator Norris bears a child.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the motion, I do not like much of what has been said. I disagree with the suggestion that women are abused, held back and that there is no recognition of their role. I was born in a parish called Lispole and in 1944 a train service ran from Dingle to Tralee. The station master in Lispole was Kathleen Casey, a lady. At that time the post office was run by a postmistress, as it is to this day.</P>
      <P>Senator Cassidy said rightly that we are not holding back women. All legislation passed by this House while I have been a Member specifies that gender balance must be maintained. When the Senator and I were young the children of teachers became teachers and the children of labourers became labourers. The opportunity for advancement was not available. In my part of the country the doctors today are the sons and daughters of doctors and the teachers are the sons and daughters of teachers. When I was growing up the teachers in many national schools were husband and wife. Schools never had two men teachers. In my national school there were two women teachers and one man.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Cassidy I was poor in those days. My teacher used to look at me and say, &ldquo;Tomáisín boy, you'll be cutting worms&rdquo; which meant that I would be a farmer. He would never have said that to his son or daughter because they would become teachers or doctors.</P>
      <P>Senator Leonard referred to the introduction of free education in 1966. That gave people a break. It was too late for me, but not for my family. My two sons and a daughter are in good jobs and are progressing in their careers. Senator Cassidy pointed out that the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant and two of the three officials in the Seanad Office are women. There is only one man in the office &ndash; the poor devil has an awful problem all on his own in there.</P>
      <P>I wish the motion well, but I ask Senators not to depict Ireland as a place where women are kept down and abused. That is not done deliberately, nor is it done by legislation passed by this House. I have no problem with a national women's day. I hope it would be designated for my wife's birthday, St. Brigid's Day. However, does it mean that all women are to be paid for the day, regardless of whether they are working or not? It is a good idea, but I doubt if it will work.</P>
      <P>Things are different in other countries. On a visit to Seoul in South Korea, three women stood back and invited me to go into a lift first. That is their culture. I almost had to push them into the lift before me. Different countries have different cultures, but I would always allow women into the lift before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not disagree with the motion. It must be examined further. There is nothing wrong with a national women's day, but it will be a long time before it is designated as a bank holiday. I like <Col N="911" /> Senator Lanigan's idea of Nollaig na mBan. It is a big day in our town and parish and is celebrated with mass and a day off where all the shops close on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion as amended. I am delighted the House will not divide on it &ndash; it would be crazy to do so on such an issue. We are at one on the principle, although working out the details might be more difficult. The Minister of State has done much to address issues regarding inequality and the disabled. Perhaps she should be appointed to resolve what is at issue here. The motion is noteworthy and well thought out. It is a deserving subject for debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris said that Ireland is down the league of countries in terms of the number of bank holidays it has per annum. He may not have included our unofficial holidays at Christmas &ndash; perhaps they represent an Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>
      <P>We should consider holding bank holidays on days other than a Monday. This year St. Patrick's Day will be held on a Friday and perhaps there is a case to be made for switching some of the other public holidays from a Monday to a Friday. While that may be heresy in some cases, people in Dún Laoghaire do not like bank holidays falling on Mondays because it means their rubbish is not collected for a week.</P>
      <P>There is a problem evaluating the work women do in and outside the home, including community and care work. Some of the most active people who deal with local authorities are the members of residents' associations. They are also likely to get things done in that they will be in frequent contact to ensure their problems are dealt with quickly.</P>
      <P>I support the motion, as amended. More discussion will have to take place about the nuts and bolts of it. Perhaps there could be agreement about it in principle. I do not know if the date must be 1 February or if it is a moveable feast. Perhaps it was a date chosen by the promoters and there is flexibility. It would be a nice break between Christmas and St. Patrick's Day. There is also the question of financing and whether there should be a bonus payment. I support the motion, as amended. I am glad there has been such a common sense approach in the House and that we are not divided on it. However, we are not exactly sure how it should be worked out. Perhaps it could be taken from here and the Minister of State could discuss it with various interested groupings and bodies. I hope then that some progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is present for the conclusion of the debate because I know it is something close to her heart and in which she would take a sympathetic interest. I had the pleasure of working with her some years ago on the Joint <Col N="912" /> Committee on Women's Rights and we formed a good cross-party team, especially since I am not a member of a party. However, it worked well and it was the women on the committee who made it work because they ensured it did not become party political. The remarkable aspect about the committee was that it dealt with a series of complex issues and never divided along party lines. It is appropriate for that reason that the Minister of State is present.</P>
      <P>Politics is a kaleidoscope. We negotiated from early this morning with the Government side to get it to agree to a slight amendment to prevent the motion from going to a vote. It worked out perfectly at the last minute, so we can celebrate International Women's Day united in support of women. Another interesting part of the kaleidoscope is that, if the record is checked, it will probably be found that there were more speakers on the Government side. That is terrific, so I say well done to the Government side. Obviously there was a mixture of views and I did not agree with everything that was said. However, it is marvellous to have a little divergence. If that was not the case, everything would become bland, there would no opportunity to interrupt and that would really go to my heart.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Senator Leonard who spoke from the heart. She spoke of her mother in difficult times rearing five children. That is a reason for supporting this motion. Since Senator Leonard's mother was not supported, that is a cogent reason women today should be. My father died in 1950 and my mother received nothing, but if she had died, my father would have received a housekeeper's allowance. That shows that the system then recognised that women were of value to men but placed no value on the women as individuals. Thank God things have changed.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman spoke of women in the garment industry in the Far East. I remember when I tried to enter East Timor and we were illegally taken off a plane. We were dodging around and we stopped for a while in Surabaya where a factory belonging to an internationally known brand name was located. I investigated it and discovered from a courageous woman that they were being paid £1 a day for making shoes and other items of clothing which were being sold in the West for £90 to £100. That woman tried to organise to try to get workers a living wage and, within the past five to ten years, she was murdered at the instigation of that international corporation. That is the reality with which women in these parts of the world deal and I am glad Senator Jackman raised the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We received a few thousand petitions from individuals and groups &ndash; the number is more because many of the petitions are from groups which represent the views of between five and several hundred women. This is a massive response. I draw attention to the wonderful sight of the Public Gallery which is composed totally <Col N="913" /> of women. I salute the women and wish them a happy International Women's Day for what remains of it. I recognise some of those from the National Women's Council who are present in the gallery, Christine Ross, the new chief executive, Anne O'Donnell, who has been fighting there for as long as I can remember, Angela Ramsbottom and Susan McNaughton. If I made a good speech in opening the debate, and I hope I did some justice to it, it is thanks to Susan McNaughton and Ciara McKenna who provided much of the material and research for me.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that the National Women's Council did important work because it had included in both Partnership 2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness a commitment to develop the statistical methods to evaluate the full extent of the contribution of unpaid work, and that is terribly important. Paragraph 5.11 of Partnership 2000 states:</P>
    <P>The development of statistical methods to evaluate the full extent of the contribution of unpaid work, mainly done by women and their contributions to the national economy, including their contribution in the unremunerated and domestic sectors, will be undertaken during the course of this Partnership. The CSO will undertake a pilot study based on a time-use survey during 1997 as the first stage of this process.</P>
    <P>The pilot study was completed two years late. The Government did not fulfil its commitment beyond its first stage within the lifetime of the agreement. At the Beijing conference, it gave further commitments to conduct regular time-use surveys. As I remarked by intervention when Senator Leonard dissociated from this part, the Government has committed itself to it and it is part of its policy. We always welcome independent voices and Senator Leonard is welcome on this side, even though I might not agree with her views.</P>
    <P>This is something that has been happening worldwide. In the House of Representatives in America, for example, a Democrat Party representative, Barbara-Rose Collins from Michigan, introduced a Bill in 1993 called the Unremunerated Work Act. She said:</P>
    <P>The pillars of our economy are composed of an invisible force of unwaged workers. We reap the fruits of their labor, but ignore their existence. I want them recognized.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly enjoyed the speech of my good friend, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, because it brought a type of reality to the debate. He mentioned his locality, Lispole, and the postmistress there. However, he said some things with which I disagree. He seemed to suggest that we implied that Government legislation is marginalising women. That will need to be examined but I do not believe that was part of our argument. However, no one could deny that women are <Col N="914" /> abused in society. They are the victims of violence, rape and economic deprivation. How could any citizen of this country, woman or man, be satisfied with highly discriminatory wage policies? They exist and have been tabulated for us. That is why we want statistics. It is important we know that women are paid on average 30% less than men. Why is that? I remember when Máire Geoghegan-Quinn introduced the law decriminalising homosexual behaviour and mean-minded people on this side of the House tried to introduce a discriminatory age of consent. I will never forget what she said: that as a democrat and a member of an Irish Government and Parliament she would need solid, cogent, compelling reasons to introduce any element of discrimination against Irish citizens. That is a principle we should all support and it also operates in the area of wages for women. It is not to take anything away from men, but women should be given their due.</P>
    <P>Men internationally also support this call. I wish to put on record two quotations from men. One is from someone in the United Kingdom called Bob. He is obviously an Englishman &ndash; only Englishmen are called Bob. He said:</P>
    <P>I watched my mother ruin her health bring up us four children, virtually on her own, often without any house keeping money each week from my father. My mother worked not only in the home as a housewife, but in the many part time jobs she had to have to make up for the lack of house keeping. If she had been paid for all the work she did unpaid, life would have been a lot easier for her and her children as well.</P>
    <P>She perhaps could have taken the rest she so badly needed, and us four children could have eaten better and had some new clothes instead of everybody's hand me downs. But most important she could have spent more time with us instead of running off to her next part time job to earn today's dinner. This is why I support the Global Women's Strike, to recognise the tremendous amount of hard work women are putting in all unpaid to keep their families going.</P>
    <P>The second and final one is from Giorgio, an immigrant to the UK from Italy. He states:</P>
    <P>My mother recently died. Her death made me think more than I had done in the past about all the work she had done, in her family as a child, then taking care of me and my father and other relatives, as well as taking part in the Resistance, bringing food and messages to her brothers who were fighting the fascists. Her work gained very little recognition and no money. In supporting the women's strike I feel I'm paying homage to her memory. I will help spreading the word, translating the strike material into Italian.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> That is the spirit I recognise throughout this House. I was moved that Senator Leonard spoke about her family background and Senator Cassidy spoke about his mother, Brigid Flynn, who became Mrs. Brigid Cassidy and the difficult circumstances in which those remarkable women brought up their talented families. Like that Italian man, they would also want to recognise the work that was done in such difficult circumstances and which was not recognised or paid for.</P>
    <P>I am extremely glad we have managed to pass this resolution unanimously. It is now on the record of the Oireachtas and it is something on which we can build. I have no doubt that a new bank holiday will be introduced and the women of Ireland will be the first in the queue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, to the House. Newcastlewest, Ennis and Nenagh are situated approximately 25 miles from Limerick city. Ennis and Nenagh have benefited from the decentralisation of Government offices and Departments in recent years. However, that is not the reason I want decentralisation to Newcastlewest.</P>
      <P>Why do I want decentralisation to County Limerick and Newcastlewest? Newcastlewest has gone through a difficult time in recent years with many job losses in Neodata, Giro and Kostal. This has taken a toll on Newcastlewest, which is quickly becoming a satellite town of Limerick city. Thousands of jobs are available and people are finding it difficult to fill them. Newcastlewest has also lost its Objective One status. The communities in west Limerick, Newcastlewest and its hinterland are hugely dependent on agriculture. These are important reasons that Newcastlewest should be considered favourably for decentralisation.</P>
      <P>We have a lot to offer in Newcastlewest, which is the county town of Limerick. We have a good building which could be made available to the Government if the town was fortunate to be chosen for decentralisation. This building will not remain the property of its present owners for long given the current housing market and the problems in the construction industry. That is why I am anxious to stake a claim for decentralisation to Newcastlewest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A submission was presented to me recently from Newcastlewest Community Council which I <Col N="916" /> will present to the Minister. We are all conscious of the need for a clean environment. We can boast of that in Newcastlewest which is the home of the world renowned Ballygowan. Newcastlewest offers a unique quality of life and outstanding commercial, educational and leisure opportunities coupled with a friendly and active populace. Its excellent geographical position with a road network puts more business, education and leisure activities within easy reach. We are also within easy reach of Shannon Airport, Cork Airport and Farranfore. We have top class educational institutions and a wide range of sporting activities and facilities. The special needs of the mentally and physically challenged in our community are also well served.</P>
    <P>Newcastlewest has recently benefited from urban renewal tax incentives which are important in attracting people to live in the area. There is a wide range of affordable housing and sites in the town compared to Limerick city. Sites are not available in the city and houses are more expensive than in Newcastlewest. The number of houses under construction or awaiting planning decisions means that 600 to 700 units will be provided in the near future. In addition, many building sites are available with 90 acres of land zoned residential.</P>
    <P>We also have good educational facilities from pre-schools to third level education. Special needs education is provided at Courtenay boys' national school and the vocational school. Training and employment for adults is provided by the Brothers of Charity and west Limerick community workshop. There is easy access to third level education in Limerick city because the University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology are only a short drive from Newcastlewest. There is a school of music in Newcastlewest and an international Celtic school of languages will be opened in June 2000. We are proud of this development which will be a huge boost to the town.</P>
    <P>There is a great community spirit in Newcastlewest and in the many villages and towns dotted around it. This spirit was recognised in recent years and months when some towns and villages were given national awards of which we are proud. There is also a low crime rate in Newcastlewest. If we attracted good Government jobs to Newcastlewest, it would benefit it and the surrounding towns and villages where teaching posts, post offices and other services we would like to keep are under threat. Such jobs would transform the area.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is a national cake of which we in west Limerick would like our fair share. We have lost out in recent times through not securing industrial jobs and losing our Objective One status. Decentralisation would be a boost to Newcastlewest, its hinterland and County Limerick. I appeal to the Minister of State to give favourable consideration to the submission from Newcastlewest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cregan for raising the important issue of decentralisation. From discussions we have had, I am aware of the Senator's commitment to attracting this project to his area and I know he has been monitoring developments.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced in his Budget Statement the Government's intention to embark on a new and radical programme of decentralisation with the transfer of the maximum number of public sector jobs from Dublin. In pursuit of this policy, the Government intends to relocate almost entire Government Departments, offices and other public bodies to provincial centres. It is intended that the forthcoming programme will, for the first time, involve non-commercial State sponsored bodies. The Minister's budget announcement endorses the commitment set out in the reviewed Action Programme for the Millennium to a policy of balanced regional development and set as a key priority the channelling of public sector jobs into provincial areas.</P>
      <P>The current programme of decentralisation, which is expected to be completed in the early part of next year, will involve the relocation of over 4,000 civil servants from Dublin to a large number of provincial locations. The impact of this programme cannot be underestimated given that it involves almost 20 towns and cities throughout the country. In Senator Cregan's county, over 500 staff have already relocated to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>The issue of decentralisation is one in which I have a particular interest, given the tremendous contribution made by my Department and the Office of Public Works in the provision of office accommodation. I am particularly enthusiastic about the proposals to proceed with such a significant programme and, through the involvement of my office, I intend to keep in close contact with the programme as it develops. I have seen in my constituency the benefits which a community can derive from the relocation of a Government office. I assure the House of my personal commitment to ensuring, in whatever way I can, the successful implementation of the forthcoming programme of decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost 50% of all civil servants are now located outside Dublin and while decentralisation cannot account for all of that it has played a major part and has contributed significantly to a greater geographical spread of Government services. All regions of the country have benefited from the Government's policy on decentralisation and it would be the Government's intention that any new programme would maintain that policy. As Senator Cregan stated, it is obvious that the addition of new jobs to an area, whether through decentralisation or otherwise, gives a positive economic boost to the area. New jobs result in increased economic growth and better use of <Col N="918" /> existing, and often underused, local infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has begun a process of consultation with his colleagues in Government with a view to identifying almost complete Departments, offices and other bodies which could be included in the new programme. The Minister hopes that this element of the process will be completed in time for decisions on a significant new programme to be taken by the summer. In developing a new programme the Minister has in mind a number of objectives including the promotion of regional development, the reduction of congestion in Dublin, the establishment of a more even spread of public sector jobs around the country and the procurement of office accommodation at lower cost than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government are, however, conscious of the need to maintain the efficiency of service delivery in determining the locations of Government services and the functions which can be efficiently relocated. Sections of Government Departments and offices which are decentralised must be of a certain size to be viable and sufficiently self-contained to be able to function effectively outside of Dublin. It is essential also that adequate management control is maintained.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's personal commitment and that of the Government towards the principle of decentralisation, it is worth cautioning against any impression that a new wave of decentralisations to multiple provincial locations is imminent. It is vitally important that all the issues relating to decentralisation are fully considered before decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>Appropriate blocks of work have to be identified, staff have to be selected and trained and suitable accommodation has to be sourced. These issues take time and it is important to bear this in mind. On the basis of previous experience it takes about two years from the date of a decision to relocate staff to their taking up position in the new building. I say this not to demonstrate any lack of enthusiasm on the part either of the Minister for Finance or the Government but simply to emphasise that after decisions are taken it will be some time before staff arrive in their new locations.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I are grateful to the many public representatives who have been in touch with us recently on the subject of decentralisation and we are anxious to acknowledge the impressive cases which have been advanced for many potential locations. I acknowledge the tremendous effort which has gone into these submissions and I reassure those who have been making representations that these cases will be considered fully by the Government as part of the consultative process which has been initiated.</P>
    <P>In that context, Senator Cregan can be assured that the case now being made by him for the inclusion of Newcastle West and Kilmallock in any new programme has been noted and will be <Col N="919" /> considered fully in the context of the consultative process on which the Minister has embarked. I will ensure that his submission will be given full consideration by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Manning.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who is probably aware that a number of pre-school child care regulations were introduced approximately three years ago. These were noteworthy and well thought out and, in an ideal world, they would prove suitable in terms of the care of children in pre-school facilities, crèches, etc. I know the Minister of State has a personal interest in this area and she will be aware that the reality of the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the regulations is different. It is on that basis I am seeking to ensure that a common sense approach is taken, particularly in relation to the application of the regulations. When considering this matter recently I came to the conclusion that if the city fire officer was to be totally vigilant a number of our courts would not be in operation, particularly at call-over time when they are overcrowded and constitute a fire hazard.</P>
      <P>Various people, friends and others, who are involved in child care provision in the city centre and in my constituency have contacted me about the way the regulations operate at present. In my view, the bottom line should be the welfare of children. We should not be overly concerned about the square footage of space available or about one person being delegated to mind three babies. I accept that a qualified person might be able to care for four or five children but there are some people whom I would not trust with one baby never mind two or three. In that context, a common sense approach must be adopted in relation to adherence to the regulations.</P>
      <P>We must accommodate people who have operated child care facilities for many years and who have a tremendous track record. If they have not complied with certain regulations by a particular date, some of these people will be forced to close their facilities. We must use common sense, particularly in view of the fact that people are obliged to carry out renovations, put in place new facilities, employ additional staff, care for various categories of children, namely, those aged less than 12 months and toddlers and ensure that there is an adequate child to carer ratio.</P>
      <P>Problems have arisen because people have been obliged to carry out renovations to their facilities. In discussing this matter with the health board, I urge the Minister to request that a common sense approach be adopted. Quite a number of the crèches to which I refer have been in operation for many years and the people who attended them and who have now grown up can provide testimony of the good care they received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> A number of parents in certain areas have been discommoded because the health board has moved in and informed the owner of a facility to either close down or carry out a long list of renovations, many of which often prove uneconomic or impractical to do within the time allowed. In last Sunday's <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> Emily O'Reilly mentioned some of these aspects. She also highlighted the fact that there have been complaints involving more serious matters than whether children have the requisite amount of space provided for by the regulations. I am sure the Minister of State and her officials have seen this article and it is important that she responds to it. It seems that, on the one hand, we are getting worked up about the fact that there are six children in a room which is six inches less in length than allowed for by the regulations, or that there are ten toddlers in a room when there should be only nine. Most of the people who run crèches are dedicated, hard working and try to employ high quality staff, and it is important that there is a balance in dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>The regulations, which have only recently been introduced, deal with a wide range of issues such as the development of children, notice to be given by persons carrying on pre-school services, registration, heating, ventilation, lighting and so on. However, the welfare of children should be paramount. Prescribing issues such as square footage, the size of hand basins and so on can be dealt with, but I am more concerned that people are allowed to communicate with health boards and that the boards respond positively and provide a reasonable length of time in which to carry out necessary improvements. I hope the Minister of State will also respond to the allegations which are far more serious, if found to be true.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing time. I welcome the Minister of State and wish her well. I am happy to support Senator Cosgrave as this is one of the most important issues facing society and from which a number of matters flow. The provision of proper crèche and child care facilities is central to making a reality of the concept of equality for mothers who wish to work outside the home. It is also a major element of Government policy that shortages in the labour force are addressed in this way. There has been a dramatic increase in the demand for crèche places and we would not have had this debate ten or 15 years ago when supply outstripped demand. There is a huge demand at present but Senator Cosgrave rightly stated that the welfare of children is paramount.</P>

    <P>There must be regulations but there is a danger that they will be governed by prevailing and, perhaps, outdated standards. This issue has become bigger than most imagined. The regulations are new and pretty mechanistic and there may be a need for the Minister of State to engage in a wider consultative approach and to apply energy and imagination to this matter. It should be poss<Col N="921" /> ible to bring about a rapid expansion in the number of places and to provide for the training of staff and the safety of children, without adopting an unduly mechanistic approach. I know the school referred to in Emily O'Reilly's article, but it seems that this highlights the conflict at the heart of this issue. I compliment Senator Cosgrave for raising this important matter which I am confident the Minister of State will be able to address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Ms Hanafin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning for his kind remarks and Senator Cosgrave for raising this issue in which I have had an interest for some time. We all share the desire that the welfare of children should be paramount in all our dealings and in the rules and regulations we enforce. That is the reason the regulations were introduced.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the notification to and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. The Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to these provisions came into operation on 31 December 1996. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, child minders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
      <P>The regulations do not just refer to space requirements. Their purpose is to build on existing high standards in pre-school services, to improve standards throughout the sector, to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service. On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person. The requirement to reduce places is mainly related to the availability of adequate space per child in the premises and/or the requirement to have a sufficient number of competent adults supervising the pre-school children in the service at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where deficiencies are identified, the health board and the providers work in a co-operative manner and adopt a common sense approach to make specific improvements in a planned way, provided that any delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children. People have been given some time to enforce the regulations and have not been asked to enforce them immediately. The plan may include a reduction in numbers achieved through natural reduction, that is not replacing children who leave through the year, reducing numbers on a phased basis, reducing numbers at the beginning of the next school year or by the provider moving to a larger premises. The timescale for making improvements may <Col N="922" /> vary from a requirement for immediate action if the health and safety of children is at risk, or may extend to six months if it is appropriate to use a phased approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning referred to the expansion in demand for child care places. The Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of places for child care. A number of initiatives are being taken in this regard. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was allocated £250 million to develop child care over the next seven years under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006. This funding will facilitate the child care measures announced in budget 2000.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the new measures are an increase in the quantity of child care places and an improvement in the quality of services. These measures comprise the equal opportunities child care programme, which includes grant supports to establish, upgrade, enhance and staff community-based child care facilities; capital grants for private providers of child care catering for up to 20 places; grants to develop local child care networks; and supports to enhance national voluntary child care organisations which provide advice, support and training to child care service providers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is finalising the criteria and eligibility requirements for the grant schemes and intends to begin promoting the initiatives shortly in the national media. In addition, it was announced in budget 2000 that accelerated capital allowances at the rate of 100% in the first year will apply to expenditure incurred on and from 1 December 1999 on child care facilities which meet to required standards, as provided for under the Child Care (Pre-school Services) Regulations, 1996. The allowances are also subject to clearance by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the child care measures is being facilitated by the establishment of an interdepartmental committee on child care, a national co-ordinating child care committee and county child care committees. My Department is represented on the interdepartmental committee on child care and on the national co-ordinating child care committee. The health boards are represented on the national co-ordinating child care committee and the county child care committees will be led by the relevant health boards. These committees will liaise locally and nationally on child care.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991, in regard to the promotion and welfare of children and the provision of family support services. Funding of approximately £3.9 million, capital and revenue, was provided by the health boards towards these services in 1999. An additional <Col N="923" /> £1.75 million is being provided in 2000. A small number of grants are also normally made available from national lottery funding.</P>
    <P>I share the views of Senators Cosgrave and Manning. A common sense approach is being <Col N="924" /> taken in working with both the providers and the health boards, and I hope that will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 March 2000.</P>
