      <P>I have notice from Senator Quinn that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to consider an educational campaign in conjunction with retailers in advance of introducing a tax on plastic bags to ensure that the tax results in lower usage of bags rather than an increase in inflation.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed Order of Business is No. 2, Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, which will be followed by No. 3, International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1999 &ndash; all Stages, by agreement. I do not propose a sos but we will review progress at 1 p.m. and if one Bill is concluded, we can have a sos. The afternoon's business will be interrupted at 6 p.m. for item 19, motion 23 in the name of the Independent Senators. The afternoon's business will be resumed at 8 p.m. unless previously concluded.</P>
      <P>There were requests yesterday for a debate on the economy and on inflation. I contacted the Minister for Finance but, unfortunately, he is not available today. He also has a European Council meeting next week so his availability is restricted. However, he would welcome the opportunity to come to the House if time can be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is well aware that the Minister for Finance has been one of the most available Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy Leader should send in the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste. She will do fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my answer to a matter on which requests were made.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Quinn's request, I contacted the Government Chief Whip about the Electronic Commerce Bill. He is anxious to conclude that matter in the Dáil as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards a short debate on inflation, I accept the Minister for Finance is not available today. I also accept his good faith because he has always been willing to come into the House. This debate is urgent and vital but it should be a calm debate because the issue is too serious to be the subject of point scoring. I would like a debate early next week on this subject so people have time to prepare for it and the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or another senior Minister is available. I accept the good faith of the Deputy Leader on this matter. He has assured me he is doing everything he can to ensure there will be an early debate and I am willing to accept his word.</P>
      <P>As regards No. 1, will the Deputy Leader indicate if the ongoing negotiations to try to find a compromise so this legislation can be dealt with in the House in the way all private Bills are dealt with can be expedited because we are growing tired of the sight of it on the Order Paper? I know the Deputy Leader has endeavoured to talk sense where it counts on this matter. Perhaps he could indicate today or tomorrow the present position of that Bill.</P>
      <P>Given that we are coming to the end of this session, will the Deputy Leader indicate tomorrow what business it is proposed to bring to the House and which the Government wishes to have cleared between now and then? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the items to be taken today. However, I am disappointed with the Deputy Leader's reply in that he has not been able to facilitate a debate on inflation. A debate on this issue is crucially important. The answer to high inflation for the vast majority of people outside the House and for many people inside it is to give people more money. However, that will make the situation worse. An informed debate is required so the issue can be teased out to encourage people to respond in a controlled and focused way. For once I am on the same side as Senator Ross. The debate should not be dependent on the Minister for Finance. Any Minister should know <Col N="1135" /> what is happening with inflation and if he or she does not, I would be extremely worried.</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business so that the first item to be taken today be a debate on inflation with a Minister present. Any Minister should be able to answer our questions. With the social partnership falling apart, the situation will get worse. This type of relaxed attitude where the Minister for Finance can go away for two weeks, which he must do as part of his business, and everything stops, is not good enough. It does not give the correct signal as it appears to indicate we do not care. Whereas many of us in this House, and indeed even on these benches, would have different views about the approaches to it, that is not the issue at this stage. We need to at least focus on those points of difference and of agreement to try to give the Government an edge forward on this issue. I formally propose that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the proposal to amend the Order of Business so that we can have a debate on inflation today. We raised this matter strongly yesterday. We did not expect that we would have a definite date on when the debate would take place but we are now told that it is totally up in the air, that the Minister for Finance will not be here today or tomorrow and that he is not available next week either. That is not acceptable. This is the same Minister for Finance who has got it so wrong in terms of inflation over the past six months. It is appropriate that we have the Minister for Finance in this House and I want to see him here because it is the Minister for Finance who is mouthing off abroad about his position and castigating anybody who is critical of him. He is now the person who has been found to be out of order and I second the amendment that we amend the Order of Business to have a debate on inflation, unless the Leader of the House can come back to us with some definite proposal.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on motion No. 6, that Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to publish a White Paper on early childhood education. The White Paper has been promised for the past two years. This motion has been on the Order Paper for about a year. There was a report in the newspapers yesterday from Barnardos and UNICEF to the effect that a quarter of Irish children live in poverty and that there are serious problems to address in relation to education, child care facilities and crèches. It is very difficult for mothers to go out to work if child care facilities are not available. The whole area of early education and child care facilities should be addressed and indeed it would be relevant in the context of examining the problem of inflation and where money should be spent that would not give rise to inflation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally irresponsible to ask the Minister for Finance to ignore his responsi<Col N="1136" /> bilities in Europe to come to the Seanad on account of a request&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is typical Fianna Fáil. Nobody is asking any member of Government or other Minister&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator O'Toole, and as a good teacher he should not interrupt me. It is totally irresponsible to call on the Minister for Finance to ignore his responsibilities in Europe to come to a debate in this House. The Deputy Leader has said the Minister is willing to come and that a suitable date will be arranged. That is an important decision for the Minister and for this House and we should accept it.</P>
      <P>I want to raise two other issues, one of which concerns the medical profession and the recent scandal that has been exposed both in this country and in the United Kingdom. I ask the Deputy Leader to bring it to the Minister's attention and perhaps he could come into the House for a debate on this matter so that we can question whether self-regulation is appropriate. Should we have a foolproof licensing system here in light of the fact that people in the medical profession travel throughout the EU, Australia, America and Canada? Public confidence in this area has been dashed and we should have an informed debate on it. Perhaps the Minister could bring in a new system of regulation and licensing for the medical profession.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader of the House send our compliments to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach on the extraordinary deal with Libya regarding the live export trade from this country to Libya? That is a most welcome development and is worth up to £100 million to the farming community. This has been tried by many people over many years; indeed, some people thought they had clinched a deal in the past but they had not. It was done on Friday last by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I compliment him on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the Order of Business. We are in the midst of a deepening economic crisis. It is not just one set of inflation figures. It is an economic crisis, and what is left of the Government's economic policy is in tatters. We may disagree about the benefits of what the Government calls the social contract or programme, but it is certainly in danger, if it is not dead. If that is not a crisis, and if this House does not want to debate it at this time, the relevance of this House is becoming questionable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister for Finance has come into this House on many occasions to debate financial matters. However, is it not extraordinary that we should say he has been very good about coming into one of the Houses of the Oireachtas to debate a matter which concerns his own portfolio? He ought to be here, and we <Col N="1137" /> should not be grateful for it. We should not even take note of it.</P>
    <P>I accept what Senator O'Toole says. Let us welcome the Taoiseach into this House. Let us welcome the Tánaiste or any other Minister to debate this urgent matter. When the Minister for Finance has come in, he has left, quite understandably, after a very short time, leaving a Minister of State. We are used to being treated to Ministers of State in this House, and that is regrettable. Why the sudden urge to have a full day with the Minister for Finance when no Minister, or very few Ministers, stay here for a Second Stage debate or a debate on a motion? Let us have him here, and if we cannot have him, let us debate the crisis with either of the other two people who really matter, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste. Maybe the Leader of the House could ask the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste to come in.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the main Opposition party's contention that it is acceptable this should be delayed. I understand we are to break up on 29 June. That is tomorrow fortnight. If we do not have a debate on it this week or next week, the Government, with its nimble political manoeuvring, will be able to kick to touch and kick inflation out into the summer. We do not want that. We want a debate before that.</P>

      <P>Exactly three weeks ago today, I asked the Leader of the House to arrange for the Minister for Education to come to the House to debate a specific educational issue &ndash; the qualification of persons selected to correct examination papers. By that I mean the State examinations, the junior and leaving certificates. That debate did not take place. I am very concerned that every possible step should be taken to guarantee ongoing public confidence in every element of our examination system and that the integrity of the examination system should be upheld.</P>

      <P>We cannot have a debate on the matter now. I know it is important but it is a matter that could be raised more appropriately on the Adjournment or by way of a motion. I cannot allow the Senator to go into such detail on this matter on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the situation will be in relation to this year's examination, but this is an ongoing problem. I repeat my request to the Deputy Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Education to come to the House to discuss this matter at the first opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No one understands, despite so many dire warnings from different quarters over quite some time, why the Government has taken no action whatsoever to deal with inflation which is at its highest point in 15 years, in excess of 5% and still rising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made yesterday and again this morning on that subject.</P>
      <P>On a different issue, I read this morning about the extraordinary information which the Tánaiste said the authorised officer, Mr. Gerry Ryan, was able to find out in relation to another matter. A number of reports have been completed, according to a newspaper report. There is no record or anything that would lead us to believe that these reports have been presented to Government. If not, why not? I also wonder about publication. I ask the Deputy Leader to tell me about publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for a lengthy preamble. The Senator can ask the Deputy Leader a brief question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator likes to amble. He ambles quite a lot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably a separate subject but if the Deputy Leader wishes to link them in his response that I will understand and be appreciative. We are led to believe that some Irish citizens are sheltering behind offshore companies and, as we have come to know, this is impeding progress on the part of some State agencies or other institutions that have been set up. This is not good enough. I would like to know if the Government has any legislative proposals in the pipeline to deal with these matters, particularly in the area of company law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised with the Leader some time ago an item of concern that was brought to my attention by members of the Garda Síochána in relation to the antiquated system of identification parades. I asked him to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to ask him to make a statement or make some policy change in relation to it. The idea that a woman who has been raped or a child who has been molested should have to face down the possible perpetrator of the crime is outrageous and the system should be changed.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government on the commitment it gave during the week to mainstream service delivery for people with disabilities. This measure will significantly advance the status and quality of life for these people.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Members regularly call for urgent debates. Senator Ross touched on this very clearly today when he said that we had a debate on inflation 13 days ago, but we urgently need another debate because the position has changed dramatically in 13 days. I know the <Col N="1139" /> Deputy Leader will say it is only 13 days since the Minister came in here but the situation has changed. I support the call by Senators O'Toole and Costello for a debate on inflation today. So many proposals are being made that would not help improve the situation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to draw the following matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This morning Senator Finneran said we should not ask a Minister to ignore his responsibilities in Europe, which is a very interesting term. On 26 June, which is less than two weeks away, the OSPAR conference will take place in Denmark. The Government has tabled a motion at that conference to close Sellafield or cease reproduction there. The Danes have also tabled a motion about it. There is a danger that we will fall between two stools if two motions are submitted. The Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, does not plan to attend this conference. If we want to achieve success at this conference, and the Minister of State is anxious to do that, then we should at least make sure that one motion goes forward. The Irish motion might be the best or perhaps it is the Danish one. Either way we should make sure that this matter gets our full attention. The Deputy Leader should draw the Minister's attention to the fact that it is urgent for someone to attend this conference and to make sure that we find a compromise.</P>
      <P>I am sure it is in order for me to congratulate Senator Ross on becoming a grandfather this weekend. I know the House will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Costello, in relation to the reports on child poverty that have emanated this week. I ask the Deputy Leader to request the Minister responsible or some member of the Government to come here, not to have a debate because I do not have all the answers but to make a statement on the Government's intent in this regard. All of us have represented this State abroad and have done so well. We have proudly boasted about Irish economic success but this is our Achilles' heel &ndash; 50% of Irish children live below the poverty line. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and UNICEF have talked about the issue and I cannot understand why this problem still exists under current economic conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want a debate, I want a statement from the Government about what it is doing to address the situation so that the public perception that the Government does not care will not arise. The Government does care and the Minister for Health and Children is a com<Col N="1140" /> passionate person. I ask the Deputy Leader to make an hour available in the short time left before the recess for statements on the matter as a sign of our concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader of the House bring to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs the concern of pensioners and social welfare recipients at the increase in inflation? Their incomes, miserable as they are, will have even less purchasing power unless immediate action is taken.</P>
      <P>Will he also bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the need for urgent legislation to prevent the removal of deceased persons' organs without the knowledge or consent of their relatives? This is a cause of great distress for parents. Protocols must be established in all hospitals pending the immediate introduction of such legislation. It is an unacceptable practice and we must not allow it to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Finneran in the congratulations he extended to the Government, the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for reopening the beef trade with Libya. Will the Deputy Leader provide time for a debate on agriculture before the summer recess?</P>
      <P>Recently there has been a great deal of publicity about genetically modified rape seed in this State and in Europe. It is time to express a clear opinion on the matter. If a section of the agricultural community wants to produce food from genetically modified seed so be it, but there may be other sectors which do not wish to do so. There must be clear definitions for both genetically and non-genetically modified produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Kett's call for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take action on identification parades. The present system is Dickensian. This society professes concern for the welfare of victims but this demonstrates the opposite. We are causing more trauma to victims than to professional criminals. It is about time we changed the system to remove the fear and stress due process causes for the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>There are other victims in society. Leaving certificate students can find themselves victimised by well known bullies in the middle of their examinations. The Minister for Education and Science must ask himself how he can protect students doing their examinations from being bullied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quill's remarks on the correction of examination papers. This time of year is difficult enough for students at second level without further stress being caused by the way their examination papers are being marked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House to explain the situation that prevailed this <Col N="1141" /> year for children with special needs who applied for assistance with examinations? Most of them applied for that assistance 18 months ago but many of them were assessed only three weeks before the examinations. They were obliged to wait until two weeks before the examinations commenced to discover whether assistance would be provided and it was impossible for them to practise using tapes, recording equipment, etc., in such a short period. I speak from personal experience in respect of this matter and, in my opinion, the system of assessing these children's needs must be changed for the future.</P>
    <P>I support calls for a debate on inflation. We discussed this matter two weeks ago but a further debate should be held in order that Independent Senators might put forward their solutions to the problem. On the last occasion, Senator Ross, who is very knowledgeable and highly respected&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He is also misguided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;spoke at length on this problem but he never offered a solution. I hope he will be given an opportunity to put forward such a solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's request that the Minister for Finance give special consideration to people in receipt of social welfare payments, retired persons on low incomes and those on low pay. Rich people can overcome the effects of inflation quite easily. However, the essence and evil of inflation is that it is a tax on the poor.</P>

      <P>The French will be taking over the Presidency of the EU at the end of the month and many of the issues which will be discussed during the next six months &ndash; including qualified majority voting and our status within an extended European Union &ndash; will have a major impact on Ireland. Unfortunately, during the past six to 12 months, 90% of applicant countries have concentrated their energies on joining NATO and drawing up a defence treaty. The representatives of these nations are obsessed with defence and they tend to ignore the problems that will arise in the agriculture industry in Ireland and other member states of the EU following their accession. There are seven million farmers in the EU at present but Poland, which is one of the applicant countries to which I refer, is home to a further seven million farmers. This matter has not been addressed in the context of the effect it will have on an extended EU.</P>
      <P>Apparently the applicant countries are totally committed to discussing defence policies and what they perceive as their need to be defended from attack by Russia, Germany or some other state. The EU is not addressing the difficulties which will result from the extension of the Union, particularly those which will affect the economic future of farmers in Ireland and other existing member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> This morning the Irish bishops again criticised the Government's policy on refugees and asylum seekers. They have continually attacked the Government for what they perceive as its failure to fulfil its moral obligations. In my opinion many of the difficulties associated with the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers could be solved if the church provided such accommodation in a number of its vacant monasteries and convents throughout the country. Negotiations should take place with the bishops to discover if the Roman Catholic hierarchy has a part to play in accommodating asylum seekers while their applications are under review. There is a need to give careful consideration to this matter.</P>

      <P>I reiterate that it would be more appropriate to raise a number of the issues to which Members referred on the Adjournment. I note that this morning only one Member gave notice of a matter they wish to raise on the Adjournment. However, I am not stating that Members should refrain from raising issues on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>With regard to the call for a debate on inflation which was made by Senators Manning, Costello and others and in respect of which Senator O'Toole has tabled an amendment to the Order of Business, a statement was made that the Government is taking a relaxed attitude to recent increases in inflation. That is not the case because the Government could not afford to adopt such an attitude.</P>

I will make every effort to ensure that a debate on this important issue takes place. I note that the Government intends to meet the ICTU and the social partners to discuss this matter and measures will be announced tomorrow in respect of the housing problem. That is an indication of the Government's concern about the problem of inflation. I will make every effort to ensure this debate will be held at the earliest possibly opportunity. It would be preferable for the Minister for Finance to be present for the debate but, in the event that he is unable to attend, we will seek another senior Minister to take the debate.</P>

      <P>Senators Costello and Mooney raised the White Paper on early childhood education and the issue of child poverty. Senator Mooney stated that he would be anxious to see the Government producing a statement on the matter. Senator Costello has tabled No. 19, motion 6 in regard to the White Paper, and I will endeavour to see whether this debate can be arranged. We have only two weeks left in the session and we must establish priorities in regard to our legislative programme which overrides all other matters. It will be a question then of trying to find time to debate secondary matters, inflation being the primary topic to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran raised an important point about the medical profession. Obviously, there is concern about a particular individual and the issuance of incorrect pathology results. The Government is currently reviewing the medical practitioners legislation and a working group has been established to consider how recruitment procedures for locum consultants might be tightened.</P>
      <P>I join Senators Finneran and Callanan in welcoming the announcement of the reopening of the live cattle trade to Libya. This should not come as a surprise to the Opposition because Deputy Yates, when he was Minister for Agriculture, announced that the market was opening on the morning of the general election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Quinn and Bonner raised the matter of the qualifications required to correct examination papers and Senator Bonner spoke about the treatment of students with special needs. I heard the Minister for Education and Science speaking earlier this morning about the possibility that final year students or new graduates would be brought in to correct papers. It must be emphasised that the papers in question are junior certificate papers, not leaving certificate papers. Some 60,000 students are sitting papers in civics, social and political science and it may be necessary to <Col N="1144" /> recruit additional people to mark those examinations. That will be done under strict supervision and I am sure high standards will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of the inspectors' reports for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Senator will be aware that several of the reports are the subject of High Court proceedings, thereby precluding us from commenting on them. I will certainly inform the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of his concerns to ensure that this matter is expedited. The Minister would be very concerned that that should happen.</P>

I will bring the Senators' views to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>I, too, welcome the mainstreaming of disability services.</P>
      <P>I will bring Senator Quinn's views on the environment and on the OSPAR conference to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to try to ensure that we attend and that the points made by Senator Quinn are raised.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt with the question of child poverty which was raised by Senator Mooney. I share Senator O'Dowd's concern about the effect of inflation on pensioners and social welfare recipients. It would be wrong of me not to. However, the increases granted in the budget are broadly in line with the present level of inflation, high as it is. This is not to say that increases should not be in advance of inflation. It is important that people who have contributed so well to the State should be taken care of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 3, after &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see this important and desirable legislation, which deals with trade union recognition, passing through the House. This amendment relates to the core of the Bill, section 2, which allows the Labour Court to investigate a trade dispute where it is satisfied about a number of items, the first being, as section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) states, where:</P>
      <P>it is not the practice of the employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used by the parties concerned have failed to resolve the dispute.</P>
      <P>The reason I am seeking to insert the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; is that in a number of cases no such procedures are in place. The amendment seeks to make provision for the possibility that no internal dispute procedures may be available and, if so, the amendment would cover that eventuality. It would tidy up the legislation somewhat if the words &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; were inserted in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to accept this amendment. With your permission, a Chathaoirligh, I will make some brief opening remarks concerning this important legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the special fall-back provision in the findings of the high level group established under paragraph 9.22 of Partnership 2000. The provision involves the Labour Court examining matters in dispute where three specific criteria have been met. They are, one, the failure of an employer to follow the steps outlined in the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution; two, the failure of appropriate internal procedures and mechanisms to resolve the issue; and three, the absence of industrial action during the process. These criteria are in the context of a dispute where negotiating arrangements are not in place and where collective bargaining fails to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having encouraged both sides to agree this compromise, I am obviously anxious that we should maintain the spirit and intent that existed in the high level group's report. On Second Stage, I referred to the fact that an agreed approach in resolving disputes where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place had eluded employers and unions over a very long time. I further indicated that a review process had been agreed as part of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Any changes to the measured approach taken in the Bill should ideally come <Col N="1147" /> from that review. As the Minister with responsibility for labour affairs, I have encouraged consensus on this issue through dialogue between IBEC and ICTU. Both sides recognise that an imposed solution conflicts with the voluntary approach which is central to our industrial relations system.</P>
    <P>The resulting report of the high level group set out a preferred approach as encapsulated in the new code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. This fall back procedure described in the Bill culminates in a finding from the Labour Court which can be enforced through the Circuit Court. The requirement that there would be no recourse to industrial action was agreed by the social partners and is covered in sections 2 and 8 in the Bill. The Government has agreed to implement the high level group report as a total package.</P>
    <P>Regarding the amendment, it would be usual for dispute resolution procedures to be either in written form or established through custom and practice. In a situation where the Labour Court might find a complete absence of procedures, the amendment would ensure that the court is not constrained in hearing the case. Therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 7, after &ldquo;1990&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(or any code of practice amending or replacing that code)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is an attempt to improve the legislation. Section 2(1)(<i>b</i>) relates to cases where the court may intervene where an employer has failed to observe a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution under section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. The amendment seeks the insertion of &ldquo;or any code of practice amending or replacing that code&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, a high level group is considering this area. I am not sure if the group's report is at draft or final stage but it may contain recommendations regarding the amendment of the existing code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution under the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. The amendment makes provision for the possibility of changes in the code of practice which may emanate from this and other developments in the future. It is appropriate to include this technical amendment to take into account the possibility that the code of practice may be altered in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's point. I will outline the position because it is a matter of ensuring the procedure is right. At any time, there will be a single code of practice in force on voluntary dispute resolution. Any amending code <Col N="1148" /> will result in the revocation of the old code. This is the practice in legislation and the precedent. For example, when SI 146/2000 on a code of practice on grievance and disciplinary procedures was brought into effect, the code of practice on disciplinary procedures, SI 117/1996, was revoked. There is no need to include the amendment.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to co-operate with the House and if the Senator insisted on the inclusion of the amendment, I would consider it. However, it is important to point out that there is no legal requirement for it and I would be happier if the Senator withdrew it. The position in practice is that if a new code is introduced, the old code falls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. However, the Bill provides for a specific code of practice. What will happen if an amendment to the code is made? There is no provision in the Bill to deal with a proposed variation of the code of practice. The perception is that the <i>status quo</i> is unalterable and I presume it would be necessary to amend the legislation in the future. If the amendment was included, it would provide for any future variation to the existing code of practice that might arise.</P>
      <P>My difficulty is that it is unclear what would happen if a new code of practice was proposed. This section would have to be amended. My amendment would pre-empt that situation and ensure it would not be necessary to alter the legislation in the future. It would allow a more flexible approach. If alterations to the code were suggested in the future, that eventuality would be covered in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is a Government amendment and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is a correction in the text in line 4 where it states &ldquo;accepted&rdquo;. It should read &ldquo;excepted&rdquo;. It is a typographical error.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">

The effect of that amendment would be to require a trade union not to frustrate an employer in observing a provision of the code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution but to allow members of the union, namely the employees of the enterprise, to engage in the same type of behaviour. Part of the amendment proposes that an excepted body should be included in the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 13 to 16, to delete paragraph (<i>d</i>).</P>
      <P>Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) states</P>
      <P>neither the trade union nor the employees, as the case may be, have had recourse to industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of such code of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the conditions the Minister has outlined under which the procedures, as outlined in section 2, would operate. He has indicated there are three pillars to his proposal, namely, the failure of the employer to engage, the failure of internal procedures and the absence of industrial action. This amendment relates to the third pillar which seems to make provision for a blanket ban on any industrial action during the negotiation <Col N="1150" /> process. This is extreme and it should be modified.</P>
    <P>If this section is not amended and wildcat action is taken by a maverick member of a trade union or something occurs which sparks strike action, the process will stop. I have a problem with the section from that point of view. Something might happen after the dispute is referred to the commission. While it might be against the everyone's wishes and against the code of practice, it is a severe measure to cut the procedure short if industrial action of whatever nature occurs. There is no specification about the serious nature or category of industrial action.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that a proper procedure should be put in place which would be of benefit in trade union negotiations and recognition. I ask the Minister of State to take a fresh look at this section and to see if he can modify &ldquo;industrial action after the dispute in question was referred to the Commission&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to remove the requirement that no industrial action be taken after the referral of a dispute to the Labour Relations Commission. A central feature of the fall back provision was the requirement that no industrial action be taken. It is against the agreement reached between IBEC and ICTU for the fall-back provision to operate if industrial action has taken place after referral of the dispute to the Labour Relations Commission. This has come from the agreement reached between IBEC and ICTU. The process depends on the parties continuing to work and not taking industrial action. I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendment which seeks to delete this paragraph.</P>

    <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 19, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including labour relations <Col N="1151" /> practices engaged in by the employer or an associated employer in another employment including an employment outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert at the end of subsection (2), which states, &ldquo;In the course of an investigation under <i>subsection (1)</i> the Court shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned&rdquo;, the phrase, &ldquo;including labour relations practices engaged in by the employer or an associated employer in another employment including an employment outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because of the situation in the Aldi store in Parnell Street in Dublin, although the same principle could be applied to other multinational activities. This multinational company has also opened retail outlets in Cork and Letterkenny and will open 12 or 14 stores throughout the country in the next year. While I welcome the competition provided by a wider range of semi-supermarkets and the extensive cut price range of goods made available by a German based multinational company, given that in the past almost all the multinational retail outlets were British based, the workforce in Parnell Street is on strike because of the lack of trade union recognition. Five members have been sacked because they indicated they wished to join a trade union and they have placed pickets at the store in the past two weeks.</P>
    <P>An anomaly has arisen, which was not obvious in the past to MANDATE, in that although Aldi has a range of stores in Britain and other parts of the European Union, it does not make provision for trade union recognition anywhere outside Germany. However, it has granted trade union recognition to its workers in Germany. Neither I nor the union was aware of that. It is not satisfactory that a multinational company can apply one industrial relations law for its workers at home and another in the country in which the mother company has its base. We must try to address this anomaly.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a greater concentration of multinational activity than any other country in the European Union. We must look at this matter from a national as well as a European point of view. However, it is another matter when dealing with Japan or the United States. The subsection states that &ldquo;the Court shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned&rdquo;. That is not broad enough to cover industrial relations other than those in a national context. However, we must look at the matter in an international industrial relations context in terms of employment outside the State.</P>
    <P>I will not press the amendment if the Minister of State wants to consider how he might proceed with it in the other House. It is unfortunate we are dealing with all Stages of the Bill today because we will not get a chance to discuss it again next week. Perhaps the Minister of State is prepared to accept the amendment but, if not, he <Col N="1152" /> might consider the principle of an extended definition of the &ldquo;entirety of labour relations practices&rdquo;, as envisaged in section 2(2).</P>

      <P>I appreciate what my colleague has said and I look forward to hearing the Minister on it, but as worded it could be interpreted as including what Senator Costello seeks. On the matter of labour relations practices, &ldquo;in the employment concerned&rdquo; is a matter of interpretation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. The amendment is not accepted because it would create an artificial link between Irish labour relations practices and those in other jurisdictions. That is a key point because we pride ourselves on our labour relations system. It is admired throughout the European Union in particular. Looking at the fall-back provision process in the round from the early stage at which the dispute is placed in the hands of the Labour Relations Commission's advisory service, the focus of attention is the effective resolution of the issues in dispute. This is how the high level group envisaged it, indicating that the Labour Court, when conducting its investigation into the matters in dispute, should take into account &ldquo;the integrity and totality of the labour relations practices operated in the company&rdquo;. I would ask Senators to reflect on that.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this condition was to underline that the absence of collective bargaining or the absence of negotiations with the trade union <i>per se</i> should not be seen as meaning that a valid claim exists. In submitting claims on pay and holidays, for example, a trade union would normally cite comparator firms in Ireland or Irish sectoral norms. The trade union would seek pay increases agreed under Irish national pay agreements, including the current Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. In dealing with claims, both the LRC and the Labour Court will conduct their business with a view to best practice in an Irish context, so there is that comparator aspect to this debate. Both sides are free to point to developments elsewhere and it is a matter for the Labour Court to judge the merits of such agreement.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment. The argument is that people can make comparisons with other companies from the national perspective, that there is the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness on pay issues, etc. but we should not force these kinds of international linkages. Very healthy debates are going on at European level, and I am involved at a social affairs level, about our best practice with regard to industrial relations, and I know the Senators have been following those debates. We have a particularly unique system here in Ireland and one that works well on a voluntary basis. The high level group put forward these ideas; they came from the bottom up and it was something that I, as Minister with responsibility for labour affairs, encouraged. That is where I stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> I cannot make any commitments but in the context of this debate moving on to the Dáil, I will examine any issues that are raised here. I appreciate the co-operation of the Seanad today in that we are making solid progress. That is where my case rests and I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Minister's response is adequate. If we are operating best practice, and we are operating within the European Union, it is invidious of an employer to come into this country and not operate best practice here. That is the basic principle. Also, it gives that employer an unfair advantage in terms of operating within another jurisdiction. If workers have full industrial negotiating rights in their own country, surely they should be extended where profits are going to be made in another jurisdiction, certainly within the European Union. The totality of the context which would be taken into consideration by the court should specifically address the totality of operations of a multinational company in relation to industrial relations, both at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Why should a company recognise best practice in its own country and be prepared to settle for something less in the country in which it establishes a business that will obviously make a good profit? This company is establishing a business which will not be just one outlet. It indicated a year ago that there will be at least 12 to 14 outlets throughout the country within the next two years. It will be a major player on the Irish retail outlet scene. The industrial dispute in the first store established here will be replicated throughout the country. Rather than having to come back to the issue at some time in the future, why should we not now expand that definition? The definition is quite good as it stands. It states: &ldquo;. shall have regard to the entirety of labour relations practices in the employment concerned&rdquo;, but it should be expanded to include employment outside the State. The Minister said that the court may examine that matter but why should we not direct the court as to what it should examine? It should examine the totality of experience in relation to industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to press the Minister on the matter today but I would like something other than a half-hearted response that it will be addressed in the Dáil. This is unfair to indigenous companies competing here because there will now be an extensive cut price network coming from Germany. The prices they are quoting are 30% less than those of Dunnes, Tesco or any other companies in the city. This company is currently sourcing 90% of its goods outside the country, from Germany and Britain, and it has now indicated its intention to source its goods here in Ireland. It is good to have competition in the Irish sector but we should have best practice in industrial relations. It appears to me that we are settling for something that is second best and that Irish workers can be treated less favourably than <Col N="1154" /> their colleagues in Germany will be treated by this company.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Coghlan who referred to &ldquo;the employment concerned&rdquo;. The case was that the employer could be regarded as the same employer whether the store was in Dublin or Germany.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>3.&ndash;The dismissal of an employee for availing of the provisions of section 2 or otherwise in connection with seeking or intending to seek redress under this Act shall be deemed to be an unfair dismissal for the purposes of section 6(2)(a) of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is to try to prevent victimisation of anybody who avails of the procedures in section 2 for seeking redress under the Act. This was part of the provisions we included in our original Trade Union Recognition Bill. We feel it is desirable to include a specific protection in the Bill. It would be welcomed by employees in the event <Col N="1155" /> that a bad-minded employer might victimise an employee for having recourse to these provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment. The Unfair Dismissals Act already provides protection which, while not going as far as the Senator wishes, is already considerable. That legislation provides that a dismissal is deemed to be unfair if it results wholly or mainly from, first, the employee's membership or proposal that he or another person should become a member of a trade union or excepted body or, second, the employee's engaging in activities on behalf of a trade union or excepted body where the times at which he engages in those activities are, first, outside his hours of work or, second, during his hours of work if he is permitted to do so by the employer. That is the key point.</P>
      <P>This existing protection is adequate to deal with any circumstances Senators may envisage where employees are victimised for exercising or proposing to exercise any entitlement under the Bill. The Unfair Dismissals Act has its own internal balance, to the extent that a link is drawn between trade union membership or activity during hours of work and employers' permission to do so. The net effect of the amendment would be to render a dismissal unfair if it resulted from activities on behalf of a trade union during hours of work in circumstances in which the permission of the employer had been refused or had not been sought. A move in the direction proposed would be a negative step and might open up the provisions of this new process to acts of bad faith. There is that element to altering what is effectively balanced legislation in the Unfair Dismissals Act. The key issue relates to the times at which an employee engages in these activities. The provison applies if he engages in them during his hours of work, provided he is permitted to do so by the employer.</P>

    <P>Mr. Costello: I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 29, to delete &ldquo;having regard to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;determining provisions as to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am seeking here to firm up the legislation in relation to the activities of the Labour Court and provide that the Labour Court may make recommendations giving its opinion in the matter and, where appropriate, its view as to the action which should be taken having regard to terms and conditions of employment, dispute resolution and so <Col N="1156" /> on. The function of the court is to make a determination in relation to the terms and conditions of employment and to the dispute resolution procedures. Having regard to the rather weak reference to its functions, it should be strengthened and made specific. The whole intention of the legislation is that the Labour Court should be able to determine what the terms and conditions of employment will be. There is a certain ambiguity in the Bill in this respect. If the eventual outcome of the process is to enable the Labour Court to make a determination, that is what the section should say. It does not say that. Section 5 seems to be a watering down of the functions and intent of the Labour Court as provided for in section 2. I would like to see it boosted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment because our text is better. If a claim before the Labour Court is investigated and results in a recommendation under section 5, failing resolution the court may proceed to issue a determination under section 6. The parties have an opportunity following a recommendation under section 5 to resolve matters. They can agree to vary the terms of the court's recommendation, and the use of the word &ldquo;determining&rdquo; in section 5 would denote a decision which would be binding in all its provisions. This would not be in keeping with the objective of this section, which is to put a non-binding framework to the parties in dispute. It is like a momentum building up. The whole process from the voluntary code to this legal part of the process into which we are now entering is very much an evolving one. I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment because it is a matter of wording and our wording is better.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1), line 12, to delete &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8(1) states: &ldquo;The Court shall cease its investigation or review under <i>section 6</i> . where . at the request of the employer . the Court has satisfied itself.&rdquo;. My amendment and my opposition to the section are related. This section contains a blanket ban on any form of industrial action in a dispute where an investigation has taken place. That seems too extreme. We referred to this provision at an earlier stage as well. The fact that the court shall cease its investigation if anything happens is severe in the extreme. I wonder why is it necessary to impose that blanket ban on any form of industrial action taking place during the negotiating process. This would give rise to considerable difficulties in the future where something may happen that will thwart the procedures that are at an advanced stage. The court, instead of proceeding to a resolution, determination or recommendation, will find itself simply stopping in midstream and the whole process would have to start all over again. There should be some other mechanism rather than a blanket ban on any industrial dispute that has occurred.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say that SIPTU, ICTU and IBEC have agreed to this. We in this House are not a trade union or an employer's organisation. We are a body that looks at legislation that will work. We understand the difficulties. We know that legislation can be very thorny at times and that there are human responses to it. While it may look fine in a logical sense it is still accompanied by emotion and feelings because we are dealing with people's lives, careers and families. Everything is at stake when it comes to industrial relations. I do not like the use of word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and the blanket ban on any form of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to modify this provision. Naturally it is the desirable outcome and effect because no one wants industrial action, strikes or a go slow. This provision will give rise to an inordinate amount of difficulties in the future. We must remember that any negotiations that take place will be conducted in a fairly heated context. This is where trade union recognition has been denied by and large, where workers wish to join a trade union and get negotiating rights, there will be a dispute or conflict. If anyone steps out of line the negotiations will stop dead in the water according to the procedures the Minister wants to put in place and we will not be able to get a resolution. This provision will thwart the legislation in the future. Is there some way the Minister could change this provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing a modest amendment by asking for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to be changed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;. This would mean that the court may, at its discre<Col N="1158" /> tion, look at all the circumstances. The court may then decide that it would be appropriate for it to continue with its deliberations. It could bring in all the parties, make recommendations and decide on a desirable outcome even if there has been a breach in industrial relations. We must remember that the purpose of this section and the legislation is to step in where industrial relations do not operate and are not the norm. That is what we are trying to do. We are in a contradictory situation because this provision is stating that where an employee breaches industrial relations, when no proper industrial relations machinery exists, then we cannot continue to seek a resolution and put a proper industrial relations mechanism in place. There is a certain degree of contradiction in what we are seeking to do here. This section deserves further thought.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that ICTU is prepared to accept this section. Does it know about this section and its specific terms? Has the organisation thought out the implications of full and stringent implementation of it? The employer will insist on it and give the Labour Court no scope for flexibility no matter what level of dispute because it is in their interest. Employers never wanted trade union recognition and they do not want a situation where the Labour Court can determine that there must be a set of industrial relations put in place. </P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would not be in keeping with the high level group's report but I accept what the Senator has said. I have heard Senators' comments before and I am aware of criticisms of the social partnership. Some people feel that it excludes Members of the Seanad and Dáil. The truth is that very extensive consultation led to this Bill coming into existence. As Senator Costello will be aware, issues emerged following a particular dispute and we all knew then that we had to find solutions. I would stress that this process works both ways. It puts particular responsibilities on employees and employers.</P>
      <P>The clear intention of the high level group was that the whole process involving the Labour Court should only proceed in the absence of industrial action. The Senator correctly pointed out that we all support the absence of industrial action in these types of situations. We do not want to make matters worse, especially in tense situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) makes it clear that the court's involvement must commence against a background of no industrial action. Section 8(2) makes it clear that the absence of industrial action must continue through to the completion of the procedure which takes place when the court issues its determination under section 6. I stress that the absence of industrial action was one of the cornerstones of the agreement reached between ICTU and IBEC. ICTU was very involved in this agreement. It did not just agree to this fall-back provision. The voluntary dispute resolution procedure was agreed and now we <Col N="1159" /> have this special fall-back provision which we are bringing into law today.</P>
    <P>I stated at the time of the Ryanair dispute that a consensus between IBEC and ICTU would be the preferred way to deal with similar disputes in the future. There is no doubt about that. As someone who was very closely involved with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and others and who worked with IBEC at that time I am convinced that this is the only way forward. That consensus was reached after intensive negotiations early last year. The compromised reached places obligations on employers and employees. Employees will benefit because awards made by the Labour Court can be legally enforced on the employer. This is a very good thing for an employee. This provision goes beyond the normal voluntary tradition and commits the employer to accept a third party finding. There is an obligation on the employer and employee to adhere in full to this procedure and not to pursue the adversarial route of industrial confrontation. This is a critical element of this legislation.</P>
    <P>That is my brief explanation why we must maintain the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;  This word is central to the consensus approach and the need to maintain industrial peace. These types of situations will always be very difficult disputes by nature because they will have come through a lengthy process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister of State is saying &ndash; it is easier to work from black and white positions. Industrial relations, however, like human relations, do not operate on that basis. Section 2 proposes that there would be a ban on industrial action from the point when a dispute reaches the Labour Relations Commission. That is the first stage of discussions. After that it should be possible to go the Labour Court, a more advanced stage of the machinery at which a solution would be closer. It should be left to the discretion of the court to decide if the completion of the process is merited even if a spanner falls into the works. I ask that the court be able to cease its investigation or review under section 8 and withdraw its recommendation where either the employer requests it or on its own initiative. That is not asking much and it would assist the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Minister of State gives me a commitment that he is willing to look at the matter in that sense &ndash; leaving the commission out of it and allowing the court to make the final recommendation &ndash; I will press the amendment. It would assist the process. It will not give an absolute denial of any form of industrial action but industrial action can take many forms. It does not always mean striking, there may be token action which the court may decide is not of sufficient <Col N="1160" /> weight to warrant a full resolution involving a large number of workers or a large company.</P>
    <P>I will not insist on a vote if the Minister is prepared to take this up in a serious manner before the Bill goes to the Dáil. He should discuss this with ICTU to see if it is satisfied with the total blanket ban on industrial action being imposed under section 8. Section 8 differs from Section 2(<i>d</i>) in that respect. In one case we are talking about the Labour Relations Commission, in the other the Labour Court.</P>

It is appropriate for the court to decide the timeframe within which the recommendations would be implemented.

    <P>We should be more specific, determine the timeframe and remove the provision for a 12 month period before an enforcement order can be applied for in the Circuit Court. That is far too long. We are dealing with live issues so the timeframe should be decided by the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is right that it would be anticipated that the employer and the trade union will resolve their differences earlier in the vast majority of cases. The imposition of a legal award is rightly viewed as a last resort in Irish industrial relations. The success of the economy is due in no small way to this voluntarist approach where employers and employees resolve the majority of their differences through direct talks or with the aid of third parties and non-binding adjudication. The provision of a lengthy period before referral to the Circuit Court will give parties a further opportunity to resolve their differences in an industrial relations, as opposed to a legal, environment.</P>
      <P>The high level group recommended the inclusion of a one year timescale. The positions held by the Senator and me in respect of this matter are not that different. In my opinion many disputes will be resolved within the 12 month period. I accept the merit of putting in place a specific timeframe, but in my view it is longer than required. However, the industrial relations process is evolutionary in nature and the inclusion of a timeframe will help to concentrate people's minds and encourage them to find resolutions. I cannot accept the amendment because I believe the specified timeframe should be left in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that a period of 12 months is too long because employers should not be encouraged to delay the reaching of a resolution for that length of time. The legislation should not include a specified timescale, it should be amended so that the court will be in a position to determine the period in which a resolution must be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, under section 6, the Labour Court is making a determination which is the subject of a recom<Col N="1162" /> mendation, having heard details of the circumstances surrounding a dispute it will be in the best position to decide on a timeframe within which a resolution must be reached. These timeframes may differ because disputes may involve small business concerns or large employers such as Ryanair or multinationals such as Aldi. Why is the Minister of State specifying that a period of 12 months must pass before the court's decision can be enforced, in light of the fact that this could frustrate the industrial relations process and prevent the reaching of a resolution to a dispute?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point I made earlier that the stage of the process we are discussing involves trying to find resolutions to difficult disputes and I remind the Senator that industrial action will not be taken during the specified period. Difficult disputes&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. However, the full 12 month period would only be required in extreme circumstances. In my opinion resolutions will be reached in the majority of cases before the 12 months expire. In our discussions with IBEC and the ICTU it was recommended that a period of one year should be set aside during which the parties involved in a dispute could reach agreement in an atmosphere of industrial peace. I accept that 12 months is a lengthy period but it was recommended by the high level group. I am, therefore, not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The high level group should re-examine its position. The Labour Court may issue a set of step-by-step recommendations in respect of certain disputes and these would have to be implemented on a phased basis. In such circumstances, a 12 month period would be acceptable. However, no progress will be made until the final recommendation is implemented and employers will be in a position to delay the process for a year. In my opinion the High Court is in the best position to make a decision on the timeframe to be put in place to resolve disputes of this nature. However, if the court cannot be granted this power, perhaps the timeframe specified in the Bill could be reduced from 12 to six months. Would the high level group agree to such a proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will re-examine this matter in the context of the points the Senator has raised. I should point out that if a determination was made during the 12 month period, industrial unrest could erupt thereafter. I will consider the matter before the debate on the Bill in the Lower House because the Senator has raised a number of interesting points, particularly that which refers to step-by-step recommendations. I will ask my officials to consult again with the interested parties.</P>

      <Col N="1163" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 5, after line 42, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)Section 91(5), (6) and (8) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 shall apply with any necessary modifications to an application under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to strengthen the section. The Employment Equality Act provides that where a union applies for an enforcement order the court need only be concerned with whether the Labour Court order has been complied with and not whether that order should have been made in the first instance. Employers should not be given a further opportunity to argue their cases. I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment and insert the new subsection into section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. The policy approach taken in the Bill is to allow for an enforcement order to be sought by a trade union in the Circuit Court. That court has inherent powers to deal with situations where employers fail to comply with enforcement orders. It would be open to a trade union to take the issue before the Circuit Court in the event of the non-implementation of an enforcement order. In the original application for an enforcement order, a trade union will submit the determination of the Labour Court to the Circuit Court. Where an employer fails to implement that order, the matter can again be dealt with by the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The wording used in section 91(5), (6) and (8) of the Employment Equality Act is not in full accord with the text of the Bill. I am not satisfied, therefore, that incorporation of the text suggested in the amendment would add greatly to the operation of section 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied that employers will not be given a second opportunity to argue their cases before the Circuit Court? If they are allowed to do so, I am concerned that the issues in respect of which disputes may have arisen could again be raised and discussed in court. These matters should be dealt with by the Labour Court and the enforcement orders it issues should be complied with. Employers should not be allowed to go before the Circuit Court and delay the resolution of a dispute. The amendment is designed to avoid that possibility.</P>

If it is necessary to carry out any further investi<Col N="1164" /> gations, I will ask my officials to double check the Senator's concerns between now and the time the Bill goes to the other House.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a contribution of £20 million by the Irish Government to the twelfth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association, IDA, is an affiliate of the World Bank. It is one of the bank's main instruments in the fight against extreme poverty. It was set up in 1960 to assist the poorest countries which cannot afford to borrow money from the World Bank on its normal terms. It lends to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income, in 1998 terms, of less than $895, that is less than $3 a day. There is also an exception for small island economies that have limited creditworthiness. The beneficiaries of IDA lending are the 2.3 billion people comprising 53% of the total population of the developing countries, who live in the 78 countries which are eligible to borrow from IDA. Today, 1.5 billion of these people survive on incomes of $2 or less a day and 1.07 billion on less than $1 a day.</P>
      <P>The mission of IDA is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in its poorest member countries. IDA helps build the human capital, policies, institutions and physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. Research conducted by the World Bank has shown that positive growth rates do not automatically lead to poverty reduction. Additional measures are needed to ensure that this takes place and IDA is the primary multilateral agency which is specifically charged with ensuring that these measures are identified and undertaken.</P>
      <P>The current debate on development issues often focuses on cases where progress and development fall short of what was expected at the outset. However, we should not lose sight of how much has been achieved over the years. Over the past generation, more has been done to reduce poverty and raise the quality of life than during any comparable period in human history. Advances in health care in particular have brought enormous benefits to the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 30 years infant mortality rates have been cut in half, life expectancy has increased from 55 years to 64 years, child malnu<Col N="1167" /> trition rates are 20% lower than 30 years ago and certain nutrition-deficient diseases have almost disappeared. Primary school enrolment rates in developing countries have reached almost 80% and gender disparities have narrowed, with the percentage of girls in secondary schools rising to 45%. Adult literacy has risen from 46% to 70% and there is greater consensus than ever before, in rich and poor countries alike, on what governments must do to improve the lives of their people. The developing countries themselves have been the motor driving these achievements, but their efforts have received strong support from donors, including IDA.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that a large number of developing countries at the lower end of the income spectrum continues to experience unacceptably high levels of poverty and deprivation. In these countries poverty reduction strategies must help to build capacity to address the weaknesses in governance and in institutions which lie at the root of their poor performance. It has increasingly been recognised that good governance is essential both to economic development and to the effectiveness of development assistance.</P>
    <P>The twelfth replenishment or IDA 12 negotiations identified four dimensions of governance which are particularly important to economic development, poverty reduction and the effective use of IDA resources. These are accountable and competent public institutions, transparent economic and social policies and practices, a predictable and stable legal framework and participation by affected groups and civil society. IDA is selective in identifying those countries which achieve progress in implementing policy reform programmes, especially instances of poor governance and corruption.</P>
    <P>The experience of overseas development aid over the past decades has amply demonstrated that these issues, and in particular corruption, tend to undermine development and constrain aid effectiveness. Corruption also creates barriers to the effective promotion of private sector development, raising costs and reducing growth.</P>
    <P>Gender inequality is also inimical to growth in that it deprives a nation of a significant part of its productive assets and discrimination due to caste, race, ethnicity or religion is also a significant barrier to growth and can even undermine results already achieved when it leads to civil conflict.</P>
    <P>IDA and the World Bank are now committed to addressing the problems of institutional weakness combined with inappropriate or unenforced policy or legal frameworks which often permit corruption to flourish. IDA recognises that addressing these problems will require a long-term effort, particularly in building up the institutional capacity to make the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>IDA's mandate will also take account of issues such as democratisation and respect for human rights which can also have important long-term implications for the capacity of a country to <Col N="1168" /> initiate and, more importantly, sustain programmes for effective poverty reduction, economic adjustment and growth. Lending to countries with weak governance will be scaled back or stopped entirely if necessary.</P>
    <P>IDA recognises that its impact on poverty can be judged only by the results which its operations achieve in the field. For the twelfth replenishment a number of priorities have been agreed by IDA donors. These will focus on investment in people which has been shown to be vital for development. It will also promote broadly based development and encourage sectoral reforms that promote labour intensive growth and benefit the poor. Specifically, IDA 12 will give priority to investments in education, health and social programmes, reduction in non-productive expenditure, such as excessive military spending, pro-poor policy reforms, especially those which address the needs of the rural poor, small farmers and micro-enterprises, policies to ensure the sustainable use of natural resources, assuring the access of the poor to land, credit and information, establishing basic labour standards and reforming legislation and policies that disadvantage the poor.</P>
    <P>As a major step toward concerted action for development, the international donor community has agreed to focus on a series of key goals in partnership with developing countries. These goals, which are based on United Nations conferences and resolutions reflecting broad agreement by the international community as a whole, were set out in Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Co-operation, issued by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in May 1996.</P>
    <P>The goals for the year 2015 include reducing by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty; achieving universal primary education in all countries and universal access to reproductive health services; reducing by two-thirds the mortality rates of children under five and maternal mortality by three-fourths; ensuring full access to primary health care; and reversing trends in the loss of environmental resources. The intermediate goals targeted for the year 2005 include demonstrated progress toward gender equality by eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education and the implementation of national strategies for sustainable development in all countries.</P>
    <P>The recently inaugurated Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers represent an innovative approach in the fight against poverty and one which has found wide acceptance among both donor and recipient countries. Among other innovations, they offer a framework within which the World Bank, including IDA, the IMF, donors and beneficiary countries can work together to enhance development impact in a participatory manner, integrating priority measures for poverty reduction and structural reforms within a growth-oriented macroeconomic framework.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Education, in particular, provides major economic, social, cultural and institutional benefits. A new education sector strategy is being prepared by IDA which is expected to provide a framework for deepening the policy dialogue with the world's poorest countries on the options for rapidly increasing access to quality basic education, with a focus on making better use of government, donor, and private resources.</P>
    <P>IDA offers loans free of interest, carrying only a nominal service charge. The loans have maturities of 35 or 40 years with a ten year grace period on repayment of principal. They are funded by IDA replenishments which consist of grants provided mainly by its richer member countries. These donor replenishments are supplemented by repayments made by IDA's borrowers in respect of earlier loans and transfers from the available net income of the World Bank.</P>
    <P>The twelfth replenishment, IDA 12, amounts to SDR 8.65 billion and covers the period starting 1 July 1999. This donor funding, when combined with the reflows and World Bank transfers, will allow IDA to commit lending of about SDR 15.25 billion between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2002.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to IDA 12 will amount to IR£20 million. This is made up of a basic contribution of approximately £15 million, 0.18% of total donor resources, an increase from 0.13% for IDA 11. We have also pledged a supplementary contribution of £5 million which brings the total for Ireland to 0.24% of total donor contributions.</P>
    <P>Of the donor countries, Ireland, Finland, Greece and the UK have increased their basic shares from that in IDA 11. In addition, Ireland, Australia, the Czech Republic and Israel have added supplements to their basic contributions. Senators may note the Irish agreement to exceed our previous share was instrumental in evoking increases in basic contributions and other supplementary payments and thereby helped bridge the funding gap facing IDA 12 and bringing the difficult negotiations on this replenishment to a successful conclusion. The actual cash payments for IDA 12 will be made over a six year period beginning in the year 2000. Contributions to multilateral bodies such as IDA and the World Bank qualify as part of Ireland's overall contribution to overseas development in the context of the UN target of 0.7% of GNP.</P>
    <P>Overall, IDA assistance is positive, progressive and imaginative and is fully focused on both meeting basic human needs and on raising the aspirations and potential of the poorest sections of humanity. However, it is not sentimental. IDA assistance is not measured against the policy performance of the recipient countries. While neither the IDA nor the World Bank Group has any interest in taking control of the domestic policy-making process in recipient countries, the requirements of effective aid-giving require that certain minimum standards are met in areas such as governance and the fight against corruption. To ignore these realities is to risk wasting resources which could be used to achieve real <Col N="1170" /> results in countries which are making serious efforts to improve their institutional capacity.</P>
    <P>IDA is fully prepared and equipped to render such assistance as is necessary to governments which make serious efforts to address these problems. Ireland's membership of IDA was authorised by the International Development Association Act, 1960. Our contributions to the various replenishments have each been authorised by amendments to that Act. This Bill will enable us to make our contribution to IDA 12. I therefore recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. On behalf of Fine Gael, I am happy to welcome this Bill which authorises a contribution of £20 million by the Government to the twelfth replenishment of resources of the International Development Association. The IDA is part of the World Bank and is the bank's main instrument to fight against extreme world poverty. It is extraordinary that we should be debating this issue today when only two weeks ago the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1999, was before the House. This agency is also part of the World Bank and one of its functions is to encourage the flow of investment to developing countries.</P>
      <P>The measures proposed in this Bill appear to be a more positive approach to helping developing countries. The function of the IDA is to assist the poorer countries which cannot borrow from the World Bank on its normal terms. I note that the IDA gives assistance to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income at below £721 and more than 90% of IDA lending goes to countries with a<i> per capita</i> income of less than £507. This would roughly correspond to the <i>per capita</i> income which the Irish people enjoyed 50 years ago. It shows there is now a gap of 50 years between Ireland and the developing world, which is a long time. Whatever financial difficulties have been experienced since then, they pale into insignificance when one realises that 3 million people live on less than £1.56 a day and 1.3 billion people on less than 78 pence per day.</P>
      <P>The gap between the rich and poor countries continues to grow. By the end of this year, the number of people living in absolute poverty will have increased by 1.5 billion, nearly a quarter of the world's population. As the richer countries increase their share of global wealth, there is a moral responsibility on us to respond to the needs of the less well-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The less well-off countries bear more than their fair share of natural disasters such as earthquakes and flooding. On the economic side, there is often a low price for the commodities they export or manufacture and this leads to financial difficulties for these countries. Financial crises have decimated whole societies. Many of these societies about which we speak lack the basic facilities we take for granted such as clean water, sanitation and primary health care services, especially for <Col N="1171" /> mothers. A small amount of expenditure on health could go a long way to saving the lives of hundreds of children in these very deprived areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that IDA intends to address these issues with its next tranche of funding. This will include the £20 million which Ireland is making available. One can be certain that in Third World countries where such basic facilities are missing there is also a lack of basic primary education for young children. One requirement of the fund is that provision should be made for universal primary education.</P>
    <P>Extreme poverty and low standards of living in the Third World often go hand in hand with serious conflicts between different parties which results in civil war. There are often prolonged periods of famine which affect the weaker sections of these countries. It must be the aim of IDA to promote good governance in such countries and to eliminate corruption because if investment in poorer countries is to bear fruit, it must go hand in hand with sustainable democracy. I am pleased that the Minister of State laid special emphasis on the principle of good governance and lack of corruption. He outlined the four principles on which IDA intends to work to sustain democracies in Third World countries because, irrespective of the money we provide through different agencies, if there is not sustainable democracy which eliminates corruption the funds will not go where they are mostly needed.</P>
    <P>Financial assistance in the Third World for developing countries will only solve part of the problem. It is essential that such contributions are supported by the active participation of personnel with expertise. I pay tribute to our NGOs and missionaries who have been helping people throughout the Third World. Organisations such as Trócaire, GOAL, Concern and many others have played a major role in providing food and primary care in many areas of the Third World. Trócaire's immunisation programme has played a major role in the Third World. It has been successful in combating diseases, such as malaria, measles and pneumonia, and malnutrition, which causes the death of 25,000 children per year in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Give the economic growth Ireland is experiencing we should be more generous in our contributions to the developing world. I am glad that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs has outlined her intention to achieve the target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid over the next few years. If that can be achieved, we will have played a major part in helping the Third World. I commend the legislation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I support the legislation and compliment the Government on its approach to overseas development aid over many years. It was estimated that total payments, transfers and credits <Col N="1172" /> in overseas aid by the Government for the benefit of developing countries would amount to £178 million in 1999, the largest amount ever. ODA has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting a political and popular consensus on the issue. Between 1992 and 1999 it rose from £40 million to £178 million, a fourfold increase. That is welcome and successive Governments should be complimented on their approach.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a member of the World Bank and its four affiliates, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Ireland joined the bank in 1957 and its total capital subscription to the bank to date amounts to £636 million or 0.35% of total subscriptions. Approximately 6% or some £37 million of the subscription has been paid in and is usable by the bank for lending. The remaining 94% is in the form of non-pay in or callable capital, which constitutes a general guarantee of the bank's obligations. Ireland's record in this area is to be complimented. There is general consensus that Ireland should continue to support developing countries at a time when its economic position has improved so much and where possible increase its contributions. That is the Government's policy.</P>
      <P>IDA credits mature over 35 or 40 years with a ten year grace period and repayment principle. No interest is charged but the credits carry a small service charge, currently 0.75% of undistributed balances. Sometimes we forget about the credits which are repaid. They play an important role in overseas aid. Since 1996 IDA has lent almost £115 billion to 100 countries. It lends £5 billion to £6 billion on average per year for different types of development projects, especially those which address people's basic needs, such as primary education, health services and clean water and sanitation. IDA also funds projects for the protection of the environment, improves conditions for private business, builds needed infrastructure and supports reforms aimed at liberalising economies. All these projects pave the way towards economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and a better quality of life. IDA funds allocated to borrowing countries reflect their income level and track record of success in managing their economies and ongoing IDA projects. There should be proper monitoring of moneys which are allocated and expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Development experience demonstrates that investment in basic social services is vital and the Minister of State emphasised that in his contribution. Such services include primary education, clean water and sanitation, preventative and reproductive health services, which are vitally important, nutrition and social protection to address people's needs so that children who must work do not sacrifice opportunities to learn and have the opportunity to attend school. That is the way forward. Education is vitally important in the fight against poverty and in the emergence of <Col N="1173" /> more democratic and progressive regimes in countries which suffer from social deprivation and poverty.</P>
    <P>These investments are designed to increase the productivity of the poor and hasten their emergence from poverty. IDA investments in the social sector, particularly in areas such as the education of girls, have increased steadily in recent years. While such investments fluctuate from year to year, virtually all active IDA borrowers have undertaken ongoing projects in education and health which are closely co-ordinated with community providers and other donors. It is important that there is co-ordination and that the projects are monitored.</P>
    <P>IDA is the World Bank group's concessional lending window, so to speak. An important message which must be highlighted is that it is a lending opportunity for regimes and countries which are not in a position to deal with their domestic circumstances on their own or in a manner similar to western countries. IDA provides long-term loans without interest to the poorest developing countries. This is a vital component of such aid.</P>
    <P>The mission of IDA is to support efficient and effective programmes, reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in its poorest member countries. It helps build the human capital policies of institutions and the physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. IDA's goal is to reduce the disparities across and within countries to bring more people into the mainstream and to promote equitable access to the benefits of development. Thanks to the International Development Association, some 45,000 primary school classrooms were constructed or rehabilitated in African countries, which enabled approximately 1.8 million children to benefit from access to primary education. In Asia, over 6,700 health care facilities were constructed or upgraded and then equipped and staffed to provide basic health care to rural populations.</P>
    <P>The social investment fund projects in Latin America reached some 9.5 million beneficiaries. Activities supported by these projects generated almost a million person-months of employment. In Africa, more than five million textbooks, mostly locally developed and produced, were supplied to primary schools.</P>
    <P>In India, the national AIDS control project supported the training of 52,500 physicians and 60% of nursing staff in HIV/AIDS management topics. That project is of vital importance given the frightening figures for AIDS world-wide, and particularly in the developing world. It is of great concern to everybody to see the devastation caused across the continent of Africa by HIV and AIDS. It is sobering for us all to contemplate what lies ahead for the World Health Organisation and health ministries in various countries in trying to control the epidemic and to deal with the fall out which has ravaged families and communities. The International Development Association must be part of the fight against HIV and <Col N="1174" /> AIDS in supporting communities trying to cope with this catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Improvements are also taking place in many other areas, some of which were damaged by floods. These include Haiti where improvements in the country's devastated power sector have given users access to about 20 hours per day of electricity, contrasting with the previous situation of nearly 18 hours of power blackouts daily. These practical matters are being dealt with by the IDA internationally. I compliment the Minister and the Government on that contribution to such deserving projects world-wide.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a proud record in international aid which is recognised around the world. When we debate such matters in the Oireachtas it is often forgotten that there is a far greater input from Irish people which is above and beyond what is provided by Government. I pay public tribute to the many Irish missionaries, doctors, nurses, engineers, civil servants and others from all walks of life who have contributed to development work in the Third World by helping communities in poverty and distress. I am glad to see that commitment is not being diminished in any way. It is great to see so many Irish voluntary workers offering professional services and time for the benefit of oppressed peoples abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right when we look back at our own terrible past of 150 years ago when the population of the country was devastated by famine. It is something we have never got over in so far as the population has never recovered to the levels of the mid-19th century. Thankfully, however, we have experienced an increase in population in recent times. The island of Ireland has shown a great commitment to international aid, independently of what the Government has done in providing overseas aid.</P>
      <P>In discussing such aid, we should not confine ourselves to what is being provided by the Government and State agencies through the Department of Finance. We must recognise the great human contribution that has been made by field workers who are helping communities and individuals in Third World countries stricken by poverty, disease and deprivation. The countries affected are to be found in Africa, Asia and other parts of the globe. I compliment our aid workers abroad. The Minister is also to be complimented on this vital legislation which will provide £20 million in overseas aid. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is always relevant, especially in a country like this that has had something of a nightmare past having experienced a famine. I welcome the fact that Ireland is again participating in the twelfth replenishment of the International Development Association's fund for the world's poorest and most indebted <Col N="1175" /> countries. I will be disagreeing somewhat with the Minister in what I have to say because I want to set out, to the best of my knowledge, the background to the levels of poverty and underdevelopment in the Third World, as well as the lack of understanding that exists about those conditions.</P>
      <P>While many countries have achieved some progress in the fight against poverty in recent decades, the last quarter of a century has seen not a reduction but a vast increase in poverty. More people now live in poverty than at any other time in history, despite what the Minister had to say earlier. Some three billion people on the planet today live on less than $3 a day, while over one billion people live on less than $1 per day. Last October, the world's population reached the six billion mark. More than half the world's population live in poverty and one sixth live in absolute impoverishment.</P>
      <P>Globalisation has contributed to an enormous increase in the concentration of wealth and, at the same time, to the growth in poverty, both within nations and world-wide. We often speak positively about globalisation but there is a downside to it. The combined wealth of the three richest individuals in the world is currently more than the combined gross domestic product of the world's 48 poorest countries. That is a shocking figure.</P>
      <P>Globalisation has greatly increased the powers of global corporations relative to national Governments. Of the 100 largest economies in the world, over 50 are corporations and not countries. Moreover, increasing debt forces cutbacks in social programmes for the poor with decreased real <i>per capita</i> public spending in the areas of primary health care, basic education and other basic social services in developing countries. Despite this, donor countries are devoting fewer resources to fighting poverty in the developing world. Official development assistance is now at its lowest level for 20 years. We call this donor fatigue. It has now fallen from 0.35% of donor states' combined gross domestic product in 1981 to 0.2% in 1997, the last year for which such figures are available. Yet it is acknowledged that increased financial support from donor countries is absolutely essential in eradicating poverty and getting real and sustainable development under way.</P>
      <P>While the Minister did not refer to it in his speech, it is regrettable that there has been no growth in the total amount of overseas development assistance we provide, as a proportion of GDP, although the amount of money provided has risen. We have agreed to work towards the UN target figure of 0.7% of GDP for overseas aid in any one year. This year, however, it will amount to 0.31%, which is less than half the UN target. When the Government took office in 1997 the rate was 0.27%, where it remained approximately in 1998 and 1999, although it has grown to 0.31% this year. We are progressing very slowly towards the UN target but we cannot be proud of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> A renewed commitment by all developing partners should be a cornerstone of all ODA policy. This should be stated in Ireland's ODA policy because this country is in a good position to talk to the rest of the world about the philosophy of overseas development assistance. We have a responsibility to talk about building a broader understanding of poverty and the possibility of its eradication and to enter and pursue co-operation among rich and poor countries to reduce world poverty.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that the existing gap between rich and poor countries is unacceptable and that it cannot be a permanent feature of the global economy. Innovative approaches to poverty eradication, including the development of real partnerships with developing countries, civil society groups and the private sector, are desperately needed in terms of policy by donor countries and in recipient countries.</P>
    <P>ODA policies need to focus much more closely at the issues surrounding poverty and development. They should be considered under a number of broad headings &ndash; financing for development, generating employment, gender equality, civil society alliances, debt relief and new partnerships for sustainable development. To reduce inequality between rich and poor and to eradicate untenable levels of absolute poverty in the developing world, political leadership is needed for accountable and transparent resource allocation at national level. The governments in developing countries can make important changes at national level to lift the poor out of poverty. My colleague, Senator Doyle, referred to this aspect.</P>
    <P>High levels of military spending often serve to displace social spending on health, education and anti-poverty programmes in low income and developing countries. Developing countries spend $125 billion per year on military forces. This is a shocking figure. South Asia alone spent $60 billion on defence in 1998. This is more than the total annual cost of health and basic nutrition for the poor worldwide. The United Nations Development Programme &ndash; UNDP &ndash; has called the use of scarce resources for military expenditure the most shocking example of the state's use of power contrary to the interests of poor people and others who may not necessarily be poor.</P>
    <P>In 1994, at a meeting of the Organisation for African Unity, African heads of state called for more public spending on social programmes and a one third reduction in military spending across the board on that continent. However, far from the achievement of a one third cut, spending on the military and armaments has increased in almost all the major countries in Africa. These well meaning proclamations will be empty rhetoric unless they are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The volatility of international financial speculation is among the other destabilising factors. Legislators in developed countries can reduce this threat and restore national monetary autonomy by encouraging capital controls, including <Col N="1177" /> national controls on capital in-flows and out-flows. These are particularly devastating to the economies of poor countries. Alternative types of taxation also need to be considered. This is a radical view but there should be levies on currency exchange transactions, referred to as the Tobin taxes, named after Mr. James Tobin, the Canadian economist and Nobel prize winner. Other mechanisms should be considered as a means of reducing the volume of short-term currency speculation transactions and, in turn, providing a resource pool for sustainable development.</P>
    <P>The existence of debt and its servicing is a critical factor in the problem of poverty. On the international level, there is a need to address the debt crisis in the poorest countries, although one is given some hope from the outcome of the most recent annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington towards the end of last year when major decisions on debt forgiveness were taken. There was also at that time an enlightened statement from the President of the United States, Mr. Bill Clinton. The major contributor to the funds of the World Bank and the IMF is the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done. Pressure must be placed on creditors to write off the debts of the poorest countries and to assist other debtor countries in making sustainable development rather than debt repayment their first budgetary priority. For too many poor countries the repayment of debt is an item in their annual budgets demanding much greater resources than spending on social programmes, such as health and education. Transformation of debt relief into poverty reduction is of the utmost importance, but it must be done in a properly structured way so that future investment does not slide into the same abyss of corruption and unaccountability as has so often happened in the past.</P>
    <P>The liberalisation of the international economy has hit workers, particularly those who are poorly trained and educated. As each workforce, community and nation seeks to become more competitive, decreasing wages, reductions in the workforce and cut backs on social and environmental overheads are often the case. Unemployment, under-deployment, stagnation and recession then become commonplace in such economies.</P>
    <P>The rights of workers is an important area where economic policies, human rights and development meet. Countries as well as international financial institutions and multilateral corporations should ensure conformity with internationally recognised worker rights set out in relevant international conventions, of which there are several. These include freedom of association; the right to organise and bargain collectively for pay; the right to freedom from discrimination; the prohibition on any use or any form of compulsory labour and the right to withhold labour; the right to certain minimum labour standards that take into account differences in development levels among nations, including a minimum age for the <Col N="1178" /> employment of children where the employment of under age children exists; and acceptable conditions at work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, occupational safety and health in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The impact of poverty has not fallen indiscriminately, as other speakers noted. Women, racial and ethnic minorities and indigenous people have been the primary victims. Women are being exploited in export industries in developing countries and have suffered the brunt of cutbacks in public services and support for basic needs. Programmes aimed at increasing access to education and reproductive health services and concentrating on opportunities for women would greatly decrease poverty in society as a whole. A recent study by the British Department of International Development shows that investment in girls is the most effective way to reduce poverty. Even a few years of basic education empowers women to have smaller and healthier families. An educated mother is always more likely to send her children to school and this, in turn, creates a new cycle of education and poverty reduction.</P>
    <P>Our ODA policy should be considered in a broader context than only the donation of funds to poor countries. We should have a voice in relation to the whole philosophy of ODA policy. We should never be afraid to speak to other countries about it because Ireland is in a particularly good position to do it. People at grassroots level should be encouraged to organise themselves in strong and independent organisations at village level, in micro-enterprise groups. community development groups, NGOs, religious groups, trade unions and others which have an important role.</P>
    <P>We should play a major part in creating a positive environment for NGO development through the creation of legal structures and frameworks that not only support the creation of NGOs but also their participation and interaction in public life. NGOs can play a pivotal role in the common struggle for poverty eradication. For example, instead of closed negotiations with governments and corporate officials, decisions about international economic agreements and loans should require participation by all involved. I send this message to the Government. The NGO community should be involved in our donor programme and the overall thrust of our overseas development programme.</P>
    <P>This debate has offered a unique opportunity to address some of the issues related to poverty reduction. We should work to promote aid, debt relief and proper trade terms. An important issue in developing countries is the disparity in trade and trade relations which works to the disadvantage of a poor country when it trades with a wealthy one. We must also inspire people. Instead of the fear of premature death, sickness and grinding poverty, we should offer people the hope of enough food to eat, well nourished children, an equal chance of education and opportunities in a more just world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although I have reservations about it. It is desirable that a larger sum of money is being sent abroad for development purposes in countries which are in severe need and suffer from poverty, deprivation and a lack of education and basic human rights. However, I am concerned that we, particularly the Government, have not made any attempts in recent years to reach our United Nations target of 0.7% of gross national product for overseas development aid. To make things worse, we are slipping back rather than moving forward. That is astounding given that the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to operate on a three year basis for 1999, 2000 and 2001. However, we have only reached 0.3% of our UN target this year, compared to 0.31% of gross national product in 1999. We were moving towards the interim target of 0.45%, but we are now moving away from it.</P>
      <P>It is no use saying that gross national product is increasing because the more it increases, the more we should be in a position to meet our targets. The Exchequer is making a greater percentage of profit. However, although it is projected that profits will reach £3 billion to £4 billion this year &ndash; it was £2 billion last year &ndash; not to mention the profit from the sale of various assets, we are still reneging on our United Nations commitment. I do not know how we can come into the House and blandly present a £20 million contribution to the World Bank through the International Development Association while we are slipping back in our overseas development contribution in terms of gross national product. That anomaly must be addressed, but we have not begun to do so.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Government. The march forward began in 1993 but this is the first year of eight years in the 1990s when the percentage of gross national product has gone backwards. Yet this is the first year we have a splendid Exchequer surplus. The Minister should address this issue because it highlights the seriousness of our contribution to eliminating world poverty.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the United Nations target for 2015 includes &ldquo;reducing by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, achieving universal primary education in all countries and universal access to reproductive health services, reducing by two thirds the mortality rates of children under five and by three fourths maternal mortality, ensuring full access to primary health care and reversing trends in the loss of environmental resources&rdquo;. That is pie in the sky in terms of our contribution. We should get our act together and show we are serious about dealing with this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor mentioned the Tobin tax and the various national creditors who have been asked to waive tax debts for impoverished countries. We have seen the good work done by Bono and other non-governmental bodies and individuals. They have made as big a contribution as many national entities in their efforts to reduce <Col N="1180" /> world poverty. We should support them and we should set and achieve targets.</P>
    <P>We should tell people that this is a country whose citizens went abroad as economic migrants, that we were impoverished and that two million of our people died of famine or related diseases in the mid 19th century. We understand extreme poverty and deprivation in the Third World. We should be a beacon to the emerging world. We can do more, not less, than the best of other countries.</P>
    <P>We should direct our economic resurgence towards eliminating poverty abroad as well as at home. It was outrageous to see the figures published by Barnardos and UNICEF yesterday which show that a quarter of the children in this country are living in unacceptable poverty at a time when the Minister for Finance does not know what he will do with his budget surplus. We should target that money at people who need it both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has published legislation which commits it when next in Government, with whatever party it may be in Government, to establish a target of 0.7% of gross national product for overseas development. That will be a statutory commitment. That is the way to do it. The Minister of State must cross the Rubicon and say we are committed to doing something about Third World poverty, the lack of education, huge mortality rates, etc.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government responds by saying it will reach its targets and do its bit to ensure Third World poverty is eliminated. Otherwise, we can pick another date out of the sky, such as 2015, knowing there is no commitment at national or global level to reach targets by that date. We must take steps to show what we will deliver each year until we reach our target. The Minister of State did not say anything which shows we are serious about that. It is an outrage that for the first year in eight years we are going backwards in terms of the percentage of our gross national product being spent on overseas development.</P>
    <P>Our non-governmental organisations are wonderful and the people are charitable. They make contributions to the Third World on a voluntary basis. However, that is not good enough. The Government holds the purse strings to the surplus tax people pay to the Exchequer as a result of our booming economy. Let us use this to the best advantage and let us ensure that it is used where it is most needed, on a global scene.</P>
    <P>In terms of the legislation before us, I have always questioned the manner of operation of the World Bank and its reliability as a facility for channelling funds. Because of our strong links with Third World countries and our strong non-governmental organisations that are working in virtually all of the countries experiencing poverty and famine, we are in a position to do far more than the World Bank. The World Bank has always imposed strictures and operated mechanisms that do not take into account human suffer<Col N="1181" /> ing. It is not a suitable channel for the distribution of funds. I am not satisfied that it has got its house sufficiently in order for us to pay out £20 million willy nilly and tell it to get on with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about putting in place certain levels of accountability and transparency and ensuring that countries to which money is distributed have a proper governance in place and that they have structures and institutions that can be checked. That is lip service. I would like to see the actual figures. I do not want to see funding distributed to warring factions, put towards military equipment or misused for any purpose. We must ensure that we are able to trace every penny that goes from this country to the Third World through any institution affiliated to any body that is responsible for the dispensing of moneys from this country.</P>
    <P>It is important that money sent from this country gets to the people to whom it is directed, that the community on the ground has a say in its distribution and use and that it is not distributed just to deal with media problems but that it has regard for the long term as well. We could and should adopt, so to speak &ndash; I do not want to use that word in a pejorative sense &ndash; a Third World country be it in Africa or in the Far East, like East Timor, and make ourselves responsible on the international stage for the development of that country. To do that we would have to provide for, on the one hand, capital and current spending abroad for building up the infrastructure in that country and, on the other, have an exchange mechanism where children and adults from the country would come here to be educated, trained and so on. We would twin, so to speak, with a country that is in extreme poverty and in dire need. In that sense we, as a people, would be responsible for its development. We would take on the responsibility at a human level and we would put in place whatever mechanisms and exchange structures are necessary.</P>
    <P>It would be a two way process, not just charity going out from the country but a human interaction where we would assist, with our extra resources, the development of that Third World country. We could also link up in a practical and developmental fashion in that citizens of that country could come to Ireland while our own citizens could go to the Third World country for developmental purposes. I would like the Department of Foreign Affairs to examine a model such as that. We send our non-governmental organisations to these countries but why can we not be the equivalent and twin with a country and support it for a period of years? This is an idea that could be sold perhaps to the United Nations. Every country in Europe could do the same and in that sense we could act in consort with the overall development.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose this legislation. I am always happy to see money being put aside for developmental purposes abroad. I hope it will be well used by the institution through which we are channelling it and I hope that the Minister will <Col N="1182" /> begin the process of increasing our gross national product percentage that we have agreed with the United Nations. We are not even half way there. It is currently 0.7% and we are only on 0.3%. That has to be done but we will never do it unless we draw the line on a statutory basis and do it within a space of time.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a new structure explored where we would be prepared to link up with some Third World country and take responsibility for overseeing all development. Essentially we would be responsible but NGOs from other countries would come under our auspices in a twinned arrangement with a country that is experiencing extreme poverty.</P>

      <P>There has been a general welcome for the Bill but a number of points were raised by all Senators on the issue of our percentage contribution to overseas aid assistance. I am not suggesting that we should not try to achieve the target of 0.7%. We should, and there is general political agreement on that front, but where we can get hung up on percentages, it is important to point out that in 1992, our contribution was £40 million; eight years later, that contribution is £178 million. The percentage figure has risen. There might be some dispute as to whether we are on the same figure as last year but the 1999 figure represented a 27% increase on the year before. In fairness to us as a nation, we are much more generous and more advanced in the way we do things than many other economically strong European countries. The contribution Irish people make through the various voluntary agencies and the many organised collections that take place here amounts to a phenomenal sum of money which is not included in the 0.31%.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we do not give the impression that somehow Ireland is not very committed to this issue. We are. All Governments and political parties here have been. With regard to the £20 million of IDA moneys, it was the fact that Ireland led the argument in the context of the £5 million of supplementary money that encouraged other countries to get involved and also bring in supplementary assistance.</P>
      <P>To take up another point, the Irish voice is a legitimate one on the world stage on these issues. It is a voice that is listened to and respected. The Irish nation was sending people to the Third World as religious and lay missionaries many years before other countries knew what this was all about. I disagree with the Senator's point about twinning. We have been doing that in a bilateral sense for many years. Ireland has identified key priority countries with which it has increased its involvement in a continuing rolling-out programme which was well planned with them a number of years in advance. This encompasses the points, although not in the specifically structured way suggested by the Senator. It is something Ireland does better than most other countries.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered also that the increase in our aid programme over the past number of years has rightly gone mainly into our bilateral relations. Ireland is probably at the top of the league in maximising the benefits of aid to people in the countries in which we operate. It does not negate our involvement in a multilateral sense within the EU in the context of our aid contributions in that forum. That does allow us to have an overview and to speak at fora where we can make the very points made by many Senators who contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another hobby-horse of mine which I was glad to hear mentioned, particularly by Senators Joe Doyle and Finneran, relates to good governance. Good governance and tackling corruption in developing countries is crucial. The despotic ruination of nations that has been carried on in continents such as Africa over generations has had an appalling impact on the ability of people who have got so-called freedom from colonial powers <Col N="1184" /> which resulted in an absolute abuse of power by people who purported to be representing the best interests of their countries. This was referred to by many Senators in the context of the arms build-up and the moneys that have been stolen from ordinary people to build up regimes that protected so-called presidents for life to the detriment of the people in those countries.</P>
    <P>It is right to put good governance and the removal of corruption at political, corporate, public and private levels at the top of the agenda. I am convinced that, irrespective of the amounts of money and resources we make available to these countries, if the regimes are based on corruption all the money in the world will not solve the difficulties encountered by the people.</P>
    <P>The review of IDA money has been specific in terms of targeting. One of the areas at which the IDA has been looking closely and targeting specifically is the problem of HIV and AIDS that is ravaging the Third World today. That is very much a target of the IDA in directing resources to health care and education and in terms of dealing with this crippling issue. Senators may have seen a documentary programme on television on this issue which revealed figures which are frightening. The figures for South Africa are devastating. We are not facing up to that problem and the damage it is doing to the Third World as we should.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate. It is always most enjoyable to come to the Seanad. I am pleased with the response and the support we have in passing this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the lack of any sense of urgency on the part of the Government in addressing the medical and nursing staffing shortages in Irish hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the House. I am very sorry that I must raise this topic. I have asked the Government to debate this issue during its time for the past two years and I have explained, as someone working within the health service, the serious <Col N="1185" /> developments that I have seen regarding staffing. I get Private Members' time only once a year and on each occasion I have had to use it to debate something in the health service. The Government should have dealt with these matters in its own time because the situations were so serious.</P>
    <P>I will address the nursing situation first because it is worse than the medical one. The Commission on Nursing which was chaired by Judge Mella Carroll produced a splendid report. A considerable number of people went before the commission and a great deal of work was put into the report. Three years ago next July it made its recommendations. The current Minister has been in his Department only a short time and I cannot blame him for the delay in bringing forward a solution to some of the problems which were elaborated by the commission. Nor can I blame him for the first nursing strike here which took place last autumn. It took a great effort for nurses to steel themselves to go on strike. They felt the situation, not just regarding money, but career structure and the treatment of their patients left them with no option and they went on strike.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about brinkmanship by the employers within our hospitals. Last month psychiatric nurses almost went on strike in some hospitals because of the non-implementation of the agreements made last autumn. To my amazement I discovered that this dispute was mainly about seniority posts which had been agreed. Some 60% of psychiatric nurses agreed not to strike if another 20 were considered. The fact that we could have a strike on this matter is utterly ridiculous. It shows no sense of understanding the feelings of the people who are employed in these situations. I am very glad Senator Glynn is here because I want to say that we all know that there is a dire shortage of nurses in the psychiatric services. Some speed and imagination are needed to deal with this.</P>
    <P>There are many inactive nurses on the register but this issue could be easily addressed. To do a retraining course nurses are obliged to travel to Dublin and support themselves for six weeks. Why can we not have regional courses? We are in such a bad state. Why can nurses who are inactive and on the register not be paid for going on these courses? If that was done we could get them back into the workforce.</P>
    <P>Recently the Civil Service held a recruitment fair in the RDS. It decided that new recruits could bypass five grades and be admitted into the Civil Service. Why can we not let trained nurses bypass two grades? Instead of nurses joining at the £15,500 level they could join at the £17,000 pay level. If the Civil Service can recruit new people at higher levels, why then can it not happen with nurses joining the health service?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has agreed to recruit more nurses. Will we get people to fill these places? The recruitment situation is nearly as bad as retention. Student nurses have demonstrated outside of this House because they must pay their fees. In a very short time we will have to pay <Col N="1186" /> them not to stay outside of Dáil Éireann but to return to where they are studying.</P>
    <P>I cannot separate consultants from the non-consultant hospital doctors problem. I was very depressed to see the Medical Manpower Forum mentioned in the amendment. The forum has not met for five months. A meeting was arranged for 4 April but it was postponed; a meeting had taken place quite some time before that.</P>
    <P>I objected to the Medical Manpower Forum's make up in the first place. As 60% of medical graduates are women what was the point of starting off with a forum that consisted of 12 men? Surely some imagination could have been exercised within the Department to ensure that women were represented on that forum; the sub-committees included women as did the training committee. The people working in the workforce must be represented at the highest level. There is no reason this sort of thing should happen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked the Minister about the Medical Manpower Forum on 24 May and he replied that the forum would produce a report shortly. Almost a month has passed without anything appearing. The Irish Hospitals Consultants' Association has not agreed to the first report. How on earth will we have a report shortly if half of the people involved in bringing it forward have not agreed to it at all? It is pointless to tell people that something is coming forward shortly unless &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; is next Christmas.</P>
    <P>There is a huge shortage of consultants here. To bring us up to the Scottish level, which is not reckoned as being over-populated with consultants, we would need approximately 1,000 consultants. The North Eastern Health Board, the Midland Health Board and Mid-Western Health Board do not have a rheumatologist. Is there no arthritis in those areas? We know the problems with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions but there are only 12 such consultants in the entire State.</P>
    <P>Scandals do occur in the health service but some of them arise in the areas which are most neglected. Monaghan and Dundalk are the last places in either Ireland or Britain with single handed obstetricians. There are a further nine two handed practices. Since 1 January, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has refused to recognise posts for juniors unless three obstetricians are working in the practice. That means 11 centres will not be recognised. How will they manage without the juniors who do much of the work?</P>
    <P>There is a scandal now about the 78 year old locum pathologist who was employed. There are many single handed pathology practices in hospitals throughout the State. What are these people supposed to do when someone goes on holiday? How will they find locums for these positions? They are entitled to some time off. It is no wonder we end up employing locums with whom there are problems.</P>
    <P>We are far below the medical staffing levels of most developed countries. I beg the Government <Col N="1187" /> not to introduce a screening programme for prostate cancer because there is no way there are enough urologists to deal with it. There are 12 in the State when it is estimated that we need 34. Those on waiting lists who are not there for operations &ndash; patients suffering multiple sclerosis, strokes and other serious neurological conditions &ndash; will never get to see someone. That is pitiful. In 1991 there were 13 neurologists and we in Comhairle na n-Ospideál asked if something could be done to rectify the situation. That was ten years ago. It is no wonder people are angry about the situation.</P>
    <P>Currently, 1% of the population is on a waiting list for an operation. The waiting lists initiative is a good idea but who will operate on these people? Who will anaesthetise them? I was disappointed to hear the Minister say in the Dáil that anaesthesiology is a consultant-provided service. We have no choice but to do it. Gone are the days when there would be a consultant anaesthetist supervising two or three theatres.</P>
    <P>Some people will ask what the non-consultant hospital doctors are doing when they are standing about. They are getting ready for people going into theatre or taking people when they come out of theatre into intensive care. They are going round wards. I do not want to hear that nurses will do these jobs because they are struggling to nurse, never mind trying to fill in for the medical profession. The anaesthetists need their staff. The anaesthetic situation is also appalling. I said sarcastically recently that it is still traditional in Ireland to anaesthetise people for operations but it seems we will soon forget about that.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Medical Council changed its regulations to make non-EU doctors sit an examination which did not tie in with the British examination, I said that we would run into serious trouble. Everyone knew we would because the non-EU doctors could take their examinations elsewhere. The crunch has now come. The lack of training facilities means that non-EU doctors will not be allowed by the Medical Council to train in some hospitals. It has finally been decided that non-EU doctors will not train in Naas. What will happen as a result? Irish and EU doctors will have to go there as part of their rotations. If it is not suitable for training non-EU doctors, how is it suitable for Irish doctors?</P>
    <P>Consultants are asked to continue in medical education and clinical auditing. We would be delighted to but when are we supposed to do it? Every year, 10,000 patients are admitted to hospital and 1,000 per hour, eight hours a day, five days a week are seen in hospitals. There are 1.3 million attendances at accident and emergency departments seen by only 14 accident and emergency consultants. There will be strikes next week because the talks have run into trouble again.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Minister of State are truthful people but who told them there was no trouble with staffing? In the Dáil two weeks ago, ques<Col N="1188" /> tions were answered with replies which stated that there was no trouble filling consultant vacancies. Here I have an advertisement posted by Naas General Hospital asking anaesthetic registrars to submit<i> curricula vitae</i> immediately for two posts. Such advertisements are everywhere. Mallow General Hospital requires senior house officers, general medical staff, general surgery staff and accident and emergency staff for 1 July. St. Luke's Hospital requires senior house officers by 1 July. A locum consultant anaesthetist is immediately required in Ennis General Hospital. The south infirmary of the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital is advertising for a locum consultant radiologist. There are pages and pages of such advertisements in the newspapers. There are advertisements placed by Lettekenny General Hospital seeking obstetricians and gynaecologists, anaesthetists, a registrar in accident and emergency and a senior house officer at once. Sligo General Hospital is looking for medical and geriatric specialists. Maternity hospitals are short of 40 midwives and the Dublin hospital area is short of 1,200 general nurses. In spite of that, I am told there is no crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The motion states that Seanad Éireann deplores the lack of any sense of urgency on the part of the Government in addressing the medical, nursing and staff shortages in Irish hospitals. When Senator Henry first informed me of her intention to table it, I was not all that sympathetic. It is the same everywhere, there are signs for looking for staff in almost every window, whether it is a fast food outlet, a shop or a high tech Internet company. The nursing and medical situation is the same.</P>
      <P>Then I did some study on the area and read that Ireland was among the lowest spenders on health care in the European Union as a proportion of GDP. I realised then that the answer to this is in our own hands, it is not just another shortage. I am at a loss as to how we got into this situation in the first place. If we compare our medical services to a normal commercial business, we expect higher standards from the medical services because they deal with life and death. That is not the case. When we compare the medical services with ordinary businesses, we find them lacking in even the most basic requirements for running a business which any company would accept without question. How can we put up with such a thing? In a normal business there would be imaginative and creative solutions to such problems. Management would not sit back and say that it is a shame it can do nothing about it. That can be seen in many areas of the medical service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry talked about staff shortages. The Mater Hospital was looking for nurses and was offering two, four, six, eight and 12 hour shifts. Others posts involved job sharing. Such efforts are commonplace in commercial outlets but very rare in the health service. We are not a <Col N="1189" /> Third World country, we are a rich nation with a growth rate higher than any other OECD country. It is not enough to sit back and say nothing can be done. The Government has enough money to do something about it but we are lacking imagination and creative management.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry may be right that there is a lack of management training. We have medical services which can only be described as a disgrace. We starved these services of resources to the extent that no one is surprised when malpractice scandals arise. Why did we tolerate this? Was it because the standards on offer at the top level, which is accessed by the fortunate few, are impeccable? The standard of care and service provided at this level is extremely high because the best consultants are employed in private hospitals. As a result, the needs of important people are catered for while others are obliged to accept a level medical services which no advanced country would dare to offer its citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that a multitude of excuses, which date from the period when the country was less well off, can be put forward to explain why the level of service available to ordinary people is so bad. In my opinion the apparently abysmally low standard of management in the health services dates from the period to which I refer when we could not afford to take action, but surely those days are gone. For many years we have taken a &ldquo;poor mouth&rdquo; approach to the difficulties which have arisen in respect of this and other areas. Now that we can afford to put matters right we should surely begin by improving the health services.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar with the health services as Senator Henry. However, I have enjoyed a number of good experiences when dealing with hospitals in recent months. On the past two bank holiday Mondays I have been obliged to attend the accident and emergency department in Beaumont Hospital because, on both occasions, I injured myself while working in the garden. I arrived in the hospital at 9 a.m. and I was very impressed by the level of care and attention the six people in the accident and emergency department, including me, received.</P>
    <P>I am informed, however, that if one attends an accident and emergency department during peak hours one will see that they are obliged to deal with successive crises. However, that is no different from the situation which obtains in most other businesses. If a person is obliged to wait for six or seven hours in an accident and emergency department in order to receive treatment, their temper will become frayed and they will become angry or aggressive. The fact that people awaiting treatment may have taken alcohol or another substance means that there is a need to employ security personnel to maintain order.</P>
    <P>These are the challenges faced by those involved in management in any business. However, the people who manage our health services have not adapted to these challenges. The crisis in the health service may not be due merely <Col N="1190" /> to a shortage of money, it may, perhaps, be due to a lack of management training. I wish to refer to three examples to illustrate my point.</P>
    <P>First, a number of agreements reached in respect of non-consultant hospital doctors in 1997 have not yet been implemented. If that happened in a normal commercial enterprise chaos would ensue, employees would go on strike and there would be a breakdown in industrial relations. The second example involves the agreement reached in respect of the regrading of psychiatric nurses in October 1999. That agreement has not yet been implemented and a strike has been threatened in recent weeks My third example refers to junior doctors' rosters. It was agreed, perhaps three to four weeks ago, that responsibility for the these rosters would be assumed by a senior member of staff in hospitals. Apparently, however, the new system has not yet been implemented in a number of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The examples to which I refer do not involve medical matters, they relate to normal management practices which must be put in place. Part of the problem is that those involved in managing our hospitals require advice and help and they should be encouraged to undergo specialised management training. These people should be able to run our hospitals and the medical service in general as if they were normal businesses.</P>
    <P>Let us consider how technology might be used to improve matters in the health service. Mechanical aids such as the hoists used in geriatric wards and other technological developments could be used to allow a smaller number of people to do the job better. However, if we do not invest money with a view to providing such aids, the care people receive will not improve. The situation which obtains in respect of providing secretarial staff in our hospitals with word processors and modern computers is similar. In a normal commercial venture, an immediate investment would have been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>The lack of investment in the health services was understandable in the past. However, it is no longer understandable, excusable or acceptable, particularly when one considers that we are discussing matters of life and death. Instead of proceeding with the Government amendment to the motion, I urge the Minister to state that there is a need to take urgent action in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &rdquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&rdquo;noting that the Government established the Medical Manpower Forum to review the medical staffing in Irish hospitals; recognising that the Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on Nursing, which are designed to address the underlying problems within the profession and develop nursing as a key profession within the health services; commends the Government on its efforts to address the <Col N="1191" /> medical and nursing shortages in Irish hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to criticise the previous speakers but one could infer from their comments that we are living in a Third World country with a Third World medical service. That is not the case. Our best is as good as the gold standard offered in other countries. I have no desire to undermine the commitment of consultants, doctors and nurses to developing a quality service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Senator in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to pick a fight with Senators Henry and Quinn and I accept that there are a number of problems in the health service. However, health services in every country encounter difficulties. One need only consider the manpower shortages and the lack of investment in the British health service. At least the problems faced by the Irish health service relate to a lack of money not manpower. That is the thrust of Senator Henry's argument.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made a number of important points. He said that while hospitals should not be run as commercial entities, they should be managed in line with commercial standards. I have said previously that hospital managers should be trained in hotel schools and not by the IPA. The approach adopted by hotel managers is customer-oriented, while that of health managers is, by and large, systems-oriented. Many Senators are members of health boards and can testify that they receive a staggering number of reports on a monthly basis. They will also agree that they are expected to be <i>au fait</i> with each of these reports.</P>
      <P>One of the problems with the health service is the tendency to focus on systems rather than people. Another is the fact that we are moving towards a consumer led environment. People are aware of developments in medicine and they want to avail of new treatments and services. They rightly expect these to be delivered, irrespective of their ability to pay for them. There are three areas &ndash; health, education and social welfare &ndash; where the services on offer should not depend on people's ability to meet the cost of those services. Such services should be delivered on the basis of need.</P>
      <P>There has been a change in attitude among people joining the health services. Senator Henry will recall that there was an atmosphere of vocation when we entered the health profession. However, that has changed. Students sitting the leaving certificate require straight As in order to gain entry to medical school. I often wonder if such students are ideally suited to becoming doctors or nurses. In my opinion they may be extremely intelligent but they may not have the patience required to endure the daily grind of medical practice. This matter must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People's entry to the medical profession is determined solely by the number of points they <Col N="1192" /> obtain &ndash; if they obtain the requisite number of points, they will be allowed to enter medical school. To interfere with that system might lead to charges of favouritism, etc. That issue must be examined.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the near future people will receive a licence to practise medicine only for a certain number of years, after which they will be reassessed and re-licensed depending on their ability to practise and their level of training. This will have huge implications for staffing in the health professions from doctors to nurses to paramedics. People will not be licensed for life any more and will certainly not be licensed up to 75 years of age in the general medical services. I note that a consultant in England practised pathology up to 78 years of age; he was probably a pathology specimen himself at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children and all future Ministers will have to deal with the huge vested interests in the medical and paramedical professions. Any move the Minister makes will have a domino effect on all grades throughout the health service. Although many people in the health service realise the value of change they, like all human beings, will be slow to change.</P>
    <P>The Minister has probably not read the book by Professor McCormack and the late Dr. Skrabanek with which Senator Henry and I are familiar, although his officials may have brought it to his attention. The book is essential reading for anyone dealing with the delivery of health care. These eminent doctors &ndash; Professor McCormack is still practising &ndash; cast a cold eye on many modern medical fashions such as screening. People are screened for everything nowadays. A person could be screened for coronary heart disease, receive a clean bill of health, walk out the door and drop dead from a heart attack. Screening is not foolproof. The adoption of a mechanical view of medicine, as happens in America and Germany where doctors test for everything, may miss many important factors. The ability to deliver good medicine depends on the practitioners' experience, the years of grind in which they learn from their mistakes or failure to identify problems. That fact should not be underestimated when doctors are being employed.</P>
    <P>I do not have any real experience of health board areas outside Dublin but the insistence that senior consultants should spend a number of years abroad, primarily in America, represents a serious waste of money. We can train our consultants to a very high standard here and can send them to good teaching hospitals for a few months if additional experience is required. It is not necessary to waste five good years of medical manpower by insisting that doctors go abroad. Those doctors apply for jobs, their CVs are full of papers which nobody will ever read and which most interviewers would find incomprehensible, and they are subsequently employed here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Senator Henry has raised over a number of months on <Col N="1193" /> the Order of Business the urgent need to address staffing shortages in the health service. I am disappointed that that urgency is not embodied in the amendment. Most of the Senators present are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and I had hoped we could have worked together to resolve this issue.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Medical Manpower Forum has been established and I understand that Departments and local authorities must set up various committees. Senator Henry's intention, in tabling this motion, was to get the Minister to acknowledge the existence of problems and to outline specific measures to address those. Perhaps the Minister will address these issues in his contribution. That is all the motion seeks to do.</P>
      <P>We are not dealing with mere statistics here. The people who make up these figures are real people who are awaiting operations. Nurses are not under pressure because there are not any vacancies outside Dublin but because it is virtually impossible to replace nurses who are on sick leave or bereavement leave. Hospitals can deal with foreseen absences such as maternity leave. It is not the desire to create a better environment for nurses which poses problems, rather it is the day to day pressure and inability to cope because nurses are absent due to unforeseen circumstances. The urgency of this motion centres around what we can do to relieve the pressures which currently exist in the health service.</P>
      <P>Due to the limited time available to me, I intend to concentrate on nurses. It would be cold comfort to them to hear that the Medical Manpower Forum has been established. Their eyes would glaze over on hearing that the forum was established to review medical staffing in Irish hospitals when they are already aware, from a succession of reports, of the problems which currently exist and which existed long before the nurses' strike.</P>
      <P>We know there is a shortage of nurses in the Dublin area, although the same problem may not exist outside Dublin. There will not be a massive exodus of nurses from Limerick to Dublin because nurses do not want to work in Dublin. Many nurses who trained in Dublin will naturally want to return to their own areas and many will want to train in their own areas. Due to the lack of openings in nursing schools &ndash; I am referring specifically to Limerick &ndash; many nursing students have to go abroad. They will naturally want to go the regions when they return home. I do not know what the Minister intends to do about the shortages in Dublin, which are not confined to the nursing profession. The major problems and crises exist in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Reviews are all very well but the Minister must address the reality. There is a need for a greater number of social workers and junior doctors. What will happen in July when new contracts must be signed? Perhaps there will be automatic replacements in July but the Minister must address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> What has happened in regard to the medical professionals who were supposed to come here from the Philippines? Are these people already <i>in situ</i>? I understand there are 14 in St. James's Hospital and 70 in the Mater Hospital. I also understand that St. John of God's Hospital has certain missionary or other links with the Philippines and that up to 100 medical personnel may be employed there. I hope that this issue, which was raised in meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in March, has been addressed.</P>
    <P>There has been an improved intake of 30 people by the Daughters of Charity at St. Vincent's, Lisnagry as a result of the strong recruitment drive in the media. I stated previously that the campaign budget of £400,000 was very low and that a more attractive campaign could have been launched to attract young people into the nursing profession, particularly psychiatric nursing.</P>
    <P>On the centralisation of nursing training and the proposal to bring this under the CAO system, what will happen in regard to points? The points required for nursing are relatively low at present. Students currently require two C grades on higher papers and four D3 grades on lower papers. Has thought been given to what may happen when nursing comes under the CAO system? I have been told that 1,500 of the 5,000 applicants have already been placed.</P>
    <P>Many of those who take the graduate nursing diploma in the University of Limerick do not proceed to nursing careers but take up teaching or travel abroad. This does not improve the supply of nurses. Although the Minister has provided finance for those who opt to study for an extra year these students have not been incorporated in the student body. I know the Minister feels it would be difficult to balance between those who have gone through the apprentice scheme and those who have gone through a degree scheme, that there may be an inequity.</P>
    <P>Rheumatoid arthritis is a major issue in Limerick. I receive many representations from people who wish to know why patients must travel to Galway or Dublin for treatment for this condition. Rheumatoid arthritis patients suffer dreadfully in the damp climate of Limerick and the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would need another half hour to talk about the problems of cancer treatment. An integrated cancer treatment service is needed, particularly for women. I recently travelled with Deputy Keaveney to see the integrated breast cancer service in London. In the Royal Free Hospital I was pleased to note that of the 1,300 beds dealing solely with breast cancer, only 12 were reserved for private patients. I would like to see our public patients having the same access to services as is the case in other countries.</P>
    <P>I hope the nursing profession does not become one which does not attract young people. This would leave the medical service in a sad and sorry state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for raising this issue and for giving me an opportunity to make a comprehensive statement on medical and nursing staffing difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the contributions of Senator Henry and other Senators. Politicians and the general public must decide whether or not we accept regional statutory health authorities. The Government has been condemned this evening. Regional health authorities were established in 1970 with statutory powers to do certain things about which people are now complaining. The regional authorities are responsible for manpower and human resources. I do not condemn management at local or regional level but there is confusion on this question. Everyone wants the Government to take responsibility for matters, yet everyone loves the idea of regionalisation and trumpets the cause of regional authorities and the need for them. However, I am still asked parliamentary questions about why someone in Castlebar is waiting for an ENT procedure, for example. It is time we decided whether we want a regional approach to the health service or to have all power retained at the centre. We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry rightly asks where I get my information regarding the shortage of consultants and their recruitment. I do so by liaising with health boards. Structures of communication between the players in health boards are not satisfactory. Consultants tend to make statements to the medical press. I have often asked people who complain about situations if they have spoken to their health board on these matters.</P>
      <P>I was in Mallow hospital last week to discuss a range of issues, particularly the expansion of the hospital. Many people still fear that hospitals will close as they did in the 1980s. It is no longer Government policy to close hospitals. Its policy is one of expansion. However, if a particular area of a hospital is changed, perhaps because of developments in Cork University Hospital, local people become defensive and fear that their hospital will close. There is a reluctance by major players in the health service to engage, even with the local or regional health authority. I stressed to those I met in Mallow that they must engage with their health board. They cannot demand that the Minister solves their problem because they do not wish to talk to their health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made on the issue of medical examinations. The Medical Council is a statutory authority established by the Oireachtas to make recommendations to the Minister and to do certain work, yet the Minister is asked to intervene and tell the Medical Council what to do. The same applies to Comhairle na n-Ospidéal. Senator Henry has more experience of the comhairle than I. When people do not like what the comhairle tells them, in terms of where consultants should be appointed, they ask the Minister to intervene. There is a reluctance to accept that <Col N="1196" /> statutory bodies which have been established to do certain tasks must be allowed to do them.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council was set up with great care and given clear functions with regard to the medical profession. Any Minister must be extremely careful not to undermine its statutory independence. I have had consultations with the board of the Medical Council on a number of issues and we have agreed to have ongoing consultations so that its professional development and training remit can be fulfilled while its impact on services in the short term is recognised. This problem deserves to be ironed out. Statutory health bodies have been established and given clear functions. We must acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>Investment in health in the past three years amounts to £4.1 billion, although that figure means very little to patients or to people attending accident and emergency units. The hierarchical structure of hospitals has changed little in the past 100 years, despite much change in health and society generally. Hospitals retain the old hierarchical structure of consultant, registrar, house officer and intern. We must change and reconsider what we are doing. The medical manpower forum was not established by my predecessor to while away the time. Delays are regrettable but the forum will deal with issues which must be agreed by all sides and critical issues are outstanding. The medical manpower forum was established to investigate medical staffing in our hospitals and bring forward recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the reasonable expectations of a patient entering hospital is that he will be looked after by medical and nursing staff who possess the skills and experience necessary to undertake the task. The medical manpower forum was established to focus on addressing the imbalance in hospitals between career posts and training posts, the need to improve postgraduate medical training to keep more Irish medical graduates in the country and the need to provide the highest quality of medical care for those who require the services of hospitals.</P>
    <P>At present there are approximately two junior doctors for every consultant employed. Non-consultant hospital doctors regard career prospects as poor and many emigrate. Young doctors tend to leave at the point where they have just acquired the skills and expertise and are ready to make a real contribution to Irish hospitals. Women doctors also leave the system and there is a need to examine the reasons why this is happening so that solutions can be found to facilitate the optimum use of their skills and develop training structures to accommodate their needs. I am not happy to preside over such a system and I intend to make major changes in the way hospitals are staffed. Other areas which require attention are the different needs of larger and smaller hospitals, combining other disciplines with medical staffing, general practitioners and nurses, and coping with the demographic changes which have occurred in Irish society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> The Medical Manpower Forum, in association with the various medical interests, will address longer-term contracts for non-consultant hospital doctors. I want to give greater certainty to young doctors as to where they will be working and what they will be required to do. A system of structured rotations that includes training in the larger teaching hospitals as well as smaller general hospitals will give young doctors a broad range of experience and make them fit to fill posts as consultants in the Irish health service. Other concerns include revised arrangements for medical training and the need to take the requirements of women into account. There is much to be done here and I am anxious to progress with agreed improvement and make greater provision in the system for the needs of women.</P>
    <P>Institutional structural reform is needed to allocate clear responsibility for ensuring the quality of training in Irish hospitals. There is a need to place more fully trained doctors in our hospitals. This is especially true of night cover and at weekends.</P>
    <P>The Medical Manpower Forum seeks to propose policies that maintain and improve patient care while providing a satisfactory working environment and career structure for all hospital doctors. While the forum is expected to advocate an increase in the number of doctors and consultants, major changes are recommended to the structure of training for NCHDs as follows: each hospital should have a training strategy and there should be development of training partnerships with UK and US hospitals, with accreditation of training placements abroad, with training structures and opportunities made available in modular form, both full-time and part-time, forming part of an overall professional development structure that also meets the needs of nurses and other grades of hospital staff. The report will address the need for improved medical education.</P>
    <P>Other changes recommended include advocating the development of new training structures which allocate protected time to research, an important issue, the provision of career opportunities for Irish medical graduates with a research orientation, a five year national research strategy, the development of links with private funders and the exploration of roles for senior medical researchers. The Medical Manpower Forum has much to offer NCHDs and we want to publish its first report shortly.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the point about the meetings of the forum. Over the past few months, there has been a series of bilateral meetings with individual organisations that constitute the forum to try to make progress on some of the thorny issues that are still unresolved. We think there has to be change. Other interests will have different perspectives on those issues but we will have to continue to negotiate to arrive at a conclusion. We must also resolve the situation with the junior doctors which is currently with the LRC. This House is not currently the correct forum to resolve those issues. The matter is with the Lab<Col N="1198" /> our Relations Commission and both parties should work in that context to resolve the outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>I take a deep personal interest in the non-consultant hospital doctors' issues. We have already agreed an interim agreement on overtime rates. I have taken a personal interest in the entire industrial relations framework in the health arena because I am conscious that we had 12 major disputes in the past four years. We must move on now to a new era. The LRC will engage in an audit of the health situation in terms of industrial relations. The national partnership group for health under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness will be meeting to develop protocols and so on.</P>
    <P>I am developing the concept of involving all the health partners in a strategic approach to health over the next ten years so that we could collectively develop a strategic plan for the next decade together. All the players should have a sense of ownership in that plan. It is the direction I want take away from the sort of &ldquo;pot-shotting&rdquo; going on between management, partners or the different players and to move on to a different plane and put industrial relations on to a new framework.</P>
    <P>Some junior hospital doctors work long hours which had the effect of making many NCHDs more inclined to seek positions in other countries or, indeed, in other professions. For this reason, I welcome the new proposed EU Working Time Directive. Initially, NCHDs as doctors in training were, as the Senators know, one of a number of groups excluded from the original EU Working Time Directive adopted in 1993.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that agreement has now been reached on a formula which provides for a nine year transition period to apply the directive to junior doctors. I took the initiative to move from the 13 years down to nine years and I would like it noted that this is an indication of my goodwill towards resolving the situation in which junior doctors find themselves. We must work together to find the right logistics and mechanics to enable us to achieve that timeframe which will be a challenge in itself. We are committed to reducing doctors' working hours to an average of 48 per week as quickly as we can in accordance with European legislation. If we can do this quickly, I will be glad to do it. I am confident that, with the full co-operation of the profession, we can achieve that objective in the nine years ahead.</P>
    <P>As part of our preparations for this eventuality we are conducting a major study of NCHD working hours on a joint basis with the Irish Medical Organisation. The study is being undertaken at eight hospitals by PA Management Consultants. The report of the study will be available by the end of this month.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined, I had consultations with the Medical Council already, which has decided today that candidates who achieve an overall pass mark in the PLAB &ndash; Professional Linguistic Assessment Board &ndash;  examination conducted by <Col N="1199" /> the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom will be exempted from the requirement to take the Irish equivalent assessment. Part 1 of the PLAB can often be taken in the applicant's country of origin. This should make it easier for some non-EU doctors to consider working here.</P>
    <P>Some health boards have been actively trying to recruit junior hospital doctors from countries such as Germany where currently there is a surplus of non-consultant hospital doctors. I am also aware that health boards are attending medical employment fairs to encourage junior hospital doctors to work in Ireland. We have been proactively talking to health boards and telling them to enter the market, start recruiting potential junior doctors and meet their manpower shortages and requirements.</P>
    <P>On nursing, at the end of 1998, a total of 26,695 wholetime equivalent nursing staff were employed which represents over 31,000 individuals due to the very significant numbers who have opted to work in job sharing or part-time arrangements. In addition, significant resources have been invested to facilitate general practitioners in employing practice nurses in their surgeries. There are now several hundred nurses working in this area.</P>
    <P>While the number of qualified nursing staff in employment is now at an all time high, the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of nurse education to the diploma based programme has impacted on the availability of nurses. This is because the service contribution of students trained under the traditional model has been replaced by a skill mix of registered nurses and non-nursing personnel. While this has enhanced the quality of nursing care through the creation of additional nursing posts in hospitals, it has had the effect of absorbing the pool of surplus nurses that existed when student nurses were part of the rostered workforce.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that in 1993-4 when the first diploma based programme was being planned, there was increasing resistance from the nursing profession to maintaining a high student intake at a time when nurses on registration were finding it difficult to find employment. This issue was highlighted by An Bord Altranais in 1994 in a report which referred to a general contraction in nurse employment both at home and abroad. In 1990, the Department commissioned a study of nursing personnel which was presented to the Department in 1995. That took a long time to complete. That report recommended a gradual reduction in the number of student nurses up to the year 2000. We can see how dramatically the situation has changed. Ironically, there is now a general shortage of nurses not only in Ireland but in the United States, Britain and most other European countries.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is encouraging there has been a net inflow of nurses to Ireland in recent years. Data maintained by An Bord Altranais show that, in 1996, the inflow was 939 <Col N="1200" /> nurses while the outflow was 1,079 nurses. By 1998, the number coming in had increased to 1,400 while the number leaving had decreased to 850. The inflow figure for 1999 is 3,181 which represents a dramatic increase over 1998. This trend proves that Ireland continues to be competitive when it comes to recruiting nurses from abroad.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, agreement has been reached between the relevant Departments, to refer to Senator Jackman's point, on a procedure for fast tracking immigration clearances and work permits for non-European Union nurses. The indications are that there is not a nationwide problem regarding the availability of nurses and the difficulties largely relate to the greater Dublin area. While some nurses have always moved from Dublin to other parts of the country, investment in hospitals and the development of regional specialities in recent years have increased demand for nurses outside the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Nurse recruitment is carried out on an ongoing basis in most hospitals and the level of vacancies fluctuates accordingly. At any given time, significant numbers of nurses would be in the process of being appointed by employers or moving from one employment to another.</P>
    <P>Hospitals are taking a number of recruitment initiatives. We have been in touch with hospitals and again in touch with health boards telling them to go to the international fairs and start recruiting and make sure we can bring in as many nurses as we can. For example, Beaumont Hospital's most recent initiatives to attract nurses included large stand-alone advertisements in national and international papers and nursing magazines highlighting what the organisation can offer, participation in the recent national recruitment skills fair in the RDS and interviewing foreign nurses. The hospital continues its advertising programme in Northern Ireland, England and Canada as well as its in-house recruitment and retention initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital anticipates that approximately 70 nurses from the Philippines will be employed in the near future. However, it will be necessary for them to attend a six week orientation course prior to commencing employment. The first such course commenced last week.</P>
    <P>Tallaght Hospital is engaged in an international recruitment drive. It has made 92 job offers to date with the first recruits expected in early July. Its overseas recruitment will continue throughout this year. St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, is involved in a number of initiatives, including contracting ex-members of staff and offering more flexible working hours. It also continues to work with nursing recruitment agencies to fill vacancies.</P>
    <P>St. James's Hospital is also employing a range of initiatives to fill positions. As well as advertising in the national press, it interviews and appoints successful candidates who forward their CVs without any invitation. A nursing recruit<Col N="1201" /> ment agency is also being utilised to locate specialised nursing staff worldwide, particularly in South Africa, for the critical care and operating theatre areas. The hospital is promoting flexible working hours and creating a family-friendly environment. A proposal to develop an on-site crèche is being prepared. I visited the hospital recently to open a new cardiac facility and it was interesting that it had made great progress in terms of recruiting nurses. The lesson is that different initiatives are being taken by hospitals and agencies but some are more proactive than others and are, therefore, making greater progress in terms of manpower issues.</P>
    <P>The major Dublin hospitals have also undertaken a recruitment and retention research project. An action plan for implementation of the report's recommendations is under consideration by chief executive officers and directors of nursing. A range of initiatives has also been taken, or is being progressed, at national level with a view to stabilising the situation and improving it, where possible. These initiatives include new arrangements which have been introduced to give better starting pay to nurses taking up employment by giving full recognition for previous experience at home and abroad. A significantly improved regime of allowances in respect of nurses working in specialised areas, such as operating theatres and intensive care units, has also been introduced.</P>
    <P>Standardised overtime working arrangements have been introduced following agreement with the nursing unions. Some 11 hospitals throughout Ireland provided back to nursing courses in 1999 for those wishing to return to the workforce. A total of 304 places were available. The expansion of these courses is aimed at maximising the available nursing workforce. During 1999/2000 16 new post-registration programmes have been developed. This year there will be 660 places on such courses in specialised areas of clinical practice. Some 11 of the 16 new programmes will be located outside Dublin in response to an identified need.</P>
    <P>An anti-bullying document prepared by the HSEA and agreed with the nursing unions was published in December 1999 and has been widely promoted within the service. The promotion structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. Up to 1,250 clinical nurse midwife specialist positions are to be introduced for nurses who have recognised expertise in particular areas. These posts attract clinical nurse manager 2 salary. Nurses are also benefiting from an agreement to upgrade 1,100 staff nurse posts to clinical nurse manager grade 1, which is being implemented.</P>
    <P>A study of the nursing and midwifery resource by the nursing policy division of the Department of Health and Children commenced in 1998 with the primary purpose of forecasting future nursing and midwifery resource needs. Following this, a <Col N="1202" /> national study on turnover in nursing and midwifery has been commissioned by the Department through the Health Research Board and awarded to the Department of Nursing Studies, University College Cork. Employers have stepped up recruitment from abroad with significant success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, in addition to ongoing recruitment within Ireland.</P>
    <P>Swift progress is being made on the implementation of the agenda for change mapped out by the Commission on Nursing. It is all systems go from the Department's perspective in this regard. It was interesting that when all the nursing union leaders spoke at their respective conferences they heaped considerable praise on the nursing division of my Department. They were satisfied with the bona fides of that division in terms of its drive and commitment to implement the commission's recommendations. They had problems with regional authorities in terms of implementation on the ground. We have spoken to health authorities in respect of the absolute importance of fulfilling the agreement that was reached as a consequence of the industrial dispute and we have maintained close dialogue with these authorities to make sure that outstanding payments are made to nurses as fast as is feasible. Many health boards have difficulties in terms of payroll systems, etc., in implementing this complex agreement but we are sparing no effort to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
    <P>I will continue to oversee their implementation. I have met all the unions in the nursing profession on a number of occasions, including the PMA. We had a good discussion with that union recently and I am glad that collectively we deferred the industrial dispute which had been planned. Channels of communication were opened that could lead to a better industrial relations climate. That is my objective and it is something that I am keen to develop with the HSEA and the Department.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Nursing recommended that the Department, health service providers and nursing organisations should examine the development of appropriate systems to determine nursing staffing levels. The need to address skill mix issues was also highlighted in the commission's report. Both of these recommendations are included in the priority action plan agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike.</P>
    <P>We are also keen to attract young people into the nursing profession. The number of training places increased by 153 between 1998 and 1999. This was the first increase in places since the diploma programme was introduced in 1994. Some 3,100 student nurses are in training. The 2000 intake will be 1,500, an increase of 300 on 1999. This increased figure was agreed with the Nursing Alliance as part of the settlement of the nurses' strike. A further 20 places are available on a new direct entry midwifery programme which is being introduced on a pilot basis. There was a record <Col N="1203" /> intake of psychiatric nurses last year. We have turned the corner in terms of attracting young people into psychiatric nursing and have opened new schools in this field. Two more will open in Ardee and Monaghan. We have developed good relationships with the institutes of technology in certain locations and they will serve as host schools.</P>
    <P>In 1999, following a local and national recruitment campaign costing £400,000, which was funded by the Department, the number of applicants increased by more than 40% on 1998. This resulted in the largest number of direct entrants to nursing for several years. A total of 1,215 training places were filled in 1999, including record intakes of students to psychiatric and mental handicap nurse training. Further funding totalling £400,000 was made available to the various schools of nursing nationwide late last year to enable them undertake local marketing campaigns aimed at promoting nursing as a career. This year there were more than three applicants for every available training place. This is most encouraging bearing in mind that the total number of training places has been increased by 25% over last year to 1,500 and the reduction in the volume of applicants for public service positions generally.</P>
    <P>The annual maintenance grant for nursing students, which is not subject to a means test, has been increased to £3,325 with effect from 1 April 2000. The grant is almost double the maximum grant for which other third level students may qualify. In addition, allowances for external clinical placements, books and uniforms have also been increased. These initiatives represent a significant effort on our part to improve the situation. In the longer term it is hoped that the substantial increase in the number of student places will provide enough registered nurses to fill all vacancies.</P>
    <P>I refer to the important fees initiative which I announced recently at a cost of £15 million over a number of years. From 1 January 2001 nurses working in the public health service who want to undertake nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses on a part-time basis will have their fees paid in full by their employing agencies. Fees will be paid in return for a commitment on the part of the nurses to continue to work in the public health service for up to two years after the completion of their courses. This fees initiative will continue until at least 2005, at an estimated additional annual cost of £3 million. It is intended both to marry people's needs by giving them opportunities and to monitor the supply side of nursing.</P>
    <P>The initiative is designed for the benefit of nurses who do not already have a degree and includes fees for access courses and nursing degrees undertaken through distance education. It will apply to nurses employed in our public health service in either a permanent or temporary capacity. An important objective of the initiative <Col N="1204" /> is to provide an assurance to graduates of the three year nursing diploma programmes that they will have an opportunity to undertake a part-time degree course and have their fees paid.</P>
    <P>This should act as a real incentive to newly qualified nurses to enter the workforce following registration and to remain there, thus alleviating the current shortage of nursing personnel. The thrust of this fees initiative is to encourage graduates from the nursing diploma programmes to enter the workforce immediately and for employers to retain them. I am glad to say this initiative has been warmly received by the nursing unions who regard it as the most equitable approach to the provision of financial support to nurses and midwives wishing to undertake post-registration education programmes, irrespective of their model of pre-registration training.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by again referring to the issue of funding. The health budget this year is in excess of £4 billion and the increased investment in funding under this Government is unprecedented. A major opportunity is opening up to bring about fundamental and lasting improvement in services. It will take a sustained effort but the challenge is to deliver a service that has the confidence of the entire community, where standards are uniformly excellent and where it is acknowledged that decisions, including decisions about resource allocation, are made wisely and on the basis of objective evidence concerning needs.</P>
    <P>Since taking office, the Government has made available an extra £1,500 million to health, which represents a 56% increase in the day to day resources going into the health service. This level of increased investment will be sustained and if I have anything to do with it, it will be improved over the years.</P>
    <P>An indication of the priority attached to health by the Government can be seen in the fact that previous Governments made available just over £400 million in extra funding. That said, we recognise that in moving forward, not only do we have to spend additional moneys but we must get value for money and we must reform procedures within hospitals and the health service generally. Money alone will not solve this issue. Many good points were made in the House this evening on management issues and the reorganisation of what is happening in the health service, in particular, in hospitals. I am keenly aware of that.</P>
    <P>Over the next seven years, a spending programme of approximately £2 billion will be undertaken within the provisions of the national development plan. There is no doubt that will have a dramatic effect on improving facilities. It will impact on the quality of services in hospitals, including accident and emergency departments. My Department is currently engaged in a review of bed capacity under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to assess bed needs in the health service over the next few years. I understand the change in figures that has taken place over the past ten years and where we stand in the <Col N="1205" /> OECD statistical table. We are examining that area in a critical fashion and hope to have feedback on that matter by the end of July when we will feed that information into the Estimates process.</P>
    <P>The only difficulty we will have in spending the £2 billion is whether or not the system will be able to deliver the range of projects covered under the NDP. That is the big issue now. Whereas people are lobbying for various units, this presents a huge challenge to the health service because such moneys have not been invested in capital projects before. It involves getting design teams organised, presenting briefs and achieving all that work in the 2001-07 period. The timeframe in which to spend the money is very tight. I am also conscious of building inflation and other difficulties that are coming down the tracks, which will present real challenges. In addition, people are seeking more than the £2 billion that will be available.</P>
    <P>The only question that one can realistically pose in terms of extra capital allocation, if I get it, is whether or not we would actually be able to spend it. Would the system be able to deliver the projects in the timeframe we have set? That is one of the major challenges facing us. My Department will have an overseeing role in spending the money and we will work with the health boards in providing extra resources to enable them to get these projects done on time.</P>
    <P>This represents an historic opportunity if we can deal with the organisational issues. I acknowledge the points that Senators have made and I recognise that we have much work to do and more progress to make. However, if we can marry organisational change with the increased investment we will witness an improvement to the quality of health care. I thank Senators for having raised this issue and for allowing me to address the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive presentation. I did not catch all of it but it sounded impressive with £2 billion being spent over the next five years. That works out at £400 million per annum, although the Minister did not indicate whether the expenditure would be front loaded. The motion is warranted, given the experience we have all had in recent months. It calls on Seanad Éireann to deplore &ldquo;the lack of any sense of urgency on the part of the Government in addressing the medical and nursing staffing shortages in Irish hospitals&rdquo;. We have never seen such a level of unrest in the medical service, with nurses on strike and junior doctors marching in the streets. The position is extremely bad at present. I wish to concentrate on my own experience in a hospital casualty department.</P>

      <P>I wish to concentrate on my own experience in casualty. I was in casualty in the Mater Hospital in 1994 on the day that Ireland played Italy in the World Cup. The match was starting at 7 p.m. and I ended up in the hospital at 1 p.m., yet I barely got out in time to see the match, with two fractured arms. I was in pain for those six hours.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, I was in the Mater Hospital again and the situation has not changed significantly in those six years. I wish to go through the procedure that I experienced. I went to a general practitioner at 6 o'clock on Friday evening, experiencing body pains and a tremendous headache that I had not experienced before. I had had the body pains about a week earlier but they had not diminished to any great extent and I felt it was time I saw a doctor. I am glad to see Dr. Fitzpatrick in the House and perhaps I should have attended him. My GP decided it would be best for me to go to casualty and he telephoned the Mater so that I would be seen to very quickly because I had to attend a number of functions that evening. In addition, as I had a severe headache the matter was considered as a priority.</P>
      <P>I arrived at the hospital, was seen and was told by the friendly nurse that I would be dealt with well within the hour. There were just two people ahead of me. I waited until 10 p.m. and there were still two people ahead of me. I had to leave at that stage because of the functions I had to attend. I asked if I could go and come back at midnight and was told that I could go but that my position in the queue could not be guaranteed. My position in the queue had not changed in the three hours I had been there, even though I had been referred there by my GP and had been informed by the nurse on arrival that I was unlikely to be there more than an hour.</P>
      <P>I arrived back at the hospital at 12.30 a.m. and nothing had happened. The two people ahead of me in the queue were still there and had not been seen even though they were priority cases. I was eventually seen shortly after 4 a.m. One of the people in the queue had been moved aside and was not regarded as being as serious a case as me. So, in fact, from 7 p.m. when I had arrived, one person in the queue was dealt with before me on the priority list by 4 a.m. in the morning, a period of nine hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was told that it was not a particularly busy Friday night, but some emergency cases were coming in. A reasonable number of people had been there before I arrived. One person had been there from noon and still had not been dealt with. <Col N="1207" /> Another person with a bad eye injury, who had come from Newry and was on the way to Wicklow but stopped off needing treatment, had been there since 1 p.m. The person still had not been dealt with when I left at 4.30 a.m. They had been there for almost 16 hours, yet had not been dealt with. They had not even been given a painkiller. I had to intervene to try and obtain one for the person who had a ferociously enlarged eye, through which they could not see, following an attack on them in Newry.</P>
    <P>A woman told me that her husband had been admitted and seen by a doctor. Two hours later she went to the cubicle to which he had been taken and discovered that the doctor had disappeared and his file had been left to one side. The nurse said to the woman that she wanted her to appreciate it was not a nurse who left her husband there but a doctor. Another person was there with a child who had a severe football injury. They were there before me and they were still there when I was finished.</P>
    <P>This took place in the casualty department of the Mater Hospital last Friday night. It was almost impossible to get the attention of a doctor or a nurse; one could not make eye contact. A staff nurse was in charge but not in the sense of managing the situation. Nobody was responsible and there was no way that one could courteously ask a question and get a courteous response. People were bypassed and no information was given. People waited for hours on end without any indication of when they would be seen. They were not told their place in the queue or when they might be treated.</P>
    <P>This is my experience, and it was the most horrendous experience I have ever had of any public service. If a politician or a retail outlet provided such a service to their customers, they would not be re-elected or it would go out of business. They could not function; it would not happen. This lack of service was inflicted on the most vulnerable people one can imagine. These people were frightened, injured and in pain. This relates to one casualty department but it is not much different from my experience of the same department six years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister said wonderful things are in progress. There is a need for a major overhaul of structures and how health services are provided to the public. Hospitals are not treating the public as paying customers. This might happen in relation to private health structures, but the situation with regard to public health care is disgraceful in terms of the interface between the public and hospitals in casualty departments. An inquiry into this matter is warranted. I do not understand how the public can continue to be treated in that most discourteous fashion day after day in terms of how long they must wait for services.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion tabled by the Independents. I am not sure that an amendment to the motion should be accepted because there are no improvements on the ground after three years <Col N="1208" /> and there is a question mark over future developments. The motion should be put and the Government should accept it in its entirety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Martin, is no longer present. I am a little schizophrenic because I spend a good deal of my working life drafting replies for Ministers to the types of points made by Senator Henry. I am ashamed to say that I have drafted items like the proposed amendment which elevates blandness to an art form. It is a pity there is a question of dividing the House on this matter because the motion is an expression of concern about a vital public service. This service is of great concern to us all and I am greatly heartened by the Minister's statement. I would prefer it if Senator Henry's motion was considered an expression of concern and that the Minister's statement was viewed as an acceptance of that concern and a response to it rather than a rebuttal.</P>
      <P>In discussions about hospitals and health services, people appear to think that only nurses and doctors work in them. I wish to assert the role of other people who work in the health services and particularly those who are less fashionable, such as ancillary workers, porters and domestics. They are an important part of the caring organisation. If some of their jobs were enriched, it would enable them to take some of the load off nurses. This would release nurses for tasks for which they are more highly trained.</P>
      <P>I am also glad the Minister does not want to answer questions on matters of detail. I accept the issues raised by Senator Costello. However, they have little to do with manpower and everything to do with management and attitude. There is a need for a health service in which the customer is king and is treated as such and in which differences are not made because of one's ability to pay. Why should it be less pleasurable to enter a public hospital than a private hospital? Why should a lower level of care be tolerated?</P>
      <P>While the Minister is right to stress the responsibility of statutory authorities, a strategic overview also needs to be taken. An eye needs to be kept on whether these statutory authorities are discharging their responsibilities uniformly. Some issues overlap and cannot be addressed within the bounds of a health authority. However, there is a need for a proper debate about the type of health services that are possible, needed and can be afforded and how they can be delivered. More than anything, there is a need for leadership. The Minister, Deputy Martin, appears eminently qualified to give that leadership and I hope he takes the matter by the forelock and pulls it forward. He will find that he has to challenge large vested interests, particularly in the professions, if he is to turn the situation around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in Ireland are no different from those that have appeared elsewhere. I was in France recently and there was a strike by junior hospital doctors. The same problems also arise in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The diffi<Col N="1209" /> culty is that lead-in times are so long and the whole issue is so complex that changes take an enormous amount of time. However, despite the explanations given by the Minister, it is not enough to leave it to a manpower forum. There is a tendency in all health services to reach for some form of consultative committee or a report. There are enough reports; implementation is needed.</P>
    <P>We should be heading towards a consultant-led service. Senator Henry pointed out that the day of the single handed consultant is long gone. The day of the three person team is going rapidly if one is to get a one in five rota instead of a one in three rota. This could do interesting things in terms of addressing the problems of the misappropriately named junior hospital doctors. One of the problems in that regard is the number of consultants is not determined by the number entering the system at the bottom, but the number allowed out through the hole at the top. This must be widened.</P>
    <P>If the number of consultants is multiplied by two, there is a need to consider how they are disposed and where they work. People will have to put up with some degree of centralisation. There is a need to start considering epidemiology. Not everything can be done perfectly everywhere and we should not try to achieve that. However, in the short term, there should be a focusing of resources on diseases and conditions which are killing or debilitating people. There is a lot to be said for tackling cancer, heart disease, drugs and geriatric problems in a way which brings tangible and rapid improvement.</P>
    <P>It is increasingly possible to look across the Border to Northern Ireland and to bring it into the pool as well. That could help to solve some of the demographic and locational problems in both parts of the island. Northern Ireland is no better off in terms of waiting lists or employment problems. Nevertheless, there are possible synergies and I encourage the Minister to consider them. I am chairman of a hospital in Belfast and we have just taken on cataract work from the North Eastern Health Board which enables it to shorten its waiting lists and enables us to employ another ophthalmologist and, therefore, to shorten our waiting lists. There is a well developed network of professional connections in this field, North and South, and I encourage the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>We need to go beyond manpower and to look at how medicine is and can be practised in this country. People should be encouraged to look at things radically. We should look at the possibilities of tele-medicine, for example, and of decentralising diagnosis while centralising treatment. Hospital management is a peculiarly difficult operation. However, as the Minister said, there is no point in pouring money into an operation unless it is capable of being well used in a strategic sense.</P>
    <P>The health services are full of dedicated and concerned people. Their concerns not only <Col N="1210" /> require money but consideration. Many of them need to be loved a bit more than they are at present. Someone compared managing a hospital to managing a hotel. However, one bears little resemblance to the other because customers do not generally arrive at hotels in ambulances and in pieces in the middle of the night. There is one analogy which can be made. If staff are treated well, they will treat the customers well. It is important to have a content, happy and motivated staff in the health service. It is also important to ensure that the customer is king and the client is served.</P>
    <P>We must turn the service around and make it more service oriented in the same way as the best service industries. The benefits are there to see if we do that, although it will take a long time. I hope we can agree on that sentiment, on what the Minister said and to support the concerns of Senator Henry and her colleagues without attempting to be complacent or bland about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Henry on bringing this matter to the attention of the House because it is the type of issue we need to discuss. On many previous occasions we on the Independent benches have tried to raise such issues. Senator Henry has tried time after time to get more information on the annual report of the psychiatric services in hospitals. It is important to look at what we are doing here.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister but he seemed to see the picture through rose tinted spectacles. Although he said many things with which I agree, he did not get to the fundamental point that there is a lack of a sense of urgency in addressing the problem. The Minister is right to say that politicians have a habit of giving something to a committee and, when they do not like the result, of asking the Minister to intervene. However, that does not take from the fact that there are problems which are not being addressed.</P>
      <P>We, as public representatives, have an appalling record in our approach to the health issue. We, and parties in particular, have used it time after time as a political football. I could go through every one of the past four or five elections and give examples of big billboards which advertised what one party would do with the hospital queues and what had happened when the other party was in Government. The elections in 1989 and 1992 were largely about health issues. The way the health issue has been handled is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also remember the outcry when the South Western Health Board decided to reduce the waiting lists for hip operations by getting some of them done in Belfast, as Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned. I do not understand why anyone would worry about that. One of the great problems in Irish society is the demand for a hospital in every village and a specialist in every town. However, that is not what this motion is about; it is about making a service available. I agree there <Col N="1211" /> are extraordinary synergies which could be and are being developed. There is no doubt that a hospital, such as Altnagelvin in Derry, is dealing with many people from the north Donegal hinterland. That is the type of operation which should continue.</P>
    <P>The closure of Barrington's Hospital was considered to be the end of the medical service as we knew it in Limerick. However, it was a good decision because it was unnecessary to keep it open. The proper thing to do was to develop services in the region. I cannot remember who was in power at that time but it is irrelevant because whoever was not in power led the opposition to it and agitated people, which always leads to problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a vivid memory of that great gentleman, Jim Kemmy, leading the charge. I recall talking at the time to the then Minister for Health, Barry Desmond, who was a member of the Senator's party, and he told me that not only were the Limerick people opposed to the closure of Barrington's Hospital but they wanted to open a fourth hospital in Limerick. He did not say that publicly at the time, but he did not have any difficulty in hindsight. I could recall other stories as well.</P>
      <P>There are extraordinary demographic changes in Irish society. People are living longer and medical science is allowing them to live more comfortable and better lives. However, this creates more demands for medical services because as people get older they require more care. As knowledge and medical science have progressed, they have become more specialised and focused. Where a generalist, a semi-specialist or a specialist might have dealt with something in the past, it now requires a specialist of specialities to take it further in many cases. People know more about their conditions and, therefore, they demand an understanding of what is happening to them.</P>
      <P>We must go back to the old economic argument. The first rule of economics is a simple one, namely, the first requirement for a developing economy is an educated and healthy society. Health and education require investment. I can listen to Ministers of all hues but it is the same advisers who are doing all the work, writing the speeches, giving advice and deciding on policy. The Government moves the issue on as elections bring new political masters in and out like Lanigan's ball but the reality is that the decisions are being taken there. This is the incontrovertible fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the statistics that have been given to us and all the factual evidence that more and more money is being invested in health and also in education, the reality is that in terms of the services per head of population and in terms of the spend as a percentage of gross domestic or <Col N="1212" /> national product, we are behind our European partners. As I said during the negotiations on the PPF on the areas of health and education, the objective should be to spend on average the same as the average of our European partners in terms of percentage of gross national or domestic product on our health and education services. That is when we will have arrived.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of the simple measurement of whether we have put more money in this year than last year or five years ago. We are starting off from such a low base that these are not the appropriate measurements. The appropriate question is the level or percentage of gross domestic product that should be invested in our health services. That figure is the figure which will be the average for Europe. We are not doing that and there will be a sense of urgency until we do it.</P>
    <P>This is the answer to the Department of Health and Children officials who say that if we give them this they will want more and they will never have enough. The way to deal with this matter is to have a long-term objective and to have a graded way of reaching it. It is for that reason that I strongly support&mdash;</P>

      <P>I promise Senator O'Toole I will not jump left or right but stand where I am. I welcome the Minister to the House. He is deeply committed to resolving whatever difficulties exist in the health services. While I am not saying that everything is Utopia, the amendment before us reflects the factual position pertaining to the performance of this Minister and this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry might feel aggrieved that she did not get this debate sooner but I can tell the Senator and the other Members of this House that I was calling for a college of nursing in Tullamore for 15 years. In fairness to the local media, they gave me credit when that eventually came. I <Col N="1213" /> accept it did not come to Mullingar but, taking up the point that the Minister made earlier, we were talking about a regional facility and that is the context we should be thinking about. I would also refer back to 1985 when the Midland Health Board took a decision pertaining to the rationalisation of hospital services and from that decision flowed quite a number of specialties which we would never have had under the old system, including rheumatology, ophthalmology, ENT, paediatrics, etc. It is important to address this matter in a regional context because that is what is relevant today.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry expressed concern about the nursing shortages, especially in the psychiatric services. Although I am no longer in the profession, I still have an abiding interest in it. I am pleased to go further than the Minister went in respect of the exact statistics pertaining to the recruitment of psychiatric students, which would indicate to all and sundry that we really have turned the corner in the context of recruiting for this nursing discipline. In 1997 we had approximately 100 recruitments and 92 in 1998. The following year we had a record intake of 254 and in the year 2000 we have 300 places. In addition, I am pleased to say there is a practice of retraining nurses who have left the profession. That does not pertain to the psychiatric discipline alone but to all the other nursing disciplines. That is an important use of a resource because any professional person, or any person who has a skill, who is non-practising is a disregard for an important resource.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the college of nursing in Tullamore. When the college was set up in September 1998, we had an intake of 20 students. In September 1999 we had 30 students and in September this year we will have 42 students. It is clear that in this context, while we are not clapping ourselves on the back, we certainly have turned the corner.</P>
    <P>There has been, for very practical reasons, a difficulty in relation to the recruitment of nurses for the Dublin area. A number of factors impact on that difficulty, including the problem of parking and the cost of accommodation. There is a whole plethora of reasons nurses are difficult to recruit.</P>
    <P>In terms of students wanting to pursue diploma courses, there is no doubt that has had an impact. The position that obtained in England, which I understand is now discontinued, was that they had the SRN and the SEN grades. When I visited a psychiatric hospital in Leicester I met the nursing officer, a well informed gentleman who was very courteous to me, but in the main his staff on the day was a dual qualified SEN and a number of other ancillary staff. If that gentleman had to go off the ward, there was no qualified person to replace him. We have criticised ourselves in many ways and we have been criticised here today, in many cases unfairly, but that is one problem we do not have to contend with and we should be grateful for that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I have long felt that our general practitioners are in the main an underused resource. I find it objectionable that if a person gets a thorn in their finger or if they have a pain in their big toe, they go to the casualty department of the local general hospital and immediately become a waiting list statistic. In the main, our general practitioners provide an excellent service but greater use could be made of them. They perform a valuable role currently but that role could be expanded.</P>
    <P>To return to the question of the psychiatric services, we debated a motion last year, again put forward by the Independent Senators, on inappropriate bed occupancy. The practice of lodging in psychiatric hospitals is an abuse. Such people are occupying acute beds, and that is not what psychiatric hospitals are for &ndash; they are for treating people who have psychiatric illness. Each bed therein is an acute bed and it should be used as such.</P>
    <P>The shortage of doctors in Britain will also impact on recruitment of non-consultant doctors here. The long-established tradition of Irish junior doctors going to work in Britain proves the old Irish adage bíonn adharca fada ar eallach thar lear &ndash; far away cows have long horns. It is important for junior doctors to travel and to get experience but it will further impact on the situation here.</P>
    <P>What has been said by the Minister will impact in a positive way. I welcome the £4 million bed replacement announcement by the Minister. If anything has contributed in a major way to back injuries among nurses it is inappropriate bed stocks. The allocation is aimed primarily at psychiatric and geriatric hospitals, but it will have a knock-on benefit for general hospitals as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. From a nurse's point of view I particularly welcome the Government's commitment to the implementation of the full recommendations of the report of the Commission on Nursing.</P>
      <P>We all recognise and acknowledge that there are shortages in the nursing and medical fields. I entered training as a nurse in 1987, when the country was in a deplorable state financially. I was fortunate to be able to enter the profession at that stage. From then until the mid-1990s nurses have been treated in a deplorable manner. That is not a partisan view but is the view of all sides. I particularly welcome the initiatives which the Minister discussed here tonight. However, I would like to put on the record the treatment that nurses received between 1986 and 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it was very difficult to enter the profession. If one did not have an honour in biology and an honour in English &ndash; why one needed an honour in English to enter nursing I do not know &ndash; one was totally disregarded, regardless of individual qualities of patience, a flair for nursing and a bedside manner. In my hospital 21 students completed their course at that time, eight of us were given temporary employment which lasted approximately six months, after which we were <Col N="1215" /> on our own. Most nurses, and most of my friends at that time &ndash; 1991 &ndash; were forced to emigrate or to work in any care setting in nursing homes and so on just to gain experience as a nurse. Many travelled abroad. Nursing was always seen as a training that gave one a passport to the world. However, at that time the emigration was forced and not by choice. Nurses who train nowadays may travel abroad by choice.</P>
    <P>In addition, at that time one could not get a job if one did not have experience, but one could not get experience because there were no jobs. In 1994-95 many hospitals offered employment to nurses on a temporary basis. They were employed on an 11 month contract, after which time they were automatically discharged from their duties, despite the fact that others were coming in to take over their role. That was because if they stayed on any longer they would have to be made permanent in the hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in apportioning blame. However, hospital employers at that time were responsible for the deplorable way in which nurses were treated. I firmly believe that the problems of the early 1990s are only manifesting themselves now because nurses left the country and chose not to return. If the opportunity arises to take up employment as a medical or pharmaceutical representative, in human resource management or many other areas, particularly health and safety which has come to the fore in the last number of years, nurses will take it.</P>
    <P>Despite all the qualifications a nurse may have, it is a particularly physical job which requires dedication. It is no longer a vocation and I am delighted that we have passed the stage where nursing was seen as such. Nursing is a job which requires dedication and commitment. At the moment it requires ongoing education. Nurses must keep abreast of what is happening because changes are taking place in nursing care and treatments on a weekly basis. Unfortunately, we often lose sight of where we were. There are problems now. I would be the first to acknowledge that because I have many friends who are still working in the profession who are having difficulties. However, we must recognise the initiatives which have been introduced in the past few years, particularly as a result of the nursing commission's report.</P>
    <P>The recommendations I particularly welcome are those relating to education and the way nurses are being encouraged back into education whereby their fees will be paid if they commit themselves to working in the public health service for a number of years. I worked in a hospital in the early 1990s at a time when if a nurse wanted to take a one-day course to improve herself &ndash; which would benefit the people she was looking after and the hospital she was working in &ndash; she had to do it on her day off. For the past 15 years, until 1997-98, every nurse had to do that. Money has never been the issue for nurses. Recognition has always been the issue &ndash; recognition of the <Col N="1216" /> job they do, the care they give and the profession they are involved in. However, at that time, no matter what a nurse wanted to do, she had to do it completely at her own expense and she had to organise for somebody else to work in her place if she could not get the day off. They are the facts of the matter.</P>
    <P>The initiatives the Minister has outlined are particularly welcome from the point of view of nurses. I have no doubt that it will encourage people into the profession. Change will take time. Nursing has not been seen in the last couple of years as the ideal occupation because of unsocial hours, the day and night duties. Everything a person does not want exists in nursing. However, of all the jobs I have ever done, there is none that can give such job satisfaction. That is something we lose sight of when we get side-tracked on the issue of the amount of money an individual earns. If nurses feel they are treated well in the profession, and can avail of the opportunities the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his predecessor Deputy Cowen have set in train, it will attract more people into the nursing profession and retain nurses in it. More importantly, the care they are giving because they are satisfied in their job will benefit the patients in the long run and improve our health service.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have time to go into the medical aspect but that could take another eight minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Senator Leonard had more time because it is by personal testimonies like hers that we can see the value of having people with experience in these areas talking in here. I have often said to her that I worry about the fact that no kudos are ever given to the clinical skills of nurses in this debate. When I phone someone at 10 p.m. to inquire about a patient I want to be told more than their pulse and blood pressure measurements. If a nurse tells me they do not like the look of a patient then their comment can tell me an awful lot more about the condition of the patient. A comment from someone who has worked in this situation means an awful lot more than measurements. Senator Tom Fitzgerald and I argued about this issue yesterday but I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>I am profoundly disappointed in what the Minister has said. It is fine to talk about all the initiatives taking place in nursing. The Government has been in power for three years yet nurses had to get out on the streets before there was some action. Apparently the non-consultant hospital doctors will have to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister began by saying that we are undertaking a fudge in this House. I rather resent his comment. He went on to say that statutory bodies such as the Medical Council, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal and all the health boards stand alone. That is a true statement. Later he said that he had phoned the health boards and told them to do something about the situation. He said he had <Col N="1217" /> told them to go abroad and look for people to employ. Why does he not tell them to find a way to retain the people we already have? If he did that we would not have to go abroad or look in Germany for people. We should fix things up so that we can retain the people we already have.</P>
    <P>I was rather annoyed that the hierarchical situation within hospitals had to change. The only change that must be made is for the top of the pyramid to expand. This would allow for more consultants and junior hospital doctors or non-consultant doctors would be able to see a career path for themselves. Has the Department of Health and Children looked at the number of consultants taking early retirement? Has it looked at the length of time they will draw their pensions? I regret to tell you that it is not all that long.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn talked about involving GPs more. They are pinned to their collars most of the time. I agree that far too many people go to casualty departments. It is estimated that 80% of people who attend such places would be better off going to their general practitioner. That is not to say that GPs are doing nothing. They are extraordinarily busy and we are losing them through emigration as well.</P>
    <P>My motion only concentrated on the hospital service. We have talked about changing medical staff but what about changing the management staff? The Minister did not mention management staff in his reply.</P>

      <P>We have criticised the various posts down the country where non-EU doctors can go. <Col N="1218" /> The training bodies will not allow them to take up positions in these places because they believe there is not sufficient training available. We will have to fill those posts with Irish and EU graduates because someone must run those hospitals. I do not think the Minister really stated what he was going to do about this. I am still not clear if he has accepted that Ireland will not ask for another derogation on the Working Time Directive. Perhaps he will tell me that we will definitely not seek any more than nine years. This length of time is bad enough and I do not want to see any more slippage in this area.</P>
      <P>The Government has been in existence for three years. What happened to the Tierney report? Why should we start again with the Medical Manpower Forum? The Tierney report looked very good to me. Dr. Tierney was a very nice man and he produced a report. We are continually churning things over.</P>
      <P>Comhairle na n-Ospidéal is not independent. It must report everything to the Department and seek its approval. The Minister's officials will confirm that.</P>
      <P>I know the Medical Council is a stand alone body. The Minister could introduce an interim solution for a few years by extending temporary registration from five to seven years. This would mean that the non-EU doctors we have captured and got here would have to stay on for another few years. Many training courses take six years while temporary registration lasts for five years. This is a bit of an anomaly.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Leonard I could go on all night. Some time Senator Leonard and I will have a night to ourselves in here. Senator Tom Fitzgerald could tell us about his experiences as a patient and Senator Quinn could be present as well.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Tax on Plastic Bags.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must declare that I have a vested interest in this matter, but I welcome the opportunity to bring to public notice the dilemma the country faces as a result of the overuse of plastic bags.</P>
      <P>I accept without qualification that people use too many plastic bags. I was impressed by the aggressive billboard advertisements paid for by IBAL &ndash; Irish Business against Litter &ndash; which use slogans such as &ldquo;Ignore the litter, the Government does&rdquo; in order to embarrass the Government into taking action about the litter problem. In that context, however, I acknowledge that my company is probably one of the largest creators of litter &ndash; particularly that which is caused when plastic bags are thrown away &ndash; and I acknowledge that litter is embarrassing to the nation, its citizens and the Government.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's judgment that there is a need to use an element of compulsion when trying to solve this problem. Unfortunately, it does not appear that we will be able to make progress towards solving it by simply exhorting individuals and retail outlets to use fewer plastic bags. A number of years ago the Minister was given the power to place a tax on the use of plastic bags at the point of sale. By raising this issue I wish to ensure that the practical modalities of putting this proposed tax into action succeed in realising their ultimate objective, namely, a significant reduction in the number of plastic bags people use.</P>
      <P>My concern arises from the fact that there are two possible outcomes &ndash; one of which is desirable, the other is not &ndash; from placing a tax on plastic bags. The desirable outcome will be that the tax will be seen by the public for what it is, namely, a deterrent against the use of plastic bags. Rather than paying the tax people will reduce the number of bags they use, particularly by their use of re-usable alternatives. The success of this endeavour could be judged on the small amount of tax which might be collected and the low number of plastic bags the public might use. That will be the desirable outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undesirable outcome will be that the public will not get the message about the intention behind the proposed tax. Instead, people might <Col N="1219" /><Col N="1220" /> see it as just another obstacle placed in the way of their getting what they want. In such circumstances they will grudgingly pay the tax without understanding what we are attempting to achieve. This outcome will be all the more likely if what I see as the most probable scenario takes place, namely, that consumers will not be charged directly for every bag they use but that retailers will absorb the cost and recoup it by increasing prices.</P>
    <P>Whether customers pay directly or indirectly for plastic bags, they will do so unless they are educated carefully about the reasons for the tax's introduction. They must be informed that the point is not to pay the tax but to avoid it by changing their behaviour. People must be told that this is one tax which the Government does not want them to pay. I do not believe people will get that message if the State merely introduces the proposed tax. Without careful education, it is far more likely that people will simply pay the tax and prices will increase as a result. If people pay the proposed tax, two undesirable things will happen. First, the Government will have failed in its objective to reduce the number of plastic bags in use and, second, we will have caused a further increase in inflation at a time when reducing it has again become a national priority.</P>
    <P>I speak with confidence not only about the need to educate the public but also about the likely success that an education campaign could enjoy. My company, together with Marks and Spencer, mounted a dry run on the issue of reducing the use of plastic bags on Monday last. For one day only we focused on trying to show people the alternatives to throwaway plastic bags and we tried to explain to our customers why we were doing this in the context of the forthcoming tax on plastic bags.</P>
    <P>Rome was not built in a day and I do not claim that we succeeded in educating out customers fully about this issue. However, I spent some time on the shop floor during the past two days to see if our experiment had a lasting impact. I was impressed by the change in a number of people's attitudes. The reports I received from my shop managers convinced me that people are willing to listen if one takes the trouble to explain what is intended.</P>
    <P>An essential element in ensuring the success of the tax on plastic bags will be the need to properly educate the public. If the Department of the Environment and Local Government and retailers devise a campaign to educate people, the measure will have its intended effect. People will change their behaviour and the environment will benefit as a result. However, if the opportunity to prepare the ground through the provision of education is not taken, there is a high risk that the initiative will not work. As a result, people, directly or indirectly, will pay the tax. Their behaviour will not change but the cost of living <Col N="1221" /> will increase significantly to take account of this new tax.</P>
    <P>My purpose in raising this issue is not to obtain a quick answer from the Minister of State. My aim is to provide him with food for thought in the hope that a study of my company's experiment this week will show the sense behind my suggestion. The proposed tax could have the effect of increasing inflation as opposed to reducing the number of plastic bags in use unless we educate the public. If this is done, everybody will win because people, by their refusal to use plastic bags, will not pay the tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn for raising this motion on the Adjournment and for giving me the opportunity to put on record the Government's position on the introduction of a tax on plastic bags.</P>
      <P>The use of plastic shopping bags has increased alarmingly in recent years. It is estimated that in excess of 1.2 billion bags are currently provided free of charge to consumers at retail outlets each year. To place the matter in context, this equates to roughly 325 plastic bags used per head of population per year. In my view, this is wholly excessive.</P>
      <P>As Members are aware, plastic bags are a visible form of nuisance litter in addition to being a persistent pollutant in urban, rural and coastal settings. They undermine the clean, green image which we cherish and on which our tourism industry depends. They impact negatively on ecosystems, habitats and wildlife.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that the Government is finalising proposals to introduce a substantial levy on plastic shopping bags in order to discourage their use and, thereby, their impact on the environment. This initiative should come as no surprise. Both parties in Government clearly signalled their intent to tackle this problem and gave a commitment to levy plastic bags as a means of discouraging their use. With a view to facilitating effective action in this regard, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, appointed consultants in 1998 to identify and assess possible fiscal, regulatory or other measures that might be undertaken. Having examined the various options, the consultants concluded that a levy offers the most appropriate means of minimising consumption of PSBs thereby reducing consequent environmental problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A subsequent public consultation process regarding the findings of the consultancy study indicated strong support from the general public for the introduction of such a levy. Notwithstanding the Government's concern about the environmental impact of plastic bags and its intention to act on the matter, the retail sector in general has <Col N="1222" /> been relatively complacent and inactive and has not made a significant or sustained effort to discourage the use of such bags or to seek more acceptable alternatives.</P>
    <P>In saying this, I must give due credit to Senator Quinn for his efforts over the years. His supermarket chain has consistently been to the forefront in exploring and introducing initiatives to reduce plastic bag use. While he has provided positive leadership to the other major players in the retail sector they, regrettably, have not seen fit to follow suit. While some efforts have been made to encourage the public to reduce the use of plastic shopping bags, these have been infrequent and ineffective. The general practice remains that members of the public are facilitated in their excessive consumption of plastic shopping bags, without any serious regard for the consequences of this approach.</P>
    <P>We have attempted to address the issue by means of public education and awareness and will continue to do so. My Department is currently running a well resourced environmental awareness campaign under the theme &ldquo;The Environment &ndash; It's Easy to Make a Difference&rdquo;. The emphasis of the campaign is on simple steps people can take to help improve the environment. One of the ten central messages of the campaign is &ldquo;Say no to plastic bags&rdquo;, particularly when people are only buying one or two items, and to use reusable bags for supermarket shopping. While it is important that we continue to promote this message, we must also be realistic. Our experience is that, in this area at least, awareness and education are not of themselves making a sufficient impact on consumer habits and further action is warranted.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the proposed levy on plastic shopping bags will have any impact on inflation. Their continued use is a matter of habit and convenience. This demand is not immutable. If, as expected, consumers take appropriate action to avoid the levy by using reusable bags or containers, for example, its economic impact will be minimal. In effect, the exposure of individual consumers to the levy will be self-determined and easily avoidable.</P>
    <P>I would be happy to be associated with an educational initiative from the retail sector with a view to reducing the use of plastic shopping bags but this, in itself, will not suffice. I am convinced that we can no longer rely on a &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; approach to tackle this problem. We are at an advanced stage in the development of specific mechanisms to implement the Government's commitment to tax plastic shopping bags and an announcement will be made shortly in this regard. I look forward to the support of the retail sector for this measure.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his willingness to be associated with an educational <Col N="1223" /> programme. The proposed levy will affect inflation levels unless such a programme is undertaken.</P>
